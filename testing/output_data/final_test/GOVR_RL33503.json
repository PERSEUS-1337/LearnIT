    "content": "As of March 1, 2007, there were around 25,000 U.S. service members in Afghanistan, with the majority from the 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division based in Fort Drum, NY. Additionally, there are U.S. Special Operations Forces conducting missions in the region. The 10th Mountain Division, except for the 3rd Brigade, is being replaced by the 82nd Division from Fort Bragg, NC. The 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division is being extended in Afghanistan for up to 120 days, while the 173rd Airborne Brigade from Vincenza, Italy is being diverted from deployment to Iraq. U.S. Navy and Air Force service members are increasingly involved in ground operations in Afghanistan. The 173rd Airborne Brigade is being redirected from deployment to Iraq to Afghanistan in spring 2007. An additional 3,500-soldier brigade is planned to be sent to Afghanistan for training local forces. NATO leads the International Security and Assistance Force in Afghanistan, with some countries contributing forces. The United States contributes troops to both OEF and ISAF, with 9,600 troops in OEF and 15,800 troops in ISAF. A composite headquarters led by U.S. Army General Dan McNeill commands ISAF and OEF forces until February 2008. Requests for additional troops in Afghanistan have been made by the U.S. government and NATO commanders. Despite requests from the U.S. and NATO for more troops in Afghanistan, many NATO members, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Turkey, have rejected sending additional forces or changing how their forces are used. Poland is expected to send 1,000 troops in early 2007. Some argue that forces with restrictions on offensive operations are not as valuable and place a burden on other actively engaged forces. However, others believe these forces, even with restrictions, help provide necessary security for reconstruction efforts. Opposition is growing in Germany over its increasing military role in Afghanistan. Opposition is growing in Germany over its expanding military role in Afghanistan, heightened by recent incidents. This could make it unlikely for Germany to adopt a more offensive posture as requested by NATO and the U.S. Pressure for a more offensive role could increase opposition and reduce German military participation. Great Britain plans to deploy 1,400 additional soldiers to Helmand province by summer 2007 due to a lack of commitment from other NATO nations. Great Britain will deploy an additional 1,400 soldiers to Helmand province by the summer of 2007, increasing the British troop level in Afghanistan to 7,700. The new battle group will include units from the 1st Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, 1st Battalion, Scots Guards, 5th Regiment, Royal Artillery, and 39th Regiment, Royal Artillery. Norway will send a 150-soldier special forces unit to Kabul, despite a NATO request for them to operate in southern Afghanistan. Additionally, the Czech Republic will increase its military presence to 255 soldiers, deploying a field hospital, military police unit, and chemical defense unit. Latvia will also contribute to the mission. NATO's troop contributions in Afghanistan are increasing, with Latvia and Lithuania deploying additional soldiers. Despite reinforcements from the United States, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Norway, NATO's Supreme Commander believes more combat battalions are needed. A significant battle in January 2007 resulted in the deaths of 150 Taliban insurgents as they crossed the border from Pakistan. NATO, with close cooperation from Pakistani authorities, tracked and ambushed insurgents crossing into Afghanistan from Pakistan. The ambush in the Barmal district of Paktika Province resulted in the destruction of trucks carrying arms and ammunition. Additionally, Operation Achilles was launched in Helmand Province to secure the road leading to the strategically important Kajaki dam. Operation Achilles was launched in Helmand Province to secure the road leading to the strategically important Kajaki dam, which provides electricity to 1.7 million Afghans. NATO and Afghan officials are addressing narcotics trafficking and facing challenges from insurgents preparing for attacks, including suicide attacks. Over 1,000 U.S. soldiers are involved in the operation to bring security to the region and disrupt Taliban preparations for a spring offensive. Some analysts believe the NATO operation in Afghanistan will struggle due to low troop numbers and inability to pursue Taliban into Pakistan. A Marine Special Operations Company was sent home for a controversial incident where civilians were killed in response to an ambush. The U.S. military sent a Marine Special Operations Company home early from Afghanistan due to a controversial incident involving civilian casualties. The incident has sparked an official investigation, raising concerns about the unit's effectiveness in counterinsurgency operations. Pakistan's military operations in the region are also under scrutiny for their role in combating Taliban insurgents. Pakistan's military is actively combating Taliban insurgents and supporting jihadist madrassahs along the Afghan-Pakistan border. They plan to close refugee camps used by insurgents, increase border posts, issue biometric cards for monitoring, and construct a border fence. Pakistan plans to erect fencing, barbed wire, and landmines along the border with Afghanistan to deter illegal border-crossers, insurgents, and drug traffickers. The Afghan government opposes this plan, fearing it will divide Pashtun tribes and bring back memories of past conflicts involving landmines. Insurgent tactics in Afghanistan have evolved, with cross-border attacks increasing significantly since Pakistan signed a pact with tribal groups in 2006. The number of suicide attacks and roadside bombs also saw a sharp rise from 2005 to 2006. In 2006, there were 783 roadside bombs and 4,542 direct attacks by insurgents, compared to 1,677 bombs and 1,558 attacks in 2005. Taliban seized control of two towns due to lack of NATO presence. Musa Qala in Helmand province was taken over on February 1, 2007, and a district in southwestern Afghanistan was seized on February 19, 2007. Insurgent troop strength and potential spring offensive remain uncertain. Reports vary on insurgent troop strength in Helmand province, with some suggesting 8,000 to 9,000 fighters ready for a spring offensive. NATO officials debate the Taliban's capability for a new offensive, with recent cross-border attacks indicating insurgents are still willing and able to confront US and Coalition forces. PRTs are small civil-military teams extending Afghan government authority beyond Kabul, aiding in reconstruction projects. They enable coalition forces to provide security in outlying regions and build relationships with local leaders to reduce insurgent influence. As of February 7, 2007, ISAF had 25 operational PRTs, with 12 being U.S. teams consisting of 50-100 military and civilian personnel. The Afghan National Army (ANA) was established after the defeat of Taliban forces in 2002, with a goal of reaching 70,000 troops. ISAF's mission includes training and supporting the ANA to take over security responsibilities. The ANA's performance varies based on leadership, but recent reports show improvement in proficiency. Recent reports indicate that the Afghan National Army (ANA) is improving its proficiency and may be able to defend Afghanistan without U.S. and NATO support in the future. Some military officials believe the ANA outperforms the Iraqi security forces, with over two dozen ANA battalions capable of operating independently. The ANA's ethnic diversity and training curriculum, including literacy and language training, are credited for its growing effectiveness. The Administration now supports a 50,000 soldier ANA, down from the originally planned 70,000 soldiers. The Pentagon doubts Afghanistan's ability to support a 70,000 soldier force and predicts they won't afford a 50,000 soldier force until 2063. The Afghan government opposes reducing the force to 50,000 soldiers, while the Defense Minister believes 150,000 troops are needed to secure the country. He argues that a 70,000 member ANA, still three years away, would not be able to end Taliban violence or protect against external threats without proper training and equipment. The Afghan National Army lacks essential equipment such as air power, armored vehicles, modern weapons, body armor, and artillery. A retired U.S. Army general suggests a five-year program to equip them with helicopters, transport aircraft, combat vehicles, and modern automatic weapons to enhance their capabilities. The Afghan National Army lacks essential equipment such as air power, armored vehicles, modern weapons, body armor, and artillery. The United States and NATO have provided some equipment to the ANA, including heavy and light weapons, vehicles, helicopters, and ammunition. Opium cultivation in Afghanistan has increased significantly, with expected revenues exceeding $3 billion. Opium cultivation in Afghanistan rose 59% over 2005 levels, with revenues expected to exceed $3 billion. The number of people involved in cultivation increased by almost a third to 2.9 million, approximately 12% of the total population. The U.N. suggests combining counterinsurgency and counternarcotics efforts in Helmand and Kandahar provinces to stop drug funding for terrorists. Some Afghan government officials believe former warlords now in government positions are involved in the drug trade. Major Afghan drug traffickers have established complex protection systems to evade government and law enforcement pressure since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. The Afghan government is resisting U.S. pressure for aerial eradication of opium-producing poppies but has renewed ground-based eradication efforts. NATO's supreme commander has ordered increased assistance to local counternarcotics authorities, emphasizing that NATO is not authorized for certain actions. NATO's supreme commander emphasized that NATO is not authorized to play a direct role in Afghan counternarcotics efforts but can provide intelligence and logistical assistance. Some suggest that more direct NATO involvement could yield better results, but additional troops would be needed. Congress may need to assess the adequacy of U.S. and NATO forces in combating the evolving tactics of the Taliban insurgency. National caveats limiting some NATO nations' military operations may be hindering overall effectiveness. The national caveats placed on NATO forces in Afghanistan may lead to a rift between combat and non-combat forces, potentially exploited by insurgents. Congress should consider NATO's ability to sustain or increase force levels in Afghanistan. NATO's reliance on member countries for forces hinders long-term planning. US and UK had to provide majority of reinforcements due to lack of commitment from other members. Congress may investigate events leading to Marine Special Operations Company expulsion, including reports of reckless firing. The Marine Special Operations Company's expulsion due to reckless firing on a crowded road is seen as unusual for an elite unit. Congress may examine the evolving Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, with insurgent attacks doubling in the past six months, threatening security gains. The evolving Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan has seen insurgent attacks doubling in the past six months, threatening security gains. The insurgency has grown stronger, attacking in larger groups with more sophisticated operations, displaying a tenacity not seen before. Despite Coalition offensive operations, the Taliban insurgency has improved its military effectiveness over the past five years. The Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan has grown stronger over the past five years despite Coalition efforts to destroy it. There are concerns about the U.S. government's commitment to building a sufficient Afghan National Army to confront the insurgency and defend the country's borders. Critics argue that the current proposed army size of 50,000 soldiers may be inadequate and driven by cost-cutting measures. Some suggest that a short-term financial approach could lead to an undermanned Afghan National Army, requiring a long-term commitment of U.S. and foreign troops for security. The Afghan National Army is seen as crucial for national loyalty and stability, given the lack of unifying institutions in Afghanistan. Concerns about the army's poor equipment state prompt calls for improvement plans from Congress and NATO. The United States, NATO, and Coalition countries aim to enhance the equipment posture of the Afghan National Army, which is currently outmatched by Taliban forces. Analysts emphasize the need for proper equipment and support for the ANA to succeed. Congressional scrutiny may focus on U.S. military counternarcotics policy and NATO's limited role in such operations. While direct action like burning poppy fields may be extreme, a more active approach could impact insurgent activities. An interdisciplinary solution is needed to address the illegal opium problem. The illegal opium problem in Afghanistan requires an interdisciplinary approach. NATO and U.S. forces should target drug laboratories, opium stockpiles, and trafficking routes to help Afghan counternarcotics efforts and reduce drug flow to Europe. Critics argue that this could divert resources from stabilizing security and undermine the Afghan government's credibility.
