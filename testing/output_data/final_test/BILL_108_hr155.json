The United States domestic shrimping industry is vital for coastal communities, providing economic benefits and safe domestic food. Many nations have banned shrimp imports due to contamination, but the US has not taken similar action. The domestic shrimping industry in the US is heavily regulated by the Federal Government, leading to a loss of product per trawl and damaging its competitive position. Seven non-NAFTA foreign countries have exploited this reduction in competitiveness by exporting large quantities of shrimp. Foreign countries have gained a competitive advantage by exporting large amounts of shrimp to the US, accounting for a significant portion of shrimp consumption. The US government has provided substantial financial support to these countries, totaling over $16.5 billion. Many of these countries are not market-oriented. The US government's financial support to foreign countries in the shrimping sector indirectly benefits their international competitors, leading to a crisis in the domestic shrimping industry. This has been exacerbated by the high level of shrimp imports, resulting in a price depression. The National Marine Fisheries Service met with House and Senate staff and industry representatives to address the crisis in the domestic shrimping industry. Despite the meeting, no decision has been made to alleviate regulatory burdens on the industry, such as proposed modifications to TEDs that could harm competitiveness. The Secretary of Commerce is prohibited from imposing new regulations on the domestic shrimping industry in the Gulf of Mexico, including changes to turtle excluder device requirements. Additionally, countries exporting excessive amounts of shrimp are banned from receiving OPIC financing and insurance. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation is restricted from providing insurance, guaranty, or financing for projects in countries that exported over 20,000,000 pounds of shrimp to the US in the first 6 months of 2002. This restriction lasts until the country reduces its shrimp exports to less than 3,000,000 pounds per month for 3 consecutive months. Additionally, the US opposes IMF assistance to countries exporting excessive amounts of shrimp in the first 6 months of 2002. The US opposes IMF assistance to countries exporting excessive amounts of shrimp in the first 6 months of 2002. The Secretary of the Treasury directs the US Executive Director at the Fund to oppose providing assistance to foreign countries that exported over 20,000,000 pounds of shrimp to the US in the first 6 months of 2002. If assistance is given, the US will reduce its contributions to the Fund. The United States will reduce its contributions to the Fund based on the amount of assistance provided to foreign countries that exported large amounts of shrimp to the US in 2002. The Secretary will reduce US contributions to the Fund until the total reductions equal the assistance provided to a foreign country. The Secretary must notify Congress of impending reductions within 60 legislative days of assistance being provided. The Treasury will determine and notify Congress of the required reduction in the United States contribution to the Fund. The Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 is amended to ban assistance to countries exporting excessive amounts of shrimp to the United States in the first 6 months of 2002. The Bank cannot support exports to any country that exported over 20,000,000 pounds of shrimp to the US in the first 6 months of 2002 until their exports are reduced to less than 3,000,000 pounds per month for 3 consecutive months."
