The Air Force considers this a top priority and requested $1,558.6 million for the program in the FY2014 budget. The KC-46A acquisition program is closely watched due to its economic impact, military importance, and past challenges in procurement. The Department of Defense awarded Boeing a $35 billion contract to build 179 KC-46A aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, replacing aging KC-135 tankers. The history of previous attempts by DOD to acquire a KC-X program has led to controversy and failures. Congress must decide on approving, rejecting, or modifying the Air Force's FY2014 research and development funding for the KC-46A program, and evaluate the fairness and transparency of the contract process. The Air Force announced candidate bases to host the first tranche of KC-46As in January 2013. The Air Force will establish 10 main operating bases for the 179 KC-46A tankers. Altus and McConnell Air Force Bases are candidates for the training unit and first active-duty led operating base. Other potential bases include Fairchild AFB, Grand Forks AFB, Forbes AGS, Joint-Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Pease AGS, Pittsburgh International Airport AGS, and Rickenbacker AGS. Airport Air Guard Station, Pennsylvania, and Rickenbacker Air Guard Station, Ohio, are potential candidates to be the first Air National Guard-led KC-46A main operating base. Concerns were raised in late 2012 that automatic budget cuts from the Budget Control Act of 2011 could jeopardize the KC-46A development contract with Boeing, potentially leading to contract renegotiation without fixed-price certainty. The sequestration effect on the KC-46A program would have been in addition to the reduction in program funds resulting from the use of a continuing resolution for the FY2013 DOD budget. Congress failed to pass a new budget, leaving the KC-46 program with only $900 million, half of what was planned for the year. The Air Force would not need to modify its fixed-price development contract with Boeing at the reduced funding level. In September 2012, Singapore requested information to evaluate the KC-46A as a replacement for KC-135 tankers. FlightSafety Services won a contract to provide training devices for the KC-46A, beating out Boeing, Lockheed Martin, CAE, and L-3 Link Simulation and Training. The $787 million contract includes options for production, training, operations, and sustainment. Major General Christopher Bogdan was reassigned from the KC-46A program to the F-35 program in July 2012, with Major General John F. Thompson taking over. The Air Force operates the U.S. long-range tanker fleet, consisting mostly of re-engined KC-135R Stratotankers. Aerial refueling capability is crucial for projecting power overseas and maximizing military aircraft effectiveness in theater. The KC-135 fleet entered service in 1956 and the last one was delivered in 1964. The average age of the current fleet is nearly 51 years, with upgrades including new engines. The cost to maintain the aging fleet could reach up to $6 billion per year. The Air Force also operates about 59 KC-10 Extender aerial refueling aircraft. The Air Force's fleet of large tankers includes 59 KC-10 Extender aerial refueling aircraft, with plans to replace the aging KC-135 fleet in three stages. The KC-46A will replace one-third of the KC-135 fleet, with future tankers designated as KC-Ys and KC-Zs. The procurement cost for 179 KC-Xs is estimated at $34 billion. The KC-46 program is using a fixed-price incentive contract to limit taxpayer costs and place cost growth risk on the contractor. The KC-46 program utilizes a fixed-price incentive development contract with a target value of $4.4 billion. If costs fall within the $3.9 billion to $4.9 billion range, the Air Force would pay 60 percent and Boeing 40 percent. The tanker's estimated development costs are currently $900 million higher than the contract award value, with the USAF liable for only $500 million. The contract also allows for varying production rates in years three, four, and five. The USAF has the option to buy between nine and 18 jets in years three, four, and five at good prices. The KC-46 program has a fixed-price incentive development contract with a target value of $4.4 billion. The contract allows for varying production rates, with the first flight of the 767-2C in 2014 and the full-up KC-46 first flight at the end of 2014. The DOD states that a new tanker is necessary due to the aging KC-135 inventory. The Air Force's top acquisition priority is to replace one-third of the aging KC-135 tanker fleet with the KC-46A to ensure crucial air refueling capacity worldwide. $1.6 billion was allocated in FY14 for the manufacture of four developmental aircraft, with plans to have 18 operational aircraft by late FY17. Boeing's initial plan for the KC-46A involves assembly in Everett, WA, and conversion into tankers in Wichita, KS. Until the KC-46A reaches full operational capability, critical modernization of the KC-10 and KC-135 tanker fleets is being resourced. Boeing initially planned to convert KC-46A tankers in Wichita, KS, supporting 50,000 U.S. jobs. However, they decided to close the Wichita facility and complete the tankers in Everett, WA. Major General Christopher Bogdan expressed concerns about the change, emphasizing the need for accountability to ensure no risks arise. The failed attempt to acquire KC-X in 2008 led to a competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS. Boeing protested the award, and the GAO agreed that the competition was flawed. The 2008 KC-X competition was canceled, and control was temporarily taken away from the Air Force. The next attempt at a KC-X acquisition program was deferred to the Obama Administration. Key features of the proposed KC-X competition strategy were outlined in a DOD news briefing in September 2009. The proposed KC-X competition strategy, devised jointly by OSD and the Air Force, will be evaluated on a best-value basis, considering price and non-price factors. The competition will have a sole winner, not split between bidders, and will focus on capabilities, acquisition price, warfighting effectiveness, and efficiency. This competition differs from the 2007-2008 one and is not a re-run. The DOD states that the new KC-X competition will have more precise selection criteria than the 2007-2008 competition. Contracts will be fixed-price type, with different contract types for various phases of the program. Bidders will have 75 days to prepare and submit their bids, with the government evaluating them for about 120 days before awarding a contract. The government will evaluate bids for about 120 days and prepare a contract award over a subsequent period of about 30 days. DOD anticipates awarding the contract in January 2011. The first KC-X is projected to be delivered in 2015, with delivery of all 179 KC-Xs over a period of more than 15 years. Northrop Grumman stated they would decline to bid in the KC-X competition unless the draft RFP was substantially revised. Northrop Grumman, the largest U.S. defense company, will not bid for the $35 billion Air Force refueling tanker program unless changes are made to the draft request for proposals due to financial concerns. The Pentagon has refused to make amendments, leading Northrop to decide not to submit a bid. This decision comes after a competition restart in September against Boeing Co. for the tanker contract. The Pentagon's preference for a smaller tanker than Northrop's planned offering has influenced their decision to withdraw from the bidding process. Northrop Grumman will not bid for the Air Force tanker program due to financial concerns. The Pentagon refused to make changes to the draft request for proposals, leading Northrop to withdraw from the competition. Pentagon spokesman hopes Northrop will return for the final request for proposals. Both competitors have suggested changes to favor their offering, but the Department will not alter warfighter requirements. The final KC-X RFP was issued on February 24, 2010, with little change from the draft requirements. The KC-X aircraft had minimal changes from the draft RFP, with one requirement removed and no new ones added. The Northrop/EADS team withdrew from the competition after evaluating the final RFP. The bid deadline was extended by 60 days, and EADS announced its North American division would compete independently. The proposed defense budget requested funding for KC-46A development. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees recommended funding the Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft program at the requested level. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended funding the Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft program at $1,728.5 million, $87.1 million below the requested level. The budget included $1,815.6 million for the KC-46A development, with excess funding from fiscal year 2011 available for fiscal year 2012 activities. The Department could apply $87.1 million in fiscal year 2012 funds against fiscal year 2013 funding requirements, resulting in a recommended reduction of $87.1 million in the budget request for the KC\u201346A EMD program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding the Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft program at $1,815.6 million, as directed by the explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended funding for the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft program at $1,738.5 million, $77.1 million below the requested level, for \"Air Force identified forward financing.\" The FY2013 appropriations levels were ultimately established by H.R. 933, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, with funding set at $1,738.5 million. The Administration's proposed FY2012 defense budget requested $877.0 million in Air Force research and development funding for the KC-46A acquisition. As passed by the House, H.R. 1540 recommended $849.9 million in funding for the program, including a requirement to report on changes in the acquisition program. The bill included a requirement for an annual Comptroller General report on the KC-46A aircraft acquisition program, detailing its progress in meeting cost, schedule, performance, and risk mitigation goals. The annual Comptroller General report on the KC-46A aircraft acquisition program will assess development, procurement cost, schedule, performance, and risk mitigation goals. It will also evaluate progress in meeting operational capability dates, testing results, deficiency correction plans, procurement plans, production results, acquisition strategy compliance, and risk assessment of schedules and evaluation plans. The Comptroller General will assess the master plan of the KC-46A aircraft acquisition program, including funding, development concurrency, and key documentation. The budget request for the next generation aerial refueling aircraft was reduced by $877.1 million. The committee supports the KC-46A aircraft acquisition program with a budget request of $877.1 million. The competition resulted in significant cost savings and the committee will closely monitor the program to ensure wise investment of taxpayer dollars. The Under Secretary of Defense will conduct quarterly reviews of the program. The committee supports the KC-46A program with a budget of $877.1 million and will monitor it closely. Quarterly reviews will be conducted by the Under Secretary of Defense. Additionally, the committee directs the Comptroller General to conduct annual reviews and requires USD, AT&L to provide quarterly review results to congressional defense committees. Major changes to the program must be reported, including costs. The committee recommends $849.9 million for PE 65221F, a decrease of $27.2 million. The committee recommends $849.9 million for PE 65221F, a decrease of $27.2 million, for the next generation aerial refueling aircraft to align funding with the signed KC-46A contract. This is a reduction from the Administration's request of $877.1 million for the KC-46A development. The Air Force has excess funds for the current KC-46A contract, with $77.0 million available for fiscal year 2012 activities. The budget request for fiscal year 2012 exceeds the required amount by $50.1 million. The committee recommends a reduction of $127.1 million in the budget request for the KC\u201346A EMD program, aligning funding to the signed contract. The conference report included a reduction of $135.0 million for the Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft, with $7.9 million considered excess to requirement. Additionally, there is a House reporting requirement for an annual Comptroller General report on the KC\u201346A aircraft acquisition program. The Comptroller General conducts an annual review of the KC\u201346A aircraft acquisition program, submitting reports to congressional defense committees on engineering, manufacturing, development, and procurement progress. Reports also cover operational testing, performance, and risk mitigation goals. The Comptroller General conducts annual reviews of the KC\u201346A aircraft acquisition program, providing reports to congressional defense committees on various aspects including aircraft performance, procurement plans, production results, acquisition strategy compliance, risk assessment, and additional information. The Comptroller General conducts annual reviews of the KC\u201346A aircraft acquisition program, assessing key documents like the integrated baseline review, initial capabilities document, capabilities development document, and systems requirement document. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding the Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft at $877.1 million, fully supporting the KC\u201346A tanker program. Air Force leadership testified before the Committee about ensuring the new tanker's timely delivery within cost. The Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to report any contract modifications over $5,000,000 to Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $742.1 million for the Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft, supporting the program's modernization efforts. The Air Force conducted an Integrated Baseline Review of the program, resulting in a $135 million reduction in the budget request for fiscal year 2012. The Committee recommended aligning the budget with the new IBR. The FY2012 defense appropriations bill funded the Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft at $877.1 million, with a provision for quarterly reports on the KC-46A program. The House Armed Services Committee recommended approving $863.9 million in research and development funding for the KC-X program in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Bill. An amendment was approved requiring the Defense Department to consider subsidies ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization. The Secretary of Defense was mandated to submit an interim report on the impact of these subsidies on the acquisition of KC-45 aircraft. The Secretary of Defense must submit an interim report on the impact of covered subsidies on the KC-45 Aerial Refueling Aircraft Program within 60 days of the review initiation. The report should detail how the subsidy affects the source selection process and if it gives an unfair advantage to any bidder. The Inslee amendment requires the Defense Department to consider any \"unfair competitive advantage\" in evaluating bids on major weapons systems. It broadens the bill's reporting language to apply to any bidder. The report accompanying S. 3454 makes no change to the Administration's requested funding level for KC-X. The Joint Explanatory Statement on H.R. 6523 does not mention the KC-X program. The Defense Level Playing Field Act (H.R. 6540) is also discussed. In 2011, the Defense Level Playing Field Act (H.R. 6540) was passed by the House of Representatives, requiring the Secretary of Defense to consider any unfair competitive advantage in evaluating bids for the KC-X aerial refueling aircraft program. The Defense Level Playing Field Act (H.R. 6540) required the Secretary of Defense to report on any unfair competitive advantage in bids for the KC-X aerial refueling aircraft program. The Act defined unfair competitive advantage as a situation where the offeror does not fully bear the cost of development, production, or manufacturing for the contract. The Act was not passed by the Senate before the adjournment of the 111th Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $538.9 million for the Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft in the FY2011 Defense Appropriations Bill, a reduction of $325 million from the Administration request. The House did not report a separate defense bill for FY2011. The Administration's proposed FY2010 defense budget requested $439.6 million for new KC-X aerial refueling tankers. The conference report on H.R. 2647 authorizes $439.6 million for Air Force research and development funding for the KC-X program. It includes a pilot program to assess using commercial air refueling tanker aircraft for Air Force operations. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report to the congressional defense committees on the force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. This report includes details on aerial refueling aircraft force structure decisions. Section 1081 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is modified to include a pilot program on commercial air refueling support for the Air Force, with the condition that pursuing such a program must be in the national interest. Section 1082 authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to enter into multiyear contracts for a pilot program on commercial fee-for-service air refueling support for the Air Force, with certain limitations on contract terms. The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized to enter into multiyear contracts for a pilot program on commercial fee-for-service air refueling support for the Air Force, with limitations on contract terms not exceeding 8 years and a maximum contract amount of $999,999,999. Compliance with service contract laws is required, but certain certification requirements to congressional defense committees are waived. The House Armed Services Committee recommends approving $439.6 million for research and development funding for the KC-X program to replace the aging KC-135 aerial refueling tanker fleet. Commercial air operators contracting with the Department of Defense may receive Government-provided insurance if commercial insurance is unavailable on reasonable terms. The House Armed Services Committee recommends funding for the KC-X program to replace the aging KC-135 aerial refueling tanker fleet. The committee urges the Department of Defense to expedite the source selection and award a contract for the KC-X tanker replacement program to meet global mobility requirements. They emphasize the importance of competition throughout the program's lifecycle to deliver the best capability to the warfighter and value to the U.S. Government. The committee recommends utilizing competitive measures from the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 for the KC-X tanker program. They emphasize the need for persistent competition to control costs and improve reliability throughout the program's lifecycle. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review to congressional defense committees. The committee expects detailed analyses on the force structure, specifically regarding aerial refueling aircraft, including factors influencing decisions, force sizing constructs, changes from previous proposals, operational risks, and measures to address them. (Page 388) Section 1044 of H.R. 2647 would repeal Section 1081. Section 1044 of H.R. 2647 aims to repeal a pilot program for utilizing commercial fee-for-service air refueling tanker aircraft for Air Force operations, as the committee deems it costly with little operational benefit. The committee recommends eliminating the $10.0 million funds for a fee-for-service refueling pilot program in the Air Force, as stated in the report on Senate Division D of S. 1390. The report also recommends approving $439.6 million in research and development funding for the KC-X program. The committee supports the KC-X tanker replacement program as a national security priority, emphasizing the need for modernization of the KC-135 fleet. They expect a fair and open competition for replacement tankers to ensure the best capability at the best price. The committee recommends ensuring competition in the acquisition strategy of the KC-X program to improve contractor performance. Section 1058 of S. 1390 proposes amending the FY2008 defense authorization act to assess the feasibility of using commercial air refueling tanker aircraft for Air Force operations. The Air Force is seeking an exemption to the 5-year limitation on multiyear contracts to implement a fee-for-service air refueling support pilot program. This program aims to assess the feasibility of using commercial tanker aircraft for Air Force operations and requires an 8-year contract for adequate competition and cost reduction. The Air Force is requesting authority for an 8-year pilot program to utilize commercial tanker aircraft for operations. This includes the ability to issue requests for proposals and provide insurance coverage similar to the civil reserve air fleet program. The Secretary of the Air Force may enter into multiyear contracts for this purpose starting in fiscal year 2011. The Air Force is seeking approval for an 8-year pilot program to use commercial tanker aircraft for operations. Contracts under this program must comply with specific laws regarding contract terms, cancellation ceilings, and contingent liabilities. The Air Force is seeking approval for an 8-year pilot program to use commercial tanker aircraft for operations. Contracts under this program must comply with specific laws regarding contract terms, cancellation ceilings, and contingent liabilities. The Secretary is exempt from certifying to congressional defense committees on cost-effectiveness and alternatives for urgent operational requirements. The contract amount cannot exceed $999,999,999, and commercial air operators may receive government insurance if commercial insurance is unavailable on reasonable terms. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3326) was passed into law as P.L. 111-118 on December 19, 2009. The bill allocated $15.0 million for Air Force research and development for a next-generation air refueling aircraft. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3326) allocated $15.0 million for Air Force research and development of a next-generation air refueling aircraft. The bill reduced the Administration's request for program management by $30.0 million, with $394.6 million transferred to Title VIII for a Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill allocated funds for Air Force research and development of a next-generation air refueling aircraft. The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized to transfer funds for tanker acquisition program, with notification and reporting requirements to congressional defense committees. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill allocated funds for Air Force research and development of a next-generation air refueling aircraft. The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized to transfer funds for tanker acquisition program, with notification and reporting requirements to congressional defense committees. The explanatory statement includes provisions for the Aerial Refueling Tanker Program, with $15,000,000 allocated for program management and a Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund of $291,715,000. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to submit a report to the congressional defense committees within 10 days of releasing the final request for proposal for an aerial tanker replacement aircraft. The Secretary is encouraged to pursue tanker recapitalization at a rate of 36 aircraft per year. The House Appropriations Committee recommends $439.6 million in research and development funding for the KC-X program to accelerate procurement and retire aging KC-135 aircraft. This funding is transferred to a \"Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund\" established by Section 8112 of the bill. The House Appropriations Committee recommends $439.6 million for the KC-X program to accelerate procurement and retire aging KC-135 aircraft. The funds are appropriated to the Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund for the Air Force to transfer to various purposes related to a tanker acquisition program. The Secretary of the Air Force must notify prior to making transfers using these funds. The Secretary of Defense must notify congressional defense committees before transferring funds for the aerial refueling tanker replacement program. Contracts for the program must be awarded based on best value or lowest cost source selection, with non-development aircraft assembled in the United States. Life-cycle costs over a 40-year period must be evaluated. The evaluation of life-cycle costs for aircraft over a 40-year period must be conducted, including an independent estimate by a research center. Contracts for the tanker replacement program must be awarded to offerors with non-development aircraft assembled in the US. The Secretary of Defense must certify the most cost-effective tanker replacement strategy by October 1, 2009. The committee emphasizes the need to promptly replace the aging Air Force aerial refueling fleet due to numerous setbacks in the current program. The plan is to procure 12-15 aircraft per year to eventually replace the fleet of 513 aircraft, which will take decades to complete. The average age of a KC-135 tanker is almost 50 years old, and the current fleet of Eisenhower-era tankers will be 80 years old by the end of the recapitalization process. The Air Force plans to invest billions in maintaining an aging tanker fleet, with costs expected to rise from $2.1 billion to $3 billion per year by 2040. Depot maintenance costs are projected to increase from $320 million to $1.1 billion in 2040 due to aging aircraft. This unprecedented plan to operate aircraft for 80 years may result in even higher costs than estimated. The Committee recommends replacing the aging tanker fleet with new tankers, which will result in significant cost savings. The lower cost per flying hour of the new tankers will save taxpayers billions of dollars per year. The Committee suggests procuring 36 aircraft per year to expedite the fleet recapitalization and retire the current KC-135 aircraft quickly. This plan will help avoid high sustainment and modernization costs for the legacy fleet. The Committee recommends replacing the aging tanker fleet with new tankers to save costs and expedite fleet recapitalization. This will avoid high sustainment and modernization costs for the legacy KC-135 fleet. Multiple aircraft providers will promote competition, control procurement costs, and facilitate a faster aircraft replacement rate. The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit a report outlining key mission requirements, performance parameters, and selection criteria for the aerial tanker replacement aircraft. The Department of Defense aims to improve communication with potential offerors and address issues raised by the Government Accountability Office. The Committee's funding recommendations focus on enhancing the efficiency of defense resources, stabilizing acquisition programs, and expediting the fielding of new equipment. The Committee emphasizes the importance of timely procurement to avoid costly delays and highlights the significant cost savings of investing in a new fleet of aerial refueling tankers. They recommend focusing on the KC-135 tanker replacement program over the fee-for-service refueling pilot program due to validated requirements. The Committee recommends $439,615,000 for the recapitalization of the aging KC\u2013135 fleet with a competitive procurement of a commercial derivative tanker aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee suggests $409.6 million for research and development funding for the KC-X program, with a $30 million reduction for \"Contract award delay.\" The 2006 RAND Analysis of Alternatives and DSB report assessed the technical condition and potential longevity of the KC-135 fleet. Factors such as airframe service life, corrosion, and maintenance costs could impact the operational life expectancy of the KC-135s. The average KC-135 airframe had flown about 17,000 hours out of an estimated service life of 36,000 hours (KC-135E) or 39,000 hours (KC-135R) by 2004. Both reports concluded that the KC-135 airframes were viable until 2040 at current usage rates. The 2006 RAND AOA and DSB reports assessed the KC-135 fleet's technical condition and longevity. Corrosion was not an imminent threat, but concerns about operating these first-generation turbojet aircraft indefinitely were valid. Maintenance costs had increased but leveled off due to Air Force changes in depot processes. The DSB report forecasted modest growth in maintenance costs for the KC-135 fleet. Some observers express concerns about potential problems with flying older tankers, but the DSB report concluded that grounding is no more likely than with any other aircraft. The 2006 RAND analysis suggested that KC-135s could operate into the 2040s, but expressed doubts about long-term operation due to maintenance cost increases, fleet availability issues, and possible grounding. The analysis recommended a more thorough scientific and technical study of the KC-135 fleet to provide a reliable basis for future assessments of its condition."
