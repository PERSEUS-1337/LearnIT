    "title": "SB 547",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Health and Human Services Agency comprises various departments and offices, including the Department of Aging, Department of Health Care Services, Department of Social Services, and State Council on Developmental Disabilities. California baby boomers are aging rapidly, with over 20 percent of the state's population expected to be 65 or older by 2030. Among this age group, 70 percent will require long-term services and supports. The fastest-growing segment of the population is those 85 and older, who are four times more likely to need LTSS than those aged 65 to 84. The aging population is becoming more diverse as people live longer. The Senate report identified numerous deficiencies in California's aging and long-term care system, including the complexity of navigating 112 programs across 20 agencies, lack of person-centered care, poor transitions between care settings, limited access to services for aging in place, workforce shortages, and cultural competency issues. Division 121 is added to the Health and Safety Code, establishing coordination of state aging and long-term care services. The Secretary of California Health and Human Services will oversee efficient use of state and federal funds. Additionally, a Statewide Aging and Long-Term Care Services Coordinating Council is created, chaired by the Secretary and including heads of relevant departments. The curr_chunk lists various departments and offices in California, including the Department of Consumer Affairs, Department of Food and Agriculture, Department of Human Resources, Department of Insurance, Department of Justice, Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Rehabilitation, Department of Transportation, Department of Veterans Affairs, and others. The State Department of Public Health and the State Department of Social Services are tasked with developing a state aging and long-term care services strategic plan to meet the needs of the aging population in 2020, 2025, and 2030. The plan must include clear benchmarks, timelines, and cost-benefit analysis, consulting with experts in the field. The strategic plan for state aging and long-term care services will involve input from various stakeholders, including consumer advocates, rural and urban communities, and the California Task Force on Family Caregiving. Technical support will be provided by the Office of Health Equity and the California Department of Aging. The strategic plan for state aging and long-term care services includes integration of services, long-term care financing, managed care expansion, end-of-life care planning, elder justice, disease care guidelines, caregiver support, data management, affordable housing, mobility, workforce, alignment with federal programs, and potential integration with disability services. The council will examine model programs in various cities, counties, and states to develop a strategic plan for scaling up best practices in long-term care services delivery. The plan must be submitted to specific legislative committees by July 1, 2018, and the secretary can accept grants to support its development."
