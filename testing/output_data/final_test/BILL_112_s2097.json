    "content": "The \"Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act of 2012\" includes provisions for coverage of cancer care planning services under the Medicare program, grants for health professional education on palliative care and symptom management, and a research program on coordination of care for cancer patients. Congress finds that individuals with cancer lack access to high-quality, coordinated care. The cancer care system does not provide comprehensive treatment plans, symptom management, or follow-up care for late effects. Cancer survivors often suffer from under-diagnosis and under-treatment of symptoms, side effects, and late effects of cancer. Cancer survivors, especially those from minority groups, face obstacles in receiving coordinated cancer care for managing symptoms and side effects. Lack of information about treatment options hinders engagement in comprehensive cancer care that includes symptom management and psychosocial services. Comprehensive cancer care for survivors should include a care summary and follow-up plan after primary treatment. Quality care involves initial treatment recommendations and a communication plan for the course of treatment. The Institute of Medicine recommended providing cancer survivors with a comprehensive care summary and follow-up plan after primary treatment. Medicare beneficiaries, especially the elderly, face challenges in accessing quality cancer care. Shortcomings in cancer care under Medicare include inadequate symptom management, lack of monitoring for late effects, and insufficient research. Changes in Medicare payment, better education on symptom management, and increased research can improve patient decision-making and overall care for individuals with cancer. SEC. 101. COVERAGE OF CANCER CARE PLANNING SERVICES. Amends Section 1861 of the Social Security Act to include comprehensive cancer care planning services. The term 'comprehensive cancer care planning services' refers to developing a detailed plan of care for individuals diagnosed with cancer, including treatment, symptom management, and palliative care, provided in person and in written form soon after diagnosis. The comprehensive cancer care planning services involve developing a detailed plan of care for individuals with cancer, taking into account cultural and linguistic needs, and following appropriate standards set by the Secretary. The plan may need revision due to changes in the individual's condition, disease recurrence, or significant changes in curative or palliative care elements, which must be communicated in written form. The development of a follow-up cancer care plan for individuals who have completed primary cancer treatment includes describing treatment elements, providing recommendations for subsequent care, and furnishing the plan in person or in written form within a specified period. The follow-up cancer care plan for individuals post-primary treatment should be provided promptly, consider cultural and linguistic needs, meet appropriate standards, and be revised as needed for changes in the individual's condition or diagnosis. The Secretary will establish standards for revising follow-up care plans for individuals with a second cancer diagnosis, ensuring prompt delivery and consultation with relevant organizations. The payment for comprehensive cancer care planning services will be based on the national average amount for a new patient office consultation and physician certification for home health services. The amendments made by this section apply to services furnished under a home health plan of care, effective on the first day of the first calendar year after the enactment of this Act. Title II of the Act focuses on provider education for palliative care and symptom management, including grants to improve health professional education. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide grants to eligible entities to enhance training for healthcare providers in developing cancer care plans and communicating them to patients. Eligible entities must demonstrate the ability to train professionals in coordinating cancer care and communicating written plans. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide grants to eligible entities for training healthcare providers in cancer care coordination and communication. Eligible entities include cancer centers, academic health centers, physician practices, schools of nursing, visiting nurse associations, home care agencies, and private nonprofit organizations with health provider training expertise. The evaluation plan for the training programs will be developed and implemented by the Secretary. The term \"NCI-designated cancer center\" refers to a cancer center funded by the National Cancer Institute. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for implementing this section. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2017 for this purpose. SEC. 202. GRANTS TO IMPROVE CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide grants to eligible entities to enhance the quality of continuing professional education for qualified individuals on developing and communicating written cancer care plans. Eligible entities must demonstrate experience in sponsoring education programs, reaching healthcare providers engaged in cancer care, and the ability to create innovative training programs. The Secretary will evaluate the effects of professional education programs funded under this section. Eligible entities include cancer centers, academic health centers, schools of nursing, and professional societies supporting continuing education programs.
