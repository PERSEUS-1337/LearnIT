    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Forced Abortion Condemnation Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. The Congress finds that forced abortion and sterilization in China have been reported for over 15 years, despite the Chinese government denying their involvement in population control policies. The People's Republic of China enforces birth quotas and grants immunity to officials engaging in coercion, leading to instances of forced abortions and sterilizations without punishment. Population control officials monitor women's menstrual cycles and subject unauthorized pregnancies to psychological pressure, economic sanctions, and physical force. Official sanctions for unauthorized births in China include fines much larger than residents' incomes. In Fujian, fines can be twice a family's annual income, leading to confiscation of property for non-payment. Harsh punishments, especially for religious resistance, have been reported, such as Catholic villagers in Hebei Province facing population control measures. Forced abortions and sterilizations in Communist China have been enforced through torture, sexual abuse, and detention of resisters' relatives as hostages. These measures are part of the official eugenic policy known as the \"Natal and Health Care Law\", aiming to regulate the number of children and eliminate those considered defective. The US government prohibits entry of Chinese nationals involved in enforcing forced abortion policies. The Secretary of State and Attorney General are restricted from issuing visas or admitting individuals who have enforced population control policies leading to forced abortions or sterilizations. The President has the authority to waive the entry restriction for Chinese nationals if it is in the national interest of the United States, with written notification to Congress."
