    "content": "Community detection in graphs is crucial for graph mining, machine learning, and network science. Detecting overlapping communities is a challenging task. A probabilistic model based on graph neural network architecture has been proposed for this purpose, outperforming existing approaches in community recovery. This model can also perform out-of-sample community detection for nodes not present during training. Graphs are a natural way to represent complex systems, and community detection methods are essential for understanding their structure and behavior. Community detection methods are crucial for analyzing social networks, detecting fraud, discovering brain functional units, and predicting protein functions. Over the years, research has focused on developing advanced models to capture the complex structure of overlapping communities in real graphs. The emergence of deep learning methods for graph data has led to more accurate and scalable algorithms, showing state-of-the-art results in various graph-related tasks. In this paper, a new deep probabilistic model called Deep Overlapping Community detection (DOC) is proposed for detecting overlapping communities in graphs. The model utilizes a graph neural network to predict community affiliations and achieves state-of-the-art results in community recovery. Additionally, it can perform out-of-sample community detection for unseen nodes. This approach addresses the limitation of existing deep learning methods that focus only on disjoint communities. The main contributions of the Deep Overlapping Community detection (DOC) model include proposing a simple yet effective deep learning model for overlapping community detection in graphs. It can perform community detection both transductively and inductively, introduces 5 new datasets for overlapping community detection, and shows superior performance compared to established methods. The goal is to assign nodes in the graph into communities based on their attributes. Community detection involves assigning nodes in a graph to communities, represented by a non-negative community affiliation matrix. There is no universal definition of a community, but it is generally agreed to be a group of nodes with a higher probability of forming edges with each other. Methods for overlapping community detection include non-negative matrix factorization, probabilistic inference, and heuristics. NMF methods aim to recover the community affiliation matrix by decomposing the adjacency matrix. The problem of community detection can be approached through various methods such as probabilistic inference, heuristic-based approaches, and representation learning. These approaches aim to assign nodes in a graph to communities by optimizing different criteria or embedding nodes into a vector space to preserve the community structure. Recent advancements in deep representation learning for graphs have raised the question of whether these techniques can improve community detection algorithms. While traditional methods focus on disjoint communities, a more preferable approach is an end-to-end deep learning architecture that can detect overlapping communities. This contrasts with methods like DeepWalk and node2vec, where embeddings are learned independently. Recent advancements in deep representation learning for graphs have led to the adoption of defining embeddings as a function of node attributes and solving optimization problems using neural networks. This approach allows for better performance in tasks like link prediction and node classification, incorporating attributes without hand-crafting generative models, and generating embeddings for unseen nodes. The proposed framework for overlapping community detection involves a three-layer graph convolutional neural network. The community detection framework involves applying a ReLU nonlinearity to the output layer to ensure nonnegativity of the community affiliation matrix F. A probabilistic approach is used to define the likelihood p(A|F), assuming edges are conditionally independent given F. An interaction between nodes is transformed into an edge probability using a link function g. Two choices for the link function are considered. The edge probability is determined by a link function, with two choices considered: Bernoulli-Poisson link and sigmoid link. The Bernoulli-Poisson link is a common model for community detection but has an unrealistic assumption that can be adjusted by adding an offset. The sigmoid link is commonly used for binary classification and ensures edge probabilities are above 0.5. Incorporating an offset in the sigmoid model ensures edge probabilities are above 0.5. The offset can be optimized, but setting it to zero still yields good performance in community recovery. Two variants of the model are considered: DOC-BP and DOCSigmoid for Bernoulli-Poisson and sigmoid link functions respectively. Real-world graphs are sparse, leading to an imbalanced binary classification problem. Incorporating an offset in the sigmoid model ensures edge probabilities are above 0.5 for community recovery. The objective function for balancing contributions from both classes in an imbalanced binary classification problem is optimized using stochastic gradient descent on real-world graph datasets. The curr_chunk discusses the collection and preprocessing of 5 real-world datasets for future benchmarks in overlapping community detection in attributed graphs. These datasets include subsets of the Microsoft Academic co-authorship graph and ego-networks from the Facebook graph. The datasets will be made available for download after the blind-reviewing phase. The curr_chunk discusses the model architecture for experiments using a 3-layer GCN with different variants denoted as DOC-BP and DOC-Sigmoid. Results are averaged over 10 random initializations, and more details about the model and training procedure are provided in the appendices. The curr_chunk discusses training procedures for the model on the Facebook-1912 dataset, comparing full-batch training with stochastic training for different batch sizes. The experiment aims to show convergence to the same result using a stochastic approximation that depends on batch size S. Training curves for batch sizes S \u2208 {500, 1000, 2500, 4000, 5000} are compared with full-batch training in FIG0. The experiment compares full-batch training with stochastic training for different batch sizes on the Facebook-1912 dataset. The stochastic training procedure shows stable convergence to the same result as full-batch training for batch sizes S \u2208 {500, 1000, 2500, 4000, 5000}. The performance of overlapping community detection algorithms is evaluated based on their ability to recover ground truth communities in graphs, which are meaningful for the datasets used in the study. In the study, community affiliations are converted into binary assignments based on a threshold value. The performance of overlapping community detection algorithms is evaluated using normalized mutual information. The method is compared against established algorithms like BigCLAM, CESNA, SNMF, CDE, and LDense. The study evaluates overlapping community detection algorithms using normalized mutual information. DOC-BP and DOC-Sigmoid outperform other methods in recovering ground-truth communities. CESNA could not run on the Amazon dataset due to handling continuous attributes. The DOC-BP and DOC-Sigmoid models, based on GCN architecture, show superior performance in community detection by handling any kind of attributes. They converge quickly in most datasets except for Amazon due to a dense attribute matrix. The use of a graph neural network (GNN) allows for incorporating attribute information and producing similar community vectors for adjacent nodes. The baseline models considered for community detection include a fully-connected neural network and treating community affiliations as a free variable in optimization, similar to standard methods like BigCLAM. Additional hyperparameter optimization is performed for the free variable model. The training procedure involves stochastic training with early stopping. The best configuration with the highest average NMI score across datasets is selected. GNN-based models outperform simpler baselines in 16 out of 20 cases, highlighting the importance of incorporating graph structure for better community detection. The DOC model shows high precision in recovering communities. The DOC model demonstrates high precision in recovering communities and can predict communities inductively for nodes not present during training, achieving high accuracy levels comparable to transductive methods. Both DOC-BP and DOC-Sigmoid models show NMI scores of \u2265 40% for inferring communities for unseen nodes. Graph-based neural network architectures, such as GCN-based models, outperform MLP-BP and MLP-Sigmoid models for community detection. Traditional methods like stochastic block models and spectral methods are limited to non-overlapping communities, while overlapping community detection methods are less understood. Methods for OCD can be categorized into nonnegative matrix factorization, probabilistic inference, and heuristics. Factorization-based approaches aim to minimize the Frobenius norm, while most NMF and probabilistic inference models perform a non-linear low rank decomposition of the adjacency matrix. Deep learning for graph data is divided into graph neural networks and node embeddings. Graph neural networks are specialized architectures for graph-structured data, while node embeddings focus on embedding approaches. Deep learning methods for community detection in graphs aim to learn vector representations of nodes for downstream machine learning tasks. While some approaches focus on clustering nodes into communities using k-means, others use deep learning for low-rank decomposition of the modularity matrix to find disjoint communities. Our algorithm differs by capturing overlapping community structures and using a neural network architecture that incorporates graph information. In this work, two deep models, DOC-BP and DOC-Sigmoid, are proposed for overlapping community detection in graphs. These models outperform existing techniques in transductive and inductive community detection tasks, with DOC-BP performing better on average. The models use stochastic training, are highly efficient, and scale well to large graphs. The neural network architecture incorporates graph information, unlike other approaches, and learns to detect communities in an unsupervised manner. The experimental evaluation results show that the DOC-BP model outperforms the DOC-Sigmoid variant in community detection on graphs. A 3-layer graph convolutional neural network with hidden sizes of 64 is used for training, with dropout applied at every layer. The model is trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4 and early stopping strategy.

Training involves a 3-layer graph convolutional neural network with hidden sizes of 64, dropout at every layer, and Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4. The model stops training if there is no improvement in validation loss for 500 iterations or after 5000 epochs. The Amazon data used includes nodes representing products in 14 subcategories of \"Video Games,\" edges connecting products based on \"also bought\" information, and communities labeled by subcategories. Visual features are extracted from the products. The authors extracted visual features from product pictures using a deep CNN for their experiments. They constructed two co-authorship graphs - Coauthor-CS and Coauthor-Physics, where nodes represent researchers and edges connect researchers who have co-authored papers. In Coauthor-CS, venues are used as proxies for fields of study, assigning authors to specific fields based on their publications. In Coauthor-Physics, journals like Physical Review A, B, C, D, E are used as indicators of fields of study. In Coauthor-Physics, authors are assigned to fields of study based on publishing at least 5 papers in specific Physical Review journals. A histogram is constructed for each author based on keywords in their papers. Papers with too many authors were excluded to prevent large fully-connected components in the graph. Reddit is an online platform where users share, rate, and comment on various topics in smaller communities called subreddits. Data from Reddit comments in February 2018 was downloaded for analysis. In February 2018, data from Reddit comments was analyzed by constructing graphs for gaming and technology subreddits. Nodes represent Reddit users, edges connect users who commented on the same posts, and users are assigned to communities based on their comments. User features are represented by histograms of commented subreddits. The study analyzed graphs from Reddit comments for gaming and technology subreddits to identify overlapping community structures. The probability of connection between nodes increased with the number of shared communities. Reference implementations of BigCLAM and CESNA were used with default parameters, while SNMF was implemented in Python with F matrix initialized from a Uniform[0, 1] distribution. CESNA required binarization of attributes for binary handling. The study analyzed graphs from Reddit comments for gaming and technology subreddits to identify overlapping community structures.
