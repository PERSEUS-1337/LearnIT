    "content": "The Unemployment Compensation program provides up to 26 weeks of income support for eligible workers who lose their jobs. Benefits can be extended up to 47 weeks through the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program and up to 13 or 20 weeks through the Extended Benefit program in certain economic situations. Former U.S. military servicemembers may be eligible for benefits through the unemployment compensation for ex-servicemembers program. The Unemployment Compensation program provides income support for eligible workers who lose their jobs, with benefits lasting up to 26 weeks. Federal laws set guidelines for benefit coverage, but each state determines specific details, resulting in 53 different programs. Eligibility is based on earning qualified wages and employment in covered work over a 12-month period. States vary in methods used to determine monetary eligibility, with most replacing half of a claimant's average weekly wage. The program is financed by federal taxes. The Unemployment Compensation program is financed by federal taxes under FUTA and state payroll taxes under SUTA. Employers pay a 0.6% net FUTA tax on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings, funding administrative costs, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, and state employment services. SUTA taxes are limited by federal law to fund regular UC benefits. State tax rates are based on the amount of UC paid to former employees, with a minimum tax on the first $7,000 of earnings and a minimum state tax rate of 5.4%. The state tax rate for Unemployment Compensation (UC) is based on the amount of UC paid to former employees, known as \"experience rating.\" States have flexibility in determining their SUTA structure, with higher UC benefits leading to a higher employer tax rate. Funds from FUTA and SUTA are deposited in the Unemployment Trust Fund. In 2008, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program was created to extend benefits during economic slowdowns, administered by state UC agencies. The EUC08 program, authorized through January 1, 2014, provides benefits equal to weekly UC benefits. Amendments by H.R. 8 and P.L. 112-96 modified the program, including the number of weeks available in each tier based on state unemployment rates. Tier I offers up to 14 weeks of benefits, while Tier II availability varies by state. The EUC08 program provides up to 14 weeks of benefits in Tier I, with Tier II, III, and IV offering additional weeks based on state unemployment rates. All tiers expire on or before January 1, 2014, with no benefits grandfathered after that date. States may reduce UC benefits in response to financial stress. States may have reduced UC benefit durations as a response to financial stress, leading to a decrease in total UC benefit payments. This was done through changes in benefit calculation or maximum benefit amount. The \"non-reduction\" rule from February 2009 to December 2013 prevented most states from reducing UC benefit amounts through calculation changes. As a result, states that reduced regular UC benefit durations also decreased EUC08 and EB benefit durations. Seven states have already decreased their maximum UC benefit durations. Seven states have reduced their maximum UC benefit durations after the non-reduction rule was enacted. For example, Arkansas decreased its state UC maximum duration from 26 weeks to 25 weeks, effective March 30, 2011. Florida now offers a variable maximum duration based on the state unemployment rate, ranging from 12 weeks to 23 weeks. Georgia also reduced its UC maximum duration from 26 weeks to a variable duration between 14 weeks and 20 weeks, depending on the state's unemployment rate. Several states have reduced their maximum UC benefit durations based on the state's unemployment rate. For example, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, and South Carolina decreased their UC maximum durations from 26 weeks to 20 weeks. The maximum UC duration can range from 14 weeks to 20 weeks depending on the state's unemployment rate, with a maximum of 20 weeks if the rate is at least 9%. The EB program was established by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. The EB program, established by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, extends unemployment benefits at the state level based on economic conditions. States may provide up to 13 weeks of EB if certain thresholds for insured unemployment rate (IUR) or total unemployment rate (TUR) are met. Optional thresholds allow for an additional 13 weeks of benefits based on IUR or TUR levels. The EB program provides extended unemployment benefits at the state level based on economic conditions. States can offer up to 13 weeks of benefits, with additional weeks available if specific thresholds for insured unemployment rate (IUR) or total unemployment rate (TUR) are met. When a state triggers \"off\" the program, all benefit payments cease immediately. Optional thresholds allow for extra weeks of benefits based on IUR or TUR levels. The EB program provides extended unemployment benefits at the state level based on economic conditions. States can offer up to 13 weeks of benefits, with additional weeks available if specific thresholds for insured unemployment rate (IUR) or total unemployment rate (TUR) are met. Recently, H.R. 8 extended the authorization for a three-year lookback calculation for EB triggers, allowing states to adjust their unemployment laws accordingly. The EB program provides extended unemployment benefits at the state level based on economic conditions. H.R. 8 extended the authorization for a three-year lookback for EB triggers. The EB benefit amount is equal to the eligible individual's weekly regular UC benefits. FUTA finances half of the EB payments and 100% of EB administrative costs. States fund the other half of EB benefit costs through their SUTA. ARRA temporarily changed the federal-state funding arrangement for the EB program, with FUTA financing 100% of EB benefits through December 31, 2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011, signed by President Obama, established procedures for increasing the debt limit. It allows for increases of $2.1 trillion to $2.4 trillion in three installments. A subsequent act introduced by Representative Camp requires states to charge employers' accounts for unemployment insurance benefits. Title II subsection C of the act mandates states to penalize employers for UC overpayments caused by them, impose a 15% penalty on claimant fraud overpayments, and require employers to report rehired employees. P.L. 112-78 extended UI laws, including the EUC08 program and EB program financing, until March 2012. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended the three-year lookback trigger option for the EB program until February 29, 2012. It made changes to the EUC08 program, reformed the UC program, provided reemployment services for claimants, and expanded other programs. The potential duration of EUC08 benefits was altered under this act. For more details, refer to CRS Report R42444. P.L. 112-96 extended EUC08 benefits through January 2, 2013, eliminating the phase-down of the program. There is no grandfathering of benefits once the program ends. Individuals can be grandfathered into available weeks of a tier at the date of entrance. The act also extended federal financing of EB through December 31, 2012, and allowed states to use three-year lookbacks in their EB triggers until December 31, 2012. P.L. 112-96 extended railroad unemployment benefits through December 31, 2012, financed by funds from the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. It now requires all states to mandate that workers receiving unemployment benefits must be actively seeking work. The U.S. Department of Labor was authorized to allow up to 10 states to conduct projects to improve reemployment of claimants. The U.S. Labor Secretary may waive certain requirements for state demonstration projects, which must operate for at least one year and not increase costs to the state's account in the UTF. These projects can provide subsidies for employer-provided training or direct disbursements to employers hiring individuals receiving UC. No project can last more than three years and all must end by December 31, 2015. No state demonstration project has been approved as of the publication date. P.L. 112-96 requires states to recover overpayments by reducing UC benefits, allows waivers based on equity, authorizes FAC overpayment recovery, designates data elements for SSA information, allows drug testing for UC claimants, and mandates active work search for EUC08 recipients. An active work search for EUC08 claimants includes registering with reemployment services, actively searching for suitable work, maintaining work search records, and providing them to the state when requested. P.L. 112-96 mandates reemployment services for certain EUC08 claimants, with federal funding of $85 per claimant. States must offset any EUC08 benefit overpayment from future unemployment benefits. P.L. 112-96 maintained the \"nonreduction rule\" for regular UC benefit amounts, except for changes made before March 1, 2012. States were required to pay EUC08 benefits before EB benefits, clarifying requirements for short-time compensation programs and providing federal financing for state worksharing programs. The P.L. 112-96 provides temporary federal financing for state worksharing programs, covering 100% of STC benefits for up to three years and six months. States without existing STC programs can receive federal reimbursement for administrative expenses and 50% federal financing of STC payments to individuals for up to two years. Eligible states may receive grants from the Labor Secretary. The Labor Secretary may award grants to eligible states under P.L. 112-96, with one-third for implementation and two-thirds for program promotion/enrollment of employers. The maximum grant amount was $100 million, with an additional $1.5 million for a report on implementation. States could also set up Self-Employment Assistance programs for eligible individuals. SEA benefits are available to EUC08 and EB claimants through entrepreneurial training activities. These benefits are paid in the same amount as UC benefits and participants are exempt from work requirements. P.L. 112-96 provided $35 billion in SEA grant funding for FY2012 and FY2013 to states for program administration and enrollment. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended the EUC08 program until January 1, 2014. The program ended on December 28, 2013, with no grandfathering of benefits. The U.S. DOL was required to establish model language for states participating in SEA programs and provide technical assistance. H.R. 8 extended federal financing of EB and railroad unemployment benefits through December 31, 2013. Senator Reid introduced S. 1549, the American Jobs Act of 2011, containing the President's proposal. $250,000 was appropriated for administrative expenses. The President's American Jobs Act of 2011 proposal, as outlined in S. 1660, includes UI provisions for EUC08 extension and federal financing of EB. It also allows states to use three-year lookbacks for state EB triggers. The proposal does not increase the number of weeks of unemployment benefits available. The President's American Jobs Act of 2011 proposal includes new federal requirements and funding for states to provide reemployment and eligibility assessments to certain EUC08 claimants. States would need to enter agreements with the U.S. DOL and new claimants would have to report to One-Stop Career Centers. The plan allocates $200 per unemployed worker for states to conduct assessments and authorizes states to pay Self-Employment Assistance benefits for up to 26 weeks to eligible individuals. The President's American Jobs Act of 2011 proposal would extend Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) benefits for up to 26 weeks to eligible individuals participating in entrepreneurial training activities. SEA benefits would be paid in the same amount as EUC08 benefits and participants would be exempt from work availability and search requirements. States with agreements to pay SEA benefits could use Reemployment NOW funds for administrative and start-up costs. The President's American Jobs Act of 2011 proposal extends unemployment benefits through June 30, 2012, financed by funds from the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The proposal includes a \"Reemployment NOW\" program with $4 billion in appropriations from the Treasury, distributed to states based on the number of unemployed and long-term unemployed individuals. States must submit to receive funds. The \"Reemployment NOW\" program requires states to submit a plan outlining activities to assist eligible individuals in finding reemployment, performance measures, coordination with federal programs, timelines, quarterly enrollments estimates, assurances of providing services to EUC08 claimants, and reporting to the U.S. DOL. The U.S. DOL will provide guidance and program evaluation for activities funded by Reemployment NOW. Allowable program uses will be monitored for effectiveness. The \"Bridge to Work\" program under Reemployment NOW funds allows individuals to receive EUC08 benefits as wages for short-term work experience placements lasting up to eight weeks. Participants working at least 25 hours per week have suspended work search requirements and their wages do not offset EUC08 benefits. Earnings during program participation are not considered employment taxes but treated as unemployment benefits for tax purposes. Wage insurance would provide income supplements to EUC08 claimants who find reemployment at a lower wage. The benefit level would be determined by states, capped at 50% of the wage difference, with a maximum benefit amount set by the state. Payments would last for up to two years and be limited to individuals over 50 earning less than $50,000 per year from reemployment. The proposal aims to provide enhanced reemployment services for EUC08 claimants and individuals who have exhausted benefits, including one-on-one assessments and counseling. States can use funds for administrative costs related to SEA agreements and innovative programs to facilitate reemployment. The President's American Jobs Act of 2011 would clarify requirements for short-time compensation programs and provide temporary federal financing for state worksharing. The President's proposal aims to federally finance short-time compensation (STC) programs for up to three years in states that meet the new definition, with a transition period for existing programs. States without STC programs can enter into agreements with the U.S. DOL for federal reimbursement of administrative expenses and 50% financing of STC payments to individuals. If a state enacts an STC law after entering an agreement, it can receive 100% federal financing. The President's proposal would provide federal financing for short-time compensation (STC) programs in eligible states, with grants totaling $700 million. The proposal also includes funding for program promotion, implementation, and a report on the program's implementation within four years. Additionally, the proposal adds a targeted group for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for long-term unemployed individuals. The proposal includes federal financing for short-time compensation programs in eligible states, with grants totaling $700 million. It also adds a targeted group for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for long-term unemployed individuals, providing a non-refundable income tax credit for eligible hires. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the authorization of WOTC through December 31, 2011. H.R. 3346 and S. 1804 propose to extend expiring UI provisions and make various changes, including to the financing of UI benefits. H.R. 3346 and S. 1804 propose to extend the EUC08 program, federal financing of the EB program, and state EB triggers through 2012. They also suggest allowing states to suspend EB triggers temporarily and extend railroad unemployment benefits. Additionally, states could temporarily suspend interest accrual on loans from U.S. DOL for FY2012. Employers facing decreased state tax credit on federal unemployment taxes can opt to suspend the reduction for tax year 2012. States with no outstanding unemployment loans would earn additional interest. Various legislative proposals, including H.R. 3638, aim to address UI expirations by extending provisions through 2012. Various legislative proposals, including H.R. 3638 and S. 1885, aim to extend expiring UI provisions through 2012. H.R. 3638 would add 14 weeks to Tier I of the EUC08 program, while S. 1885 would extend EUC08 authorization and federal financing of the EB program. S. 1885 does not include the three-year lookback option for EB triggers and proposes to offset UI extensions with $44 billion in federal funds. H.R. 3743 would have extended EB and EUC08 provisions until March 6, 2012. H.R. 1745, the Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits, and Services Act of 2011, proposes changes to state UC eligibility requirements and federal unemployment benefits funding. It introduces new federal requirements for work availability and search activities, including registering for employment services, posting a resume, and applying for similar jobs with comparable wages. H.R. 1745 proposes new federal educational requirements for UC claimants in state programs and allows states to create demonstration projects to improve reemployment. It also transforms federal unemployment benefits financing into a block grant to states for FY2011 and FY2012. H.R. 1745 would end federal financing of EUC08 and EB benefits, allowing states to use block grant funds for EUC08 benefits. States could terminate the federal-state EUC08 agreement without affecting their block grant share. States would still pay EB benefits if the program is active. Many states owed $40.8 billion to federal accounts within the UTF due to the financial crisis. The ARRA temporarily halted interest charges on loans until December 31, 2010, but charges have resumed. States cannot reduce regular benefits, leading to potential increases in state unemployment taxes. Employers in 21 states may see higher federal unemployment taxes in 2011 due to borrowing from the federal UTF loan account. The President's Budget Proposal for FY2013 aims to address these issues by extending the interest accrual suspension through 2014 and delaying net FUTA tax increases until 2015. U.S. DOL projects states accrued $1.22 billion in interest charges in FY2011 and $1.79 billion in FY2012 without these measures. The President's Budget Proposal for FY2013 aims to address the increase in interest charges on loans by extending the suspension through 2014 and delaying FUTA tax rate increases until 2015. The proposal includes raising the FUTA taxable wage base to $15,000 in 2015 and adjusting the tax rate accordingly. Additionally, the proposal allocates up to $4 billion for reemployment activities. The President's American Jobs Act of 2011 proposal includes S. 386, which extends the suspension of interest accrual on federal loans to states through 2012, temporarily suspends net FUTA tax increases through 2012, increases the FUTA taxable wage base to $15,000 in 2014, and forgives a certain percentage of outstanding federal loans to states based on need. States without federal loans would receive an additional 0.5% in interest on their state UTF account balances. S. 386 extends the suspension of interest accrual on federal loans to states through 2012 and temporarily suspends net FUTA tax increases. Employers in states with sufficient reserves would face a lower FUTA tax rate. H.R. 650 would extend the suspension of interest accrual on federal loans to states through 2012. Congressional hearings have discussed aiding long-term unemployed individuals, with 41% being without a job for over 26 weeks as of July 2012. Long-term unemployed workers, at risk of exhausting benefits, may benefit from additional federal support. H.R. 589 and H.R. 3638 propose adding 14 weeks to EUC08 tier I benefits, extending eligibility to 34 weeks. H.R. 494 suggests creating a Civilian Conservation Corps for job opportunities in public works like forestation and National Park projects. H.R. 3615 would prioritize unemployed Armed Forces veterans and U.S. citizens for job placement in the Corps. It also proposes mandatory drug testing for UC claimants. If an individual tests positive, they must retest negative after 30 days to be eligible for benefits. H.R. 3601 would require individuals to undergo substance testing. H.R. 3601 proposes a federal requirement for substance abuse risk assessment and drug testing for UC eligibility. H.R. 2001 suggests disqualifying individuals with previous employment-related drug offenses. H.R. 3598 defines EBT card fees as administrative expenses under federal law. Several bills have been introduced to restrict or recover unemployment insurance benefits paid to high-income individuals or households. S. 1944 proposes a new income tax on unemployment benefits for taxpayers with AGI of at least $1 million (or $500,000 for individuals). The tax rate would be 55% for tax years 2011 and 2012, and 50% for subsequent years. EBT fees would need to be covered by state funds, not deducted from unemployment payments. S. 1931 proposes a new tax on unemployment benefits for high-income taxpayers with AGI over $1 million ($2 million for joint filers), taxed at an additional 100% rate. Individual filers with AGI of at least $750,000 ($1.5 million for joint filers) would also face this tax, with rates proportional to AGI over these limits and a maximum rate of 100%. Tax receipts would be transferred to the state's account in the federal UTF. H.R. 235 would prohibit federal funds from EUC08 and EB programs to pay for certain expenses. H.R. 235 and S. 310 aim to prohibit individuals with resources of at least $1 million from receiving unemployment benefits from the EUC08 and EB programs, following the resource test for the Medicare Part D drug benefit subsidy. While H.R. 235 would be effective from January 1, 2011, S. 310's provision would take effect upon enactment. H.R. 3427 and S. 1826 propose Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) programs for EUC08 and EB recipients, offering SEA allowances in place of unemployment benefits for up to 26 weeks to eligible individuals participating in entrepreneurial training. SEA participants would be exempt from work requirements and up to 1% of EUC08 and EB claimants in each state could access SEA benefits. H.R. 3427 and S. 1826 propose SEA programs for EUC08 and EB recipients, offering allowances in place of unemployment benefits for up to 26 weeks. States can set up SEA programs for recipients of regular UC benefits, with federal funds provided for program development and promotion. States also have the option to create a \"Learn to Earn\" program under S. 1743, if approved by the U.S. DOL. Total funds allocated for grants to states would be $35 billion for each FY2012 through FY2014. The \"Learn to Earn\" program, if approved by the U.S. DOL, would allow individuals to receive EUC08 benefits as wages for work in a short-term placement of up to 10 weeks. Participants would be compensated at the minimum wage rate, with the option for states to supplement the benefit. Work search requirements would be suspended during participation, and additional wages earned would not reduce EUC08 benefits. The \"Learn to Earn\" program under S. 1743 would provide federal funding for states to establish short-term work placements for individuals receiving EUC08 benefits. Earnings during program participation would not affect EUC08 benefits but would be treated as unemployment benefits for tax purposes. H.R. 2731 would allow states to participate in the program. H.R. 2731 allows states to set up reemployment demonstration projects with the U.S. DOL for up to three years. These projects cannot use funds from the state's account in the federal UTF and would be effective for weeks after September 30, 2011. Additionally, H.R. 2137 authorizes states to establish an Employment Assistance Voucher Program over five years to provide subsidies to employers hiring individuals eligible for state UC benefits. H.R. 2137 and H.R. 2868 propose measures to incentivize employers to hire individuals eligible for state unemployment benefits. H.R. 2806 aims to repeal federal income taxation on unemployment benefits and eliminate penalties for early retirement plan distributions after receiving unemployment benefits. H.R. 2120 proposes expanding the Work Opportunity Tax Credit to include individuals who have exhausted entitlement to EUC08. Employers could claim a 40% income tax credit for the first $10,000 in wages paid during the worker's first year of employment if they remain on the payroll for at least 400 hours. For those employed between 120 to 399 hours, the subsidy rate would be 25%. In the second year, an additional income tax credit of up to 25% could be claimed. H.R. 1663 suggests a temporary tax credit for small businesses hiring eligible, unemployed workers. A temporary tax credit is proposed for small businesses hiring eligible, unemployed workers who have received unemployment benefits for at least four weeks and reside in high unemployment zones. The credit would be available until December 31, 2013. The proposal aims to expand approved training for individuals receiving unemployment compensation to include coursework for a recognized postsecondary credential. This credential can be an industry-recognized certificate, completion of an apprenticeship, or an associate/baccalaureate degree. Additionally, individuals on extended unemployment compensation would need to perform 20 hours of public service and 20 hours of active job searching each week."
