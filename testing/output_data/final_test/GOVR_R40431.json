It allocates about $305 billion for these programs, with increases in funding levels for highway and public transportation programs. For example, in the first year, highway spending increases by $2.1 billion and public transportation spending by $753 million. By FY2020, highway spending is projected to increase by $2.16 billion. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, signed into law in 2015, reauthorizes federal highway and mass transit programs through FY2020. It allocates about $305 billion for these programs, with increases in funding levels for highway and public transportation programs. FAST supersedes the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) and authorizes $105.2 billion for these programs in FY2013 and FY2014. MAP-21 followed multiple short-term reauthorizations of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005. The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015, Part II, known as FAST, emphasizes state decision-making authority in surface transportation policy. It provides states with greater flexibility in using federal highway assistance, consolidates safety grant programs, and aims to reduce project delivery time for construction projects. FAST builds on previous reauthorizations like MAP-21, showing a shift towards increased state control in federalism relationships. The federal government's role in American surface transportation policy has become more influential over time, especially since the Federal-Aid to Highway Act of 1956. State and local government officials have lobbied for increased federal assistance and flexibility in the use of funds through public interest groups. State and local government officials advocate for increased flexibility in federal highway and mass transit programs to better address diverse transportation needs and innovate. They argue that states are more capable of identifying and administering funds with minimal federal oversight, leading to improved transportation policies through experimentation with innovative solutions. The federal government is urged to ensure efficient use of funds for national economic growth and environmental protection in surface transportation policy. Some suggest restructuring federal and state responsibilities in this area. This report offers a historical perspective on federalism issues in transportation policy. The Federal-Highway Act has undergone five multi-year reauthorizations since 1987, including ISTEA, TEA-21, SAFETEA, MAP-21, and FAST, with varying budgets and durations. The FAST Act (P.L. 114-94) was signed by President Obama in 2015, marking a significant evolution in federal involvement in surface transportation policy. The federal government now provides about $51.9 billion annually for highway and mass transit grants, representing one-quarter of total government expenditures on highways and mass transit. The Federal-Aid to Highway Act of 1956 authorized the construction of the interstate highway system, marking a significant evolution in federal involvement in surface transportation policy. This act, along with other key provisions in selected Federal-Aid to Highway Acts, addresses federalism issues in surface transportation policy. The U.S. Constitution's Article 1, Section 8 grants Congress authority to establish post roads, shaping the federal role in transportation projects since the nation's formation in 1789. During the 1800s, there were congressional efforts to provide federal cash assistance for transportation projects to encourage western migration and promote interstate commerce. However, most of these efforts failed due to sectional divisions in Congress, opposition from members prioritizing reducing the national debt, and concerns about violating states' rights. During the 1800s, Congress authorized federal land grants to states for transportation projects instead of cash assistance. States like Ohio received land grants to raise money for improving roads, such as the Maumee Road and Columbus and Sandusky Turnpike. This method of funding was used by nine states and all subsequent newly admitted states. By 1900, over 3.2 million acres of federal land was donated to newly admitted states for transportation projects, including roads, railroads, bridges, canals, and water course improvements. Congress also authorized additional land grants for revenue generation and infrastructure development, providing states with wide latitude in project selection and minimal federal oversight. During the early 1900s, congressional interest in federal cash assistance for surface transportation increased due to the lobbying efforts of the \"Good Roads\" movement. This movement, initially started by bicycle enthusiasts, gained momentum as automobile ownership in the United States rapidly increased. Public demand for improved roads intensified as the number of registered motor vehicles rose from 8,000 in 1900 to over 2 million by 1915. Various organizations, such as the American Automobile Association and the National Grange, advocated for public investment in roads, alongside lobbying efforts directed at state and local government officials. Highway Officials lobbied Congress for federal road assistance, leading to the establishment of the Joint Committee on Federal Aid in the Construction of Post Roads in 1912. The committee's final report in 1914 laid the groundwork for the Federal-Aid Road Act of 1916, considered a significant intergovernmental grant program before the New Deal era. The committee argued that federal aid for post roads was constitutional and aligned with the objectives of the Framers of the Constitution. The Federal-Aid Road Act of 1916 aimed to achieve the objectives set by the Framers of the Constitution, such as establishing post roads, regulating commerce, and promoting the general welfare. It provided $75 million over five years for improving rural post roads, with funding limited to communities under 2,500 people on a cost-sharing basis. This federal assistance was seen as beneficial for the nation's economy, particularly in reducing freight hauling costs. State officials did not oppose this federal involvement in domestic policy at the time. State officials did not object to federal intrusion in domestic policy areas in 1916 as the program was voluntary and directed funds to rural areas. Most state legislative seats were allocated to representatives from rural areas, making it politically difficult for politicians to object to federal subsidies for agriculture. Demand for public investment in roads increased as automobile ownership rose, with motor vehicle registrations reaching 10.4 million in 1921. AAA and AASHO lobbied for expanded federal assistance for road construction, recommending different uses for increased funding. Congress faced the same fundamental question in 1921 as it does today regarding the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 reauthorization. In 1921, Congress debated the federal government's role in surface transportation policy. AAA proposed a federal highway commission for a 50,000-mile highway system, while AASHO argued for state control and expanded grants-in-aid eligibility for primary and secondary roads. AASHO believed state officials were better equipped to make project decisions than federal bureaucrats. In 1921, Congress adopted AASHO's state-centered approach in the Federal Highway Act, giving state officials control over project selection for surface transportation projects. This decision rejected AAA's federal-centered approach and emphasized the use of grants to avoid constitutional objections. Congress increased federal funding to $75 million annually for grants-in-aid eligibility to non-post roads, limited to a Primary System of federal-aid highways not exceeding 7% of all roads in the state. At least three-sevenths of this system had to consist of interstate roads, with up to 60% of funds for interstate routes. The act retained the federal-aid concept to appease advocates of rural roads, ensuring state highway agencies considered local concerns in project decisions. Congress increased federal funding to $75 million annually for grants-in-aid eligibility to non-post roads, limited to a Primary System of federal-aid highways not exceeding 7% of all roads in the state. The program's scope expanded, allowing highways that were interstate in character to be eligible for federal assistance due to their connection to congressional authority to regulate interstate commerce and promote the general welfare. The program's title was changed from the Federal-Aid Road Act to the Federal Highway Act of 1921. During subsequent reauthorizations of the Federal Highway Act, AASHO and the American Municipal Association lobbied Congress to increase federal funding and expand program eligibility to include secondary and urban highways. They argued that all roads were interconnected, forming a single national surface transportation system, and that urban links were becoming bottlenecks in the highway system. Urban links were identified as bottlenecks in the highway system, leading to calls for Congress to include urban road construction in the Federal-Aid program. However, trucking and farm organizations opposed this expansion, fearing potential increases in gasoline taxes and fees, as well as reduced funding for farm-to-market roads. This debate occurred during World War II when traffic congestion was not a top national concern. During World War II, the idea of creating an interstate highway system in the United States was discussed to address traffic congestion in cities. Various organizations supported this initiative, but there was no agreement on how to finance it. Thomas H. MacDonald proposed the construction of interregional highways in 1939. The National Governors Conference opposed using federal gasoline taxes to fund interstate highways due to concerns about sovereign taxing powers. Congress recognized the increasing political relevance of urban areas as demographic shifts led to more people living in cities and suburbs. This transformation from a primarily rural to an urban nation led both major political parties to seek political advantage. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944 expanded federal funding for urban highways, adding new programs for secondary routes, urban extensions, and an interstate highway network. This was a response to the increasing political relevance of urban areas as demographic shifts led to more people living in cities and suburbs. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944 authorized funding for the National System of Interstate Highways, with different annual budgets for the Primary, Secondary, and urban extension programs. Budget constraints during World War II limited construction progress. The Act also marked a shift in federalism relationships by removing constitutional constraints on program eligibility, allowing for more flexibility in funding decisions. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 expanded program eligibility for interstate commerce, with states lobbying for increased federal assistance. Different programs like the Primary System, Secondary System, urban highway extension program, and the Interstate Highway System addressed specific transportation needs across the nation, totaling $25 billion over 13 years. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 authorized the construction of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, totaling $25 billion over 13 years. Financing the interstate system was a key issue, with debates over tolls and fuel taxes. Senator Harry Byrd played a significant role in the failure of a proposal to use 30-year bonds financed by federal fuel taxes. The Highway Revenue Act of 1956 created the Highway Trust Fund to finance the interstate system with a small increase in the federal gasoline tax. Governors reluctantly supported the tax as the only viable option, with all revenue dedicated to highways and a 90% reimbursement for expenses. Tolling on interstate highways was prohibited. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 solidified the federal government's role in shaping the nation's transportation system by expanding the highway system and giving federal and state officials more control. Local government officials still had a role, but decisions on the design and location of highways were primarily made by federal and state officials. Local government officials were interested in clearing slums, promoting local economic development, and resented uniform road construction standards imposed by federal and state highway engineers. From 1956 to 1991, state and local government officials focused on maximizing federal assistance in surface transportation policy and opposed increasing federal fuel taxes to complete the interstate highway system. They believed such increases infringed on their authority to tax fuel and raise state fuel taxes. States opposed efforts to divert federal Highway Trust Fund revenue to other uses and supported increasing federal surface transportation funding levels. They also favored a 50-50 cost sharing arrangement for federal reimbursement expenses under the Federal-Aid Road Act of 1916. The federal intergovernmental grants-in-aid system evolved with varying cost sharing requirements, sparking interest in how these requirements influenced state and local government budget decisions. Critics argue that high cost sharing distorts budgetary behavior towards federally funded activities. Critics argue that high cost sharing requirements distort state and local government budget decisions towards federally funded activities, leading to non-optimal use of public funds. Lowering or eliminating state cost matching requirements could reduce this distortion and maximize the public interest, although some argue that it may lead to overspending on projects that are not financially sustainable without federal assistance. In 1970, organizations advocated for an increase in federal share of expenses for non-interstate highways to align with national interest. Highway maintenance costs and increasing requirements for non-Federally aided state highway improvements were straining states' ability to meet the federal government's 50% matching requirement for non-interstate highways. Various organizations argued for an increase in the reimbursement rate for non-interstate highways, with suggestions ranging from 70% for all federally aided highways to focusing additional resources on non-interstate highways as the interstate system nears completion. In response to states' struggles to meet the 50% matching requirement for non-interstate highways, Congress increased the federal share to 70% in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. States advocated for another increase in 1978 due to falling fuel tax revenue and difficulty in finding state funds. The National Association of Counties and the Carter Administration supported the increase in the federal share to alleviate financial burdens on states and local governments. Adams and the Carter Administration supported increasing the federal share of expenses for non-interstate highways to alleviate financial burdens on states. Congress raised the federal share from 70% to 75% in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978. Efforts were made to devolve federal surface transportation programs to state and local governments during this time period. The number of federal grants to state and local governments, including surface transportation, increased significantly from 1960 to 1981. The Federal-Aid to Highway Act also saw an increase in the number of surface transportation grant programs, from nine in 1960 to 37 in 1975. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of the 1970s and 1980s included various grant programs for highway development, urban transportation, safety, and infrastructure projects. These programs aimed to improve road systems, bridges, traffic operations, and public transportation in both rural and urban areas. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were attempts to change federal, state, and local government roles in surface transportation policy. Presidents Nixon and Reagan aimed to consolidate federal grant programs into special revenue sharing programs to focus resources on areas of national interest. President Nixon's proposal to consolidate federal surface transportation programs into a special revenue sharing program faced opposition from interest groups and state highway officials concerned about funding and programmatic influence. Despite this, Nixon and his successor, President Ford, opposed further expansion of federal transportation programs, maintaining stable numbers throughout the decade. When President Reagan took office in 1981, the focus on consolidating programs continued. President Reagan aimed to change federal and state roles in transportation policy by proposing a $20 billion \"swap\" to shift funding responsibilities. He also suggested a temporary $28 billion trust fund to replace multiple grant programs, phasing out federal taxes after four years. President Reagan proposed phasing out federal tax support for programs after four years, giving states the option to use their own funds to continue or let the programs expire. However, both the swap proposal and devolution of federal programs faced opposition from organizations concerned about reduced funding. The National Governors Association supported federal takeover of Medicaid but objected to assuming costs for AFDC and food stamps due to economic concerns. In 1983, President Reagan proposed the Federalism Block Grant Highway Act of 1983, offering states the choice to receive funds for highway programs focused on local and state needs. President Reagan proposed the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act of 1986 to streamline highway programs, combining various programs into a single one and creating a block grant for remaining programs. However, Congress did not approve this proposal. In 1987, President Reagan vetoed the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, the last surface transportation authorization bill. In 1987, President Reagan vetoed the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act (STURAA) due to objections, including the bill's 121 \"demonstration projects\" which he deemed wasteful. Congress overrode the veto after initially sustaining it by a single vote in the Senate. The inclusion of demonstration projects in STURAA led to President Reagan's veto being overridden. Congressional earmarks in subsequent reauthorizations impact federalism relationships in surface transportation policy by reducing state and local government flexibility. Earmarks are discussed with officials but still limit flexibility, depending on how they are distributed. Earmarks in SAFETEA programs and discretionary programs affect the distribution of funds. The Equity Bonus (EB) program under SAFETEA guarantees states a 92% return on payments to the Highway Trust Fund. Earmarks outside the EB program do not impact fund distribution, considered additional funding \"above the line.\" High Priority Project (HPP) earmarks, included in the EB program, are referred to as \"below the line.\" The issue at hand is whether congressional earmarks included in the EB program should be inside or outside the program. Keeping earmarks outside the program would give states more flexibility in using funds for core formula programs. President Reagan's New Federalism and block grant proposals aimed to reduce the number of federal surface transportation programs. By the end of his second term, there were 27 programs compared to 34 at the start of his presidency. Changes included a shift towards capital expenditures and a decrease in mass transit operating assistance. The U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations recommended repealing highway and bridge programs funded by the federal Highway Trust Fund. The U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations recommended devolving programs financed from the federal Highway Trust Fund, excluding certain exceptions. They also suggested that Congress relinquish a portion of the federal excise tax on gasoline to allow states to fund these programs. ACIR provided criteria for defining national interest areas and determining roles for federal, state, and local officials in surface transportation policy. They emphasized that while all roads are interconnected, they vary in trip lengths. The U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations recommended devolving programs financed from the federal Highway Trust Fund, excluding certain exceptions. They emphasized that while all roads are interconnected, they differ systematically in trip lengths and travel purposes. ACIR argued that the Interstate highway network provides transportation benefits over a wider geographic range than Secondary and Urban systems, which impacts highway finance responsibility. They highlighted the competition between roads serving local purposes and those providing national benefits, recommending a focus on the geographical range of benefits associated with each type of road. The U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations recommended incremental devolution of surface transportation programs based on the geographical range of benefits. They introduced the concept of interstate spillovers to illustrate market imperfections in economic activities like wastewater and air pollution treatment. The U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations recommended devolution of surface transportation programs based on geographical benefits. They highlighted interstate spillovers in economic activities like pollution treatment, emphasizing the need for government intervention to address spillover effects. Interstate spillover occurs when road benefits are not fully captured in-state, leading to underfinancing of roads with large out-of-state benefits. Charging tolls on Interstate 80 could help internalize these benefits, but setting tolls too high could deter use. The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) argued that tolls on Interstate 80 should not be set too high to avoid overcharging motorists, who would be paying twice through tolls and taxes. ACIR advocated for fiscal equivalence in surface transportation financing, stating that those who benefit from government functions should pay for them to avoid exploitation and incentivize judicious fiscal choices. Highway beneficiaries not paying their fair share could lead to exaggerated demands at the expense of others. ACIR argued for national standardization in the highway transportation system, emphasizing the benefits for safety requirements. They suggested continued federal support for the Interstate System but stated that the Primary system's national role has diminished. ACIR also recommended state-local financing and control for Secondary highways. ACIR argued that state-local financing and control are more suitable for Secondary highways due to light traffic and alternative routes. They questioned the fiscal federalism principle governing funds allocation for highway demonstration projects, noting their limited national benefits. Certain bridge safety programs were deemed unsuitable for devolution, while widening bridges to alleviate traffic congestion may be appropriate for local traffic. Five multi-year reauthorizations of the Federal-Aid Highway Act have occurred since 1987, including the $151 billion Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Five multi-year reauthorizations of the Federal-Aid Highway Act have occurred since 1987, including ISTEA in 1991, TEA-21 in 1998, SAFETEA in 2005, MAP-21 in 2012, and FAST in 2015. The major federalism issues involved in each of these reauthorizations are examined. The major federalism issues in the reauthorizations of the Federal-Aid Highway Act since 1987 are examined, focusing on roles for federal, state, and local governments in surface transportation policy. Lobbying organizations maintained their positions, but with changing circumstances post-1991, consensus on the Interstate System's primary goal shifted. President George H. W. Bush and Congress had differing approaches to federalism relationships in surface transportation policy during the 1991 reauthorization. President George H. W. Bush proposed a $105 billion reauthorization for surface transportation policy, focusing on a 40% increase in highway funding and a slight increase for mass transit. His plan aimed to give more decision-making power to state and local officials and distribute federal funds based on the program's benefits across different regions. President George H. W. Bush proposed a reauthorization for surface transportation policy, emphasizing increased highway funding and decision-making power for state and local officials. He recommended replacing existing highway programs with a National Highway System and a highway block grant, with different funding levels and reimbursement rates based on national significance. President George H. W. Bush proposed lowering the reimbursement rate for highways from 75% to 60%, while maintaining rates at 90% for interstate highways and 75% for primary highways. He suggested allowing states to reallocate funds between urban and rural highways, mass transit, and new mass transit starts. Additionally, he recommended a marginal increase in mass transit funding to $16.5 billion over five years, with reduced reimbursement rates for mass transit capital expenses and new starts. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan supported these changes. Senator Moynihan led the Senate's reauthorization effort for surface transportation policy, proposing a bill that shifted focus from highway construction to maintenance, emphasized mass transit and intermodal solutions, decentralized authority to states and metropolitan planning organizations, increased public participation, and strengthened federalism relationships. The Senate bill authorized $123 billion in funding for surface transportation projects, with a focus on highways, bridges, mass transit, and research programs. It rejected the idea of lowering cost matching rates based on geographic benefits. The Senate bill proposed reimbursement rates of 80% for maintaining transportation facilities and 75% for new construction to prioritize maintenance over new projects. The Bush Administration opposed the bill for not including the National Highway System and focusing on highways of national interest. Dr. Thomas Larson emphasized the importance of a strong national transportation program over individual state programs. The House bill (H.R. 2950) authorized $151 billion for a program including funding for a National Highway System and mass transit. It incorporated elements from the Administration's proposal and the Senate bill to address federalism relationships in surface transportation policy. The $151 billion, six-year Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA, P.L. 102-240) provided states with added flexibility to shift funds among existing highway programs, including for mass transit purposes. It set federal reimbursement rates at 80% for most programs and 90% to 95% for interstate highways, with the higher rate for states with large amounts of federal land. ISTEA represented a compromise between House and Senate approaches to federalism relationships in surface transportation policy. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) provided $46 billion more than the President's request, allocating $119 billion for highways and $32 billion for mass transit. It replaced various highway programs with a National Highway System and Surface Transportation Program, while also creating new programs like the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. ISTEA had a significant impact on federalism relationships in surface transportation. ISTEA's impact on federalism relationships in surface transportation policy was significant. It increased state authority to shift funds among programs, enhanced the role of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and mandated performance planning for various transportation aspects. ISTEA increased state authority in transportation funding, mandated performance planning, and changed reimbursement rates to promote equity between interstate and non-interstate projects. President Bill Clinton's Administration advocated for intergovernmental responsibilities sorting to reduce expenses and improve government performance. Clinton proposed modest intergovernmental reforms, including the six-year, $174.5 billion NEXTEA reauthorization proposal retaining and increasing funding for transportation programs. Congress addressed efforts to devolve responsibilities during ISTEA's reauthorization. During ISTEA's reauthorization, Congress focused on devolving programmatic authority to states and resolving allocation differences. The STEP 21 Coalition advocated for a minimum 95 cents return per dollar contributed by highway users to the Highway Trust Fund. They proposed merging programs into the national highway system and creating a Streamlined Surface Transportation Block Grant program receiving 60% of highway funding. The Alliance for ISTEA Renewal wanted to prevent the redirection of federal fuel tax revenue from the Highway Trust Fund. California, Ohio, South Carolina, and Michigan endorsed efforts to devolve non-interstate highway and mass transit programs to states through the Surface Transportation and Transit Empowerment Act. The proposed Surface Transportation and Transit Empowerment Act did not receive much congressional attention compared to the state donor-donee debate. Arguments for and against its adoption are relevant today, considering the potential devolution issue during SAFETEA's reauthorization. However, current fiscal conditions differ from 1997 and 1998, with the economic crisis potentially limiting states' ability to take on federal transportation projects. Senator Mack defended his devolution proposal at a House subcommittee hearing on ISTEA's reauthorization in 1997. Senator Mack defended his devolution proposal during a House subcommittee hearing on ISTEA's reauthorization in 1997, emphasizing that states are better equipped to address their transportation needs than the federal government. He highlighted the inefficiency of current transportation spending and suggested that eliminating federal mandates could increase states' purchasing power for projects by 20 percent. Representative Kasich also supported devolution, citing Ohio's stance among 32 states on the issue. Representative Kasich endorsed a bill to allow states to keep their highway funds and bypass federal bureaucracy. He proposed this as an amendment to the House ISTEA reauthorization bill in 1998, but faced opposition from Representative Shuster. Representative Kasich proposed an amendment to the House ISTEA reauthorization bill in 1998, allowing states to keep highway funds and bypass federal bureaucracy. Representative Shuster, from the Transportation and Infrastructure committee, opposed the amendment, emphasizing the importance of a coordinated national transportation system due to increased interstate movement of people and goods. He highlighted the bill's flexibility for states and cities in funding allocation, with only 1% of funds staying in Washington for administrative purposes. Representative Kasich proposed an amendment to the House ISTEA reauthorization bill in 1998, allowing states to keep highway funds and bypass federal bureaucracy. Representative Shuster opposed the amendment, emphasizing the importance of a coordinated national transportation system. He highlighted the bill's flexibility for states and cities in funding allocation, with only 1% of funds staying in Washington for administrative purposes. Representative Oberstar also opposed the amendment, expressing concerns about the potential negative impact on national transportation programs. The amendment proposed in 1998 aimed to allow states to retain highway funds and bypass federal oversight. Opponents argued that this would lead to chaos, with incomplete infrastructure projects due to lack of coordination between states. They emphasized the importance of a unified national transportation system for the future. The 1998 amendment aimed to promote interstate and foreign commerce through transportation but was defeated. The focus then shifted to the state return-on-investment issue and ending the diversion of gasoline tax revenue for deficit reduction. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) signed in 1998 authorized funds for highways and mass transit, effectively ending the diversion of highway trust fund revenue for deficit reduction. TEA-21 created a state minimum guarantee program ensuring each state a percentage share for various highway programs, at least 90.5% of highway user payments, and a minimum of $1 million in funds. TEA-21 retained ISTEA's programmatic flexibilities, reduced planning factors from 16 to 7, and increased the role of local elected officials in project selection. President Bush proposed SAFETEA, a $247 billion transportation act aiming to change federalism relationships in surface transportation policy. Amtrak became eligible for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement funding. The proposed bill aimed to change federalism relationships in surface transportation policy by consolidating grant programs, creating new safety and performance grants, and merging mass transit grants into three main programs. During TEA-21's reauthorization, Congress focused on resolving disagreements over funding levels and distribution among states. Donor states in the South and Southwest wanted the state minimum guarantee increased to 95% of highway user contributions, with an expanded scope of programs included in the calculation. Donee states did not object to these proposals. During TEA-21's reauthorization, Congress faced challenges in increasing the state minimum funding guarantee without reducing funding for some states. Despite donor states wanting a higher minimum guarantee, Congress extended TEA-21 multiple times before passing SAFETEA in 2005, signed by President Bush on August 10. The veto threat was removed after a change in ethanol fuel tax treatment, generating additional revenue for the Highway. SAFETEA increased overall funding to $286 billion and resolved the impasse over the minimum guarantee. It created an Equity Bonus program to ensure states receive a percentage of highway revenue. The guaranteed rate was set at 91.5% for FY2007 and 92% for FY2008 and FY2009, with provisions to mitigate funding shifts between states. The Equity Bonus program in SAFETEA provides spending increases to all states, with larger increases to donor states. Congress added three new formula programs, including the Highway Safety Improvement Program, Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program, and Safe Routes to School Program. Additionally, a new discretionary transportation improvement program was introduced. SAFETEA introduced new programs like the Safe Routes to School Program and discretionary transportation improvement program. It also allowed states to transfer funds between highway and mass transit projects, enhanced environmental regulations, and increased funding for transit new starts and innovative financing. The National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission recommended increasing federal gasoline and diesel taxes by 10 and 15 cents per gallon respectively, along with other fuel taxes, to address the Highway Trust Fund's revenue shortfalls. It also suggested shifting from federal fuel taxes to a new funding system for surface transportation programs in the long term. The National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission recommended increasing federal gasoline and diesel taxes to address the Highway Trust Fund's revenue shortfalls and shifting to a new funding system based on user pay charges like a vehicle miles traveled fee system. The Obama Administration considered alternative means to sustain the Highway Trust Fund but opted for a $20 billion cash infusion instead of a comprehensive reauthorization of SAFETEA. The Obama Administration opted for an 18-month extension of SAFETEA to address the Highway Trust Fund revenue shortfall, providing funding certainty for state and local transportation officials. Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative James Oberstar supported the extension, with discussions ongoing for a long-term, comprehensive reauthorization. On June 18, 2009, Representative Oberstar and others released a draft of a six-year, $450 billion SAFETEA reauthorization bill, including $50 billion for high-speed rail corridors. The proposal allocated funds for highway construction, mass transit, and safety measures, focusing on core formula categories. The SAFETEA reauthorization bill focused on highway safety, improved capacity, and reducing congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. It allocated funding for repair, restoration, mobility, access, and planning, required specific performance standards for transportation plans, created a national infrastructure bank, and consolidated over 75 transportation programs. Congress transferred $21.7 billion to the Highway Trust Fund and passed six short-term reauthorizations. President Obama proposed a six-year reauthorization with $50 billion for surface transportation programs. Obama proposed a six-year reauthorization of surface transportation programs with an upfront investment of $50 billion in infrastructure to create more jobs. The proposal includes establishing an infrastructure bank to leverage federal funding, integrating high-speed rail into the transportation program, and consolidating over 100 programs to focus on performance measurement and competitive pressures. The proposal focused on using performance measurement and competitive pressures to drive investment towards better policy outcomes, including funding for safety, environmental sustainability, economic competitiveness, and livability projects. Congress did not act on the proposal, and in July 2011, separate SAFETEA reauthorization proposals were announced by Chairman John Mica and Chairman Barbara Boxer with Minority Ranking Member James Inhofe. The proposals differed in scope and policy direction. Both proposals addressed funding levels, program consolidation, efficiency, and project delivery speed. Congress passed multiple short-term extensions of highway and mass transit program authorization while considering these proposals. The House T&I majority's draft proposal, known as H.R. 7, aimed to fund federal highway and mass transit programs at $260 billion over five years. This bill included changes that would have provided states with greater flexibility in surface transportation policy. H.R. 7 aimed to provide states with greater flexibility in surface transportation policy by consolidating or eliminating federal highway programs and reorganizing the remaining programs. It would have reduced the number of \"core\" programs from seven to three, merging some programs and retaining others with modifications. The bill aimed to consolidate 70 federal highway and mass transit programs deemed duplicative or not serving a federal purpose. States would have the flexibility to spend their funds on similar purposes without mandated set-asides for specific projects like the National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Program. Highway funding would no longer be required for non-highway activities, giving states the option to fund such projects if they choose. The bill reduced the number of transportation enhancement activities eligible for federal funding to 7 from 12, providing states greater flexibility to toll highways and allowing tolls on new lanes of the Interstate Highway System. It also increased funding for the TIFIA loan program to $1 billion annually from $122 million. The bill aims to provide financial support for surface transportation projects by offering loans, guarantees, and credit lines. It includes changes to streamline project approval processes and increase TIFIA's maximum support to 49% from 33% of eligible project costs. It also allows federal agencies to review projects concurrently, delegate approval authority to states, set deadlines for decisions on permits, and expand activities qualifying for faster environmental review. The Senate proposal, known as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) bill, aimed to expedite the approval process for transportation projects by exempting certain projects from National Environmental Policy Act requirements. The bill remained on the Senate floor for over a month as leaders negotiated offsets to pay for it and secure enough votes for adoption. The Senate adopted S. 1813 on March 14, 2012, with a vote of 74-22. The bill aimed to increase state flexibility in using federal highway assistance by reducing the number of federal highway programs from about 90 to 30. This included consolidating existing programs and creating new ones like the National Highway Performance Program and National Freight Network Program. The Senate adopted S. 1813 on March 14, 2012, with a vote of 74-22, aiming to increase state flexibility in using federal highway assistance by reducing the total number of federal highway programs from about 90 to 30. This would be achieved by shifting program eligibility to core programs and eliminating many discretionary grant programs under the Federal Highway Administration's control. States would be authorized to spend federal highway funds for similar purposes, with a 10% set-aside for transportation enhancement projects. Eligible activities would be expanded to include various transportation projects. The bill aims to increase state flexibility in using federal highway assistance by reducing the number of federal highway programs. It includes set-asides for transportation enhancement projects and requires 50% of funds to be allocated to local governments and other entities based on population share. Changes to project delivery approval process are also proposed to expedite construction projects. The bill, S. 1813, aimed to increase state flexibility in using federal highway assistance by reducing the number of federal highway programs. It included increased funding for the TIFIA loan program and the use of national performance measures. However, it did not include a provision to expand state authority to use tolling for revenue generation. Numerous amendments were offered during Senate consideration, including S.Amdt. 1756, which proposed devolving most federal highway programs and taxes to states. Senator Jim DeMint proposed S.Amdt. 1756 to devolve federal highway programs and taxes to states, phasing out federal fuel and excise taxes supporting the Highway Trust Fund over five years. DeMint emphasized empowering states to make decisions on their own infrastructure. Senator Jim DeMint proposed S.Amdt. 1756 to devolve federal highway programs and taxes to states, phasing out federal fuel and excise taxes supporting the Highway Trust Fund over five years. DeMint emphasized empowering states to make decisions on their own infrastructure. Senator Barbara Boxer opposed the amendment, warning that it could jeopardize the federal highway and transportation system. The amendment was ultimately defeated on March 13, 2012, by a vote of 30-67. House Speaker John Boehner sought support for H.R. 7 and H.R. 3864, which aimed to provide $260 billion over five years for highway and mass transit programs. The proposed legislation aimed to make changes to existing transportation programs, including consolidating or eliminating duplicative programs, streamlining project review processes, increasing funding for the TIFIA loan program, eliminating mandatory set-asides for transportation enhancements, and giving states authority to toll new capacity on the Interstate. H.R. 3864 aimed to supplement Highway Trust Fund revenue with royalties from domestic energy production. Speaker Boehner supported a short-term extension of SAFETEA authority and included provisions for the Keystone XL pipeline, limiting EPA's regulation of coal ash, Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund guarantee, and environmental streamlining provisions. The House adopted the bill (H.R. 4348). The House adopted H.R. 4348, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, on April 18, 2012. The Senate later replaced the House-passed language with MAP-21, leading to a conference agreement approved by both chambers and signed into law as P.L. 112-141 by President Obama on July 6, 2012. MAP-21 reauthorized federal highway and mass transportation programs. MAP-21, signed into law as P.L. 112-141 by President Obama on July 6, 2012, reauthorized federal highway and mass transit programs through FY2014 with $105.2 billion in funding for FY2013 and FY2014. It increases state flexibility by consolidating federal highway programs and requiring states to develop asset management plans. The management plan aims to improve the condition and performance of the transportation system. States failing to meet standards must allocate funds to address deficiencies. The Surface Transportation Program broadens funding eligibility for highways and bridges, with a 50% sub-allocation to local governments based on population. Highway Safety measures are also included. The transportation management plan includes funding for mass transit projects, highway safety improvements, and congestion mitigation programs. It provides states with more flexibility by eliminating 60 federal highway programs. The transportation management plan eliminates 60 federal highway programs, providing states with greater flexibility in the use of federal highway assistance. This is achieved by shifting program eligibility to core programs and consolidating or converting discretionary programs for mass transit assistance. States are authorized to spend their federal highway funds for similar purposes as discontinued programs. The transportation management plan eliminates 60 federal highway programs, providing states with greater flexibility in the use of federal highway assistance. This includes replacing dedicated funding for certain programs with a Transportation Alternatives program, requiring states to set aside 2% of their funding for eligible activities, and expanding the list of eligible projects. The Transportation Alternatives program allows states to set aside funds for various entities in proportion to their population. States can transfer unallocated funds to other federal highway programs and make changes to project delivery approval processes to reduce project delivery time. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to establish a program for streamlined relocation processes and innovative project delivery methods. The federal share of project costs may be increased to 100% for projects using innovative methods. The list of activities qualifying for categorical exclusions is expanded to include projects with less than $5 million in federal funds or a total cost of not more than $30 million. The Transportation Secretary is directed to consult with officials at all levels of government to recommend new activities for categorical exclusions. Funding for the TIFIA loan program is increased to $750 million in FY2013 and $1 billion in FY2014. TIFIA's maximum support is raised to 49% from 33% of project costs, with a 10% set-aside for rural projects. National performance measures are to be used by Metropolitan Planning Organizations to support seven goals, including reducing traffic fatalities. The Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) are required to establish targets for highway condition and performance, track progress, and include representation from public transportation agencies. The new legislation removes the need for agreements with the Department of Transportation for tolling projects under mainstream programs, while also codifying substantive requirements. The new legislation allows states to toll new Interstate highways and add lanes to existing ones, with certain conditions. It also permits the conversion of HOV lanes to toll facilities under specific circumstances. All toll facilities on federal-aid highways must implement interoperable electronic toll collection programs by October 1, 2016. The FAST Act, enacted after multiple extensions of MAP-21, focused on funding and state decision-making authority in the reauthorization process. The Senate passed the DRIVE Act in July 2015, while the House passed a different version in November 2015. The conference agreement for the FAST Act was filed in December. The FAST Act, signed into law in December 2015, reauthorized transportation programs for six years. It provided three years of full funding for the Highway Trust Fund and created a new program for major projects with increased funding. Funding for the TIFIA loan program was reduced under the FAST Act. The Senate's DRIVE Act proposed significant changes to transportation funding, including expanding eligibility for TIFIA loans, providing states more flexibility for highway projects in rural areas, removing limitations on HOV facilities, and authorizing a toll credit marketplace pilot program. The Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program allows states to place tolls on existing highways under specified conditions. States must put tolling projects out to bid within one year of acceptance and under contract within two years. The program focuses on project delivery reforms, including the use of programmatic agreements and categorical exclusions to streamline project review processes. The U.S. Department of Transportation directed the implementation of categorical exclusions through a programmatic agreement and established review deadlines to reduce project delays. Additional funding was provided for mass transit, specifically for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Public ports, intercity bus operators, and commuter vanpool providers were added as parties for Metropolitan Planning Organizations to comment on transportation plans. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration truck and bus safety grant programs were consolidated and streamlined. States were no longer allowed to transfer up to 50% of their Transportation Alternatives Program funding to other highway programs. The House's STRRA proposed changes to transportation funding, including sub-allocating 100% of TAP apportionment based on population. It also renamed and modified the Surface Transportation Program as a block grant, with a pilot program allowing states to conduct environmental reviews under state laws. GAO would be required to report on the program within two years of enactment. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for local governments and states under the Act to accelerate the delivery of federal-aid highway and highway safety construction projects. It includes provisions for environmental review, permitting processes, and toll agreements for participating states in the Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program. The Act provisionally approves applications with the option for extension, cancels conditional approval if requirements are not met within a year, eliminates the High Density Bus program, consolidates FMCSA safety grant programs, and merges TAP into the STP block grant program. The FAST Act reauthorizes MAP-21's programs for five years, includes offsets for the HTF's solvency through 2020, creates a new discretionary program for major projects, and reduces funding for transportation. The FAST Act reauthorizes MAP-21's programs for five years, includes offsets for the HTF's solvency through 2020, creates a new discretionary program for major projects, expands eligibility for TIFIA loans, provides additional funding for mass transit, and adds new parties for Metropolitan Planning Organizations to comment on transportation projects.

Organizations must allow comments on the transportation plan, with various provisions of interest to state and local government officials. The debate over the federal role in surface transportation policy has historical roots and has been influenced by internal and external factors. The background, personalities, and ideological preferences of congressional leaders have influenced federal-state-local government relationships in surface transportation policy. The decentralized nature of decision-making in Congress has made it difficult to develop broad-based policies that cut across committee jurisdictions. In Congress, decision-making on surface transportation policy involves multiple committees and committee chairs. Different issues such as programmatic, funding distribution, tax, Highway Trust Fund, and safety are under the jurisdiction of various committees in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Interest groups from the private and public sectors advocate for transportation policies. Interest groups from both the private and public sectors have historically supported additional federal funding for transportation programs. However, there is a division on how funds should be allocated among states and transportation modes. Congress plays a key role in balancing national interests with state capabilities in managing transportation programs. While promoting state flexibility, Congress also ensures adherence to federal guidelines for project development and monitoring highway conditions and safety programs. FAST, and its predecessor Map-21, provide states with greater flexibility in federal highway assistance by converting the Surface Transportation Program (STP) into a block grant, consolidating truck and bus safety grant programs, and making changes to the project delivery approval process to reduce project delivery time for highway and mass transit construction projects. Presidents, often former governors, support program consolidation and devolution in surface transportation policy more than Congress, especially when favoring smaller government. Opposition arises from private sector groups fearing less funding and Members concerned about specific program funding. Changing American society and expectations complicate federalism relationships in transportation policy. The changing nature of American society has led to a shift in expectations regarding personal mobility, with automobile ownership now seen as a social status symbol and a necessity. Obtaining a drivers' license signifies the transition to adulthood for many American teenagers. Policymakers face challenges in transitioning towards a more balanced transportation approach due to the strong bond between Americans and their cars. Congress is hesitant to devolve surface transportation programs due to the public's high expectations for personal mobility. Congress is hesitant to devolve surface transportation programs to states due to concerns about accountability and meeting public expectations. They prefer to provide states with programmatic flexibility while retaining federal oversight to ensure alignment with national objectives. The future of federalism relationships in surface transportation policy will continue to be determined by Congress, evolving over time to adapt to changes in American society."
