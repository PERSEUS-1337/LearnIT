    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1996\". Congress found that the production of geologic maps had decreased before the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992. Geologic maps are crucial for earth-science investigations and are relied upon by various entities to assess potential environmental damage. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 highlighted the importance of geologic maps in addressing environmental issues, designing structures like dams, and locating fossil fuel and mineral resources. However, the program called for by the Act has not been fully implemented, and it is crucial for it to be fully executed now. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 emphasized the significance of geologic maps in various applications. Now, there is a need for the reauthorization and amendment of the Act. In the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992, definitions are amended to include the term 'Association' as the Association of American State Geologists. The Geologic Mapping Program section is also amended to establish certain provisions. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 amends definitions to include the Association of American State Geologists. It establishes a national cooperative geologic mapping program between the US Geological Survey and State geological surveys, administered through the Survey. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 amends definitions to include the Association of American State Geologists and establishes a national cooperative geologic mapping program between the US Geological Survey and State geological surveys, administered through the Survey. Amendments include rewording and reorganizing paragraphs and subparagraphs for clarity and consistency. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 amended definitions to include the Association of American State Geologists and established a national cooperative geologic mapping program between the US Geological Survey and State geological surveys. Amendments were made to reword and reorganize paragraphs and subparagraphs for clarity and consistency in 1996. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include the Association of American State Geologists and establish a cooperative geologic mapping program between the US Geological Survey and State geological surveys. In 1996, amendments were made to reword and reorganize paragraphs and subparagraphs for clarity and consistency. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include the Association of American State Geologists and establish a cooperative geologic mapping program between the US Geological Survey and State geological surveys. Amendments in 1996 reworded and reorganized paragraphs and subparagraphs for clarity and consistency, including changes to responsibilities of the secretary, interpretive language, and federal components. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include the Association of American State Geologists and establish a cooperative geologic mapping program between the US Geological Survey and State geological surveys. Amendments in 1996 reorganized paragraphs and subparagraphs, including changes to responsibilities of the secretary and federal components. The amendments also added a geologic mapping education component that involves geochronologic and isotopic investigations contributing to a national geochronologic database. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include a geologic mapping education component that aims to develop academic programs teaching earth-science students geologic mapping principles and field analysis. Federal funding for this component must be matched by non-Federal sources on a 1-to-1 basis. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to establish a 10-member geologic mapping advisory committee to advise the Director on planning and implementation of the program. Federal agency members include the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include representatives from the Survey, State geological surveys, academia, and the private sector on the advisory committee. The Geologic Mapping Program Implementation Plan was also updated to include a cooperative national component and specific requirements for the State geologic mapping component. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include a priority-setting mechanism for State geologic mapping, adopting scientific and technical mapping standards for geologic maps to ensure uniformity and quality. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include standards for geologic maps contributed to the national archives, ensuring format, symbols, and technical attributes adhere to set standards for efficient access and comparison of archival information. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include standards for geologic maps in cooperation with the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Annual reporting requirements were updated, and authorization of appropriations was revised. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include standards for geologic maps in cooperation with the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Annual reporting requirements were updated, and authorization of appropriations was revised to include SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 was amended to include funding allocations for the national cooperative geologic mapping program. Appropriations of $24-30 million were authorized annually from 1997 to 2000, with specific allocations for State and educational mapping activities. For fiscal years 1997 and 1998, appropriations under the National Geologic Mapping Act allocated funds for Federal, State, and educational mapping activities. For fiscal years 1999 and 2000, funds allocated under the National Geologic Mapping Act are distributed as follows: 74% for Federal mapping and support activities, 23% for State mapping activities, and 2% for educational mapping activities in 1999; and 73% for Federal mapping and support activities, 24% for State mapping activities, and 2% for educational mapping activities in 2000. For fiscal years 1999 and 2000, funds allocated under the National Geologic Mapping Act are distributed as follows: 74% for Federal mapping activities, 23% for State mapping activities, and 2% for educational mapping activities in 1999; and 73% for Federal mapping activities, 24% for State mapping activities, and 2% for educational mapping activities in 2000. The National Geologic Mapping Act was passed by the House of Representatives on July 30, 1996."
