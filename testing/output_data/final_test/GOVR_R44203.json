    "content": "The Fair Housing Act (FHA) prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, physical and mental handicap, and familial status. It applies to all types of housing and residential real estate transactions. The Supreme Court confirmed in 2015 that the FHA also prohibits housing-related decisions with a discriminatory effect. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discriminatory housing decisions that have a disparate impact on protected classes. Courts recognize two types of disparate impacts under the FHA: one that affects one group more than another, and another that perpetuates segregation. The Supreme Court and HUD have affirmed the validity of disparate-impact claims under the FHA. HUD and 11 federal courts of appeals have different criteria for determining when a neutral policy causing disparate impact violates the FHA. In 2013, HUD established uniform standards to harmonize disparate impact analysis. The Inclusive Communities Court adopted a three-step burden-shifting test similar to HUD's standards and outlined limiting factors for assessing disparate impact claims. It will take time to see the full impact of this decision on future FHA litigation. The Inclusive Communities decision will impact future disparate impact litigation under the FHA and other civil rights laws. Plaintiffs historically faced challenges in advancing their claims, but the \"cautionary standards\" emphasized by the Court may lead to even fewer successful claims. This report discusses how lower courts and HUD evaluated discriminatory effects pre-Inclusive Communities, followed by an analysis of the Court's ruling and its potential implications. All circuit courts previously held that disparate impact claims are valid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that disparate impact claims are cognizable under the FHA without requiring proof of discriminatory intent. This decision is significant in combating housing discrimination. Before the Inclusive Communities ruling, courts commonly looked to Title VII disparate impact cases for guidance in FHA-based claims. There was a general agreement among circuits that plaintiffs must show more than just a statistical anomaly to prove discriminatory effect. Causal evidence was also deemed necessary to demonstrate that a particular practice caused the disparity on a protected class. Prior to Inclusive Communities, plaintiffs faced challenges in disparate impact claims under the Fair Housing Act. A study of 92 cases from 1971 to 2013 showed that only 19.5% of cases resulted in positive outcomes for plaintiffs. Most cases were dismissed at preliminary stages by appellate courts. The study found that district court rulings in favor of plaintiffs were often reversed by appellate courts, despite lower courts generally being affirmed 80% of the time. Conversely, lower court rulings in favor of defendants were only reversed 16.2% of the time. This disparity led the scholar to question the sudden interest in examining disparate impact liability under the Fair Housing Act. The courts did not agree on every aspect of disparate impact analysis under the Fair Housing Act. Different Circuit Courts of Appeals applied burden-shifting tests with variations. Plaintiff initially bears the burden to show a policy results in disparate impact, then defendant must prove a legitimate purpose. The Second Circuit places the burden on the defendant to prove there is no less discriminatory alternative after showing a legitimate purpose. The Seventh Circuit uses a four-factor balancing test for disparate impact analysis under the Fair Housing Act. The Sixth and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals applied hybrid approaches for disparate impact analysis under the Fair Housing Act, incorporating elements from the Seventh Circuit's balancing test and a burden-shifting framework. The Fourth Circuit used a burden-shifting test for private defendants and a four-factor balancing test for public defendants. The Eleventh Circuit emphasized that a showing of significant discriminatory effect is sufficient to establish a prima facie violation of the Fair Housing Act, but causality must also be proven. HUD has interpreted the Fair Housing Act as supporting disparate impact claims for approximately two decades, formalizing this policy through regulations in February 2013. The Rule defines \"discriminatory effect\" as a practice that results in a disparate impact on a group of persons or perpetuates segregated housing. The HUD Rule adopted a three-part burden-shifting test to assess discriminatory effects under the Fair Housing Act. Plaintiffs must prove a discriminatory effect, defendants must show a legitimate interest, and plaintiffs must then rebut with evidence. The Supreme Court held that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act, but cautioned that they must rely on more than just statistical disparity. The Court's decision was surprising as there was no circuit split on the issue. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. sued the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs for perpetuating racial segregation by disproportionately distributing low-income housing tax credits. The district court found a discriminatory effect on African-Americans but required a less discriminatory alternative. The Fifth Circuit agreed on disparate impact claims but reversed the ruling due to burden of proof issues. The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's ruling on burden of proof issues regarding discriminatory effect claims under the FHA. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings, emphasizing causality and remedies. The Court referenced prior cases to support its interpretation of the FHA. The Supreme Court interpreted the Fair Housing Act (FHA) as supporting disparate impact claims, similar to previous cases involving Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The FHA prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin, focusing on the consequences of actions rather than just intent. Congress' use of the phrase \"otherwise make unavailable\" in the FHA refers to the discriminatory effects of actions. The Supreme Court concluded that Congress ratified disparate-impact liability under the Fair Housing Act in 1988, supporting claims based on discriminatory effects rather than intent. The Court emphasized the need for a \"robust causality requirement\" to prove that a policy or decision led to the statistical disparity in disparate impact claims. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for a \"robust causality requirement\" in disparate impact claims to avoid injecting racial considerations into housing decisions, imposing liability on defendants for disparities they did not cause, and discouraging housing development for the poor. Defendants should be able to counter a prima facie case with evidence that the policy in question is necessary to achieve a valid interest. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for a \"robust causality requirement\" in disparate impact claims to avoid injecting racial considerations into housing decisions. Defendants should be able to counter a prima facie case with evidence that the policy in question is necessary to achieve a valid interest. The Court also cautioned against court-ordered remedies that are race-neutral and focused on eradicating the policy causing the disparate impact. Much progress remains to be made in the nation's struggle against racial isolation. The Fair Housing Act plays a crucial role in promoting diversity and integration in cities, following the Kerner Commission's warning about the risk of segregated societies. The Supreme Court's decision highlighted the importance of a strong causal link in disparate impact claims, emphasizing the need for evidence to justify policies that may have unintended discriminatory effects. Justice Alito's dissent argued that the FHA was meant to address only intentional discrimination, not disparate impact. The dissenting Justices in the 1988 amendments viewed it as a compromise between Members of Congress on disparate impact claims under the FHA. Justice Thomas argued that Griggs should be limited to Title VII cases, not expanded to other contexts like the FHA and ADEA. The Inclusive Communities decision may impact how lower courts and HUD evaluate disparate impact claims. The Supreme Court's decision on disparate impact claims under the FHA will change evaluation methods in lower courts and HUD. The Court established a three-step burden-shifting test for assessing liability, requiring plaintiffs to prove disparate impact, defendants to show a valid interest, and plaintiffs to propose an alternative with less impact. The Supreme Court's decision on disparate impact claims under the FHA will lead to changes in lower courts and HUD. Circuits like the Fourth and Seventh may shift from a balancing test to a burden-shifting test. The burden to establish a less discriminatory alternative may now fall on the plaintiff. These changes could have occurred due to HUD's disparate impact rule even without the Supreme Court ruling. The specific standards outlined by the Inclusive Communities Court for the burden-shifting test may differ slightly from historical practices. The Supreme Court's decision on disparate impact claims under the FHA may differ slightly from historical practices applied by lower courts and HUD. The Court's standards for steps one and two in Inclusive Communities are largely consistent with HUD's rule, but with some differences in language that could impact plaintiffs and defendants. Both the Court and HUD require plaintiffs to establish a prima facie case with causal evidence, but the Court's language on causation differs slightly. The burden at the second step remains on the defendant according to both the Court and HUD. The Supreme Court's decision on disparate impact claims under the FHA emphasizes that defendants can counter a prima facie case by proving the challenged practice is necessary for valid interests. Courts and HUD should rigorously evaluate plaintiffs' claims for statistical disparity and causality, disposing of claims swiftly if a prima facie case is not established. Decades of legal challenges have made it difficult for plaintiffs to succeed in disparate impact claims. The Inclusive Communities decision may lead to stricter causality standards, making it harder for plaintiffs to prove discriminatory effects. The decision criticized the Eighth Circuit's ruling in Magner v. Gallagher, highlighting the importance of proving causation in such cases. The Inclusive Communities Court criticized the Eighth Circuit's ruling in Magner v. Gallagher for not requiring plaintiffs to provide direct evidence connecting the city's housing code enforcement to a reduction in affordable housing for African-Americans. The Court emphasized the importance of proving causation in disparate impact claims, signaling a potential shift towards stricter causality standards. The Inclusive Communities Court emphasized the need for causation in disparate impact claims, potentially leading to fewer successful claims and quicker dismissal of those raised, discouraging future claims."
