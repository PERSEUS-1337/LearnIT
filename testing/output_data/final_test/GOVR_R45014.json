    "content": "In a representative democracy, government information has transitioned from paper-based to digital processes, distributed through various outlets. Government printing and publishing authorities, codified in Title 44 of the United States Code, specify the production, dissemination, retention, and availability of government information through the Government Publishing Office (GPO). GPO serves as a centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, authenticating, and preserving published information for all three branches of the federal government. Its activities are funded through appropriations, income from executive and judicial branch agencies, and sales of products to nongovernmental entities and the general public. The Government Publishing Office (GPO) is primarily funded through appropriations from Congress, with a substantial portion allocated to Congressional Publishing for the production and dissemination of congressional documents. Established in 1861 as the Government Printing Office, GPO underwent significant operational changes in 1895 and 2014. Congress also established the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) in 1846 to oversee GPO operations and qualifications of personnel. The 1895 measure established printing formats for congressional bills, hearings, and documents, as well as the Federal Depository Library Program in 1962. In 1993, GPO was directed to maintain an electronic directory of federal digital information and provide online access to the Congressional Record and the Federal Register. GPO operates based on statutory authorities granted in the 19th and 20th centuries, presuming government information in ink-on-paper format. The current U.S. Code mentions JCP authorities in 60 sections. The U.S. Code mentions JCP authorities in 60 sections, with 37 enacted over a century ago. Similarly, GPO is subject to 129 Code sections in Title 44, with 105 enacted before 1917. The law references outdated trades but lacks details on modern digital processes. It also focuses on paper distribution over digital collection, retention, and preservation. The current business model of GPO relies heavily on printing for income generation, lacking provisions for upgrading technological infrastructure for electronic distribution and preservation. Some suggest replacing paper versions of publications with electronic versions to save costs, but the lack of reliable cost models for digital information management systems makes it difficult to verify potential savings. Savings have been achieved by reducing printed copies and implementing newer production processes. The GPO acknowledges that some tangible print will still be necessary for official use, archival purposes, authenticity, specific industry requirements, and populations with limited digital access. Concerns have been raised about the outdated framework of laws governing government publishing, with technological advancements expected to exacerbate the situation. The National Academy of Public Administration and the Director of GPO have highlighted the outdated laws governing government publishing, which may not be able to keep up with technological advancements. The question arises whether 19th-century authorities and work patterns can meet the challenges of digital government information creation. This report examines government information management in a digital environment, focusing on the Joint Committee on Printing, the Federal Depository Library Program, and future government information management. The Joint Committee on Printing was established in 1846 to oversee government printing services, and its duties were detailed by Congress. The Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) has detailed statutory duties regarding the management of the Government Printing Office (GPO), including overseeing finances, facilities, staffing, and production of printed works. JCP has authority over wage setting, paper quality assessment, and work production. Its authority was unchallenged for over a century but began to change in the 1980s and 1990s following a Supreme Court decision ruling a one-chamber veto unconstitutional. The Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) faced challenges to its authority following a Supreme Court ruling that deemed a one-chamber veto unconstitutional. Executive branch entities, such as the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Defense (DOD), questioned JCP's regulatory authority, particularly regarding the requirement for all government printing to be done at the Government Printing Office (GPO). The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) concluded that certain provisions of JCP's authority were invalidated by the Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court ruling invalidated certain provisions of the Joint Committee on Printing's authority, allowing executive agencies to procure printing services outside of the Government Printing Office. This led to a departure from the policies outlined in Title 44 of the U.S. Code, resulting in the production of \"fugitive\" government documents not readily available to the public. In 1995, Congress started the process of cutting staffing and funding for the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) due to governance and operational challenges. JCP has held organizational meetings for every Congress since the 104th Congress and published details for the 108th and 113th-115th Congresses. Some of JCP's responsibilities are carried out by the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee. Questions have been raised about the efficiency and effectiveness of JCP. One option for addressing concerns about the efficiency and effectiveness of the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) could be to assess its authorities and potentially reassign its responsibilities to other government entities like CHA, SRA, or GPO. The Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) was established by Congress in 1813 to provide free public access to federal government information. The Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) was established in 1813 to provide public access to federal government information. Administered by the Government Printing Office (GPO), FDLP libraries receive tangible copies of government publications for distribution to depository libraries. These libraries are required to retain and make accessible the FDLP content. Depository libraries, including academic, municipal, and federal ones, are mandated to provide tangible FDLP content to the public. They support this by managing collection development, cataloging, and staffing. Ownership of publications remains with the U.S. Government. Distributing publications to depository libraries ensures long-term preservation and free local access to government information. Costs for preservation and access are widely distributed among depository libraries. Under 44 U.S.C. 1912, depository libraries fall into two categories: regional and selective. Regional libraries are designated to retain government publications permanently, with exceptions, and there are currently 46 regional libraries in the FDLP. Selective depository libraries are all FDLP participants that are not regional libraries. Some multistate agreements for regional libraries exist, despite not being explicitly sanctioned in the law. The FDLP includes regional and selective depository libraries. Regionals retain all tangible content, while selectives can choose among document classes. Selectives served by regionals can dispose of documents after 5 years, others must retain them permanently. There are around 1,100 selective libraries in the FDLP, with a decline in participation since the mid-1990s. Authorities governing FDLP are based on a paper-based information environment, with a tangible collection dating back to 1813. The FDLP tangible collection, dating back to 1813, contains approximately 2.3 million items, with one-third not catalogued. Government publications are distributed to depository libraries, with a decrease in quantities over the years. FDLP participants are required to provide the \"FDLP Basic Collection.\" The FDLP Basic Collection includes various government information collections like the Budget of the United States Government and the Congressional Record. GPO announced changes in 2014 to focus on providing online resources to selective depository libraries. Selectives can choose to be \"mostly online\" or \"all online\" depositories, transitioning from tangible to online formats over time. The transition to a predominantly digital FDLP raises questions about GPO's ability to manage the program. GPO's responsibilities for digital information distribution are diverse and less explicitly defined compared to tangible materials. SUDOCS has archiving authorities for tangible materials but not for digital content. GPO has authority to manage digital FDLP materials, but lacks explicit digital distribution authorities for online access to publications. In 2017, Director Vance-Cooks tasked the DLC with recommending changes to Title 44 related to FDLP, focusing on Chapter 19 for potential revisions to provide depository libraries with more flexibility. Director Vance-Cooks suggested that technology has surpassed certain aspects of 44 U.S.C. Ch. 19, governing FDLP operations, allowing for more flexibility and innovation in providing government information. DLC recommended amending definitions to include all formats, requiring agencies to deposit electronic publications with GPO, and allowing regional depository libraries to hold digital copies. The DLC recommended changes to FDLP operations, including enhancing access to government publications, ensuring public access to electronic information, and allowing for privacy expectations. Other recommendations included updates to qualifications for selectives, requirements for participating libraries, disposal of government documents, and expanded authorities for regional depositories. The DLC recommended changes to FDLP operations, including enhancing access to government publications, ensuring public access to electronic information, and allowing for privacy expectations. Expanded authorities for regional depositories to share collections and services across state lines are subject to approval. Concerns include managing tangible and digital materials, such as storage, cataloging, access, security, authentication, custody, and long-term preservation. Other areas of concern are management and digitization of tangible materials, retention of digital content, and associated costs. User demand for FDLP information lacks a uniform metric over time. User demand for FDLP information lacks a uniform metric over time, with systematic estimates of tangible materials usage not readily available due to decentralized storage and access. Some suggest underutilization of parts of the collection, while others note increased access when materials are made available online. Some depository libraries are considering digitizing tangible FDLP collections to increase access for users. This could reduce costs and potentially lead to consolidation of physical government publications in libraries. The debate over digitizing tangible FDLP collections held by depository libraries raises questions about costs, maintenance, and the authority to make such changes. There is uncertainty about the number of paper copies needed and the potential higher costs of digitization. The challenge lies in balancing the retention and preservation of tangible materials with the transition to digital formats. Questions arise regarding the preservation of decaying tangible materials, the number of copies needed for permanent retention of government records, and access for the public when digital materials are insufficient. The need for a fully cataloged FDLP collection is essential to determine preservation requirements, with varying opinions on the number of tangible copies needed permanently. Some suggest consolidating collections to save space and costs while meeting user needs, while others highlight a lack of data on the necessary number of copies. One proposal suggests creating two national retrospective collections by GPO for secure housing. A study on retaining scholarly journals in print form found a lack of accurate data, leading decision-makers to estimate the appropriate number of tangible copies needed. Questions on digitized materials preservation and costs are similar to those for born digital materials. The discussion includes the costs and implications of digitizing original publications, comparing them to current FDLP practices, and the impact on public access to government information. Unlike tangible collections, digital government information is provided online to depository libraries and users. Cost estimates for preserving tangible materials in their original form have not been developed. The information is provided online to depository libraries and users, raising concerns about collection development practices and access to digital materials. Potential users may face challenges with insufficient Internet access to retrieve resource-intensive materials. Concerns also arise about the availability of information not physically present in depository libraries and the effectiveness of search resources. Depository libraries bear the costs of the FDLP program without a funding mechanism in place. The emergence of digital delivery has shifted costs to information providers like GPO. Maintaining tangible collections has become prohibitive for some depository libraries. In its FY2018 budget request, GPO highlighted investments in IT infrastructure for digital information systems. The increasing costs of digital delivery may require more resources from GPO's revolving fund or additional appropriations. Agencies may need to reassess service levels in a hybrid system of tangible and digital delivery as digital information grows. The costs of maintaining and upgrading digital data, software, and hardware for long-term preservation are expected to rise, but there is no public estimate available. Congress's past approaches to government printing and publishing practices could provide insights for future oversight. The enactment of the Printing Act of 1895 reflected the state-of-the-art standard of printing technology at that time. Government printing and publishing practices from the past could offer ideas for overseeing government information creation, distribution, and retention in the future. Primitive drawings and early examples of printing can be seen in historical documents like the Journals of the House and Senate dating back to the First Congress in 1789. The Printing Act of 1895 showcased advanced printing technology, supporting government information distribution for over a century. Paper-based documents can last for centuries due to durable materials and proper storage. Preservation techniques can maintain the integrity of tangible materials without altering the information they contain. Skilled practitioners in writing, printing, bindery, and librarianship are globally available. In the digital age, challenges arise in preserving digital information for the long term. Unlike tangible materials, there is no widespread agreement on how many copies of digital items should be kept. Various approaches are needed to preserve born digital materials like databases and websites. Digital preservation of born digital materials like databases, websites, and publications raises questions about version control and the need for strategies to capture different versions for archival preservation. Unlike tangible products, digital preservation relies on risk analysis and differentiated techniques based on the object or preservation goals. Hardware, operating systems, and software applications are essential for digital production and retention, creating a dynamic \"document\" that requires ongoing maintenance. Digital preservation involves evolving hardware, operating systems, and software, leading to challenges in accessing and rendering older digital materials. Reformatting may be necessary to ensure compatibility with newer systems. Digital preservation faces challenges in retaining original forms of digital materials, raising concerns about authenticity and preservation. Efforts to establish standards for digital material production may limit technologies to conform to specific standards, potentially replacing current printing and publication management approaches. Congress could consider a process for adopting newer technologies and approaches for long-term retention of government information, rather than enacting fixed standards like those set in 1895. Assessing current practices against future needs and emerging information management practices could help identify future standards. Assessing current practices against future technological advancements and emerging information management practices could help identify future needs. Technology and management assessment efforts could be conducted by a government agency or external experts in the field. This approach could facilitate the regular updating and management of digital information technology processes."
