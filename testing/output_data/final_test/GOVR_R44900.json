    "content": "Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) are tax-avoidance strategies that exploit gaps in tax rules to shift profits to low-tax locations. The OECD has published a list of 15 action items to address tax avoidance, some of which can be implemented through administrative actions while others would require legislative action. The OECD framework on Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) includes four minimum standards: countering harmful tax practices, preventing treaty abuse, country-by-country reporting, and increasing dispute resolution effectiveness. This framework aims to address tax avoidance through multinational cooperation and legislative actions. The BEPS action items aim to tackle profit shifting through multinational cooperation, focusing on methods like excessive interest deductions and transfer pricing. The United States faces potential revenue loss if other countries increase taxation on U.S. firms, due to its worldwide tax system and foreign tax credit provisions. The Senate Finance Committee requested a study on BEPS actions, focusing on transfer pricing guidance and CbC reporting. Concerns arise about other countries using CbC reporting to implement formula-based taxation on U.S. multinationals. The U.S. adopted CbC reporting for 2017, with bilateral sharing agreements, while most countries signed a multilateral agreement. Confidentiality concerns exist, with proposals to make CbC reports public. Some concerns have been raised about the permanent establishment issues in Action Item 7 and the use of expanded permanent establishment treatment to allow foreign taxation of U.S. firms' income not properly allocated to foreign sources. Heightened concerns about capturing revenues by other countries stem from the EU's actions against U.S. multinational corporations like Apple in Ireland, the UK's and Australia's diverted profits taxes, and the allocation of profits for firms with permanent establishments. The OECD's recent progress report highlighted increased transparency in rules, reduced opportunities for treaty abuse, curtailment of harmful tax practices, and the benefits of uniform CbC reporting for U.S. multinationals. The OECD's recent progress report highlighted increased transparency in rules, reduced opportunities for treaty abuse, and curtailment of harmful tax practices. Europe faces constraints due to EU rules prohibiting discrimination against cross-border trade restrictions. Some BEPS measures target artificial income shifting into low-tax foreign subsidiaries and limitations of benefits in the multilateral instrument. Certain countries may not find all action items relevant, and legislative changes required for many actions may be challenging. The United States may not find proposed actions in the digital economy or harmful tax practices relevant. The OECD's recent progress report highlighted increased transparency in international tax rules, reduced opportunities for treaty abuse, and curtailment of harmful tax practices. The United States may not find proposed actions in the digital economy or harmful tax practices relevant due to existing differences in tax laws and practices. The OECD's recent progress report focused on international tax rules, treaty abuse, and harmful tax practices. The report proposed standards for VATS and addressed profit shifting, tax treaties, and administrative actions. Different tax systems like territorial and worldwide taxation were discussed, with the US having a hybrid system. The United States has a hybrid tax system that includes worldwide taxation and territorial features like deferral and cross-crediting. Income from foreign subsidiaries is taxed when paid as dividends, while certain types of income are taxed currently. Anti-abuse rules, known as Subpart F rules, apply to foreign firms with U.S. shareholders owning at least 50% of the voting power. The Subpart F rules apply to foreign firms with U.S. shareholders owning at least 50% of the voting power or value, and at least 10% of the voting interest. These rules tax passive income, income from sales and services subsidiaries in foreign countries, income from insurance of risks outside the country, and income invested in U.S. property. There are de minimis exclusions and full inclusion rules based on the percentage of Subpart F income. Other countries have similar rules triggering current taxation. The Subpart F rules apply to foreign firms with U.S. shareholders owning at least 50% of the voting power or value, and at least 10% of the voting interest. These rules tax passive income, income from sales and services subsidiaries in foreign countries, income from insurance of risks outside the country, and income invested in U.S. property. EU member countries are constrained in applying CFC rules to other EU member states. Check-the-box rules have reduced the scope of Subpart F since the late 1990s, allowing foreign subsidiaries to elect to disregard second-tier subsidiaries as separate entities for tax purposes. The U.S. tax system allows a foreign tax credit to prevent double taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. This credit ensures that firms are not taxed in excess of the greater of the foreign tax or U.S. tax due if the income were earned in the United States. If the foreign tax credit had no limit, a worldwide system with current taxation and a foreign tax credit would result in the same tax as a residence-based tax. The U.S. tax system allows a foreign tax credit to prevent double taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Firms in countries with a higher tax rate than the U.S. rate would get a refund for the excess tax, while firms in countries with a lower rate would pay the difference. Cross-crediting allows excess credits from one country to offset taxes in another with little or no tax. Foreign tax credit limits are applied to different income categories or baskets to prevent excessive tax offsetting. Tax credit limits are applied to different income categories or baskets, such as passive and active baskets. Royalties on active business operations fall under the active basket and can benefit from excess credits against U.S. tax from foreign taxes. Excess credits from oil and gas extraction are restricted due to high foreign tax rates. Multinational firms have low U.S. tax rates due to deferral and cross-crediting, with an estimated effective U.S. residential tax of 3.3%. The source country has the first right of taxation, regardless of the residence country's tax system. When firms, especially closely related firms, are located in different taxing jurisdictions, the allocation of profits, whether returns to waiting or risk, should be carefully considered. The profit representing waiting should accrue to the owner of the asset or the entity that gave up resources to make investments, while the profit representing risk should be borne by the person subject to the risk. Successful innovations can lead to excess returns due to patent protection or monopoly power. Returns from risk-bearing should go to the party taking the risk, based on the investment under income tax rules. Market size is not a source of value, but a factor in investment decisions. Risk-bearing is a key issue in BEPS standards and transfer pricing. Nexus is the initial step in the process. The review of transfer pricing issues addressed by BEPS focuses on establishing nexus for determining a country's right to tax a firm's profits. Nexus requires a permanent establishment with a physical presence, leading to the determination of income sourced in that country. In U.S. tax law, effectively connected income requires a physical presence or assets used in the United States. Tax treaties also address permanent establishment. Profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions is a concern in BEPS projects, with methods like leveraging and transfer pricing of intangible assets. Firms shift profits through leveraging debt in high-tax countries like the United States. Thin capitalization rules restrict large interest deductions to 50% of income. New regulations under Section 385 aim to control debt between related entities. Recently, new regulations under Section 385 require some debt between related entities to be reclassified as equity. Profit shifting can also occur through transfer pricing methods, where goods and assets are bought and sold between related firms at arm's length pricing. Transfer pricing issues often arise with intangible assets, for which various methods are used to determine prices. When operating abroad, foreign subsidiaries may make buy-in payments and cost-sharing payments for research rights. Tax treaties between countries aim to prevent double taxation, covering issues like withholding taxes and source-based taxes. Withholding taxes can be imposed on dividends, interest, royalties, and capital gains payments. The United States applies a 30% withholding tax on dividends and royalties, exempting interest from banks and insurance companies. Capital gains are mostly exempt, except for real estate sales. EU member states cannot impose withholding taxes on each other. Treaties between countries reduce tax rates, sometimes to zero on royalties and 5% for U.S. subsidiaries of foreign parents. Treaty shopping is addressed by OECD BEPS action items to prevent tax avoidance through generous withholding tax treatment. Tax planning arrangements involve shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions by utilizing withholding taxes. For instance, in Europe, profits are funneled through the Netherlands to avoid withholding taxes on royalties. Tax treaties address various issues like defining residency and determining when U.S. firms' profits will be taxed abroad. Business profits are typically taxed in the state of residence unless conducted through a permanent establishment in a foreign country. Action 1 focuses on the impact of the digital economy on profits taxation in foreign countries. It addresses the challenges posed by online activities like advertising, broadcasting, and financial services. The discussion includes corporate profits taxes, withholding taxes on income, and the value-added tax (VAT), with standards provided only for the VAT. The digital economy encompasses various activities such as retailing, financial services, remote education, and cloud computing. It involves gathering customer data for revenue generation and user-generated content. The OECD analysis raises questions about classifying income from activities like cloud computing. U.S. multinationals are heavily involved in the digital economy, leading to discussions on establishing nexus in this evolving landscape. The OECD is exploring new approaches for establishing nexus in the digital economy, focusing on physical presence standards under Action Item 7. Economic presence, measured by various factors, was considered but not adopted as the standard nexus test. Action Item 1 discussed income allocation methods and withholding taxes on digital transactions. These approaches are not standardized but can be adopted by countries to address BEPS issues. The OECD is considering new approaches for nexus in the digital economy, focusing on economic presence over physical presence standards. This shift could impact how profits from remote or digital sales are taxed, potentially leading to increased taxes for U.S. firms by other countries. Standards for digital economy taxation are not yet defined, but could affect how profits and passive income are taxed. The OECD is exploring new nexus approaches in the digital economy, emphasizing economic presence over physical presence. This could affect how profits from remote sales are taxed, potentially increasing taxes for U.S. firms. The focus is on reducing profit shifting by multinationals through actions like limiting exceptions in the definition of permanent establishment and ensuring current taxation of income in the digital economy. Hybrid entities and instruments involve cross-border tax issues such as deductions in one country without taxation in another and multiple foreign tax credits. They can be seen differently from various countries' perspectives. For example, in the U.S., check-the-box rules allow entities to be disregarded for tax purposes, impacting how income is taxed. The check-the-box rule allows a German subsidiary to be disregarded for U.S. tax purposes, resulting in untaxed interest income. Hybrid instruments involve different tax treatments in different countries, such as deductions in one country without taxation in another. Three types of treatments are identified: (1) deductible payment in one country but not included in the other, (2) double deductions, and (3) indirect tax issues. The action item proposes measures to address issues related to hybrid instruments and entities, including denying deductions and ensuring income inclusion. It also suggests changes to domestic laws to prevent misuse of treaty benefits and outlines rules for deductible hybrid payments and dual residents. The curr_chunk discusses tax treaty provisions, including deductible hybrid payments and dual residents. No legislative proposals are active, with no changes proposed to check-the-box and look-through rule. Action 3 standards aim to strengthen CFC rules, suggesting limitations on check-the-box treatment for Subpart F income and considering additional income types like IP, digital activities, and finance. Substance analysis is also mentioned to assess economic activity levels. The curr_chunk discusses potential changes to CFC rules in the United States, including taxing excess income from intangibles and implementing a minimum tax on intangible income in low-tax jurisdictions. These proposals have similarities to past suggestions but no changes have been proposed to eliminate check-the-box and the look-through rule. The United States is considering a move to a territorial tax system. The discussion focuses on the possibility of the United States transitioning to a territorial tax system and the challenges related to leveraging for profit shifting. It mentions thin capitalization rules, foreign subsidiary loans, and different types of leveraging strategies. The proposal addresses leveraging challenges by implementing rules such as arm's length tests, withholding tax on interest payments, and limiting interest deductions. It suggests a fixed limit on interest as a percentage of pretax earnings, along with a worldwide group ratio rule to allow for exceeding the limit. The proposal suggests rules to limit interest deductions, including a fixed limit on interest as a percentage of pretax earnings and a worldwide group ratio rule. It notes exceptions for loans funding public-benefit policies and highlights that the rules may not apply to the banking and insurance sectors. The 2016 report concluded that a common approach may not be suitable for banking and insurance, recommending individual country risk assessments. The proposed BEPS rules are stricter than current U.S. regulations, requiring legislative changes to meet the standard. The Section 385 debt-equity regulations aim to restrict interest deductions by characterizing certain debt as equity. The proposal aims to limit interest deductions by characterizing certain debt as equity. There are no current targeted legislative changes in the United States regarding interest deductions. Establishing nexus is the first step in allocating income for profit taxes, requiring a permanent establishment. Tax authorities face challenges in profit attribution due to the lack of a permanent establishment, which can be avoided through a commissionaire arrangement. A commissionaire arrangement is used in certain civil law countries to sell products on behalf of a foreign enterprise, allowing the principal to avoid having a permanent establishment and not pay tax on profits. The commissionaire pays taxes only on a commission set by contract, reducing profit taxes in the country where products are sold. The OECD Model Tax Convention allows for the avoidance of permanent establishment status by ensuring contracts are not concluded in the state where sales take place and by using independent agents. This measure would modify the convention to include circumstances where the agent habitually concludes contracts or plays a leading role. Exceptions to business operations are also considered to avoid permanent establishment status. The concern is that certain business activities, previously considered preparatory or auxiliary, may now be seen as core operations in the digital age. Fragmentation of operations is also a worry, where firms split activities to avoid permanent establishment status. The proposed action item aims to define preparatory or auxiliary activities in relation to core operations and address strategies like splitting contracts to avoid permanent establishment. The OECD's proposed actions aim to address concerns about profit shifting through the use of a network of agents to sell insurance and the attribution of profits to permanent establishments. These changes, including limitations on intragroup interest payments, are part of the BEPS initiative to prevent tax avoidance. U.S. firms are particularly concerned about how revisions to permanent establishment rules may impact their operations. U.S. firms are worried about the impact of permanent establishment status on profit allocation to target export countries. Other countries are interested in addressing this issue for tax investigation purposes. The United States has not taken any action on this matter yet. Transfer pricing is crucial for allocating profits when related companies trade internally. Transfer pricing rules require charging a transfer price based on the arm's length principle, ensuring goods are exchanged at prices similar to unrelated firms. Various methods like resale costs and profit margins are used when comparables are unavailable. Intangibles like technology and brand value are challenging to value. The focus is shifting towards economic functions, assets, and risk, emphasizing value creation in pricing. The BEPS plan focuses on aligning transfer pricing with value creation through three key actions: 1. Transfer pricing of intangibles (Action 8) 2. Contractual allocation of risks (Action 9) 3. Addressing issues like non-commercial transactions and profit diversion (Action 10). It clarifies that risk should be associated with higher returns and cannot be allocated to a party without control or financial capacity. Legal ownership is also emphasized. The OECD documents emphasize that legal ownership alone does not guarantee the right to exploit intangibles, especially in cost-sharing arrangements like cost-contribution arrangements in the United States. Capital-rich members providing funding without controlling risks may only receive a riskless return. CbC reporting in Action 13 helps assess risks and transfer pricing issues, highlighting that contract-based outcomes may not reflect reality. To manage risks effectively, entities must have control and financial capacity to bear risks, otherwise, they should only receive a risk-free return. Factors like contractual terms, functions, economic circumstances, and business strategies are crucial in determining arm's length pricing. Conduct holds more significance than the contract in these matters. The fundamental theme in this section emphasizes that conduct is more important than the contract. Risk management involves actual control and financial capacity, with true control being the making of decisions. Risk assumption should be ex ante, and factors like geographic market, underpricing strategies, location effects, and group synergies impact transfer pricing. Persistent losses in one firm while the group is profitable raise concerns. Countries face challenges in commodity transactions, with the profit split method being considered for global trading of financial instruments. Inputs include invested capital costs and functional contributions. Inexact comparables may be used, but the profit split method is better for highly integrated operations. Its use in supporting results under the TNMM and other methods is under discussion. The profit split method is being considered for defining intangibles, ensuring appropriate profit allocation, and developing rules for hard-to-value intangibles. Risk issues from Action 9 are relevant, with a risk-free return allowed only if no function is performed or risk controlled. Tax authorities can use ex-post outcomes as evidence for pricing arrangements when there are information asymmetries. Returns should align with value creation, not legal ownership. Control and capacity to bear risk are necessary for assuming risk. Financing without functions should receive a risk-adjusted return. The discussion emphasizes that intangibles include patents, know-how, trademarks, and goodwill, among others. Transfer pricing should consider functions, assets, and risks, with control and capacity to bear risk being crucial. Various methods can be used, but rules of thumb are not recommended. The discussion on transfer pricing methods includes CUP, transactional cost methods, and discounted cash flow. Risk in payment forms is highlighted, with contingent payments seen as more risky. Tax authorities should consider ex-post outcomes for hard-to-value intangibles. Low value-adding intra-group services may use CUP or cost-based approaches. Profit attribution based on cost-contribution arrangements (CCAs) is discussed, particularly in the context of U.S. multinationals. The discussion on profit attribution based on cost-contribution arrangements (CCAs) focuses on ensuring that the same rules applying to contractual arrangements in general are also applied to CCAs. It is important for entities to exercise control over risks and measure contributions and benefits at value, not cost. The entity must exercise control over risk in cost-sharing arrangements, making decisions on how to respond to risks and allocate based on formulas like shares of income, costs saved, sales, profits, and units employed. This is crucial in the U.S. due to common use of cost-sharing arrangements in developing intangibles and sharing benefits of research. High returns from excess returns are unlikely to be shared with unrelated firms in exchange for financing research. The discussion on transfer pricing highlights concerns about the arm's length principle not effectively accounting for risk allocation between related entities. This view challenges the ability of a parent company to transfer risk to its subsidiary due to the impact on market value. This perspective is supported by Ed Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California. Ed Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California, commented on a court case involving Medtronic and its Puerto Rican subsidiary. The IRS considered the manufacturing of medical devices in Puerto Rico routine, but the Tax Court found additional income could be attributed to the subsidiary due to quality control challenges. Kleinbard argued that if the implanted instruments malfunctioned, it would impact the parent company's reputation and value. The IRS has appealed the decision, and there are concerns about current U.S. practices aligning with OECD guidelines. The OECD circulated discussion drafts on two issues related to profit attribution and transfer pricing methods. The first issue involves attributing profits to permanent establishments, while the second issue focuses on the transaction profit splits method for highly integrated businesses. The reality is that risk cannot be fully allocated away from the parent company, despite efforts to separate control of risk within subsidiaries. The draft discusses the transaction profit splits method for highly integrated businesses, emphasizing the need for actual profits based on known information. It highlights the challenges of applying this method and cautions against using it solely due to a lack of comparables. The GAO study raises concerns about profit shifting through this method, particularly in preferential tax regimes for intellectual property. The United States does not have a patent or innovation box, but proposals have been made for one. Other countries have preferential regimes for income from innovations or intellectual property. This could impact the attractiveness of locating research abroad rather than in the US. The action item also focuses on transparency in tax rules, particularly advance pricing arrangements. The OECD's action item focuses on harmful tax practices, specifically on the substantial activity requirement for preferential regimes and risk allocation for profit shifting. Factors considered include low-tax rates, lack of transparency, and ineffective exchange of information. Other factors to consider are artificial base, secrecy, and promotion as a tax minimization device. The OECD's action item focuses on harmful tax practices, specifically on the substantial activity requirement for preferential regimes and risk allocation for profit shifting. It considers factors like low-tax rates, lack of transparency, and ineffective exchange of information. The item has a specific focus on IP regimes, requiring R&D expenses to occur in the country. The pricing approach for preferential tax regimes is based on functions and risk, with research expenditures determining income eligibility. Outsourcing is allowed to unrelated firms but not related ones. The action item covers patents, copyrighted software, and certified items for smaller firms. Existing IP regimes are found inconsistent with proposed actions, while tax incentives for disadvantaged areas are not a concern. Requirements for substantial activities or core income-generating items are briefly considered. The action item requires transparency and information exchange for certain types of rulings related to preferential regimes, advance pricing agreements, downward adjustments in profit, permanent establishment, conduits, and any other ruling that would give rise to BEPS issues. Holding companies are a special case, and their potential for profit shifting may be addressed with other work on information exchange, treaty abuse, hybrid mismatches, and ring fencing. The only U.S. action planned is to exchange information about unilateral advance pricing agreements. The action item proposes transparency and information exchange for certain types of rulings related to preferential regimes, advance pricing agreements, and other BEPS issues. It includes measures to address treaty shopping through tax treaties, such as limitation on benefits and anti-abuse rules. The U.S. plans to exchange information about unilateral advance pricing agreements with other countries. The action item proposes flexibility in implementing the treaty through LOB and PPT rules, with LOB rules being more certain and PPT rules offering more flexibility. The statement of intent to prevent tax evasion is a minimum provision. The need for flexibility is due to restrictions within the EU on withholding taxes, domestic anti-abuse rules, and economic substance rules. The United States does not plan to include PPT rules as they already have LOB rules. This section addresses monitoring BEPS, mandatory disclosure, CbC reporting, dispute resolution, and other provisions. Action 11 of the BEPS initiative reviews indicators and data needs to monitor BEPS, estimating global revenue losses between 4% and 10% of corporate income tax revenues annually. Key indicators include higher profit rates in low-tax countries, lower effective tax rates for large multinationals compared to domestic firms, and a concentration of foreign direct investment in high GDP ratio countries. The separation of taxable profits from value-creating activities, especially with intangibles, is highlighted. The action item in the BEPS initiative highlights key indicators of BEPS, such as higher profit rates in low-tax countries and lower effective tax rates for large multinationals. It emphasizes the importance of measuring the magnitude of BEPS and suggests improving data analysis to address existing limitations. The OECD is urged to work with governments to report and analyze more corporate statistics, with CbC data analysis seen as a potential tool for enhancing BEPS economic analysis. Action 11 in the BEPS initiative discusses the need for additional analysis on profit shifting, differences in profitability between multinational and domestic firms, tax factors in location decisions, and governments' strategic behavior. It encourages the publication of new corporate tax statistics and provides a toolkit for estimating BEPS effects. The BEPS initiative's Action 11 calls for improved corporate tax statistics globally, focusing on profit shifting by U.S. multinational firms. Estimates show significant revenue losses for the U.S. due to profit shifting to low-tax countries. Data on profits of foreign affiliates by country is crucial for tracking this trend. The G-7 countries had a tax haven share of 0.6% in 2004, increasing to 0.7% in 2010. Large tax havens like Ireland saw significant growth, with the share rising from 7.6% to 41.9%. Small tax havens like the Cayman Islands also experienced high growth rates, with the share increasing from 546.7% to 2,065.6%. The proposed action item suggests mandatory disclosure rules for aggressive tax transactions to provide early information to tax authorities and deter tax avoidance. The current mandatory disclosure regimes include a transaction-based approach in the United States, requiring reporting from both taxpayers and promoters. The approach to mandatory disclosure rules for aggressive tax transactions involves reporting from both taxpayers and promoters. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a promoter-based approach places the primary disclosure obligation on the promoter. Different approaches may rely on specific hallmarks or cover generic ones, such as when tax benefits are a main benefit. In cases where the promoter is offshore or faces compliance difficulties, the disclosure obligation may fall on the taxpayer. Recommendations suggest that for offshore promoters or cases where legal privilege is claimed, the obligation should fall on the taxpayer. The scope of a disclosure regime can be single-step or multistep, with a single-step regime broadly covering tax benefits. The mandatory disclosure rules for aggressive tax transactions can involve a single-step or multistep regime. A single-step regime covers tax benefits broadly, while a multistep regime defines a threshold condition. The action discusses generic and specific hallmarks, including confidentiality, premium fees, and generating losses. The United States includes listed transactions, transactions of interest, and book-tax differences, while other countries have hallmarks like leasing transactions. The action recommends disclosure of tax schemes involving hallmarks such as leasing transactions, salary conversion, and hybrid instruments. It suggests disclosure at the date of availability and implementation, penalties, and procedural matters. Recommendations include removing threshold conditions, focusing on BEPS risks, broadening definitions, and utilizing the JITSIC network for information exchange. The action item proposes a standardized approach for multinational companies to provide information on their operations and transfer pricing. This includes a master file, a local file with transfer pricing details, and a CbC report with revenue, profit, taxes paid, and other business activities for each jurisdiction. The reports will be shared with local tax administrations and filed by the parent company. The CbC report will be filed in the parent's jurisdictions and shared through automatic exchange of information for firms with revenue of 750 million euros or more starting in 2018. The Treasury has implemented CbC reporting but is not requiring the master or local file to be submitted. The United States is opting for bilateral agreements for information sharing due to concerns about confidentiality and inappropriate use. Companies have signed bilateral agreements with several countries for Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting. Concerns have been raised about potential misuse of the information leading to double taxation and audit disputes. Stakeholders believe compliance costs will increase despite OECD's claims of standardizing reporting. The action item aims to enhance the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) to reduce compliance costs for U.S. multinationals by focusing on Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting. It includes elements such as timely case resolution, administrative process efficiency, and access to the procedure. Peer reviews are ongoing, with some countries opting for binding arbitration. This aligns with the U.S.' stance on mandatory binding arbitration in tax treaties. The multilateral instrument (MLI) was designed to modify bilateral tax treaties to implement BEPS measures quickly. It has been signed by almost 70 countries, but the United States has not shown any intention to sign. Some developing countries are hesitant to adopt binding arbitration in dispute resolution due to concerns about sovereignty over tax matters. The flexibility of the MLI to accommodate different countries' adoption of BEPS standards has been seen as weakening its value."
