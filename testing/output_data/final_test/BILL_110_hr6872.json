The amendment to Section 2504 of title 44, United States Code allows for grants to eligible entities, such as 501(c)(3) organizations or State/local governments, to promote historical preservation and public access to records related to Presidents without a Presidential archival depository. The amendment allows grants to eligible entities for historical preservation and public access to records related to Presidents without a Presidential archival depository. Funds received cannot be used for facility maintenance, operating costs, or construction. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Commission for grant consideration. The Commission will only approve a grant application if an eligible entity can demonstrate possession of historical works and collections related to Presidents, suitable facilities for preservation and public access to these materials. The eligible entity must ensure preservation and public access to historical works and collections at no cost, incorporate the use of documents into educational programs, and raise funds from non-Federal sources equal to the grant amount sought. The eligible entity must coordinate with relevant Federal and non-Federal programs, including Presidential archival depositories, State and local governments, and private historical entities, to preserve and provide public access to historical works and collections."
