    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf Coast Back to Business and Homes Act of 2006\". It includes findings related to the Gulf Coast region. Congress finds that 43 percent of businesses that close after a natural disaster never reopen, with an additional 29 percent closing permanently within 2 years. Hurricane Katrina and Rita negatively impacted small businesses in the Gulf Coast, leading to disruptions in commerce. Over 125,000 small and medium-sized businesses in the region were affected by these hurricanes according to the United States Chamber of Commerce. Businesses impacted by Hurricane Katrina are in dire need of increased access to capital and technical assistance to recover and prosper. Without full recovery and prosperity, the Gulf Coast and the rest of the United States will be negatively impacted. The Act defines \"Disaster Area\" as an area affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita, \"major disaster\" as defined in the Stafford Act, and \"small business concern\" as defined in the Small Business Act. It also includes provisions for Small Business Concern Recovery Grants. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to appropriate $100,000,000 for the Economic Development Administration to make grants to State agencies in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas for small businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita in 2005. The funds will be disbursed based on the number of businesses, residents displaced, and jobs lost in each State.
