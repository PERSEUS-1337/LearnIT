    "content": "The Act is titled the \"American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act\". The Congress acknowledges the service and sacrifices of the Armed Forces, including those who have served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Middle East. Americans are urged to honor both living disabled veterans and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Congress authorized the construction of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in 2000. The United States should honor living disabled veterans by issuing a commemorative silver dollar coin, with proceeds going towards the construction of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins in honor of disabled American veterans, with specific weight, diameter, and composition. The coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of the coins will be determined. The design of the coins minted under this Act will be emblematic of the design selected by the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation for the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. Each coin will have a value designation, the year \"2010\" inscribed, and words like \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation and the Commission of Fine Arts. The design of the coins minted under this Act will be emblematic of the design selected by the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation for the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial.
