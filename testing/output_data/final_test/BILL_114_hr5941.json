    "content": "The intended transfer described in subsection (a) will not take effect if Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval under section 3. A special rule applies for transfers near the end of a session of Congress, where if written notice is submitted within a specific timeframe before Congress adjourns, section 3 will apply in the succeeding session of Congress. The intended transfer described in subsection (a) will not take effect if Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval under section 3. An intended transfer must be treated as if notice was submitted to Congress on the 15th session day for the Senate or the 15th legislative day for the House of Representatives in the succeeding session of Congress. If no joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, no inference can be made from Congress's actions or inactions. The Congress's intent regarding a transfer or joint resolution of disapproval is not influenced by Congress's actions or inactions. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL PROCEDURES. The Joint Resolution of Disapproval defines the process for Congress to disapprove an intended transfer. The resolution must be introduced within 60 days of receiving notice of the transfer and states that Congress disapproves the transfer, rendering it ineffective. The resolution is referred to relevant committees in each House of Congress for consideration. In the Senate, if a committee has not reported a joint resolution within 20 days of receiving notice of an intended transfer, the committee can be discharged upon a petition by 30 Senators. The joint resolution will then be placed on the calendar for expedited consideration. The Senate can proceed to consider a joint resolution with waived points of order and limited debate to 10 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. Amendments, postponements, and reconsiderations are not allowed. If agreed to, the joint resolution remains unfinished business until disposed of. In the Senate, after limited debate on a joint resolution, a vote on final passage must occur. Appeals on procedural rules regarding the resolution are decided without debate. The deadline for expedited consideration procedures in the Senate is specified. In the Senate, procedures for considering a joint resolution on intended transfers have specific time limits. If one House receives a joint resolution from the other House, certain coordination procedures apply. The joint resolution described in subsection (a) triggers specific procedures in the House receiving it, where the vote on final passage is on the joint resolution from the other House. This section is enacted by Congress as an exercise of rulemaking authority. The joint resolution described in subsection (a) triggers specific procedures in the House receiving it, superseding other rules only to the extent of inconsistency, while recognizing the constitutional right of each House to change its rules regarding procedures. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Executive agency\" refers to agencies as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code. \"Humanitarian assistance\" includes aid for food, medicine, education, and clothing. \"State sponsor of terrorism\" is a country designated by the Secretary of State for supporting terrorism. The curr_chunk states that a government can be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism if it has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism."
