    "content": "The corporate income tax applies to C corporations, which are taxed separately from their shareholders. This leads to double taxation of corporate profits. In contrast, non-corporate businesses pass their income through to owners, only taxed once at individual income tax rates. The corporate income tax is a tax on corporate profits, calculated as total income minus expenses. Business expenses that can be deducted include employee compensation, depreciation, supplies, advertising, and interest payments. Special deductions, credits, and preferences are also allowed to reduce taxes paid by corporations. The tax liability formula is Taxes = [(Total Income \u2013 Expenses)(1 \u2013 p ) \u00d7 t ] \u2013 Tax Credits, where t is the statutory tax rate and p is the Section 199 production activities deduction. The Section 199 deduction lowers the corporate tax rate for domestic manufacturing activities. The corporate tax system is complex, with a 35% statutory tax rate for most income. Smaller corporations benefit from a rate structure that varies from 15% to 35%. Some small firms incorporate to save on taxes compared to the individual tax system. The corporate tax rate increases above 35% for certain income brackets. The corporate tax system includes \"bubble\" brackets that increase the tax rate for higher-income corporations. The 35% statutory federal tax rate is a point of contention, but the effective tax rate paid by corporations is typically less due to various tax benefits. The effective tax rate paid by corporations is often lower than the statutory rate due to tax benefits such as tax expenditures. Variations in effective tax rates can be attributed to factors like debt financing, depreciation of assets, and overseas operations. The corporate tax system includes incentives like tax expenditures to encourage certain behaviors and assist businesses, resulting in revenue loss for the government. In 2014, corporate tax expenditures totaled $154.4 billion, with the largest being the deferral of active income. In 2014, the largest corporate tax expenditure was the deferral of active income of controlled foreign corporations, resulting in an estimated revenue loss of $83.4 billion. Other top-five corporate tax expenditure provisions included domestic production activities (Section 199), tax deferral on gains from like-kind exchanges, interest on state and local government debt, and tax deferral on installment sales. Additionally, bonus and accelerated depreciation for equipment resulted in a revenue gain of $23.7 billion in 2014, compared to a revenue loss of $13.9 billion in 2013. The 2014 revenue estimate reflects the expiration of bonus depreciation, leading to revenue losses in the early years and gains in the later years. Net operating losses (NOL) allow corporations to offset profits and no tax is due when a company has a NOL. Net operating losses (NOL) can be carried back up to two years to offset taxable income and receive a refund for previously paid taxes. If the loss is too large, it can be carried forward for up to 20 years to reduce future tax liabilities, promoting economic efficiency and reducing investment risk for corporations. The ability to carry back losses reduces risk and promotes economic efficiency for corporations. American corporations with overseas operations are taxed on their worldwide income, known as a worldwide tax system, unlike a territorial system that taxes only income earned within the U.S. Under current tax law, corporations in the United States are subject to a mix of worldwide and territorial tax systems. They can claim a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to other countries but cannot reduce their tax liability below zero. Income earned overseas is not taxed until repatriated, except for certain types of passive income. Dividend distributions to shareholders are taxed at rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% based on their income tax bracket. Taxpayers are taxed on dividends at rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% based on their income tax bracket. Capital gains are taxed at the taxpayer's ordinary income tax rate for short-term gains and at rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% for long-term gains. Additionally, dividend and capital gains income may be subject to a 3.8% net investment income tax. Since 2013, a 3.8% tax is imposed on net investment income or the excess of modified adjusted gross income above a threshold amount. The threshold amounts are $250,000 for joint filers, $200,000 for single filers, and $125,000 for married filers filing separately. Currently, about 6% of businesses are C corporations, a significant decrease from 17% in 1980. This shift is due to legislative changes reducing individual tax rates below corporate rates, increases in S corporation shareholder limits, and LLCs electing partnership tax status. In 1980, C corporations were responsible for nearly 80% of total business income, but today they generate less than half, with the remainder coming from pass-throughs. Despite accounting for only 6% of all businesses, C corporations still generate a disproportionate share of business income. Manufacturing pays the most corporate taxes, followed by wholesale and retail trade. The distribution of corporate taxes paid is uneven, with manufacturing paying the most at 32.3%, followed by wholesale and retail trade at 17%, and finance and insurance at 16%. The top five industries paid 80.9% of taxes, despite accounting for only 33% of all corporations. The top five industries paid 80.9% of taxes, despite accounting for only 33% of all corporations. Wholesale and retail trade industry paid taxes in proportion to their share of corporate firms. Effective tax rates and effective marginal tax rates are used to compare tax burdens across industries. The effective marginal rate is a key measure for assessing the impact of tax rates on investment decisions. Aswath Damodaran's data on effective tax rates for U.S. companies across sectors show that industries with low rates, like biotechnology and semiconductors, are more likely to invest in research and development. Conversely, industries with higher rates, such as retail and food services, tend to have above-average tax burdens. The decline in effective tax rates for large U.S. corporations over time can largely be explained by increased international activity and lower foreign tax rates. Tax expenditures have played a limited role in this change. Economists use effective tax rates to evaluate how the tax system affects incentives for capital investment. Higher effective marginal tax rates indicate the impact of the tax system on investment decisions. The effective marginal tax rate is the real return paid to investors, with higher rates indicating potential investment distortions. Factors like business organization, financing method, and tax expenditure provisions contribute to variations in tax rates. A 2005 study found an overall effective marginal tax rate of 26.3% in the corporate sector. The effective marginal tax rate in the corporate sector is 26.3%, with certain asset types facing rates of 30% or higher. Corporate tax revenues have been declining over the last six decades, reaching 1.6% of GDP in 2013 from a peak of 5.9% in 1952. The corporate tax revenue has decreased significantly over the years, accounting for 9.9% of federal tax revenue in 2013 compared to 32.1% in 1952. This decline can be attributed to factors such as a decrease in the average effective corporate tax rate, the rise of pass-through entities eroding the tax base, and changes in corporate-sector profitability. The erosion of the corporate tax base is due to declining profitability in the corporate sector, caused by shifts in industry volatility, age of corporations, and profit shifting to lower-tax countries. International comparisons of corporate tax rates focus on effective rates rather than statutory rates, as each country's tax system varies. Effective tax rates aim to consider system differences and provide a more accurate representation of the tax burden in each country. When comparing U.S. and worldwide tax rates, it is crucial to use weighted averages to account for the size of economies being compared. This ensures that smaller economies do not disproportionately impact the average international rate. Table 2 compares the tax rates in the United States to other OECD countries, showing that while the U.S. statutory tax rate is higher, the effective tax rates are similar. The weighted effective marginal rate, relevant for investment decisions, is also comparable. Corporate tax revenues in the U.S. are below the OECD average. Corporate tax revenues for OECD member countries in 2011 were 3.0% of GDP on average, with the United States collecting about 2.3% of GDP. The U.S. has consistently collected below the OECD average since 1997, while other countries have remained stable. Reasons for lower U.S. corporate tax revenue include a decline since WWII and base-broadening policies in other countries. Some countries have adopted base-broadening policies to offset declining tax rates, such as reduced investment credits and limitations on interest deductibility. Recent research shows a shift to the corporate sector in some countries, explaining why corporate tax rates have fallen while revenues remain steady. Corporate tax was justified as an excise tax on the privilege of doing business in the corporate form since the Corporate Tax Act of 1909. The new corporate income tax was upheld by the Supreme Court, measuring the privilege of doing business in the corporate form by profits. Economists today do not generally accept the privileged-based rationale for corporate tax, viewing limited liability and pooling of resources as beneficial. The corporate tax system ensures a comprehensive income tax system, preventing corporations from avoiding taxes by retaining earnings. Shareholders benefit when corporations retain earnings over long periods. The corporate tax system benefits shareholders by reducing the present value of the tax burden through delaying payouts. Economists suggest taxing only pure profits or economic rents to avoid efficiency losses, but in practice, taxes are levied on accounting profits. The corporate tax system currently in place does not tax pure profits or economic rents, leading to distortions in economic decision making and potentially reducing overall economic output. One alternative proposed is to directly tax the factors of production within corporations, eliminating the corporate tax and treating all corporations as pass-through entities. However, this approach may still allow for income sheltering through untaxed capital gains. Taxes imposed on corporations are ultimately passed on to individuals connected to the corporations, such as shareholders and workers. The corporate tax burden can be passed on to individuals connected with corporations, including owners, workers, and customers. Recent theoretical studies suggest that labor can bear the majority of the tax burden in an open economy, but empirical evidence tends to support the traditional view that the burden falls mostly on capital. In recent years, economists have used statistical methods to analyze the incidence of the corporate tax. While some studies suggest that labor bears a significant portion of the burden, methodological limitations have raised questions about the reliability of these results. Despite this, traditional theoretical models continue to support the idea that owners of capital bear most of the corporate tax burden. Government agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office, now assume that 75% of the burden falls on capital owners, with the remaining 25% distributed to households based on their labor income. The recent change in corporate tax assumptions allocates 82% of the burden to capital owners and 18% to labor income. This shift has implications for policy analysis, as it affects how the tax burden is distributed across households. Base-broadening, rate-reducing tax reforms would not change this distribution under the new assumption. Under the new methodology, changes in tax rates and deductions may alter how the corporate tax burden is distributed. Metrics like equity and efficiency can help evaluate the impact of corporate tax reforms on the progressivity and economic activity. The corporate tax system's potential distortions in economic activity are examined, with a focus on competitiveness. The ideal tax system should be simple and minimize compliance and administrative costs. Corporate income taxes are found to be highly progressive, with the top 1% paying an average rate of 6.9% and the bottom quintile at 0.7%. In 2010, households in the top earnings quintile paid 78.8% of all corporate taxes, while households in the bottom quintile paid 1.7%. The burden of the corporate income tax is assumed to be 75% borne by owners of capital and 25% allocated to labor income. Treasury estimates suggest that if the entire burden of the corporate income tax were allocated to capital, it would have significant implications. In 2012, the corporate income tax burden allocation to capital affects taxpayers in the highest quintile, ranging from 68.9% to 80.9%. The assumption of how much of the tax burden falls on labor income impacts the progressiveness of the tax system. Economic inefficiencies arise when taxes distort market choices, emphasizing the importance of corporate tax reforms to promote an efficient economy. Tax systems with high rates on broad bases limit economic distortions. Corporate taxes can misallocate capital between sectors, affecting efficiency. Different tax rates on investments can also distort resource allocation. Some tax preferences aim to address market inefficiencies, like R&D incentives for innovation. Tax subsidies for R&D can lead to positive externalities and improve economic efficiency by directing resources to innovation. However, tax preferences that narrow the tax base may require higher rates to maintain federal revenue. It is essential to balance potential economic distortions from higher rates with efficiency gains from tax preferences that enhance economic efficiency. Narrowing the tax base without improving efficiency can reduce overall economic efficiency. The U.S. corporate tax system features varying tax burdens across asset types due to accelerated depreciation rules and the Section 199 production activities deduction. Removing certain provisions like accelerated depreciation may not necessarily improve economic efficiency. Modifying depreciation to be more neutral across assets while reducing the corporate tax rate benefits existing capital but increases the burden on new investments. There is also a tax-induced bias towards debt financing in the system. The corporate tax system has a bias towards debt financing due to the deductibility of interest payments. Policy makers are concerned about rising corporate debt levels and their impact on the economy. Studies show that tax policy influences firms' debt choices, with a one percentage point increase in tax rates leading to higher debt-asset ratios. The distortion caused by this bias is estimated to be less than 5% of corporate tax revenues. Additionally, the differential treatment of domestic and foreign-source income by U.S. multinationals raises further concerns. The economic efficiency of corporate tax policy is influenced by how U.S. multinational corporations allocate resources based on tax policy. If tax rate differentials lead to resource reallocation, it can create economic inefficiencies. However, if capital mobility is limited, efficiency losses may be small. The corporate tax system's design, particularly in taxing economic profits and including the opportunity cost of capital, can impact firms' output decisions and discourage capital formation. The corporate tax acts as a tax on capital, potentially discouraging capital formation in the corporate sector. Economists question the use of \"competitiveness\" as a tax policy objective, advocating for economic efficiency instead. Economic growth is not a zero-sum game, with benefits spilling over to trading partners. Trade between nations can benefit all countries involved. The concept of \"competitiveness\" as a tax policy objective is unclear, with different definitions and policy objectives. Some economists argue that promoting domestic business globally and increasing living standards are flawed measures of competitiveness. The direct policy objective of tax policies in relation to U.S. firms investing abroad or preventing the movement of business operations overseas is not clearly defined. The focus on economic objectives of neutrality and efficiency in tax policy can help maximize output and well-being. Complexity in the tax code leads to increased compliance costs and inefficiencies, disadvantaging taxpayers with limited resources. This complexity may be viewed as unfair or inequitable. Simplifying the tax system can reduce the tax gap and administrative costs. Corporate tax reform aims to lower the top rate and broaden the tax base for revenue neutrality. However, reducing the rate further or narrowing the base may be limited by revenue needs. Some suggest cutting the corporate tax rate below 35% could increase revenue, but a recent report critiqued this claim. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that the corporate tax rate could be reduced to 28% by eliminating corporate tax expenditures, but this may not be revenue neutral over other time frames. Adjusting for timing effects and including deferral, a long-run revenue neutral corporate tax rate of 29.4% is attainable. The corporate tax rate could be further reduced by eliminating all corporate tax expenditures. Other changes such as restricting deductibility of interest and raising additional revenues through the individual income tax system could help pay for the rate reduction. Business activity may return to the corporate sector with a lower tax rate and reforms to the noncorporate sector. Reforms to the corporate tax system, including reducing profit shifting and broadening the tax base, could lead to increased domestic corporate tax revenue. Certain tax expenditures, such as expensing of research and accelerated depreciation, impact investment decisions and could affect output and employment. Removing these expenditures may increase the effective tax rate on capital investment. Designing a revenue-neutral base-broadening corporate tax reform that eliminates certain tax expenditures without raising marginal tax rates on investment leaves limited room for rate reduction. This could result in increased tax burden on some industries while decreasing it for others, such as the computers and electronics industry heavily reliant on research credits. Sullivan (2011) analyzed a hypothetical reform that repealed certain deductions in exchange for a reduced corporate tax rate. Sullivan's analysis suggests that a corporate tax reform reducing rates to 30% would impact industries differently. Industries like securities, insurance, and retail trade would see lower effective tax rates, while sectors like computers and electronics could see an increase. Pass-through businesses may not benefit from rate reductions, and broadening the tax base could have unintended consequences for them. Business-related tax incentives are available to businesses that pay taxes through the individual and corporate income tax system. The current tax treatment of corporate income leads to economic distortions, such as different tax treatment for corporate and non-corporate businesses, incentives for corporations to retain earnings, and a preference for debt over equity financing. Integrating the corporate and individual tax systems could reduce these distortions. One integration approach to reforming the tax system involves eliminating the corporate tax and allocating earnings directly to shareholders, similar to partnerships and S corporations. This could reduce economic distortions and preferences for debt financing. However, integration may lead to reduced federal revenues, requiring consideration of additional revenue-raising options for tax reform. Partnerships and S corporations allocate income to partners and shareholders, similar to eliminating the corporate tax and allocating earnings directly to shareholders. This integration approach raises administrative challenges such as record-keeping and anti-abuse measures to prevent tax sheltering. One proposed approach involves keeping the corporate tax in place but giving shareholders a credit for taxes paid, acting as a withholding tax to address tax sheltering concerns. Allowing corporations to claim a deduction for dividends paid could reduce double taxation of corporate income, but it would not fully eliminate it. This approach may make it more attractive for firms to distribute earnings rather than retain them. However, a dividend deduction does not affect the taxation of capital gains. The Treasury's 1992 report did not recommend a full integration approach due to concerns about administrative complexity. Eliminating taxes on dividends and capital gains for shareholders could reduce double taxation at the corporate level. This would effectively eliminate the double taxation of corporate income. However, this may reduce progressivity in the tax system as higher-income households earn a disproportionate amount of dividend and capital gains income. Reform proposals aim to reduce the gap in taxation between corporate and non-corporate businesses, possibly by subjecting certain pass-throughs to the corporate tax. Taxing large pass-throughs as corporations could improve business tax equity and allocation of resources. This would address concerns over reduced corporate tax revenues and inequities in the tax system. Lower tax rates and reduced business tax disparity may result from this policy change. Taxing large pass-throughs as corporations could improve business tax equity and allocation of resources. An estimated small percentage of S corporations and partnerships could be affected by the corporate tax under certain reforms. The proposed policy change could raise substantial revenue as a significant amount of economic activity is generated by a small percentage of pass-throughs. The current U.S. tax system for taxing American businesses with overseas operations is being questioned by policy makers. It is a hybrid system with features of both worldwide and territorial tax systems. The traditional metric for evaluating international tax systems is how they affect investment location decisions, aiming for equal taxation regardless of where investments are made. In the current U.S. tax system, taxes do not influence where firms invest; they invest where they can get the highest return. Equalizing tax treatment across locations is linked to a worldwide tax system. Proposed reforms include limiting deferral of foreign income and increasing the foreign tax credit limit to prevent income shifting and preserve the tax base. Alternatively, a transition to a territorial tax system could be considered. A transition to a territorial tax system is proposed to help domestic corporations compete in foreign markets by facing the same tax rates as their competitors. However, it may not necessarily enhance economic efficiency and could lead to more investment in low-tax countries. Proponents argue that it could increase corporate repatriations, promoting domestic investment and employment. One proposal to transition to a territorial tax system is by providing a dividend exemption, allowing corporations to repatriate income from foreign subsidiaries with a tax exemption. Another option is a hybrid approach, imposing a minimum tax on foreign-earned income in low-tax countries to discourage sheltering money in tax havens. Some proposals for corporate tax reform include implementing a minimum tax on income earned in low-tax countries and providing a tax credit for taxes paid. Various comprehensive reform proposals have been put forth by economists, lawmakers, and the Obama Administration, as well as the 2010 Fiscal Commission report. Senate Committee Finance Chairman Max Baucus also released tax reform discussion drafts in 2013, including one on international tax reform. The tax reform discussion drafts released by Senate Committee Finance Chairman Max Baucus in 2013 propose taxing passive and highly mobile forms of foreign-earned income at the full U.S. rate. Two alternatives are presented for taxing income earned from products and services sold abroad, with \"Option Y\" subjecting all foreign-earned income to a minimum tax and \"Option Z\" taxing 60% of foreign active business income at the U.S. rate. Undistributed foreign earnings would be subject to a one-time tax at a rate of 20%. Baucus also proposed reforms to cost recovery and accounting rules, including eliminating the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS). The tax reform proposals by Senate Committee Finance Chairman Max Baucus in 2013 include changes to cost recovery and accounting rules, such as eliminating MACRS and implementing new asset pools with longer lives. Intangibles like research and advertising expenses would be capitalized and amortized, while LIFO inventory rules would be repealed. Small-business expensing allowances would be increased, and there are discussion drafts on tax administration and energy tax policy. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp has also released tax reform discussion drafts. Chairman Dave Camp released a tax reform discussion draft in October 2011 focusing on international tax issues. The proposal aimed to shift the U.S. to a territorial tax system by exempting 95% of certain foreign-source income from U.S. tax, including U.S. dividends. Additionally, the draft included a provision to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25% with base-broadening measures to offset the reduction. Chairman Camp's tax reform discussion draft in October 2011 focused on international tax issues, proposing a shift to a territorial tax system. The draft included provisions for exempting certain foreign-source income from U.S. tax and reducing the corporate tax rate to 25%. In addition, discussion drafts related to the tax treatment of financial products and small businesses were released, proposing changes to the tax treatment of financial derivatives and options for small business reform. The small business discussion draft presents two reform options for pass-through entities and non-publicly traded businesses. It includes proposals to increase expensing allowances and allow larger firms to use cash accounting. The Obama Administration's proposal aims to eliminate corporate tax expenditures and reduce the corporate tax rate to 28%. The Administration's proposal includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 28%, enhanced tax incentives for manufacturers, small businesses, research activities, and clean energy. It also seeks to make changes to the international tax system, requiring subsidiaries of U.S. corporations operating abroad to pay a minimum tax on foreign-source income and denying certain deductions for moving business operations abroad. The Bipartisan Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2011 proposes substantial changes to the U.S. corporate tax system. The Wyden-Coats proposal suggests a flat corporate tax rate of 24% and increased expensing allowances for small businesses. It aims to repeal various corporate tax expenditures and make changes to the international tax system, moving towards a worldwide system. In December 2010, the Fiscal Commission proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to 28%, eliminating tax expenditures like the Section 199 deduction, and transitioning to a territorial tax system. Various corporate tax reform proposals aim to lower the current 35% statutory corporate tax rate. The current corporate tax rate is 35%, and there are proposals to reduce it. One suggestion is to offset the revenue cost by eliminating corporate tax expenditures, but there is no consensus on which expenditures to eliminate. There is also debate on how foreign-source income should be treated in a reformed corporate tax system, with some proposing a territorial tax system while others advocate for strengthening the current worldwide system to prevent tax avoidance by U.S. companies through overseas operations."
