    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes the limited supply of water in California and the importance of landscapes for recreation and environmental benefits. It emphasizes the need for water-efficient landscape design and management in accordance with the California Constitution's guidelines on the reasonable use of water. (5) Landscapes planned with a watershed-based approach can improve California's environmental conditions, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and conserve energy, making urban areas resilient to climatic extremes. (6) Supporting soil life by reducing compaction, adding organic matter, and promoting plant growth leads to carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat, and aesthetic benefits. (7) Minimizing energy use through efficient irrigation, reducing petroleum-based fertilizers, and planting climate-appropriate vegetation in urban areas. (8) Water conservation can be achieved by capturing rainwater and graywater, using climate-appropriate plants that require minimal watering. (9) Protect air and water quality by using low-emission equipment, selecting recycled materials, and preventing erosion in landscape design. (10) Preserve existing habitat and create new habitat by choosing native and climate-adapted plants, avoiding invasive species, and using environmentally friendly pest management methods. Implementing stormwater best management practices in landscape and grading design plans can minimize runoff, increase rainwater retention, and improve water quality. The California Water Efficient Landscaping Program aims to promote water conservation, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas reduction, and climate adaptation through funding allocation. The California Water Efficient Landscaping Program aims to encourage water conservation and efficient use of water through economic incentives, greenhouse gas reduction, and support for water inefficient grass replacement by promoting consistent landscape ordinances and the installation of water efficient irrigation systems. The California Water Efficient Landscaping Program includes low-energy, high-efficiency drip irrigation, rain harvesting technology, low-energy graywater infrastructure, water efficiency application systems, and climate-friendly landscape installation with native plants, shade trees, edible plants, and organic soil. The California Water Efficient Landscaping Program includes a residential water inefficient grass replacement rebate program, a jobs program, and public education on landscaping with the watershed approach. The Water Efficient Landscaping Fund is created to provide financial incentives for water efficient landscape improvements and irrigation systems. The California Water Efficient Landscaping Program includes projects for local conservation corps promoting recycled organics, compost, and mulch. This includes protecting green spaces in disadvantaged communities, water-efficient landscape improvements, developing drought-resistant plantscapes for low-income families, and creating community healthy food gardens. The program's administration is outlined in this part. The California Water Efficient Landscaping Program aims to prevent runoff and flooding by designing landscapes with sufficient capture and infiltration capacity. It also emphasizes minimizing impervious surfaces, incorporating pervious surfaces, directing runoff into planting beds for water capture, and utilizing rain harvesting systems like rain gardens and cisterns. The California Water Efficient Landscaping Program promotes various water conservation measures such as rain gardens, infiltration beds, wetlands, and education on efficient water use. It also incentivizes grass replacement programs for disadvantaged communities and low-income families. Equity in reimbursement rates for these programs is prioritized statewide. The California Water Efficient Landscaping Program promotes water conservation measures and incentivizes grass replacement projects for disadvantaged communities. The program prioritizes maximizing greenhouse gas emissions reductions and leveraging local, state, and federal funds. Projects receiving grants must use compost and mulch from recycled organic materials and aid community green spaces at risk from drought and climate impacts."
