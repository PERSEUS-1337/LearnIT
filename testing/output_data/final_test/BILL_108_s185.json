    "content": "The Act titled \"Africa Famine Relief Act of 2003\" provides emergency food aid to Sub-Saharan Africa. Congress finds that Africa poses both promise and opportunity alongside disease, war, and poverty, impacting US values and strategic priorities. The CIA Director also highlights the region's chronic problems as a threat to US interests. The United Nations World Food Programme reports an unprecedented hunger crisis in Africa, with approximately 38 million people facing starvation. The humanitarian crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has grown dramatically, with a 30 percent increase in commodity prices since the budget request for food aid in 2003. A congressional delegation's trip report from Ethiopia and Eritrea emphasized the need for more U.S. Government intervention to prevent a disaster of biblical proportions. The United States and other donors must provide significant food aid to help Ethiopia and other African countries facing food security crises. The assistance is crucial to avert a disaster in sub-Saharan Africa, as highlighted in a United Nations Security Council meeting and a report from the United States Agency for International Development. The HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa has worsened the humanitarian crisis by reducing agricultural productivity and food security, leading to long-term poverty. Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly affected, impacting working adults involved in agricultural production. SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress believes that addressing the famine in sub-Saharan Africa is crucial for national security. The President should request emergency funds for food aid and consult with relevant committees to develop a legislative strategy. The United States should engage in direct talks with other nations to increase contributions to sub-Saharan Africa. SEC. 103 authorizes $600,000,000 for emergency food aid in sub-Saharan Africa, designated as an emergency requirement by Congress. SEC. 104 outlines a strategy for addressing food aid, humanitarian needs, and national security in Sub-Saharan Africa. The President must submit a report within 60 days of this Act's enactment to address humanitarian needs in sub-Saharan Africa, assess the impact on US national security if needs are not met, describe how additional food aid will be provided in coordination with other assistance, and outline plans for food aid and other programs. The report must include plans for providing food aid in sub-Saharan Africa in consultation with NGOs, the number of people at risk of starvation, the amount of food needed, costs, funds committed by the US and other donors for food purchases in fiscal years 2002-2004, and any anticipated funding shortfall. SEC. 105. COORDINATION OF FOOD AID AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. The President is urged to establish a task force to address the humanitarian crisis in sub-Saharan Africa and food insecurity, coordinate programs among different agencies and organizations, and ensure fair distribution of humanitarian assistance. The President is urged to establish a task force to address the humanitarian crisis in sub-Saharan Africa and food insecurity, ensuring assistance is not politicized and maintaining proper oversight. The task force should be established within 60 days after the enactment of this Act, with consultation from key Senate and House leaders and committee members. The President is urged to establish a task force within 60 days to address the humanitarian crisis in sub-Saharan Africa and food insecurity. Additionally, the President shall instruct international organizations to increase food aid and humanitarian assistance for sub-Saharan Africa. Authorization of $200,000,000 for relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction assistance for sub-Saharan Africa in fiscal year 2003. Funds are designated as an emergency requirement.
