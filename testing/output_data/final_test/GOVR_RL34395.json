    "content": "Illegal wildlife trade has reached historic levels, with estimates suggesting a value of $7 billion to $10 billion annually for endangered wildlife products like elephant ivory and rhino horns. This figure does not include illegal logging and fishing, which can add up to $30 billion to $100 billion and $10 billion to $23 billion annually, respectively. Wildlife trafficking is considered one of the top 10 most profitable criminal activities globally, driven by consumer demand and gaps in law enforcement and trade controls. Wildlife trafficking disproportionately impacts developing countries with valuable natural resources due to gaps in management and law enforcement. It is associated with species extinction, disease spread, and invasive species proliferation. Transnational organized crime syndicates are involved for large profits with low detection risk, despite some security measures being ineffective. Operations have become more elaborate and dangerous over time. Trafficking operations have become more elaborate and dangerous, with traffickers using sophisticated hardware like night vision goggles and military-grade weapons. Park rangers have been killed by poachers, and the illicit profits involve complex routes, corrupt officials, and complicit networks. Armed groups in Africa and Asia use natural resources to finance violent activities, with reports alleging involvement of non-state armed groups in biologically diverse areas. Reports indicate that various militant groups, including separatist and Islamist organizations in Africa and South Asia, are involved in wildlife trafficking. There are suspicions of military officers in African countries being complicit in poaching activities. Asian and Eurasian organized crime groups are believed to fund poaching operations and facilitate the illegal movement of wildlife products internationally. The recognition of the serious consequences of wildlife trafficking has led to a reevaluation of current U.S. and international responses, with efforts being made to combat this issue through enhanced diplomatic outreach, public diplomacy campaigns, training, technical assistance, and cooperation to improve natural resource governance. The U.S. intelligence community and government have recognized wildlife trafficking as a major transnational organized crime threat. In March 2013, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified before Congress on the multi-billion dollar illicit trade in wildlife, timber, and marine resources. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13648 in July 2013 to combat wildlife trafficking. Executive Order 13648 on Combating Wildlife Trafficking directed the establishment of a Presidential Task Force, development of a National Strategy, and convening of an Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking. Congress continues to address the illegal wildlife trade through oversight and proposed legislation. Issues for Congress include the status of endangered species in international trade and policy responses to poaching and illicit trafficking. Issues for Congress regarding wildlife trafficking include the utilization of legal tools and authorities, such as military assistance, training programs, and trade agreements, to combat transnational organized crime. The illegal trade of wild animal and plant resources becomes illegal when it violates international commitments or domestic laws, which may prohibit hunting, harvesting, or trading of certain species without proper permits. Illegal wildlife trade involves the illegal export, import, sale, or purchase of certain species without proper permits. It can range from small local bartering to large commercial exports of animal and plant products. Wildlife contraband includes live pets, hunting trophies, fashion accessories, traditional medicine ingredients, bushmeat, and other products. Wildlife poachers and traffickers have no distinct criminal profile, but illicit trade networks often involve local hunters and regional middlemen. The illicit wildlife trade networks involve local hunters, middlemen, criminal entities, global suppliers, and consumers seeking economic gain. Demand exceeds legal supply in China, the United States, and Western Europe, driving up black market prices for endangered wildlife products. Prices have reportedly risen to $90,000 for a live Lear Macaw, $50,000 for rhino horn, $8,000 for a shahtoosh shawl, $1,200 for tiger bones or beluga caviar, and $1,000 for other products. Some organized crime syndicates are heavily involved in illegal wildlife trade, as per U.N. studies. Licit and illicit wildlife is often found mixed with other contraband goods like drugs and weapons in shipments. An example includes Colombian cocaine-filled condoms hidden in a crate of snakes. Illegal wildlife trade often involves mixing valuable wildlife products with narcotics, such as Colombian cocaine-filled condoms hidden in a crate of snakes. This trade can also include elephant tusks stuffed with hashish, exotic parrots smuggled with methamphetamine pills, and abalone exchanged for methamphetamine by street gangs in South Africa. Armed groups, including terrorists and warlords, may be involved in poaching activities for ivory and rhino horn in Africa and South Asia. Other forms of international illegal trade in wildlife include trafficking in elephant ivory, rhino horn, caviar, and bushmeat. International trade in African elephants and their parts has been restricted under CITES since 1989 due to rampant ivory poaching. The decision led to a significant drop in poaching and some African elephant populations began to recover. Currently, there are approximately 420,000 to 650,000 African elephants in 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with the majority concentrated in Southern and Eastern Africa. The growth of forest elephants in Southern Africa has offset declines in Central Africa, but there are indications of increased poaching. Data from the CITES-sponsored project MIKE shows a rise in poaching levels since 2006, with an estimated 17,000 elephants illegally killed in 2011. Early estimates for 2012 suggest over 30,000 African elephants may have been killed by poachers, with an escalation in poaching tactics in Central Africa. Notable incidents, like those in Bouba N'djida National Park in Cameroon, highlight the severity of the situation. Reports of commercial-scale poaching in Bouba N'djida National Park in Cameroon, Garamba National Park in the DRC, and Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 National Park in Gabon raise concerns. Poachers may have ties to African militaries and armed groups like the LRA and Al Shabaab. The LRA is speculated to use ivory poaching for resources, potentially trading ivory for arms and supplies. The illegal ivory trade is increasing, with poachers in DRC's Garamba National Park bartering ivory for arms from Sudanese military personnel. African wildlife rangers have been killed in reprisal attacks. Large-scale ivory seizures are on the rise, indicating involvement of organized criminal syndicates. Law enforcement officials are concerned about the growing number of these seizures. In 2011, there were 13 large-scale seizures of African elephant ivory, potentially from 2,500 elephants. The demand for ivory products in East Asia, particularly in China, has led to increased poaching. Chinese expatriates in Africa are reportedly involved in smuggling, and Asian criminal syndicates may be collaborating with African groups. The survival of all five rhinoceros species is threatened by over-hunting. Five species of rhinoceros are threatened by over-hunting and habitat loss, with three native to Asia and two to Africa. CITES trade prohibitions have been in place since the mid-1970s. Estimates from 2012 show low numbers of Sumatran and Javan rhinos in the wild, with the Vietnamese subspecies of the Javan rhino already extinct. The Indian rhino population is growing modestly due to strict protections. In the early 1900s, fewer than 200 Indian rhinos existed, but conservation efforts have since increased their population. However, illegal rhino horn demand in Asian countries like Vietnam poses a threat, with organized crime syndicates getting involved. African Black rhino population has grown to 4,880 from 2,410 in 1995, while White rhino population is around 20,165 in 2010. South Africa has played a significant role in conservation efforts, but 668 rhinos were illegally killed. Despite strong wildlife management and law enforcement efforts, 668 rhinos were illegally killed in South Africa in 2012, a record high. An additional 488 rhinos were poached in 2013, threatening the sustainability of the African rhino population. Conservation prospects for rhinos in other African sub-regions are also bleak, with a subspecies of the Black rhino in West Africa already extinct. The demand for rhino horn persists, primarily driven by consumers in Asia, despite increased protection measures such as GPS chipping and DNA tracking. The illegal trade of rhino horn is driven by consumers in Asia, where the retail price can reach $20,000 to $30,000 per kilogram. Demand is fueled by traditional remedies and claims that rhino horn can cure cancer. In Yemen, ornate rhino-horn dagger handles are also sought after. More than 4,000 African rhino horns were illegally sold in Asia between 2009 and 2012, totaling 12.6 tons. The structured wildlife crime activity is due to the high black market prices of rhino horn. The illegal rhino horn trade is highly organized, involving criminal groups using sophisticated tools for poaching. Criminal actors also steal rhino horns from various sources. In South Africa, legal trophy hunting is abused to obtain rhino horn for the black market. Sturgeon is prized for its meat and roe, especially Beluga roe. The roe from Beluga, Russian, Stellate, and Ship sturgeons are popular culinary delicacies found in the Caspian and Black Sea basins. Due to overfishing and habitat loss, wild sturgeon populations are declining, leading to high prices for caviar. Poachers, often linked to organized crime, exploit the rarity of prized sturgeon species, with caviar selling for up to $2,000 per kilogram. The global caviar trade is linked with organized criminal groups, incentivizing overfishing and illegal fishing. Major export countries include Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, and others. Russian organized crime controls much of the caviar business, with demand coming from Western Europe, North America, and East Asia. In the late 1990s, 50% of international caviar trade was estimated to be illegal, with potential higher involvement of Russian criminal groups. US investigations in the mid-2000s revealed issues in the caviar trade. In the mid-2000s, investigations into the U.S. caviar trade revealed illegal imports worth millions of dollars annually. Factors like increased prices, high demand exceeding legal quotas, and disrupted fishing regulations led to criminalization in the mid-1990s. Criminal networks emerged post-Soviet Union, engaging in repackaging and false labeling of caviar for profit. Criminal territoriality and protection of trafficking routes were key aspects of the illicit trade. In response to seizures, criminal actors involved in the illegal caviar trade displayed violence by bombing homes of border guards and attacking a coast guard station. International regulations were implemented in 1998 to control sturgeon trade through CITES, allowing legal exports with proper documentation. Some countries have imposed fishing bans and quotas on prized sturgeon species. In the U.S., import of foreign caviar was suspended in 2005 by the FWS. The FWS suspended import of beluga sturgeon caviar and meat from the Black Sea basin in 2005. Bushmeat refers to wildlife harvested for human consumption, including protected species. Overhunting of wildlife in Africa contributes to population declines and biodiversity loss. Unsustainable bushmeat hunting in Africa is a major threat to wildlife, exacerbated by new roads for logging and mining. Central and West Africa consume 1 million metric tons of bushmeat annually, with 5 to 8 million people relying on it for protein. Bushmeat is also popular in Latin America and Southeast Asia, becoming a status symbol in urban and international markets. Globalization and transnational movement drive the trade in bushmeat. International demand for bushmeat is fueled by expatriate immigrant populations, leading to a thriving multi-million dollar illegal enterprise. Public health experts warn that bushmeat smuggling could transmit dangerous pathogens to humans, as 75% of emerging infectious diseases are of zoonotic origin. Confiscated bushmeat samples at US airports from 2008 to 2010 contained pathogens, highlighting the potential risks associated with the trade. The illegal bushmeat trade poses a direct risk of disease transmission to the United States, with confiscated samples containing retroviruses and herpesviruses. Despite international efforts, challenges such as legal gaps and lack of consistency in implementing wildlife trade regulations persist. The lack of consistency in implementing legal frameworks for wildlife trade can be exploited by traffickers. This highlights gaps in political will and international policy consensus on curbing wildlife trafficking, such as the ongoing debate on elephant ivory trade. Capacity and political will gaps persist even when there is a willingness to address the issue. Some governments face capability gaps in addressing wildlife trafficking, including lack of personnel, expertise, training, funding, and equipment. Poachers often have more resources and firepower than park rangers, making it challenging to protect wildlife. Responses to wildlife crime may require specialized law enforcement and justice sector expertise. Regulating international wildlife trade has become more complex and resource-intensive due to the increasing number of protected species and scientific criteria for species identification. The illegal wildlife trade thrives due to complex socioeconomic and political conditions like conflict, corruption, and poverty. Efforts to address this issue include global policies to regulate exports of endangered species and domestic, bilateral, regional, and global conservation initiatives. Global efforts support international goals of sustainable conservation, resource management, and enforcement of laws. The main mechanism for controlling wildlife trade is the 1975 CITES, which restricts trade for thousands of species based on their risk of extinction. The Secretariat recommends suspending trade with countries violating CITES commitments. 178 governments, including the United States, have committed to CITES. Various international and regional initiatives focus on combating wildlife crime. The United States addresses international illegal wildlife trade through domestic enforcement and laws, as well as foreign policy. Efforts to combat wildlife trafficking include sharing law enforcement information, building capacity among enforcement officials, and adopting high-level international statements. Key laws involved are the Lacey Act of 1900, Lacey Act Amendments of 1981, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Increased awareness of wildlife trafficking is a growing global concern. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13648 on Combating Wildlife Trafficking in response to the escalating international crisis of wildlife trafficking. The order aims to assist foreign governments, enforce wildlife trafficking laws, and collaborate with the international community to address this illicit activity. The Executive Order aims to combat wildlife trafficking by collaborating with international partners, reducing demand for illegal wildlife trade, and establishing a Presidential Task Force and Advisory Council. The Obama Administration announced $10 million in anti-poaching training and assistance, with $3 million each to South Africa and Kenya, and $4 million for other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. In November 2012, a renewed effort to combat wildlife trafficking was unveiled, including enhanced diplomatic outreach and public diplomacy campaigns to reduce demand for illegal wildlife products. The Obama Administration announced $10 million in anti-poaching training and assistance to combat wildlife trafficking. This includes international training, technical assistance, and cooperation to enhance wildlife law enforcement capabilities. The U.S. intelligence community has been tasked with providing an intelligence assessment on the national security consequences of illegal wildlife crime. This evaluation may clarify links between wildlife crime, political instability, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, corruption, and illicit finance. Key agencies involved in combating illegal wildlife crime include the Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the State Department, and USAID. FWS has domestic and international responsibilities, while the State Department and USAID lead intergovernmental initiatives and provide foreign assistance for biodiversity conservation. Other agencies are also involved in border enforcement and federal prosecutions of wildlife crimes. The Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) plays a key role in combating wildlife crime, both domestically and internationally. FWS is responsible for implementing CITES provisions in the United States and conducts wildlife trade demand reduction campaigns. They maintain special agents, wildlife inspectors, and a forensics laboratory to support wildlife crime investigations. FWS is seeking approval and funding to deploy special agents to U.S. State Department embassy missions overseas to combat international wildlife trafficking. FWS provides international technical assistance and capacity building to combat wildlife trafficking in Asia, Africa, and South America. They deploy special agents to countries like Thailand and Tanzania, administer conservation funds for endangered species, and focus on key regions for conservation efforts. Wildlife Without Borders initiatives focus on environmental protection in key regions like Africa, the Western Hemisphere, Mexico, Russia, and China, with a specific emphasis on combating wildlife trafficking. Projects funded through various conservation funds support law enforcement capacity building and anti-poaching efforts in countries like Thailand and Indonesia. The Conservation Fund, Wildlife Without Borders, supported projects in Asia and Africa to combat poaching of species like orangutans, gibbons, and rhinos. Donor funding from USAID, State Department, and Millennium Challenge Corporation, along with international organizations, helps implement the International Technical Assistance Program for endangered species conservation and wildlife law enforcement. Congress authorizes FWS to receive aid funds for the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) to address biodiversity and conservation goals in the Congo Basin. CARPE funds support wildlife authorities in Central Africa to investigate and prosecute wildlife crimes. The State Department supports intergovernmental and public diplomacy initiatives. The State Department supports various initiatives related to wildlife trafficking, including the Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking (CAWT) and international rewards programs for apprehending criminal figures. The Department also contributes to international organizations like CITES, UNODC, and the World Bank. The Rewards Program Update and Technical Corrections Act of 2012 expanded the program to include transnational criminal figures, potentially involved in wildlife trafficking. Bilateral foreign assistance for biodiversity, conservation, and law enforcement is administered by the State Department and USAID through various funding accounts. Additional funding is provided for police training, including programs on wildlife crime issues at International Law Enforcement Academies. USAID provides funding for addressing wildlife's role in new pathogen spread and supports wildlife enforcement networks. Initiatives like ARREST aim to combat endangered species trafficking and strengthen regional cooperation. U.S. aid funds also contribute to wildlife conservation efforts. USAID supports wildlife conservation and anti-trafficking efforts in Central America and the Dominican Republic. The State Department and USAID have initiatives like CAWEN and W-TRAPS to combat wildlife trafficking and enhance regional cooperation. Hillary Clinton called for a global system of regional wildlife enforcement networks, with USAID proposing a Technology Challenge on Wildlife Trafficking to develop innovative solutions. USAID, in collaboration with FWS, works towards biodiversity and conservation goals in the Congo Basin through the CARPE program. The U.S. Congress has enacted laws to combat international wildlife trafficking, appropriate funding for conservation programs, and dismantle wildlife trafficking operations. The 113th Congress is actively involved in addressing the illegal wildlife trade through oversight and proposed legislation. The 113th Congress is addressing the illegal wildlife trade through oversight and proposed legislation. Some argue it could be a national security issue due to links with militant groups and terrorists. Hillary Clinton requested a threat assessment in 2012 to determine if wildlife trafficking threatens U.S. national security interests. Debates continue on the potential role of the U.S. military in combating wildlife crimes. Some warn of risks in militarizing conservation programs, while others seek U.S. military support for anti-poaching efforts. In 2013, the National Defense Authorization Act discussed this issue. Recommendations include withholding military aid from governments involved in wildlife trafficking. The U.S. and Peru pushed for wildlife trafficking to be classified as a \"serious crime\" at the U.N. CCPCJ, aiming to improve legal assistance and response to wildlife crimes. In practice, many question if wildlife trafficking is considered a serious crime by governments, despite UNTOC's definition. Wildlife trafficking convictions often do not result in significant penalties. The Pelly Amendment has been used to sanction countries involved in endangered species trade. Advocates urge the U.S. to designate Vietnam under the Pelly Amendment for rhino product trade. Sanctions under the Pelly Amendment for endangered species trade have only been imposed once by the President. The Pelly Amendment has been used to sanction countries for endangered species trade, with sanctions imposed only once in 1994 against Taiwan for rhino horn and tiger parts trade. Some policymakers view the tool as too severe, while others advocate for expanding punitive measures against non-cooperative governments. The U.S. Trade Representative has addressed criticisms through mechanisms like the 2007 Bipartisan Trade Deal and the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. Members of Congress may continue to monitor environmental provisions in trade agreements. Members of Congress may monitor environmental provisions in trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and potential agreements with Europe. Financial tools are available to track stolen assets and combat transnational organized crime, but are rarely used to combat wildlife trafficking. Departments of State, Justice, and Defense, along with FWS, are involved in these efforts. The U.S. government has rewards programs managed by various departments to combat wildlife trafficking and transnational organized crime. The newest addition is the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program, created to address criminal activities like trafficking in illicit wildlife and wildlife parts. The U.S. government has rewards programs to combat wildlife trafficking and transnational organized crime, including the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program. However, it is unclear how effectively these programs are used to convict wildlife traffickers. Wildlife crime initiatives are often bundled with broader environmental projects in funding reports to Congress, making it difficult to assess resource allocation. Budget constraints have limited U.S. agencies' ability to address wildlife crime, prompting requests for additional funding for new positions overseas. The U.S. government is considering creating new officer positions at U.S. embassies overseas to coordinate wildlife crime investigations and address training deficiencies. Efforts to post FWS agents abroad have been hindered by lack of priority and resources. President Obama directed FWS to station a representative in Tanzania following an Executive Order on wildlife trafficking. The number of CITES-protected species has increased by over 75% in the last 20 years. The 2008 Lacey Act amendments expanded FWS mandate to cover a wider range of plant species. The expanded FWS mandate now covers all plant and plant products exported in violation of foreign law, raising concerns about enforcement. The report explores international wildlife trafficking involving various species and discusses policy responses, including commitments under CITES and the Obama Administration's Executive Order on Combating Wildlife Trafficking. The July 2013 Executive Order on Combating Wildlife Trafficking addresses the escalating exploitation of protected wildlife by organized illicit actors. Policy challenges persist regarding the effectiveness of current responses, utilization of legal tools, and the need for new programs and resources."
