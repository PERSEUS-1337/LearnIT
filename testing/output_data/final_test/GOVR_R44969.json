    "content": "The Supreme Court has established Congress's \"plenary power\" to regulate immigration, allowing laws that discriminate against aliens based on ethnicity, gender, legitimacy, and political belief. This power is most potent in the admission and exclusion of nonresident aliens abroad. The Supreme Court has established Congress's \"plenary power\" to regulate immigration, allowing laws that discriminate against aliens based on ethnicity, gender, legitimacy, and political belief. The only limitation on Congress's power to exclude aliens concerns lawful permanent residents (LPRs), who generally cannot be denied entry without a fair hearing. Despite scholarly criticism, the Court continues to rely on the plenary power doctrine in immigration cases, with some arguing that its applicability is being narrowed. The Constitution does not mention immigration explicitly. The Constitution does not explicitly mention immigration but the Supreme Court has attributed federal immigration power to Congress's enumerated powers over naturalization and foreign commerce. The Court also recognizes the federal government's inherent sovereign authority to control its borders and relations with foreign nations, giving Congress broad authority to restrict the entry of nonresident aliens. The executive branch, by extension, possesses broad authority to enforce immigration laws. The executive branch has broad authority to enforce laws on alien entry with limited judicial review. Litigation over President Trump's executive orders restricting entry from Muslim countries and refugees has led to lower court injunctions. The Supreme Court is reviewing decisions upholding these injunctions. The Supreme Court partially stayed nationwide injunctions against the revised executive order on the \"Travel Ban\" litigation, allowing implementation pending litigation outcome. The Court's decision could define the President's power to exclude aliens, but threshold issues like mootness and standing may prevent a final ruling. This report outlines legislative and executive powers regarding alien exclusion. The report discusses the legal principle that nonresident aliens outside the US cannot challenge their exclusion. It also analyzes how the constitutional and statutory rights of US citizens limit the exclusion power. The report applies Supreme Court immigration jurisprudence to claims against the President's revised executive order in the \"Travel Ban\" litigation. Case law focuses on whether the rights of US citizens limit the government's actions regarding alien exclusion. The Supreme Court established that nonresident aliens outside the US have no legal grounds to challenge their exclusion, based on a series of cases from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. The Court consistently upheld the government's right to exclude foreigners, rendering aliens' claims for entry review powerless. The Supreme Court has established that nonresident aliens have no legal grounds to challenge their exclusion, based on past cases where the Court upheld the government's right to exclude foreigners. This doctrine extends to consular nonreviewability, preventing judicial review of visa denials. The consular nonreviewability doctrine prevents nonresident aliens denied visas from challenging the denial in federal court. The Supreme Court has never officially endorsed the doctrine by name but has stated that nonresident aliens cannot challenge visa denials. This rule also applies to nonresident aliens located outside the United States who cannot challenge their exclusion from the country in federal court. Arriving alien cases involve individuals stranded at the nation's border, raising issues beyond entry denial. The Constitution's protection for arriving aliens from prolonged detention is debated, but statutory safeguards exist. Judicial review is available for arriving aliens challenging detention or interdiction, unlike for visa denial cases. Congress has broad exclusion power, as seen in expedited removal procedures for arriving aliens created in 1996. The exclusion power created expedited removal procedures for arriving aliens in 1996, limiting judicial review. This power applies mainly to aliens applying to enter from abroad, isolating entry denial issues. The Travel Ban cases involve the exclusion of aliens located far from the nation's shores. Nonresident aliens cannot challenge entry denials, but U.S. citizens can challenge violations of rights. The Supreme Court's modern exclusion jurisprudence focuses on cases where U.S. citizens challenge an alien's exclusion. The government only needs to provide a \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" reason for exclusion to prevail against a citizen's claim of constitutional rights violation. Key cases include Kleindienst v. Mandel, Fiallo v. Bell, and Kerry v. Din. The Supreme Court's exclusion jurisprudence focuses on cases where U.S. citizens challenge an alien's exclusion. In 1972, the Court dealt with a case involving American professors claiming that the exclusion of a Belgian intellectual violated their First Amendment rights. The professors had invited him to speak at their universities, but a provision of the INA made him ineligible for a visa due to his communist beliefs. The INA made an alien ineligible for a visa due to communist beliefs. The Attorney General could waive this ineligibility, but declined to do so. The Supreme Court upheld the exclusion, stating that when the Executive exercises power negatively for a legitimate reason, courts will not question it. The Court upheld Mandel's exclusion based on the government's explanation of visa abuse. Despite dissenting opinions, the majority accepted the government's justification without further inquiry. The \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" standard resolved the dilemma in immigration jurisprudence. The American professors raised a First Amendment claim, but relief was not granted by the Court. The Court upheld Mandel's exclusion based on the government's explanation of visa abuse, using the \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" standard. This standard protected Congress's power to exclude aliens by limiting the reach of the American professors' First Amendment claim. The professors were not entitled to balance their rights against the government's exclusion power, only to a constitutionally valid statement for the exclusion. The Court did not grant relief on the professors' First Amendment claim. The Court upheld Mandel's exclusion based on a \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" justification, reinforcing the government's power to exclude aliens even in the face of constitutional challenges. In subsequent cases, the Court has followed this precedent, granting special immigration preferences based on gender and legitimacy, but leaving room for future challenges. The Fiallo Court upheld a statute restricting preferences for children or fathers of U.S. citizens, citing Congress's broad power over immigration. The Court did not provide a concrete justification for the statute but suggested it aimed to combat visa fraud or emphasize family ties. This decision followed the precedent set in Mandel, allowing limited review to prevent interference with the government's exclusion powers. In Kerry v. Din, the Court rejected a U.S. citizen's claim that the Department of State violated her due process rights by denying her husband's visa application without sufficient explanation. State cited terrorism-related ineligibility but did not disclose the basis of its decision. Justice Scalia concluded that Din did not have a protected liberty interest in her husband's ability to immigrate. Justice Kennedy rejected the claim under the \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason\" test. In Kerry v. Din, Justice Kennedy applied the \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason\" test to the visa denial, stating that citing the statutory provision for exclusion suffices as a legitimate reason. However, he added a caveat that bad faith must be shown for the \"bona fide\" prong. In Kerry v. Din, Justice Kennedy applied the \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason\" test to the visa denial, stating that citing the statutory provision for exclusion suffices as a legitimate reason. However, he added a caveat that bad faith must be shown for the \"bona fide\" prong. Absent an affirmative showing of bad faith on the part of the consular officer who denied Berashk a visa, Mandel instructs us not to \"look behind\" the Government's exclusion for additional factual details. Justice Kennedy assumes the government has a valid basis for exclusion unless an affirmative showing suggests otherwise. In Kerry v. Din, Justice Kennedy applied the \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason\" test to the visa denial, stating that citing the statutory provision for exclusion suffices as a legitimate reason. The mention of a bad faith exception in the Travel Ban cases hedges against the absolutism of Mandel's instruction not to examine the government's factual basis for excluding an alien. Congress's power to impose limitations on alien entry is considered valid, and executive enforcement of those limitations is also deemed valid. The Mandel decision accepted Congress's power to impose entry limitations based on political beliefs, without deciding if it violated the First Amendment. This raises questions about the extent of Congress's immigration power. The plenary power doctrine raises questions about the scope of Congress's immigration power, suggesting that it can override constitutional limitations, such as First Amendment principles. This challenges the traditional notion of judicial deference in reviewing immigration policies. The Fiallo case examined the constitutionality of a statute on immigration law, which discriminated based on gender and legitimacy. The Court's reasoning was unclear, wavering between suggesting limits to legislative power and describing it as absolute. The awkward application of the Mandel test, used for reviewing executive action, in a case reviewing legislative action, contributed to this lack of clarity. Ultimately, the Fiallo Court cited the Mandel test in its decision. The Fiallo Court upheld a statute under a version of rational basis review, implying a constitutional limitation against legislative unreasonableness. Some scholars argue for stricter scrutiny on admission laws classifying aliens, but this is not supported by Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court has never suggested that laws regulating the admission of nonresident aliens trigger anything more than deferential rational basis review. In Sessions v. Morales-Santana, heightened constitutional scrutiny was applied to strike down a derivative citizenship statute using gender classifications, distinguishing it from Fiallo. Fiallo and the plenary power doctrine focus on citizenship, not immigration. Morales-Santana does not signal a reevaluation of Fiallo. Courts interpret Fiallo to require laws regulating alien admission to be reasonable. The Supreme Court has not adopted stricter review of such laws. Mandel's test governs exclusion decisions violating constitutional rights. The Executive must provide a legitimate reason for exclusion. The Executive must provide a legitimate reason for exclusion based on statutory grounds, and may need to disclose factual basis if bad faith is shown by the challenger. Unresolved issues include the extent of the Executive's exclusion power, challenges to exclusion on statutory grounds by U.S. citizens, and constitutional limits on broad delegations of power for exclusion determinations. The Supreme Court has determined that the authority to exclude aliens comes solely from congressional action, not from inherent power. The Executive's immigration power comes from congressional action, not inherent power. Courts cannot determine ownership of the power by reading the Constitution. While the Executive has inherent authority to exclude aliens, it typically acts upon congressional direction in immigration matters. Supreme Court precedent assigns the immigration power to Congress. The weight of Supreme Court precedent assigns immigration power to Congress rather than the Executive. Cases like Din and Mandel highlight that executive exclusion power is derived from legislative enactment, making the Executive's decision to exclude an alien susceptible to challenge on statutory grounds. Lower courts have rejected visa denials based on statutory grounds, not applying Mandel's deferential test. The courts have closely analyzed the government's justifications for excluding aliens, with limited guidance from Supreme Court precedent on statutory claims by U.S. citizens challenging exclusion decisions. While Mandel and Din focused narrowly on constitutional claims by U.S. citizens, the Supreme Court has not expressly endorsed statutory challenges to visa denials or exclusion decisions concerning aliens outside the United States. In Sale v. Haitian Centers Council and Jean v. Nelson, the Supreme Court reviewed statutory and regulatory issues related to exclusion decisions concerning aliens outside the United States, specifically regarding interdiction and forced return of Haitian migrants and denial of immigration parole to arrivals from Haiti. The Court considered whether these actions violated relevant provisions before returning aliens to their place of origin. The Supreme Court reviewed statutory and regulatory issues related to exclusion decisions concerning aliens in the government's control. A certain level of statutory analysis may be inherent in judicial consideration of constitutional claims against exclusion decisions. The doctrine of constitutional avoidance is used to avoid serious constitutional questions through reasonable construction of statutes or regulations. The Court invoked this doctrine in the exclusion context to ensure returning LPRs could not be denied entry without a hearing. The Supreme Court reviewed statutory and regulatory issues related to exclusion decisions concerning aliens in the government's control. Courts may need to consider statutory arguments against exclusion decisions to some extent, especially when constitutional claims are raised. The question remains on the standard of review for statutory arguments and the limitations the Constitution imposes on the Executive's implementation of congressional exclusion authority. Justice Kennedy concluded that Congress's power to exclude aliens is plenary, raising questions on the government's justifications for exclusion. The Supreme Court discussed the plenary power of Congress to exclude aliens and the constitutional restrictions faced by the Executive when Congress transfers exclusion power. Justice Kennedy raised questions about the limitations on the Executive's implementation of exclusion authority. The Court analyzed whether the Attorney General violated the First Amendment by denying a waiver based on political ideas. This suggests that the First Amendment could potentially limit the Attorney General's actions. The case of Mandel suggests that the First Amendment could potentially limit the Executive's exclusion choices, unlike Congress's plenary power over such matters. It also implies that the reasonableness requirement for legislative action would extend to executive implementation of exclusion authority. President Trump's \"Travel Ban\" is a notable example of this. President Trump issued the \"Travel Ban\" through two executive orders, with the second one (EO-2) narrowing the scope in response to a court decision. The orders rely on Section 212(f) of the INA to suspend entry of aliens deemed harmful to US interests, primarily aimed at preventing terrorist acts. EO-2 temporarily barred entry of certain classes of aliens located outside the US. EO-2 imposed temporary bars on entry for foreign nationals from six countries and refugees, aiming to reduce administrative burdens on executive agencies. Plaintiffs argue that the true purpose of the order is to exclude Muslims, violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and exceeding the President's statutory authority. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear cases challenging the entry restrictions of Executive Order 2, which were upheld by the Fourth and Ninth Circuits. The Court limited the injunctions to allow the government to apply the restrictions to aliens without a \"bona fide relationship\" to a person or entity within the US. The Supreme Court limited the injunctions on Executive Order 2's entry restrictions to aliens with a \"bona fide relationship\" to a person or entity in the US. A subsequent proclamation by the President modified the restrictions, adding Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela to the list of affected countries and making the restrictions indefinite. The President's proclamation added Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela to the list of affected countries with entry restrictions. The Supreme Court will consider if the Travel Ban cases are moot due to the proclamation. The litigation reaffirms distinctions between LPRs and other aliens in immigration jurisprudence. The President's proclamation expanded the list of affected countries with entry restrictions to include Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela. The litigation surrounding the Travel Ban cases highlighted the impact of the exclusion power on aliens in the United States and abroad. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that EO-1's applicability to LPRs and other aliens already present likely violated due process, leading to revisions in EO-2 to address these concerns. The government revised its entry restrictions in response to the Ninth Circuit decision, focusing on nonresident aliens outside the US without valid visas. Due process issues for LPRs and physically present nonresident aliens were largely resolved in the EO-2 challenges. Litigation has been shaped by the rule that nonresident aliens abroad cannot challenge their exclusion in federal court, with plaintiffs including states, US organizations, citizens, and LPRs, but not excluded nonresident aliens themselves. The Supreme Court's opinion on the \"bona fide relationship\" test in response to the Travel Ban cases has raised the issue of whether plaintiffs have standing to sue over EO-2's entry restrictions. The U.S. government argues that plaintiffs lack standing because they do not assert violations of their own rights. The standing issue in the Travel Ban cases revolves around whether U.S. citizen and LPR plaintiffs with relatives in the listed countries have standing based on potential familial separation. The government argues that plaintiffs lack standing as EO-2 affects them indirectly. The contested nature of standing highlights the challenges faced by plaintiffs in asserting claims under Mandel against exclusion orders that do not directly apply to them. The Supreme Court upheld relief for nonresident aliens with a \"bona fide relationship\" in the Travel Ban litigation, balancing government and plaintiffs' interests. The Court's decision did not address the merits of the entry restrictions but provided an interim measure. The Fourth Circuit and multiple district courts applied the Establishment Clause to hold that the executive branch's exclusion of nonresident aliens abroad violated the First Amendment. The Fourth Circuit and district courts applied the Establishment Clause to rule that EO-2 likely violates it by excluding Muslims. The Supreme Court could resolve the claim without considering immigration context. Mandel and Din guide courts to limit constitutional inquiry on executive decisions to exclude aliens. The Establishment Clause jurisprudence allows for closer scrutiny of government actions unrelated to immigration, rejecting secular justifications in favor of evidence of religious motives. In the Travel Ban cases, plaintiffs rely on campaign statements as evidence of anti-Muslim animus behind EO-2. The government argues that judicial searches for government purpose in campaign discourse are not condoned, maintaining that EO-2 survives a stricter level of review than Mandel requires. The Supreme Court's decision on Establishment Clause principles, without addressing Mandel, aligns with previous efforts to narrow pronouncements on political branches' power to exclude aliens. The analysis below examines the Establishment Clause claim against EO-2 under the Court's exclusion jurisprudence, focusing on whether the Mandel standard applies, permits consideration of government purpose evidence beyond EO-2's text, and if anti-Muslim animus evidence demonstrates a violation. The Court has applied Mandel's standard to various constitutional claims, including free speech. The constitutionality of EO-2 under the Establishment Clause hinges on whether the government has provided a \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" justification for the order. While some argue that Mandel only applies to individual visa denials, others point to Fiallo's reliance on Mandel in upholding a gender-discriminatory immigration statute. The Establishment Clause claim regarding immigration policy is being analyzed in relation to the Mandel standard of review. Some argue that the Establishment Clause imposes structural limitations on government actions, while others believe it protects individual rights. The argument is that religiously discriminatory exclusion policies violate the Establishment Clause regardless of whether they target aliens or citizens. The argument suggests that religiously discriminatory exclusion policies violate the Establishment Clause, regardless of where the government displays its religious preferences. The Supreme Court has not directly applied Mandel to an Establishment Clause claim, leaving room for closer constitutional scrutiny in cases like EO-2. This could potentially distinguish previous cases and highlight the structural nature of the Establishment Clause guarantee. The Establishment Clause claim against EO-2 raises the question of whether evidence of the President's purpose beyond the order itself can be considered. Most courts have found that EO-2 does not have an expressly discriminatory purpose, as it targets countries with terrorism ties rather than Muslims. However, plaintiffs argue that extrinsic evidence suggests religious discrimination was considered during the presidential campaign. The courts have relied on extrinsic evidence to determine that EO-2 likely violates the Establishment Clause. The strength of the claim under Mandel depends on the scope of reviewable evidence. Mandel and Din suggest limiting review to the face of EO-2, similar to not looking behind the Executive's stated reason for excluding an alien in Mandel. Just as the Court declined to scrutinize the Attorney General's explanation in Mandel, the argument is to not probe the express purpose of EO-2. The Fourth Circuit decision on EO-2 focused on the \"bona fide\" prong of the Mandel test, concluding that there is evidence suggesting a bad-faith pretext for religious discrimination, which allows courts to set aside deference to the government's stated purpose. The Fourth Circuit decision on EO-2 shifts to a higher level of constitutional scrutiny when bad faith is shown, considering historical context and specific events leading to the order's passage, including statements made by then-candidate Donald Trump. The approach to the \"bona fide\" prong has been criticized as circular by dissenting judges and the government. The analysis finds support in Justice Kennedy's statement in Din that courts should not look beyond the government's proffer \"absent an affirmative showing of bad faith.\" Consideration of campaign statements and extrinsic evidence of EO-2's purpose would exceed the scope of review in Mandel and Din, where the Court did not probe the government's justifications for excluding aliens. The Travel Ban cases raise allegations of religious animus, with courts questioning the government's justifications for excluding aliens. The Supreme Court has yet to clarify the \"bona fide\" prong of the Mandel test in this context. The scope of review may depend on whether a bad faith exception exists to Mandel's rule against looking behind the government's justifications, and if the Travel Ban case facts trigger this exception. The government does not argue for the exclusion of aliens based on religion, leading some courts to find the Travel Ban in violation of the Establishment Clause. The Travel Ban cases involve allegations of religious animus, with courts questioning the government's justifications for excluding aliens. The order has been challenged for potentially violating the Establishment Clause, with courts generally holding that it does. In a case where extrinsic evidence was considered but ruled in the government's favor, it was still suggested that the order could violate the Establishment Clause if it had a discriminatory purpose. This contrasts with the Mandel case, where the assumption was that Congress had the power to exclude aliens based on political belief. The executive branch argued for similar exclusion authority based on political belief or any reason. The Mandel Court used the \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" standard to avoid addressing this issue. The Mandel Court adopted the \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" standard to avoid addressing the contention about the scope of exclusion power. In both Mandel and the Travel Ban cases, the executive branch's contentions differ regarding the power to exclude aliens based on political belief or religion. The Supreme Court is unlikely to address the underlying question about the limits of executive power in both cases. The Supreme Court is unlikely to directly address whether the executive branch can exclude aliens based on religion in the Travel Ban cases. The statutory arguments against EO-2 focus on the President's authority to exclude aliens under the INA. Lower courts have found EO-2 likely unlawful based on these arguments. The appropriate standard of review is a key issue the Supreme Court may face in addressing the statutory challenges. The statutory and constitutional claims against EO-2 may not operate entirely independently of each other. The Supreme Court's approach to the Establishment Clause claim raised against EO-2 may influence the Court's resolution of the statutory claims. If serious doubts about EO-2's constitutionality arise, the Court might assess whether it violates underlying statutes before striking it down. The Ninth Circuit and Fourth Circuit took different approaches in addressing this issue. Three principal arguments in the Travel Ban litigation suggest EO-2 exceeds the President's statutory authority. The President's authority under INA \u00a7 212(f) was not properly invoked in EO-2, as it lacks an adequate finding that the entry of the barred aliens would be detrimental. Additionally, EO-2's exclusion of citizens from six countries violates INA \u00a7 202(a)(1)(A) which prohibits nationality-based discrimination in immigrant visa issuance. The reduction in the refugee cap from 110,000 to 50,000 in FY2017 also violates INA \u00a7 207. The argument is that the President must find entry of a class of aliens \"detrimental\" to invoke exclusion authority under INA \u00a7 212(f). EO-2 tries to meet this prerequisite by citing terrorist organizations and instability in restricted countries. The Ninth Circuit and some Fourth Circuit opinions found these justifications inadequate, as EO-2 fails to show a direct link between nationality and propensity for terrorism. The government argues that the Ninth Circuit did not defer to the President's national security determinations in rejecting the justifications for the entry restrictions in EO-2. The second argument focuses on how EO-2 violates the INA by denying entry based on nationality to prospective immigrants from the six restricted countries. The Ninth Circuit rejected the government's argument that the entry restrictions in EO-2 were justified for national security reasons. It also found that EO-2 violated the INA by denying entry to prospective immigrants from the six restricted countries based on nationality. The third argument focused on how EO-2's reduction in refugee admissions violated specific provisions in the INA. The court concluded that both \u00a7 202(a)(1)(A) and \u00a7 207 limit the President's authority under \u00a7 212(f) because they were enacted after and are more specific than \u00a7 212(f). The Ninth Circuit found that EO-2's denial of entry to immigrants based on nationality does not violate the INA. The government argues that \u00a7 212(f) can harmonize with other statutes, as \u00a7 202(a)(1)(A) does not restrict entry denials and \u00a7 207 does not limit the President's ability to set refugee admissions mid-year. The unresolved question is whether courts should defer to the statutory arguments against EO-2. The Ninth Circuit found that EO-2's denial of entry to immigrants based on nationality does not violate the INA. The unresolved question is whether courts should defer to the President's evidentiary basis for invoking his exclusion authority under INA \u00a7 212(f) and what standard of deference should apply. The Establishment Clause claims have clear answers under existing case law, but the standard of review for U.S. person or entity claims against the exclusion of an alien remains unclear. The Ninth Circuit did not apply the \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" standard of review from Mandel to its analysis of the statutory claims against EO-2. The Ninth Circuit applied a strict standard of review to the government's justifications for Executive Order 2, finding that the broad classification of nationality to exclude aliens did not sufficiently match the justification to prevent terrorist acts. This analysis resembles strict judicial scrutiny and demands more from the government's justification than previous cases. Challenges to an alien's exclusion should receive heightened scrutiny of government justifications, especially when the Executive invokes statutory authority. The government argues for judicial deference to national security concerns underlying Executive Order 2, but the Supreme Court has not endorsed a specific standard of review yet. The Supreme Court has not endorsed a specific standard of review for challenges to exclusion. The Travel Ban cases focus on the Executive's power to deny entry to aliens abroad, specifically excluding aliens physically outside the US. These cases could lead to a landmark statement on the political branches' immigration power. If the plaintiffs win, it would represent a judicial check on executive immigration power. The decision could limit the exclusion of nonresident aliens based on Establishment Clause rights. On the other hand, if the government wins, it would reaffirm the Executive's power to deny entry to nonresident aliens. The Supreme Court may not decide if EO-2 exceeds the President's power. It could dismiss appeals as moot, reject claims for lack of standing, or decide on narrow grounds without defining the Executive's power boundaries. This approach mirrors past exclusion cases involving U.S. citizens' rights. The Supreme Court may not decide on the merits of the Travel Ban cases, potentially leaving the June 26 per curiam decision as a unique example of judicial involvement in exclusion decisions. However, this decision does not address the claims against EO-2 and is unlikely to change how courts review challenges to the exclusion of nonresident aliens in the future."
