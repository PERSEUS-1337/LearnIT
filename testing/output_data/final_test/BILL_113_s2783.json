    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Value Based Insurance Design for Better Care Act of 2014\" or the \"VBID for Better Care Act of 2014\". Congress finds that patient-level financial barriers for high-value medical services can reduce their use, leading to increased total medical expenditures. Research shows that reducing out-of-pocket expenses for these services can improve health outcomes and financial consequences. Value-Based Insurance Design aims to reduce financial barriers for high-value prescription medications and clinical services by adjusting patient out-of-pocket costs based on clinical value, not just cost. This approach recognizes the varying clinical benefits of different services and medications. The current copayment and coinsurance design for prescription medications and clinical services under Medicare does not consider the value differences in health outcomes. Implementing Value-Based Insurance Design methodologies in Medicare will improve patient-centered health outcomes and use taxpayer dollars more efficiently. The Demonstration Program outlined in Section 3 aims to implement Value-Based Insurance Design methodologies in Medicare to improve patient-centered health outcomes and use taxpayer dollars more efficiently. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a 3-year demonstration program to test value-based insurance design in eligible Medicare Advantage plans. At least two MA regions will be selected for the program. The Secretary will establish a 3-year demonstration program to test value-based insurance design in eligible Medicare Advantage plans. The program will start after at least two plans are approved in one MA region. Eligible plans must meet specific requirements. The Secretary will establish a 3-year demonstration program to test value-based insurance design in eligible Medicare Advantage plans. Eligible plans must have a quality rating of 4 stars or higher and meet specific requirements, including multi-year approval for specialized MA plans for special needs individuals. Value-Based Insurance Design Methodologies are defined as a methodology for identifying specific prescription medications and clinical services reimbursable under Medicare, where copayments or coinsurance should be reduced or eliminated for certain populations. The Medicare Advantage organization must use value-based insurance design methodologies to identify prescription medications and clinical services where copayments or coinsurance should be reduced or eliminated for specific chronic clinical conditions. The Medicare Advantage organization must use value-based insurance design to identify prescription medications and clinical services for specific chronic clinical conditions of MA eligible individuals. This may include reducing or eliminating copayments or coinsurance for evidence-based management of these conditions to encourage the use of such services. The Medicare Advantage organization must use value-based insurance design to identify prescription medications and clinical services for specific chronic clinical conditions of MA eligible individuals. This includes reducing or eliminating copayments or coinsurance for evidence-based management of these conditions to encourage the use of such services. Additionally, participating Medicare Advantage plans in the demonstration program are prohibited from increasing copayments or coinsurance for any covered item or service to discourage their use. The Secretary must report to Congress on the implementation status of the demonstration program within 1 year of its start. The report should list medications and services for eligible Medicare Advantage plans in the first plan year, including copayment or coinsurance amounts for each identified medication or service. The curr_chunk provides details on the copayment or coinsurance amounts required for medications or services under a plan for a specific year, including reductions from the previous year. It also includes information on copayment or coinsurance amounts for providers identified in the plan. The Secretary will contract an independent entity to assess the implementation of the demonstration program, focusing on the utilization of value-based insurance design methodologies by Medicare Advantage plans and the impact of reducing copayments or coinsurance on medication adherence and service utilization. The demonstration program aims to assess the impact of value-based insurance design methodologies on Medicare Advantage plans. It includes analyzing cost differences for participating plans, the effects of reducing copayments for providers on quality metrics and health outcomes, and evaluating each identified provider individually. The demonstration program evaluates cost disparities between Medicare Advantage plans participating and not participating in the program. The entity conducting the assessment must submit a report to the Secretary for inclusion in the overall report to Congress within 3 years. The Secretary will report to Congress within 3 years on the review and assessment of the demonstration program, including results and recommendations for improving methodologies to reduce copayments and coinsurance for Medicare Advantage plans. The Secretary will expand the demonstration program to improve copayments and coinsurance for Medicare beneficiaries and enhance the quality of healthcare services provided under such plans. This expansion will be implemented permanently unless it increases Medicare expenditures or decreases the quality of care. The Secretary has the authority to waive provisions of the Social Security Act to carry out a demonstration program aimed at improving copayments and coinsurance for Medicare beneficiaries. Funding for the program will be transferred from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund as determined appropriate by the Secretary."
