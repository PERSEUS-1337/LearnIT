Congress finds that wetland and tidal marshes in the Chesapeake Bay and other coastal States provide cultural, economic, and ecological benefits to the United States. The South American nutria is causing substantial marsh loss in Maryland and Louisiana. The Nutria Eradication and Control Act of 2003 authorized successful eradication efforts in Maryland. The Coastwide Nutria Control Program, authorized by Law 108-16, has significantly reduced nutria-impacted wetland acres in Louisiana. Techniques developed under the Nutria Eradication and Control Act of 2003 are successfully eradicating nutria in Maryland and reducing impacted wetland acres in Louisiana. This Act aims to provide financial assistance to several states for nutria eradication programs. The Coastwide Nutria Control Program, authorized by Law 108-16, has reduced nutria-impacted wetland acres in Louisiana. Maryland, Louisiana, Delaware, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington are carrying out activities to eradicate or control nutria and restore nutria-damaged wetlands. SEC. 3.
