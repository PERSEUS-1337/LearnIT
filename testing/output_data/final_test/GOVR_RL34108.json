    "content": "The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) eliminates tariffs and barriers in goods and services trade between the United States and Peru. Negotiations were concluded in December 2005, and the agreement was signed on April 12, 2006. The U.S. Congress approved the agreement in 2007, and President Bush signed the implementing bill on December 14, 2007. In Peru, the agreement was approved by the Peruvian Congress with a vote of 79 to 14. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) was approved by the Peruvian Congress with a vote of 79 to 14 on June 28, 2006. President Bush implemented the agreement on February 1, 2009, after negotiations began in May 2004. After negotiations began in May 2004, the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) was approved by the Peruvian Congress on June 28, 2006. In early 2007, Members of Congress sought to strengthen certain provisions related to core labor standards. By May 10, 2007, a bipartisan trade framework was agreed upon, including core labor and environmental standards in trade agreements. On June 25, 2007, the U.S. and Peru reached an agreement on legally binding amendments to the PTPA. Peru's Congress approved the amendments on June 27, 2007 with a vote of 70 to 38. On June 27, 2007, Peru's Congress approved amendments to the PTPA with a vote of 70 to 38. House Democratic leaders expressed support for the agreement, highlighting its potential to improve living standards in the US and Peru. They also called for changes in Peruvian laws to facilitate the agreement's implementation. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel planned to lead a delegation to Peru and Panama in August 2007 for further consultations. Chairman Charles B. Rangel and House Trade Subcommittee Chairman Sander M. Levin expressed concerns about provisions in the PTPA passed by the Peruvian Congress that were inconsistent with their commitments. They urged the U.S. Trade Representative to resolve these issues before certifying the agreement. Other Members of Congress supported the agreement, stating it would remove trade barriers and open new markets for U.S. exports. U.S. Trade Representative Susan C. Schwab noted that the Bush Administration had worked closely with Peru to ensure both parties met their obligations. Peru, with a population of 29 million, has a relatively small economy compared to the U.S. GDP. The economy has shown strong growth in recent years, driven by domestic demand. Real GDP growth rates were 7.7% in 2006 and 8.9% in 2007, with a forecasted slowdown to 3.1% in 2009. Peru's exports accounted for 28% of GDP in 2007, with the U.S. being its top export market. The United States is Peru's top export market, accounting for 19% of exports in 2007. Despite a decrease in exports to the U.S. since 2005, any change in demand could impact Peru's economy. China is the second significant trade partner, with Brazil, Switzerland, Ecuador, and Japan also important. Peru ranks 41st in U.S. export markets and 44th in imports. In 2007, Peru's top export market was the United States, with significant exports of copper, petroleum, and silver. U.S. imports from Peru increased significantly over ten years, reaching $5.21 billion in 2007. The U.S. trade balance with Peru shifted from a surplus to a deficit, with U.S. exports increasing by 41.8% and imports decreasing by 11.7% in 2007. Peru's export growth to the United States has boosted economic growth and strengthened the Peruvian currency. Before the PTPA, Peru imposed tariffs ranging from 4% to 20% on most U.S. imports, with an average rate of 10%. The government also had a 5% tariff surcharge on agricultural goods. Non-tariff barriers were mostly eliminated, but some U.S. products were banned, such as used clothing, shoes, tires, remanufactured goods, cars over five years old, and heavy trucks. Peru's export growth to the United States has strengthened its economy. The PTPA eliminated most non-tariff barriers, but some U.S. products like used shoes, tires, and cars over five years old were still restricted. U.S. industry was concerned about Peru's weak penalties for intellectual property rights violations. Peru's laws restricted foreign investment in media ownership, land near borders, and employment of foreign workers. The United States granted duty-free treatment to imports from Peru under the ATPA. Title II of P.L. 102-182 enacted on December 4, 1991, authorized duty-free treatment for certain products from Andean countries to promote economic growth and discourage dependence on illegal drugs. The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA; Title XXXI of P.L. 107-210) expanded trade preferences to include additional products and granted duty-free treatment to U.S. imports of certain apparel articles. The 110th Congress extended ATPA and ATPDEA trade preferences for Colombia and Peru until December 31, 2009. In 2007, 58% of U.S. imports from Peru received preferential duty treatment under ATPA, leading to a rapid increase in imports. U.S. total imports from Peru increased by 167% between 2002 and 2007, with ATPA imports increasing by 690%. Rising prices of mineral and energy-related imports also contributed to the import value increase. The ATPA and ATPDEA trade preferences have provided significant economic benefits to Peru, especially in the textiles, apparel, and agricultural industries. Peru's textile and apparel sector saw a 25% increase in exports in 2004, with 150,000 workers directly employed and 350,000 workers indirectly employed. Peru has become the world's largest exporter of asparagus and paprika, with the agricultural sector also benefiting under the ATPDEA. Investment in imported machinery for Peru's agricultural sector rose 79% in 2004. Peru's strong GDP growth was attributed to increased access to the U.S. market. Concerns were raised about the expiration dates of trade preferences affecting foreign direct investment. U.S. FDI in Peru totaled $6.81 billion in 2007, with mining accounting for the largest portion. In 2007, U.S. FDI in Peru totaled $6.81 billion, with mining accounting for 68% of the total amount. There were disputes between U.S. investors and the Peruvian government, mostly resolved through arbitration. Concerns were raised about the lack of resources and impartiality in Peru's executive branch ministries and regulatory agencies. Peru's President Alan Garc\u00eda, elected for a second term in 2006, faces challenges of high poverty and unemployment rates. Despite economic growth, over half of Peruvians live in poverty, with unemployment and underemployment at 64.5%. President Garc\u00eda aims to assure the international financial community of his moderate leadership approach. President Alan Garc\u00eda is working to assure the financial community that he is governing Peru moderately, contrasting with his leftist past. His first presidency was marked by hyperinflation and poverty, while a violent insurgency occurred in the 1980s. Former President Alberto Fujimori implemented economic reforms to stabilize the economy and combat terrorism. President Alejandro Toledo (2001-2006) implemented economic reforms in Peru, including price controls, privatization, and labor law relaxation. Despite public protests and scandals, his administration promoted economic growth, with GDP increasing from 0.2% in 2001 to 8.0% in 2006. President Garc\u00eda has continued the pro-market economic policies of his predecessor, President Alejandro Toledo, with Peru's GDP growth rate increasing from 0.2% in 2001 to 8.0% in 2006. Garc\u00eda has shifted towards a more moderate stance, appointing a fiscal conservative as finance minister, cutting government worker pay, and pledging austerity measures to address the needs of both the business sector and poor citizens. He has also embraced the PTPA to strengthen relations with the United States. President Garc\u00eda has initiated internal reforms to spread the benefits of free trade to poorer regions in Peru and reduce poverty levels. The comprehensive free trade agreement aims to eliminate tariffs and barriers to goods and services, with over half of Peru's population living below the poverty line. Amendments to the agreement reflect a bipartisan trade framework agreed upon by Congress and the Bush Administration in June 2007. The bipartisan trade framework agreed upon by Congress and the Bush Administration in June 2007 aims to eliminate tariffs on 80% of U.S. exports to Peru, with an additional 7% receiving duty-free treatment within five years. The agreement would also make preferential duty treatment for U.S. imports from Peru permanent, particularly in agricultural products like beef, cotton, wheat, and soybeans. Tariffs on most remaining agricultural products would be phased out within 15 years. The trade agreement between the US and Peru aims to eliminate tariffs on 80% of US exports to Peru, with an additional 7% receiving duty-free treatment within five years. In textiles and apparel, products meeting the rules of origin requirements would get duty-free treatment immediately. The agreement includes provisions for a \"de minimis\" provision allowing limited third-country content in apparel, a textile safeguard for temporary tariff relief, and customs procedures for transparency and efficiency. In the trade agreement between the US and Peru, U.S. companies would have non-discriminatory rights to bid on government procurement contracts from Peruvian entities. Peru would grant market access to U.S. firms in various services sectors, including telecommunications, financial services, and tourism. The trade agreement between the US and Peru grants non-discriminatory rights to U.S. companies for government procurement contracts in various services sectors, including telecommunications, financial services, and tourism. Peru agreed to exceed its commitments in the WTO, dismantle barriers, and ensure regulatory transparency in market access to services. The agreement also includes investment provisions for nondiscrimination and transparency in domestic regulatory regimes. The trade agreement between the US and Peru includes investment provisions to establish a secure legal framework for U.S. investors in Peru. It grants investors equal rights to operate investments, backed by international arbitration. Intellectual property rights protections for U.S. companies are also included, with provisions for trademarks, copyrights, patents, and penalties on piracy and counterfeiting. The trade agreement includes penalties for piracy and counterfeiting, with dispute settlement provisions for core obligations like labor and environmental provisions. An enforcement mechanism with monetary penalties ensures compliance with commercial, labor, and environmental obligations. Labor obligations require parties to enforce their domestic laws, with amended agreements reflecting bipartisan trade frameworks. The amended agreement under the bipartisan trade framework includes labor obligations subject to dispute settlement and enforcement mechanisms. Failure to pay monetary assessments could lead to trade benefits suspension. Emphasis is on promoting compliance through consultation and trade-enhancing remedies, with procedural guarantees for fair access to labor tribunals. Environmental obligations are enforceable through dispute settlement procedures, requiring effective enforcement of domestic laws by the United States and Peru. The PTPA includes an environmental cooperation agreement to establish capacity building and an Environmental Cooperation Commission in Peru. Both countries must commit to high levels of environmental protection, recognize the importance of biodiversity, and ensure procedural guarantees for environmental protection. The agreement also includes provisions for public participation, benchmarking environmental cooperation activities, and enhancing support for multilateral environmental agreements. Amendments to the PTPA were signed on June 25, 2007, by the U.S. Ambassador to Peru and the Peruvian Foreign Commerce and Tourism Minister. The amendments to the pending PTPA, based on the agreement between the Bush Administration and Congress, include obligations related to ILO labor rights, MEAs, and pharmaceutical IPR. These provisions are enforceable through the dispute settlement mechanism, requiring the US and Peru to adopt and enforce internationally-recognized labor standards. The pending PTPA amendments include obligations on ILO labor rights and MEAs, enforceable through dispute settlement. Parties must effectively enforce domestic environmental laws and fulfill obligations under covered MEAs. Labor provisions cannot be derogated in a way that affects trade or investment. The environment chapter of the pending PTPA amendments includes obligations under covered MEAs, with a focus on forest sector governance, illegal logging, and wildlife trade. Additional amendments cover generic medicines and government procurement, with provisions for data exclusivity and expedited drug approval. The PTPA amendments include provisions for data exclusivity and expedited drug approval, allowing generic medicines to enter the market more quickly in Peru. The agreement also allows U.S. governments to condition contracts on adherence to ILO labor standards. The net economic effect on the U.S. is expected to be small due to Peru's relatively small economy and the limited value of U.S. trade with Peru. The value of U.S. trade with Peru is small, accounting for about 0.3% of total U.S. trade. Trade liberalization from the PTPA would mainly benefit Peru by removing tariff barriers. U.S. exporters face higher tariff barriers than Peruvian exporters. A USITC study estimates that U.S. imports from Peru would increase by $439 million and exports to Peru by $1.1 billion, leading to a $2.1 billion increase in U.S. GDP. The report estimates that the PTPA would impact U.S. sectors like metals, crops, and paddy rice, with potential reductions in output, revenue, or employment. Specific industries could see job losses, with gains in wheat production but declines in metals, rice, and miscellaneous crops. Some argue that U.S. exports could harm subsistence farmers in Peru. Trade creation is a factor to consider with the PTPA. The PTPA may lead to trade diversion as it may not include all regional trading partners, resulting in countries shifting purchases to higher-cost producers. This could impact sectors like metals, crops, and paddy rice in the U.S. Labor provisions have been a controversial aspect of the agreement. Labor provisions in the PTPA have been a point of contention. Supporters argue that Peru has ratified all ILO core labor standards and that the agreement would strengthen Peru's recent labor reforms. Critics believe that Peru needs to adopt new labor laws and enforce existing ones. Some Members of Congress have called for stronger labor requirements, including enforceable ILO core labor standards in the agreement. The House Ways and Means Committee announced Democratic Trade Principles for bipartisan consensus on trade, including ILO labor standards in agreements. A \"New Trade Policy for America\" was agreed upon in 2007, incorporating key Democratic priorities on labor. The policy includes enforceable provisions on ILO core labor standards and prohibits partner countries from weakening these standards for trade or investment. The PTPA language addresses concerns about including enforceable ILO core labor standards in trade agreements by restricting provisions to trade-related matters and incorporating only the principles of the four basic ILO rights. This aims to prevent challenges to the U.S. labor code by trading partners. The PTPA includes controversial issues regarding patent protection and access to medicines, with concerns about stronger intellectual property rights potentially limiting access to affordable drugs. Data exclusivity terms could delay generic drug entry into the market in Peru and increase medicine prices. The PTPA includes controversial issues regarding patent protection and access to medicines, with concerns about stronger intellectual property rights potentially limiting access to affordable drugs. Amendments to the text of the PTPA on data exclusivity in Peru could shorten the timeline for allowing generic medicines into the market, affecting the availability of generic pharmaceuticals and potentially limiting access to affordable drugs. The PTPA raised concerns about limiting access to essential medicines in Peru, with NGOs arguing that the agreement's provisions exceeded international standards. The pharmaceutical industry refuted claims that patents hinder access, stating that most essential medicines are off-patent and can be legally copied by generic manufacturers worldwide. However, generic copies of these products are still not reaching the poorest populations. The pharmaceutical industry argues that patent protection is necessary for innovative medicines. Concerns about illegal logging in Peru and the impact of the PTPA on exports to the US are raised by environmental groups. The US is a major consumer of wood products, and some believe its demand drives illegal logging in Latin America. Environmental provisions in the PTPA require countries to enforce domestic laws and address complaints about environmental violations. In early 2007, Members of Congress pushed for stronger environmental provisions in the Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA). The agreement was amended in June 2007 to include requirements for Peru to enforce laws on logging Mahogany and for countries to implement Multilateral Environmental Agreements. Annex 18.3.4 of the PTPA focuses on forest sector governance and dispute settlement related to environmental issues. Protection measures for mahogany are mentioned in line with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) includes provisions for enforcing laws on logging Mahogany and implementing Multilateral Environmental Agreements. The agreement requires an export permit from Peru to validate sustainable harvesting practices of mahogany entering the United States. However, concerns have been raised about illegal harvesting practices and insufficient monitoring by Peru. Recently, the Native Federation of Madre de Dios (FENAMAD) partnered with the Natural Resource Defense Council to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government and timber importers for inadequate enforcement measures. The U.S. Court of International Trade dismissed a complaint by U.S. timber importers regarding the authorization of trade in bigleaf mahogany from Peru. The importers were pleased with the decision, stating the lawsuit mischaracterized international trade regulations. The Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) aims to provide legal protections for U.S. investors in Peru, potentially leading to a larger timber industry. Critics argue that the environmental provisions in the PTPA are weak and illegal logging should be addressed more specifically. FENAMAD and U.S. environmental groups urged Congress to include provisions in the PTPA to prevent illegal mahogany imports. Peru prioritized passing the PTPA, with President Garc\u00eda meeting President Bush to discuss the agreement. President Garc\u00eda emphasized the importance of the agreement for Peru's growth and social development. The Bush Administration supported free trade with Peru, emphasizing mutual benefits in strengthening ties, creating jobs, and reducing poverty. President Bush urged Congress to approve the PTPA by August 2007, despite concerns from House Democratic leaders about Peru's labor and environmental laws. The Peruvian government passed the PTPA in 2007 to strengthen worker rights, with strong support from Members of Congress. President Alan Garc\u00eda emphasized the importance of trade relations with the U.S. to fight poverty and improve equality. Renewal or passage of the PTPA was crucial for Peru's exports to the U.S. to avoid higher duties. The ATPA supporters believe the program has positively impacted the region by increasing investor confidence, creating jobs, and preventing organized crime. Peruvian policymakers stress the importance of maintaining confidence in trade with the U.S. In the U.S., groups like AFL-CIO and Public Citizen are skeptical of free trade agreements, arguing they erode environmental and workers' rights. Public Citizen criticized the bipartisan agreement on the PTPA, stating it benefits multinational corporations at the expense of U.S. jobs. Public Citizen criticized the bipartisan agreement on the PTPA, stating it did not go far enough to protect people's rights and could undermine access to essential services in Peru and Panama. The provisions on trade in services and foreign investment could limit government regulation of services like education and healthcare, potentially hindering their distribution. The business community, including the National Association of Manufacturers, supports the U.S.-Peru FTA. In 2009, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) welcomed the implementation of the PTPA agreement with Peru. NAM expressed satisfaction that 80% of Peru's tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods would immediately disappear, with the rest to follow in phases. NAM planned to work with the Commerce Department to help U.S. companies take advantage of the newly-opened Peruvian market."
