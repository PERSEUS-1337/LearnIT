Congress finds that North Korea conducted multiple nuclear tests in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 1718. The resolution demanded North Korea to cease nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches, retract its withdrawal from the NPT, and return to the treaty. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 requires North Korea to suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program, abandon nuclear weapons and programs, comply with NPT and IAEA safeguards, and provide transparency measures to the IAEA. North Korea must comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, which mandates the abandonment of all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a verifiable manner. Member States are required to prevent transfers of items that could contribute to North Korea's prohibited programs. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 mandates the prevention of transfers related to North Korea's weapons of mass destruction programs, including military equipment, technology, and luxury goods. It also requires Member States to freeze funds and assets of individuals or entities supporting these programs. On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted a second nuclear test, leading to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 on June 12, 2009. The resolution demanded North Korea to abandon all nuclear weapons and programs, authorized Member States to seize illicit items related to its weapons programs, and banned arms exports to North Korea. On December 12, 2012, the United Nations Security Council resolution banned arms exports to North Korea and imposed restrictions on financial services and fuel supplies for vessels carrying nuclear-related materials. On December 12, 2012, North Korea launched a long-range missile that violated UN Security Council resolutions. Resolution 2087 condemned the launch and demanded North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The Security Council expressed determination to take action in response to any further DPRK launch or nuclear test. The leadership transition to Kim Jong-Un has introduced uncertainties, while human rights conditions in North Korea remain deplorable with thousands imprisoned in gulags and refugees vulnerable. The findings in various human rights acts from 2004, 2008, and 2012 are still accurate today. The Government of North Korea has a history of military cooperation with Iran dating back to the 1980s. Their latest actions pose a direct threat to the United States and its allies. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that North Korea's nuclear tests and missile launches are clear violations of UN sanctions, and all UN Member States should enforce sanctions and censure North Korea. The Government of North Korea should abandon its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, comply with UN resolutions, and face sanctions until it stops threatening global peace. The US should push for new UN sanctions. The United Nations Security Council sanctions involve identifying North Korean and foreign entities suspected of violating resolutions and enforcing necessary measures. Member States should strengthen efforts to prevent the transfer of military and dual-use technologies to North Korea. Enhanced vigilance and monitoring of activities are also recommended. The United States Government should explore appropriate measures by the United States Armed Forces in the Asia-Pacific region, including in partnership with the armed forces of others countries in the region, to safeguard the national interests, security, and livelihood of the United States. The United States Government should secure the agreement of the United Nations Human Rights Council and General Assembly to adopt recommendations for investigating North Korea's human rights violations and potential crimes against humanity. The Secretary of State is required to submit a report to Congress by May 15, 2013, on US policy towards North Korea, including weapons programs and human rights abuses. The report should also include recommendations for legislative or administrative actions. This Act is not an authorization for the use of force against North Korea."
