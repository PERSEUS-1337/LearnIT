    "content": "The Act titled \"Save Our Communities from Risky Trains Act of 2016\" enhances security measures for shipments of security-sensitive material. The Secretary of Transportation must issue regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment to enhance security measures for shipments of security-sensitive material. Security sensitive material is designated based on the risk it poses to national security, considering specific quantities and forms of materials. The Secretary of Transportation must issue regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment to enhance security measures for shipments of security-sensitive material. This includes shipments of explosives, poisonous materials, hazardous materials in bulk packaging, and select agents or toxins regulated by the CDC. Railroad carriers transporting security sensitive material must compile commodity data by route and storage pattern within 90 days after each calendar year. The data should include the geographic location, total number of shipments by United Nations identification number, and storage patterns along the route. Railroad carriers transporting security sensitive material must submit an annual analysis of security risks for transportation routes and storage patterns to the Secretary. This includes assessing risks for routes, railroad facilities, storage facilities, and areas of concern. Additionally, carriers must provide a report on practical alternative routes before the end of each calendar year. Railroad carriers must submit an annual security risk assessment for transportation routes and storage patterns to the Secretary. This includes describing alternative routes, conducting a security risk assessment for each alternative route, and comparing risks to the primary rail transportation route. Carriers should also consider interchange agreements and track systems availability. Railroad carriers must consider interchange agreements and track systems availability when determining practical alternate routes for transporting security sensitive material to avoid areas of concern. An alternate route may be deemed impractical if the shipment originates in or is destined for the area of concern, or if there would be no harm beyond the carrier's property in the event of a terrorist attack. The railroad carrier must select an alternative route and storage pattern for security sensitive material within 90 days of submitting a report. They should choose the route that best reduces the risk of a terrorist attack or derailment. Additionally, carriers must conduct a comprehensive review every 5 years to assess operational changes and security measures. During a 5-year period, any changes affecting the security of transporting security sensitive materials must be reported. Definitions include \"area of concern\" as designated regions, \"railroad carrier\" as defined in title 49, and \"security sensitive material\" as determined materials. The term \"storage pattern\" refers to the conditions of storing security sensitive material, including location, type of storage, types and numbers of cars stored, population density, duration of storage, and security measures in place. The term \"terrorism\" is defined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002."
