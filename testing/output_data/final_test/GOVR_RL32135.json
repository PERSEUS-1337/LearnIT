    "content": "Most Americans prioritize health care for themselves and their children. Lack of health insurance can lead to unmet health needs, lower preventive services, avoidable hospitalizations, costly emergency room visits, and limited doctor familiarity with medical history. Early and frequent monitoring of children's health is crucial for their proper growth. Health insurance reduces parental stress. Medical child support helps noncustodial parents provide private health insurance for their children, making them responsible and reducing taxpayer burden. Since 1977, Congress has implemented measures to make noncustodial parents responsible for their children's healthcare costs, shifting the burden from taxpayers. Mandatory assignment of child support rights to states was established in 1984 to reimburse Medicaid costs. Additionally, efforts have been made to increase private health insurance coverage for children of noncustodial parents with access to employer-related or group health insurance. This aims to reduce taxpayer burden by holding noncustodial parents accountable. In 1984, federal law mandated state Child Support Enforcement agencies to include medical support in child support orders if health care coverage is available to noncustodial parents at a reasonable cost. A 1993 amendment to ERISA required employer-sponsored group health plans to provide coverage for children of divorced, separated, or never-married parents as ordered by the state CSE agency. The 1996 welfare reform law further strengthened medical support by requiring all orders enforced by the CSE agency to include a provision for health care coverage and notifying noncustodial parents' employers of their medical child support obligation. The National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) is a standardized form created in 1998 to help obtain health care coverage for children. It must be used by all state Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agencies and is considered a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" that must be honored by the noncustodial parent's employer's group health plan. Efforts to improve medical child support should be considered in the context of high health care costs, a decline in employer-provided health insurance coverage, and a large number of uninsured children. The report discusses the importance of establishing and enforcing medical support in the Child Support Enforcement program to promote family responsibility, improve children's access to healthcare, and save federal and state dollars. It highlights the challenges faced when cash support and medical support are not always compatible, and the potential impact on custodial parents and uninsured children. The legislative history of medical support provisions in the CSE program mandates that child support orders include provisions for health care coverage of dependent children by the noncustodial parent. This includes payment for medical, dental, and other health care expenses, as well as health insurance costs. States can establish child support orders, including medical child support orders, for the parent's dependent children. States can establish child support orders through judicial or administrative processes. State CSE agencies can enforce medical support, reimbursed at a 66% rate. Medical support can include health insurance, premium payments, or reimbursement for medical bills. Congress acknowledges the need to strengthen medical support enforcement activities. Congress recognized the importance of strengthening medical support enforcement activities in the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The program aims to increase noncustodial parents' health insurance coverage for their dependent children, leading to cost savings for states and the federal government by reducing Medicaid expenditures. Federal regulations require CSE agencies to petition the court for families who have assigned their medical support rights to the state or applied for CSE services. The CSE agency must petition the court to include health insurance in child support orders, establish criteria for cases with potential medical support, and consider evidence of available health insurance at reasonable cost. The CSE agency must petition the court to modify child support orders to include health insurance coverage for dependent children, provide information on the secured health insurance policy, and inform the Medicaid agency of any new or modified child support orders that include medical support. The CSE agency must enforce health insurance coverage required by support orders, communicate with Medicaid agency for lapses in coverage, and request notification of lapses from employers. A medical child support order must include participant and child information, as well as a description of health coverage provided. The NMSN is a standardized federal form used by state CSE agencies to issue medical support orders to employers. It must be honored by the noncustodial parent's employer's group health plan. Cash child support collections may include medical support and are distributed in various ways. Total child support collections for FY2001 were reported. In FY2001, child support collections were distributed as follows: 87.7% to families, 5.3% to states, 4.7% to the federal government, 1.8% as incentive payments to states, and 0.5% as medical support. Medical support is either assigned to the state for Medicaid distribution or forwarded to the family. Health insurance is preferred for medical support due to cost-effectiveness and coverage benefits. In FY2001, medical support orders were issued in the form of health insurance in 93% of cases. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 emphasized the use of private medical insurance for all families. State CSE agencies notify employers of noncustodial parents to provide health care coverage for children. The employer must determine if family health care coverage is available for dependent children and notify the plan administrator. If eligible, the plan administrator enrolls the children in a plan and informs the noncustodial parent's employer of the premium to be withheld. Data from various sources show the need for improvement in establishing and enforcing medical support laws. The U.S. Census Bureau collects national survey data on child support, highlighting issues such as children not receiving support or health insurance from noncustodial parents. The data assesses noncustodial parents' performance in providing financial and medical support for single-parent families in the United States. The Census data provides comprehensive information on child support payments, including health insurance coverage. From 1989-1999, the percentage of child support awards with health insurance increased from 40.1% to 55.6%. However, there are concerns about the actual enforcement of health insurance provisions. During 1989-1999, the percentage of child support awards including health insurance provided by the father decreased from 67.6% to 48.9%. In 1999, only 49% of custodial mothers received health benefits for their children. The percentage of cases where health insurance was required remained relatively flat. The percentage of child support awards including health insurance provided by the father remained relatively unchanged from 1989 to 1999, fluctuating between 26.1% and 29.1%. Despite some improvements in the requirement for health insurance provision, actual coverage for children living with custodial mothers did not significantly increase during this period. In 1999, only 49% of custodial mothers received health benefits for their children. The table shows that 56% of mothers have health insurance included in their child support award. However, the probability of health insurance coverage is lower for never-married, black, Hispanic, and less educated women. The impact of medical support provisions on children in single-parent families with medical coverage in their child support orders is noted. In FY2001, 49% of child support orders included health insurance coverage, up from 35% in FY1991. Despite progress, many children still lack health insurance. P.L. 105-200 mandated a report to Congress on integrating medical support indicators with performance-based incentives for the Child Support Enforcement program. The Medical Support Incentive Work Group recommended a medical support system in 2000. The Medical Support Incentive Work Group recommended in 2000 to delay a medical support performance measure due to lack of historical information. Three data elements suggested by the group are now part of the data-reporting form OCSE-157. In FY2001, only 49% of child support orders included health insurance coverage. In FY2001, health insurance coverage in child support orders varied widely by state, ranging from 100% in South Carolina to 2.1% in the District of Columbia. Only 18% of health insurance orders resulted in actual benefits for custodial families, with Ohio having an 86% success rate and Vermont at 76%. Some states reported less than 2% success in providing health insurance coverage. The report analyzes longitudinal data on children's health care coverage based on the 1993 Survey of Income and Program Participation. It shows that 37% of child support awards included health insurance coverage by the noncustodial father, 16% required coverage by the custodial parent, and 9% made other provisions for medical costs. 38% of awards had no provision for health care coverage. The analysis of children's health care coverage in 1993 shows that 68% of custodial families received health care coverage from the noncustodial father, 17% used the custodial parent's insurance, 11% relied on Medicaid or Medicare, and 4% were uninsured. 65% had valid private coverage for the entire year. The report also discusses the relevance of these findings. The 1993 findings on nonresident fathers' ability to provide health care coverage are still relevant, as changes since then have not significantly impacted the trends. Data from the Census Bureau in 1999 showed that 56% of mothers awarded child support had health insurance included, while only 49% had health insurance for their children. The 1999 Census Bureau data showed that 56% of mothers awarded child support had health insurance included, but only 49% actually received it for their children. In contrast, the CSE program data from FY2001 revealed that about 49% of child support awards included a health insurance order, with only 18% of orders being provided as ordered. This suggests a less effective medical support effort compared to national data, possibly due to noncustodial parents outside the CSE program being more financially capable of providing medical support. The national data show a need for improvement in establishing and enforcing medical support. In 2001, only 49% of families with child support awards had a health insurance order included. Child support agencies are criticized for not pursuing health insurance availability for noncustodial parents. Observers suggest expanding medical support provisions to require both parents to disclose healthcare coverage information. Enforcement of Health Insurance Order is a challenge as only 18% of CSE families with a health insurance order actually receive the mandated coverage. There has been a decline in employers providing health insurance, leading to increased costs for employees. Improved disclosure of healthcare coverage information by custodial parents is needed to determine availability for dependent children. Reasons for low compliance with health insurance orders include affordability, accessibility, and stability of coverage. Rising healthcare costs have made it difficult for noncustodial parents to afford premiums, leading to lapses or termination of coverage. Health Maintenance Organizations may not cover dependent children in certain service areas, and part-time or seasonal workers may not have stable access to healthcare coverage. To improve enforcement of medical child support, various health coverage options are available, with a focus on obtaining private health care coverage from noncustodial parents. Access to employer-sponsored health insurance for custodial parents has increased significantly in the last 20 years, along with Medicaid coverage based on child poverty. Health care costs have risen dramatically, making employer-sponsored health insurance less affordable. Requiring expensive health insurance may negatively affect parents and children. Policymakers agree that health coverage must be available, accessible, affordable, and stable. Publicly-funded health care may be necessary to reduce uninsured children with child support orders. Federal law has not fully addressed medical child support, with two provisions yet to be implemented. The 1984 law (P.L. 98-378) requires CSE agencies to secure medical support information and enforce obligations when health care coverage is available. The 1993 amendments (P.L. 103-66) aimed to remove barriers to effective medical support enforcement, prohibiting discriminatory practices and creating \"qualified medical child support orders.\" The 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193) mandated health care coverage in child support orders, but enforcement of medical support remains inadequate. A 1998 law (P.L. 105-200) established a National Medical Support Notice and a Medical Child Support Working Group to address enforcement barriers. The Working Group made 76 recommendations in a report to HHS and Labor Secretaries in June 2000. The federal government has made significant progress in improving medical child support services, moving from recouping Medicaid costs to pursuing private medical support. They now require medical support to be included in all child support orders and have established a national medical support notice for employer group health plans to follow. Critics argue more needs to be done, but analysts point to advancements made from 1984-2003. From 1984-2003, progress was made in establishing and enforcing medical support orders. Some advocate for integrating medical support with income withholding, citing its success in collecting child support. Others caution that income withholding may be too intrusive and could exceed legal limits. According to federal regulations, if the custodial parent already has satisfactory private health care coverage for themselves and the children, state CSE agencies are not required to include private health insurance available to the noncustodial parent in new or modified child support orders. In such cases, cash child support may be used to pay health care costs, especially if the custodial parent is bearing the full cost without assistance from the noncustodial parent. Some argue that medical child support should be an adjunct to the noncustodial parent's financial obligation, as it can impact the custodial parent's ability to oversee their child's health. The Medical Child Support Working Group suggests considering both parents' health coverage in determining medical support obligations. If only the custodial parent has coverage, the noncustodial parent should contribute towards the cost. When both parents are potentially able to provide coverage, it is preferred that the coverage available through the custodial parent, with a contribution from the noncustodial parent, be ordered. This is because it is more accessible to the child, involves less claims processing difficulty, and minimizes enforcement challenges. However, there may be conflict if the state has to enforce a medical support order against the custodial parent, especially if the reason for noncompliance is attributed to the noncustodial parent's failure to contribute. Conflict may arise due to confusion over whom the CSE attorney represents, with most custodial parents mistakenly believing the agency represents them when it actually represents the state. Private health care coverage available to the custodial parent is usually accessible to the child, even if it has a limited service area. However, this may not apply if the noncustodial parent's health insurance, especially through an HMO, is being used. Managed care can make coverage under the noncustodial parent's plan less attractive for children living far away, as HMO coverage in one state may be useless for a child residing in another state. According to the Medical Child Support Working Group, the accessibility of private health care coverage for children should be considered before pursuing coverage. Federal regulations should define \"accessible\" coverage, and coverage that is not accessible should not be ordered. The Working Group defines accessible coverage as being obtainable with reasonable effort by the custodial parent. Decision makers should consider if the child lives within the plan's service area and if primary care is available within a certain distance from the child's residence. If not, coverage should not be ordered. The Medical Child Support Working Group emphasizes that health care coverage should be accessible and stable, lasting at least one year. It may not be feasible for seasonal workers to provide continuous coverage. If noncustodial parents cannot provide consistent coverage, it may be best for the child to receive coverage from the custodial parent, Medicaid, or the State Children's Health. Under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), low-income children may be better off without coverage from the noncustodial parent if they are unable to provide continuous coverage. The federal government provides 66% of funding for Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program activities, including medical support, with states/local governments required to provide 34% of the funds. Congress has offered enhanced federal financial participation to encourage vital CSE program activities. Congress has provided enhanced federal financial participation (FFP) to encourage paternity establishment and automation in the CSE program. The Medical Child Support Working Group recommends a 90% FFP rate for medical child support activities to incentivize states to pursue medical support enforcement more aggressively. P.L. 105-200 required the development of a new medical support incentive measure based on states' effectiveness in establishing and enforcing medical child support obligations. The 1998 law established a support incentive system for the CSE program. The House report recommended considering medical child support as a performance measure, but due to lack of data, it was not included. The HHS Secretary formed the Medical Support Incentive Work Group to study the feasibility of using medical support as a performance measure. The HHS Secretary formed the Medical Support Incentive Work Group (MSIWG) to make recommendations on developing a medical support incentive. The work group recommended delaying the development until 2001 due to lack of data. A reconstituted MSIWG later recommended against developing a medical support performance measure for incentive payments. As of now, no action has been taken by the HHS Secretary, resulting in no incentive payment for medical support activities. The federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) concluded that most employment-related or group health insurance is considered reasonable in cost, based on a 1983 study. However, recent research shows that employee contributions for health care coverage have increased, challenging this assumption. Research indicates that employee contributions for family health care coverage can be a significant portion of low-income workers' income. Federal regulations require child support guidelines to address health care needs, but integrating child support and medical support can be challenging for custodial and noncustodial parents. States typically adjust cash support awards based on who provides health care coverage. The cash support award may decrease if the noncustodial parent subsidizes health care coverage, potentially leaving the custodial parent with insufficient funds for the child's needs. Private coverage costs should be considered, with public assistance as a last resort. According to the Working Group, private insurance should not be used if it significantly reduces the cash child support available for the child's basic needs. States can define \"reasonable cost\" of medical support in child support orders, such as Texas where it is capped at 10% of the responsible parent's monthly net income. The Working Group recommended that private health insurance coverage should be considered reasonable if the cost does not exceed 5% of the parent's gross income, regardless of how the child support order was established. Private health insurance offers advantages over public coverage, such as full family coverage, a wider range of providers, no stigma, less taxpayer burden, and greater satisfaction with care. In 2002, 8.5 million children lacked health insurance coverage, prompting the need for public health care coverage if private options are unavailable. Collaboration between CSE agencies and Medicaid/SCHIP is crucial to ensure children have access to necessary health care. A 1998 report highlighted challenges faced by noncustodial parents in providing health insurance due to limited options or high costs. The report recommended requiring noncustodial parents to pay Medicaid premiums for their dependent children to save state and federal costs. A 2003 HHS OIG report on North Carolina found potential savings of $17.4 million by collecting from noncustodial parents to offset Medicaid expenses for children. States have the authority to modify requirements for noncustodial parents if employer-provided health insurance is not available or too costly. States have the authority to require noncustodial parents to contribute to their dependent children's Medicaid costs if private health insurance is too expensive. Medicaid can pay for private health coverage if it is more cost-effective than Medicaid coverage. Federal law allows Medicaid funds to be used for group health insurance coverage. The Medicaid program allows states to use funds to purchase group health insurance for eligible individuals. Enrolling uninsured children in Medicaid or SCHIP could significantly reduce the number of uninsured children. Analysts suggest making enrollment in Medicaid or SCHIP mandatory when private coverage is not available, with consideration for noncustodial parents to contribute to premiums and other costs. The noncustodial parent may need to contribute to premiums, co-payments, or deductibles for SCHIP coverage in states with separate programs. Many uninsured children eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP are not enrolled due to lack of awareness or knowledge on how to enroll. States could provide information on publicly-funded programs to increase enrollment. The noncustodial parent's health insurance plan can be used as an alternative source of coverage for children, but some face difficulties with enrollment in programs like Medicaid or SCHIP. Providing parents with information and assistance in enrolling in these programs could help increase coverage for uninsured children. Some states require a child to be uninsured for three months before gaining SCHIP eligibility. P.L.105-200 established a standardized way for states to inform employers about enrolling noncustodial parents' children in employer-sponsored health plans. Employers must accept a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) under ERISA, which includes a national medical support notice. Plans sponsored by churches and state/local governments must also comply. States were expected to use the NMSN by October 1, 2001. Employers must honor and send the NMSN to the plan administrator within 20 business days, with the administrator responding within 40 days to the CSE agency. Employers must notify the state CSE agency if necessary. The National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) provisions were implemented by the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services on December 27, 2000, in response to the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998. The effective date of the final NMSN regulations was delayed until March 27, 2001. Despite Congress's requirement for all state CSE agencies to use the NMSN, few states had implemented it by the target date of October 2001. According to OCSE, 37 states and territories had to delay NMSN implementation due to legislative requirements. By September 2002, about 30 states had passed NMSN legislation. As of April 4, 2003, half of the states were not using NMSN. Federal law mandates child support orders to include health care coverage provision but does not require NMSN use in state CSE plans. Noncompliance with NMSN does not result in financial penalties. Some states argue against using the NMSN due to its length and cost of mailing to employers. Federal law does not require financial penalties for noncompliance with the NMSN, but states can impose sanctions. Concerns exist that the lack of sanctions may hinder successful enforcement of medical child support. Medicaid recipients must assign their medical support rights to the state, similar to TANF recipients assigning their child support rights. The federal government entered the financial child support and medical support arena to reduce costs on programs like AFDC and Medicaid. Medicaid recipients must assign their medical support rights to the state. The link between child support and medical support was to recoup Medicaid costs for public assistance families. The Medicare/Medicaid Anti-fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977 established a medical support enforcement program allowing states to require Medicaid applicants to assign their rights to medical support to the state. It also permitted cooperative agreements between CSE and Medicaid agencies to pursue medical child support. States were mandated to require Medicaid applicants to assign their rights to medical support to the state. The Medicare/Medicaid Anti-fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977 established a medical support enforcement program allowing states to require Medicaid applicants to assign their rights to medical support to the state. Section 16 of Public Law 98-378 required state CSE agencies to petition for medical support in new or modified child support orders when health care coverage is available at reasonable cost to the noncustodial parent. Regulations were implemented in 1985 by the Office of Child Support Enforcement to obtain basic medical support information. The state CSE agencies are required to obtain basic medical support information and provide it to the state Medicaid agency. The goal is to increase the number of children with private health insurance coverage, reduce Medicaid costs, and enforce medical support obligations ordered by the court or administrative process. States receive child support matching funds for medical support activities at a 66% rate. Before 1985, medical support activities were only pursued by CSE agencies under optional agreements with Medicaid agencies. These activities include receiving referrals, locating noncustodial parents, establishing paternity, determining health insurance coverage, filing claims, securing coverage through court orders, and recovering reimbursement amounts. Additional regulations were issued by OCSE on September 16, 1988. On September 16, 1988, OCSE issued regulations expanding medical support enforcement provisions. CSE agencies must identify cases with potential for medical support, petition for modifications, provide information on health insurance, and no longer require agreements that don't affect child support payments. Employees could only provide health coverage for children under their employers' plans before late 1993. Employees under their employers' health care plans could only provide coverage for children living with them. However, in cases of divorce where employees lost custody of their children, they were still required to provide health care coverage. Employers were not obligated to continue coverage for nonresident children, even if ordered by the court. In response, Congress passed legislation in 1993 to prohibit insurers from denying enrollment of a child based on certain criteria. The legislation passed in 1993 prohibited insurers from denying enrollment of a child based on certain criteria, such as being born out of wedlock or not claimed as a dependent on a tax return. Insurers and employers were required to allow parents to enroll children in family coverage without restrictions, even in cases of court-ordered coverage. Insurers were required to withhold employee's share of health insurance premiums and pay it to the insurer. Insurers were prohibited from imposing different requirements on state agencies acting as agents for individuals eligible for medical assistance. Insurers were required to provide information to custodial parents for children's benefits, allow claims submission without noncustodial parent approval, and make payments directly. State Medicaid agency could garnish wages of individuals not reimbursing for medical services received. The 1996 welfare reform legislation expanded the definition of \"medical child support order\" under ERISA to include court or administrative orders with the force of law. It also mandated that all orders enforced by the state CSE agency must include a provision for health care coverage. If a noncustodial parent changes jobs and the new employer provides health coverage, the state must notify the new employer. P.L.105-200 mandated a uniform way for states to enroll children of noncustodial parents in employer-sponsored health plans through a standardized \"National Medical Support Notice.\" Employers must accept this notice as a \"Qualified Medical Support Order\" under ERISA. States were required to start using the national medical support notice in October 2001, with some delays due to necessary state legislation. The national medical support notice is considered a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" under P.L. 105-200, requiring employer's group health plans to honor it. A Medical Support Working Group was established to address enforcement impediments, and a performance measure was developed to assess states' effectiveness in enforcing medical support obligations. The Child Support Incentive Payment System was required to implement a revenue neutral measure by October 1, 1999. Health care coverage for children in custodial families in 1993 was analyzed by Laura Wheaton from The Urban Institute. If at least one custodial child received health care coverage from a source in one month of the year, the family was considered to have received health care coverage from that source. The family is categorized based on the health care coverage received from a source."
