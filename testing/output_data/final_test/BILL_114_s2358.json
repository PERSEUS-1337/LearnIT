    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Clean Water Compliance and Affordability Act\" and includes an Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Approach Framework. The \"Clean Water Compliance and Affordability Act\" mandates a pilot program led by the EPA to assist eligible municipalities in developing cost-effective plans to meet wastewater and stormwater obligations under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The program aligns with the Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Approach Framework issued by the EPA in May 2012. The EPA, in consultation with states with approved NPDES programs, will select at least 15 eligible municipalities for a pilot program. An eligible municipality is one that holds a NPDES permit or is under an agreement to comply with the Clean Water Act. The EPA will prioritize eligible municipalities for a pilot program based on factors such as operating under compliance orders or facing affordability constraints in addressing wet weather discharges. The EPA may prioritize eligible municipalities for a pilot program based on factors like compliance orders or affordability constraints in addressing wet weather discharges. Eligible municipalities with a history of developing integrated clean water management practices may receive priority, especially if they are seeking to implement adaptive approaches in their plans. This could include using new innovative technical or institutional methods to account for future uncertainties. The EPA will approve integrated plans of eligible municipalities in a pilot program based on financial capability to meet Clean Water Act requirements. Prioritization will be given to obligations under the Act. The EPA will approve integrated plans of eligible municipalities in a pilot program based on financial capability to meet Clean Water Act requirements, prioritizing obligations under the Act. The program aims to enable municipalities to implement innovative and flexible approaches to meet their regulatory obligations. The municipality selected for the pilot program can extend the permit term under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to 25 years, modify implementation terms of a consent decree, and have regulatory flexibility for an integrated plan with adaptive approaches. The Administrator will report to Congress annually on the results of the pilot program established under the Act, detailing expected outcomes to reduce compliance costs for eligible municipalities."
