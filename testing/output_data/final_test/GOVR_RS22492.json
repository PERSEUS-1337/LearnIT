    "content": "In 1997, Sheila White complained about sexist comments at Burlington Northern's train yard. She was reassigned and suspended without pay, but later reinstated with backpay. White sued for unlawful retaliation under Title VII. The Sixth Circuit upheld her retaliation claims, awarding compensatory damages. The court differed on the standard for Title VII retaliation claims, leading to Supreme Court review. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment-related matters. In contrast, the retaliation provision protects employees who oppose unlawful practices or participate in related activities. The provision under Title VII protects employees who report discrimination or participate in investigations to prevent employers from undermining the anti-discrimination purpose. Courts have disagreed on whether a retaliation claim must be based on an employment-related action and the level of harm needed to constitute retaliation. Some courts require a close relationship between the retaliatory action and employment, while others apply the same standard as discrimination claims. The Supreme Court resolved a dispute among lower courts regarding the application of the retaliation provision under Title VII. They agreed with a more expansive view that retaliation encompasses employer actions that would materially adversely affect a reasonable employee or job. The Supreme Court clarified that the retaliation provision under Title VII covers employer actions that would materially adversely affect a reasonable employee or job applicant. The Court emphasized the differences in language between the anti-discrimination and retaliation provisions, noting that the latter does not have limiting words. Additionally, the Court considered the purposes behind both provisions in reaching its decision. The Supreme Court clarified that the retaliation provision in Title VII aims to prevent employers from retaliating against employees who report discrimination. The Court highlighted that this provision does not have limiting words and covers actions that could harm an employee outside the workplace. Examples include cases where the FBI refused to investigate death threats against an agent and his family, and where an employer retaliated in ways not directly related to employment. The Court clarified that the retaliation provision in Title VII aims to prevent employers from retaliating against employees who report discrimination. It noted examples of threats made against an agent and his family, and an employer filing false criminal charges against a former employee who complained of discrimination. The Court held that the retaliation provision is not limited to employer actions affecting employment terms, establishing a standard where the challenged action must be found materially adverse by a reasonable employee. The Court emphasized that Title VII's retaliation provision aims to prevent employers from retaliating against employees who report discrimination. It stated that the challenged action must be significant enough to dissuade the average worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination, taking into account the context of the situation. The Court upheld a jury verdict in favor of White, as Burlington Northern's actions of reassigning her and suspending her without pay were deemed harmful enough to deter reporting discrimination. Justice Alito disagreed with the majority's standard for retaliation claims in the Burlington Northern case, favoring a narrower interpretation. He believed retaliation claims should be limited to conduct affecting the terms and conditions of employment. However, he would have upheld White's retaliation claim under this standard. The decision applies broadly to employees reporting any discrimination prohibited by Title VII, making it easier for them to file retaliation claims. Retaliation claims are expected to increase in the future, especially those filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or in federal court."
