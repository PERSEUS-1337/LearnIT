    "content": "Vaccines are biologics that introduce weakened or killed disease-causing bacteria or viruses into a person to stimulate an immune reaction. Vaccination is the act of administering a vaccine, while immunization is the process of inducing immunity artificially. Inoculation involves introducing a microorganism, but vaccination specifically refers to intentional inoculation with a virus to provoke an immune response. The FDA licenses 46 vaccines for 20 diseases in the United States, with more in development. The National Immunization Program issues recommended schedules for immunizations. FDA procedures for biologic approval follow those for new drugs, including extensive animal testing for safety assessment. Animal testing is extensive for safety assessment of viruses grown in animal or human cells. Clinical trials in humans start after satisfactory animal testing. Phase I trials test safety with a small number of volunteers. Phase II and III trials gather evidence of effectiveness in larger groups while monitoring safety data. If feasible, the sponsor submits license applications to FDA for the vaccine and manufacturing plant. FDA reviews clinical data, inspects manufacturing facility, and performs tests on the vaccine and components. Advisory committees also review. The FDA maintains an active presence in monitoring vaccines for contamination and requires extensive testing of all components. Postmarketing surveillance programs are in place to monitor long-term safety and effectiveness through Phase IV studies. Various groups, including the government, are involved in vaccine-related issues. The government entities responsible for vaccine research, development, licensing, and surveillance of adverse reactions include the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the FDA for regulation, the NIH for research and development, and the CDC for coordinating nationwide activities related to vaccines. The CDC coordinates nationwide vaccine programs like VFC and state grants. The VICP compensates for vaccine injuries, while the DOD handles military vaccines and research. The Department of Defense administers vaccines to military personnel, civilians, and contractors. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides vaccines to veterans. USAID supports immunization programs in developing countries. State and local governments manage vaccine activities. Veterinary biologics are regulated by the USDA. Under the authority of the Virus, Serum, and Toxin Act, vaccines must meet safety and efficacy standards similar to human products. Various stakeholders outside of government, including individuals, private entities, vaccine recipients, employers, insurers, manufacturers, researchers, and advocacy groups, are involved in vaccine-related issues. The 107th Congress approved bills addressing bioterrorism preparedness, including the USA PATRIOT Act, which allocated funding for response efforts. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 direct funding and activities for bioterrorism preparedness, including research, development, and production of vaccines and national stockpiles of drugs and vaccines. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 protects manufacturers and healthcare workers administering the smallpox vaccine from tort liability. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 protects manufacturers and healthcare workers administering the smallpox vaccine from liability. The Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003 compensates individuals injured by the smallpox vaccine virus. Other laws provide references to vaccine coverage and funding. The 108th Congress introduced several bills related to vaccine research, purchase, and coverage. The Improved Vaccine Affordability and Availability Act aimed to improve immunization rates by increasing vaccine distribution and clarifying the vaccine injury compensation program. In response to the influenza vaccine shortage in fall 2004, additional bills were introduced and hearings were held. The 108th Congress introduced bills related to vaccine research, purchase, and coverage. The report discusses legislative issues on vaccines, including availability, safety, effectiveness, and access. Cost is a major concern, with only nine American companies making vaccines in 2004 compared to 37 in 1967. The high cost of research and development, about $800 million per licensed vaccine, poses a financial challenge for companies. The production of vaccines remains complex, as seen in the 2004-2005 flu vaccine shortage in the United States. Production costs for vaccines in the United States are high due to the complexity of manufacturing biologics. Dedicated facilities with strict safety measures are required, and the purity standard for vaccines is much higher than for drugs. The FDA inspects every lot of vaccine produced, unlike drug production lots. Some manufacturers have ceased production of vaccines due to manufacturing difficulties or cost issues, requiring new submissions to restart production. To restart vaccine production, manufacturers must submit new license applications to FDA, adhere to good manufacturing practices, and prove safety and effectiveness before making the vaccine available. In 2004, a flu vaccine shortage occurred when Chiron's Liverpool plant was shut down due to bacterial contamination and unsafe manufacturing practices. Manufacturers may be hesitant to produce vaccines due to liability concerns and low sales volume. The vaccine industry is cautious due to liability concerns, with manufacturers hesitant to produce certain vaccines that may not have a large enough market in the United States. For example, the tick-borne encephalitis vaccine, licensed in Europe but not FDA-approved, requires U.S. clinical trials for safety. The vaccine industry faces challenges in developing vaccines for diseases with low incidence in the U.S. due to the high cost of FDA clinical trials for safety. Private benefactors like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are stepping in to support research for diseases like malaria, where resources are limited. The vaccine industry faces challenges in developing vaccines for diseases with low incidence in the U.S. due to high FDA clinical trial costs. Planning difficulties can lead to shortages of licensed vaccines for childhood diseases. Influenza vaccine production is a perennial challenge due to the need to choose the right components each year based on global surveillance data. In 2003, a delay in formulating a specific flu strain led to a shortage in the U.S. distribution. Influenza can cause annual sickness in healthy adults due to partial immunity, but can also lead to pandemics with severe illness and disruptions. International surveillance is focused on avian influenza (\"bird flu\") potentially merging with human strains. The international investigation into avian viruses involves intensive surveillance, testing, and collaboration with the World Health Organization to develop potential vaccines. Congress may consider measures like financial incentives, partnerships, coordination improvements, and alternatives for vaccine availability. Companies producing vaccines are influenced by opportunity costs. The government can provide financial incentives to companies for vaccine production through tax credits and contracts. President George W. Bush proposed Project BioShield in 2003 to encourage private industry to develop medical countermeasures for bioterrorism threats, leading to the Project BioShield Act of 2004. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 (P.L.108-276) addresses liability concerns for vaccine manufacturers and includes influenza vaccine in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Congress is interested in public-private partnerships to accelerate vaccine research and development. Public-private partnerships are recommended to spread financial risk and make vaccines available for prevalent diseases. Better coordination among federal regulators, private manufacturers, government scientists, and purchasers could prevent supply shortages and shorten the time between research and product licensure. Some suggest establishing a National Vaccine Authority to streamline FDA administrative procedures. Reports recommend better coordination within DOD vaccine acquisition programs and with other entities like HHS to present a unified front to manufacturers. DOD has assigned vaccine acquisition responsibilities to a higher level and formed interagency agreements and working groups to streamline processes. Questions arise about FDA's budget limitations affecting the timeliness of its activities. The FDA's budget limits the scope and timeliness of its activities, with some analysts suggesting that its standards are too high. Various government agencies and private manufacturers have worked together to develop vaccines, especially after the 2001 attacks. HHS has announced contracts to develop new vaccines against smallpox, plague, and tularemia, with funding from Project BioShield for a second-generation anthrax vaccine. The FDA has mechanisms to expedite the review process for vaccines, including fast-track drug development and accelerated approval. Congress could assess the effectiveness of laws directing HHS and DOD to accelerate research and development of bioterrorism countermeasures and vaccines. The FDA has mechanisms like fast-track drug development and accelerated approval to expedite the review process for vaccines. The Fast-Track Mechanism and Accelerated Approval allow for early interaction between manufacturers and the FDA to clarify goals and overcome obstacles that could delay approval decisions. Accelerated approval is granted for biologic products that provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit for serious or life-threatening illnesses. The FDA requires postmarketing studies for biologics approved through mechanisms like fast-track drug development and accelerated approval. Clinical trials test vaccine effectiveness through random assignment of individuals to assess disease prevention. Field trials observe disease occurrence among vaccinated and unvaccinated groups when no known treatment exists. The FDA published the Animal Efficacy Rule in 2002, allowing data from animal studies to support licensure applications for new drugs targeting serious or life-threatening conditions when human studies are not feasible. This rule could apply to diseases like inhalational anthrax with no natural endemic disease. The FDA implemented the Animal Efficacy Rule in 2002 for new drugs targeting serious conditions. In February 2003, the FDA used the rule to approve a drug. Congress may discuss alternative actions for safety and effectiveness oversight. The Priority Review process shortens approval decision time for products addressing unmet needs. Efforts against bioterrorism were intensified after the events of September and October 2001. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 allows the HHS Secretary to authorize emergency use of products without FDA approval in the event of serious biological threats. This act also addresses spending authority for medical countermeasure development and purchase, emphasizing the protection of individuals using vaccines in the US. Vaccines in the United States require FDA licensing for safety and effectiveness. Congress may discuss safety and effectiveness criteria, including assessing safety by adverse reactions and defining effectiveness in terms of value-for-cost. FDA licensure does not require a side-effect-free vaccine, and effectiveness does not mean permanent or complete protection. Researchers aim to assess efficacy generally. Researchers assess efficacy of vaccines through expensive clinical trials comparing infection rates in two groups, one with the vaccine. Effectiveness in real-world situations may be lower due to various factors. FDA and CDC monitor safety with Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting. The FDA and CDC monitor vaccine safety through the Vaccine Adverse Event Report System (VAERS) and MedWatch. These passive surveillance systems rely on reports from consumers and physicians to identify potential risks. Concerns have been raised about the number of vaccines recommended for infants and the potential link to autism. The FDA and CDC monitor vaccine safety through VAERS and MedWatch, relying on reports to identify risks. Concerns about vaccines causing autism have led to reformulations and recommendations being withdrawn based on insufficient knowledge. Decisions on vaccine safety often involve perceptions of risk, methodologic limits, and communication of known risks. Uncertainties exist in balancing risks and benefits, reflecting personal and communal values. Some parents refuse certain vaccines due to safety concerns, highlighting the importance of knowledge in public policy and individual decision-making. Decisions on vaccine safety involve uncertainties in balancing risks and benefits, reflecting personal and communal values. Some individuals refuse vaccines due to safety concerns, impacting public policy and individual decision-making. In some cases, avoidable diseases occur due to misinformation about side effects. Concerns about safety hindered the implementation of government decisions on anthrax vaccination. The U.S. armed forces faced resistance to mandatory anthrax vaccination, leading to the suspension of the program in 2004. Comparisons of effectiveness among different vaccines and products, including new ones, have been analyzed by industry and university researchers. The production of generic biologics for vaccines has been challenging due to difficulties in measuring equivalence between products. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 has also impacted the production of generic vaccines. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 did not include provisions for abbreviated applications for biologics licenses. Manufacturers are exploring biotechnology procedures to reduce medical costs. Congressional approval of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in 1986 led to the establishment of VAERS for monitoring vaccine adverse events. Congress may strengthen surveillance programs like VAERS to build trust among concerned groups. Consistent documentation of vaccine administration for smallpox has been recognized as necessary. Congress has recognized the importance of consistent documentation of vaccine administration and side effects, as well as the coordination of federal, state, and local activities. Congress may need to assess the surveillance program's completeness and effectiveness as the smallpox immunization program progresses. Various HHS websites provide consumer-oriented health information on immunization, including addressing misconceptions and ensuring healthcare providers distribute Vaccine Information Statements. Government education programs may not be reaching all individuals who should be immunized or have reservations. Congress may need to consider additional approaches for public communication of risk and medical choices. Researchers are adapting study designs and statistical methods to assess the comparative effectiveness of drugs and vaccines, which could impact market share and access to medications. The success of vaccine analysis may depend on stakeholders trusting the unbiased entity. The 108th Congress directed the HHS Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to conduct research on healthcare outcomes and effectiveness. Funding for these activities and compensation for safety failures are topics of debate. Since its creation in 1986, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has made awards primarily to families of children for injuries associated with recommended vaccinations. Congress has been considering modifications to make the program fairer and more efficient, with Senator Bill Frist proposing changes in 2003. President Bush signed the Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003 to address compensation for smallpox vaccine injuries. Bush signed the Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-20) to provide compensation for smallpox vaccine injuries, including medical care, lost income, and death benefits. HRSA published the injury table and administrative guidelines for the Smallpox Vaccine Injury Program. The success of the program in recruiting volunteers was uncertain due to decreased urgency for smallpox vaccination. Successful vaccine development does not guarantee widespread vaccination due to factors like awareness, access, and affordability. In 2002, 75% of U.S. children completed recommended vaccinations, falling short of HHS goals. Adult immunization rates are also below targets, with regional and economic disparities in access to services. Reasons include coordination issues, incomplete documentation, and inadequate financing. Inadequate public health infrastructure in the U.S. and developing countries hinders access to vaccines. Congress is addressing global health issues, including access to vaccines, through legislative efforts. Coordination of government financing programs aims to improve childhood immunization rates. To improve childhood immunization rates in the U.S., legislative discussions could address coordination issues among publicly funded vaccine programs like Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and Vaccines for Children. Adult immunization coverage and government financing are incomplete, with many younger adults lacking coverage for recommended vaccines. Congress may need to consider funding levels and financing strategies for vaccine-related care, including payment for vaccination and follow-up care, especially in the context of medical countermeasures for bioterrorism attacks. Global Health. Concerns about access to vaccines are not limited to biodefense and domestic use. Many government agencies and private groups work toward international health objectives, such as eradicating polio. Some Members noted concern for public health needs of developing countries worldwide and the need to assist those countries in fights against infectious diseases. Their work resulted in P.L. 108-25, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Legislators may want to increase access to existing vaccines and spur the development of new vaccine countermeasures. Legislators may want to increase access to existing vaccines, spur the development of affordable new vaccines, and consider increased long-term investment in vaccine development for diseases."
