Congress acknowledges the availability of proven technologies to enhance the public alert system, with benefits including increased security, rapid dissemination, improved notification abilities, geographically targeted alerts, and the use of State homeland security grants for modernization. Testing diverse communication modes for effective public alerts is also recognized as necessary. The Federal Government needs to modernize and improve its ability to provide timely and effective warnings to the public through an integrated national network for emergency alerts. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to include a new section for the modernization of the National Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to establish a national integrated public alert and warning system within two years. An agency will be designated to receive and validate homeland security information for the Commercial Mobile Alert System. The Secretary will also set common alerting protocols and standards. The national integrated public alert and warning system established under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 must include mechanisms for adapting information dissemination based on location, risks, and user preferences, alerting populations with special needs, integrating into Department training programs, and coordinating with other agencies and stakeholders. The national integrated public alert and warning system, established under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, must incorporate redundant and diverse modes for disseminating information to reach a wide audience, adapt to future technologies, be resilient against attacks, deliver alerts to remote areas, and promote partnerships for coordination. The Secretary is required to submit reports to the Committee on the system's functionality every six months. The Secretary must submit reports every six months to the Committee on Homeland Security regarding the integrated public alert and warning system's functionality, including assessments, recommendations for improvements, and information on disseminating homeland security alerts. Additionally, a Commercial Mobile Alert System Pilot Program must be developed within three months. The Secretary will develop a Commercial Mobile Alert System pilot program within three months to increase the reach of the integrated public alert and warning system. At least five states will be selected to participate in the program, representing a geographic cross-section of the United States and varying in risk to acts of terrorism. The pilot program will terminate six months after its commencement. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress three months after the pilot program ends, detailing its effectiveness, findings, conclusions, and recommendations for improving the commercial mobile alert system. $37,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2009 to carry out this section. The Act authorizes $37,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and subsequent years. It clarifies that it does not affect the authority of certain departments. It amends the Homeland Security Grants section to improve public alert and warning capabilities. It also prohibits tampering or interference with certain acts. It is illegal to tamper with alert system components purchased with public funds, punishable by a fine up to $10,000, imprisonment up to ten years, or both."
