    "content": "The \"Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2016\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section highlights important information related to the Act. Studies since the 1990s show a strong link between firefighting and increased cancer risk, including testicular, stomach, multiple myeloma, and brain cancer. Firefighters are exposed to harmful substances like pyrolysis products, toxic gases, metals, and chemicals. An extensive 2014 study by NIOSH found firefighters at increased risk of malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer, and leukemia. Previous studies on cancer incidence among firefighters were limited by data availability, sample sizes, and underrepresentation of certain groups. State cancer registries collect and collate information on cancer diagnoses, demographics, and treatment plans. These registries help researchers access centralized data for studying cancer risks. While state registries aid in assessing cancer incidence among firefighters, a national cancer registry would offer more direct and comprehensive information for robust research. Efforts to understand cancer incidence among firefighters through a national cancer registry will inform future precautions, improve epidemiological trends understanding, and enhance safety protocols to lower cancer risks. SEC. 3. PATIENT REGISTRY FOR FIREFIGHTER CANCER INCIDENCE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a voluntary patient registry to collect data on cancer incidence among firefighters. The registry will be used to monitor cancer rates, store epidemiological information, and include de-identified data for analysis. The Secretary will collect de-identified information on cancer diagnoses and treatment of firefighters, including physical exams, diagnostic tests, pathology reports, and treatments. Additionally, data on individual patient history related to cancer incidence will include demographic information such as age and age of cancer onset. The firefighter's information required includes age, type of firefighter, years on the job, additional employment experience, number and type of fire incidents attended. If unable to provide, an estimate can be made based on a developed method. The Secretary can include questions in public health surveys to gather firefighter information. Measures will be taken to ensure data on minority, female, and volunteer firefighters is included in the registry. Additional risk factors like smoking or drug use may be listed as necessary. The Secretary, in consultation with experts, will develop a method to estimate the number and type of fire incidents attended by firefighters for the registry. Feedback will be sought from non-Federal experts in public health and epidemiology to improve the registry. The Secretary will develop an approval process for making de-identified cancer registry data available for public research purposes, with a requirement for findings to be made public or available to relevant stakeholders. The Secretary will apply data security and privacy standards to the cancer registry, following best practices from the CDC and HIPAA regulations. $2,500,000 is authorized annually for this purpose from 2017 to 2021."
