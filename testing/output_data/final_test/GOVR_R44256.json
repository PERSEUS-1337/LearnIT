    "content": "The curr_chunk discusses the use of physical force by law enforcement officers to restrain individuals and protect themselves and others. Recent incidents have sparked debate on the appropriate level of force in a democratic society. The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 sparked a debate on law enforcement-related deaths and the need for legal accountability and police reform. President Obama established the Task Force on 21st Century Policing to develop recommendations for best practices. The House Judiciary Committee also held a hearing on policing strategies in 2015, with various measures introduced in Congress to address the use of force. In 2015, the 114th Congress introduced measures to address police use of force tactics and data collection. The \"Black Lives Matter\" movement released \"Campaign Zero\" with policy proposals to limit excessive force by police, sparking a debate on Congress's role in police reform at the local level. Supporters argue that regulating local police should be left to state and local governments to allow for local experimentation. However, proponents of reform believe federal intervention is necessary as state and local governments have not held officers accountable for improper use of force. Historical precedent exists for congressional intervention in cases of constitutional violations, such as the enactment of federal statutes after the Civil War to protect civil rights. The debate over federal intervention in regulating local police centers around laws such as 18 U.S.C. Section 242 and 42 U.S.C. Section 14141, which address constitutional violations and excessive force. Key questions include the constitutional rules governing police use of force, Congress's role in providing remedies for violations, and potential reforms to these rules and remedies. The focus is on street encounters with police leading to recent law enforcement-related deaths. The Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures, particularly excessive force claims, is a key federal legal restraint. Cases like Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor have established this right as a primary protection against excessive force by law enforcement. In Tennessee v. Garner, the Court assessed the constitutionality of a deadly force statute allowing police to shoot fleeing felons. A young African American male was shot in the back of the head while climbing over a fence, leading to a civil suit for violation of constitutional rights under Section 1983. The officer's actions were deemed in good faith based on Tennessee's use of force statute. In Tennessee v. Garner, the Supreme Court reversed a decision allowing the use of deadly force against a fleeing felon, deeming it unconstitutional. Justice White emphasized that the use of deadly force is a \"seizure\" under the Fourth Amendment and must be \"reasonable.\" The Court stated that the reasonableness of a seizure must be balanced against governmental interests, highlighting the intrusiveness of deadly force. In Tennessee v. Garner, the Supreme Court ruled that using deadly force to prevent the escape of felony suspects is constitutionally unreasonable. Justice White highlighted the intrusiveness of such force and emphasized the government's interest in arresting suspects peacefully. The Court stated that killing a suspect hinders the criminal justice process and outlined when deadly force is permissible - when the officer believes the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm. In Tennessee v. Garner, the Supreme Court ruled that using deadly force to prevent the escape of felony suspects is constitutionally unreasonable. Deadly force may be used if the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, and some warning should be given if feasible. Garner addressed deadly force, while Graham v. Connor extended the rule to non-deadly force situations. In Graham v. Connor, police officers used force on a suspected shoplifter, resulting in significant injuries and a lawsuit. The Supreme Court ruled in Tennessee v. Garner that using deadly force to prevent the escape of felony suspects is constitutionally unreasonable. In Graham v. Connor, the Court extended this rule to non-deadly force situations, stating that all claims of excessive force by law enforcement officers should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's 'reasonableness' standard. Chief Justice Rehnquist emphasized that the test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment requires careful consideration of the specific circumstances of each case. In use of force jurisprudence, the factors of immediate threat, resistance, and evasion are crucial. Chief Justice Rehnquist emphasized that the reasonableness of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, considering the split-second decisions made in tense and evolving situations. The inquiry must be objective, focusing on whether the officer's actions were objectively reasonable. In use of force jurisprudence, the reasonableness of an officer's actions is crucial, judged objectively without considering their intent. Lower courts apply tests based on Garner and Graham, assessing threat levels for deadly and non-deadly force. However, the 2007 case Scott v. Harris rejected these tests. In the 2007 case Scott v. Harris, the Court rejected multi-factor tests from Garner and Graham, emphasizing the Fourth Amendment's general reasonableness test. Justice Scalia stated that Garner did not establish rigid preconditions for deadly force, but rather applied the reasonableness test to specific situations. In the 2007 case Scott v. Harris, Justice Scalia emphasized the Fourth Amendment's general reasonableness test, rejecting multi-factor tests from Garner and Graham. The Court held that a police officer's attempt to end a dangerous high-speed chase, even if it risks the suspect's life, does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Critics argue that the ruling lacks guidance for future use of force cases. The Scott ruling may not provide clear guidance for officers on what level of force is reasonable in a situation, potentially leading to agencies rewriting policies in more general terms. This could deprive officers and juries of necessary instruction on excessive force cases, as deadly force is considered a type of excessive force and should be evaluated under the Graham reasonableness test. The Court will craft a charge to help the jury determine if the deadly force used was reasonable. Not instructing the jury on the difference between deadly and non-deadly force could lead to confusion. Lower courts have interpreted excessive force cases differently. Some courts interpret excessive force cases differently, with some using multifactor tests while others rely on a free-form test. Concerns have been raised about police using deadly force too quickly or without sufficient justification, especially against unarmed suspects. Police are generally allowed to use deadly force when a suspect is perceived to be carrying a deadly weapon in a threatening manner. The courts have upheld the use of deadly force against suspects believed to be carrying a firearm, even if no weapon was found. For example, in one case, a suspect reaching for what was thought to be a firearm turned out to be a can of shoe polish, based on a citizen's report. The courts generally support officers' use of force, even when based on limited evidence, and show deference to their judgment in determining the level of force needed. This includes not requiring officers to use less intrusive force if their actions are deemed reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Some courts argue that expecting officers to always choose the least intrusive option could hinder their ability to protect the public and themselves. Some courts have noted that the \"availability of alternative means\" is relevant to a Fourth Amendment analysis, and possession of a weapon does not always justify police use of deadly force. In the 2013 Fourth Circuit case Cooper v. Sheehan, the court emphasized that the threat posed by the possession of a firearm justifies force, not just the possession itself. There is divergence in lower courts in applying the Supreme Court's limited deadly force jurisprudence. Courts are still required to give deadly force instructions following the Scott decision, which emphasized reasonableness in excessive force claims. It is unclear how the Graham factors factor into the analysis post-Scott. Justice Scalia rejected Garner as controlling excessive force cases and emphasized a free-form totality of the circumstances evaluation. Some circuits, like the Ninth and Eleventh, have adopted this approach. In Mattos v. Agaronos, the Ninth Circuit stated that the Graham factors are not exclusive, and courts must consider all relevant factors in each case. The Eleventh Circuit noted that specific factors may be considered in deadly force cases, even if not listed in Graham. Other circuits, such as the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth, have not followed Scott's broader approach. The Second Circuit emphasized the need for a Garner instruction in cases involving the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect. In the Second Circuit, a Garner instruction is required in cases involving the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect. Controversy surrounds the use of non-lethal force like chokeholds, tasers, and pepper spray, raising concerns about when these methods should be allowed. Law enforcement agencies in the US have significantly increased their use of tasers in recent decades. Tasers, used by over 12,000 law enforcement agencies, are seen as a safer alternative to firearms but have resulted in 500 deaths between 2001 and 2012. The X26 taser can deliver a 50,000 volt shock to incapacitate a person, and can also be used in stun mode for localized shocks. The use of tasers is heavily fact-specific and controversial, raising concerns about their safety and effectiveness. The use of tasers is heavily fact-specific, with courts noting that tasers are least justified against nonviolent misdemeanants who do not pose a threat to officers. For example, in Brown v. City of Golden Valley, a woman tased for a minor offense was deemed unjustified by the Eighth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit ruled against an officer who gratuitously shocked a restrained man, denying qualified immunity. Courts generally allow tasers against belligerent individuals, like a 9th grader tased for resisting an officer. Tasers are often permitted for passive resistance cases, falling between active resistance and compliance with officer commands. In Buckley v. Haddock, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the use of a taser on a man who refused to comply with officer's orders after being handcuffed. The court emphasized the government's interest in completing arrests efficiently. Another case involved a police officer using a taser on an elderly suspect with Alzheimer's who also refused to comply with orders. The court upheld the use of a taser against a mentally ill woman who tried to drive away from police officers sent to check on her after a suicide report. The court found the officer's belief that the woman posed a safety risk credible, as she got into her truck, which he saw as a potential weapon. The court also interpreted her actions as an attempt to avoid legitimate law enforcement contact. The courts consider factors like the harm caused and number of times a Taser was used in a situation. A single use causing minor harm was deemed reasonable, while multiple uses resulting in serious injury were seen as unreasonable. In most cases, where permanent injuries are unlikely, the courts may find Taser use reasonable. The use of pepper spray and tasers by law enforcement has sparked public attention due to potential harm caused. Factors like victim vulnerability, warnings given, and previous incidents are considered in determining the reasonableness of their use. Pepper spray causes immediate respiratory inflammation and eye irritation, while tasers have been scrutinized for their potential to cause serious injury. The federal courts have been less deferential to law enforcement using pepper spray on passive resisters compared to tasers. Pepper spray causes immediate respiratory inflammation and burning sensations, leading to court rulings that its use on nonviolent individuals violates the Fourth Amendment. In a recent Ninth Circuit case, the use of pepper spray on nonviolent protestors was deemed an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. However, in a Tenth Circuit case, pepper spray use during a traffic stop was justified when the individual refused to comply with the officer's instructions. Courts generally find pepper spray use justified when suspects actively resist arrest or ignore direct commands. In Singleton v. Darby, the Fifth Circuit upheld the use of pepper spray against protesters, citing the officer's warning, the need to keep public roads clear, and the use of the least intrusive force. Federal courts generally find pepper spray justified when suspects resist arrest or ignore commands. Congress has relied on three federal statutes to address unconstitutional use of force by law enforcement officers: criminal offense for violations of constitutional rights, civil cause of action for deprivation of rights, and statute for the Attorney General to bring civil suits for injunctive relief against police departments. These statutes are based on Congress's power under the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce constitutional safeguards, including the right to be free from unreasonable seizures. The Civil Rights Act of 1866, enacted after the Civil War, made it a criminal offense to deprive someone of a civil right while acting under color of law, primarily aimed at protecting the rights of newly freed African Americans. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 criminalizes deprivation of rights under color of law, protecting all races. Codified at 18 U.S.C. Section 242, it punishes those who willfully violate constitutional rights, with three elements required for prosecution. Prosecutions under Section 242 of the Civil Rights Act do not require force based on race, but rather the deprivation of constitutional rights. However, successful prosecutions are rare due to factors such as sympathetic juries, high evidentiary thresholds, and lack of resources. The specific intent element of willfully depriving someone of their rights poses a significant challenge for prosecutors. The statute for Section 242 of the Civil Rights Act originally did not require a \"willful\" deprivation of constitutional rights, but this term was added in 1909 to make it less severe. Prosecutions under Section 242 are limited, with lack of criminal intent being a primary reason. Understanding the mens rea requirement in cases like United States v. Screws is crucial to potentially altering the statute. In Screws, a shocking incident involving law enforcement led to a significant legal precedent. Three officers, including a special deputy, arrested Robert Hall for theft of a tire. They beat him mercilessly for 15 to 30 minutes until he was unconscious, claiming he had tried to pull out a gun. Hall died less than an hour later without regaining consciousness. The officers were charged under 18 U.S.C. Section 52 for depriving Hall of life. The prosecution of the officers in the case of Robert Hall's death was based on the claim that they deprived him of life without due process of law. The defendants argued that the statute was vague, but Justice Douglas clarified that court decisions provide guidance on due process. He also addressed concerns about the vagueness of the law and the mens rea element. The plurality in the case discussed the mens rea element, emphasizing the importance of proving a specific intent to do a prohibited act to avoid vague or indefinite statutes. They highlighted that \"willfully\" means an act done with a bad purpose, making an evil motive a constituent element of the crime. This specific intent requirement aims to prevent government actors from being considered criminals unintentionally. The plurality in the case emphasized the importance of proving specific intent to avoid vague or indefinite statutes. They noted that a person cannot complain about violating the law if they specifically intended to violate constitutional rights. The Court's explanation of this standard caused confusion, particularly regarding the contradiction between not needing to think in constitutional terms but aiming to deprive a citizen of a constitutional right. Justice Douglas asserted that specific intent is required under Section 242, but also suggested that individuals can be prosecuted under a \"reckless disregard\" standard. The plurality opinion highlighted the importance of proving specific intent to avoid vague statutes, causing confusion in the interpretation of the standard. The plurality opinion in Screws v. United States endorsed a \"reckless disregard\" standard for prosecutions under Section 242, which is a lower mens rea standard than specific intent. Lower courts are divided on the interpretation of \"willfully\" and the application of Section 242's specific intent requirement, with some requiring specific intent to violate the law, others focusing on the intent to commit the physical act, and a third group allowing convictions based on a \"reckless disregard\" standard. Courts have different interpretations of the mens rea standard in prosecutions under Section 242. Some require specific intent to violate the law, while others focus on the intent to commit the physical act. In United States v. Garza, a sheriff and investigator were convicted for various violations, with the court defining \"willfully\" as acting with a bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law. The Fifth Circuit upheld these instructions. The Fifth Circuit upheld instructions in prosecutions under Section 242, stating that \"willfully\" implies a conscious purpose to do wrong and intent to deprive another of constitutional rights. This aligns with the requirement that the defendant must actually intend to violate the victim's constitutional rights. In a previous case, the Fifth Circuit reversed a conviction due to improper jury instructions on the \"willfully\" element. The Fifth Circuit rejected the district court's instructions in a case where force used during an arrest was deemed unnecessary, as it did not adequately convey that the act must be done with a bad purpose or evil motive. The court also found fault in the requirement for specific intent to do the act in question without specifying the intent to deprive. The Fifth Circuit requires specific intent to violate constitutional rights, not just intent to commit the act. The Northern District of Ohio also applied this strict test in a case related to the Kent State shooting. Intent to injure or use excessive force is not enough; there must be an intention to prevent constitutional rights. In United States v. Cobb, the Fourth Circuit addressed an appeal by three officers convicted under Section 242 for beating a prisoner. The district court instructed that the defendant must have specific intent to deprive the victim of his constitutional rights, not just intent to commit the act. The Fourth Circuit upheld the instruction that the defendant must have specific intent to deprive the victim of his constitutional rights in United States v. Cobb. The court emphasized that conviction hinged on the defendant's willful, knowing, and intentional actions against the victim's rights. This suggests that the defendant did not need to intentionally violate the rights of another, but rather intended to engage in the physical act. The Fourth Circuit upheld the requirement of specific intent in United States v. Cobb, emphasizing that the defendant must willfully, knowingly, and intentionally act against the victim's rights. This contrasts with the reckless disregard standard endorsed in Screws, which allows for a less stringent showing under Section 242. The Third Circuit adopted this approach to reconcile the conflicting standards in Screws. The court in Screws accepted that willfulness in Section 242 can include reckless disregard, but did not determine whether the standard should be applied subjectively or objectively. The Third Circuit found the officer liable under either standard. The Ninth Circuit in United States v. Gwaltney upheld a reckless disregard instruction for depriving a person of their constitutional rights without needing to prove specific intent. Lower courts debate interpreting \"willfully\" in Section 242 and applying the Screws ruling, causing confusion in a sensitive area of law regarding the use of deadly force. Clarity on the level of culpability required for severe penalties like life imprisonment or death would benefit officers in the field. The recent shootings in Ferguson and elsewhere have sparked calls for clarifying the mens rea element in Section 242 to ensure consistent enforcement. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights recommended removing the specific intent standard, but the Third and Ninth Circuits already use a reckless disregard standard. Lowering the mens rea threshold in Section 242 could have unintended consequences, affecting all claims of constitutional violations by those acting under color of law. The recent shootings in Ferguson and elsewhere have led to calls for clarifying the mens rea element in Section 242 for consistent enforcement. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights suggested removing the specific intent standard, but some circuits already use a reckless disregard standard. Lowering the mens rea threshold in Section 242 could impact all claims of constitutional violations by those acting under color of law. Creating a standalone statute to lower the mens rea specifically for police use of force cases is a possible solution within Congress's authority. Regardless of the mens rea standard used, Section 242 is a criminal statute requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt, while civil suits under federal civil rights law have a lower threshold of preponderance of evidence and have seen more success in court. Section 1983 allows victims of police abuse to bring civil suits for constitutional rights violations, with a lower burden of proof compared to criminal liability under Section 242. It looks to the Fourth Amendment and other constitutional rights for substantive rights. Section 1983 allows victims of police abuse to bring civil suits for constitutional rights violations, with a lower burden of proof compared to criminal liability under Section 242. It looks to the Fourth Amendment and other constitutional rights for substantive rights. To prove a violation under Section 1983 for claims of excessive force, the plaintiff must show deprivation of the right to be free from unreasonable seizures under the Fourth Amendment and that the officer acted under color of law. Qualified immunity can protect an officer from personal civil liability if their actions did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights. Qualified immunity provides a broad shield to liability for public officials, balancing the need for accountability with the need to shield officials from harassment. It can protect officers from civil liability unless they are plainly incompetent or knowingly violate the law. While criticized for shielding officers from unconstitutional conduct, qualified immunity is not constitutionally mandated and can be altered or eliminated by Congress through statute. The process for applying the qualified immunity doctrine has evolved in recent years. Under older precedent, the Court mandated a two-step sequence for qualified immunity claims, but lower courts criticized this approach. The Court noted that skipping ahead to the \"clearly established\" prong of the test would deprive future courts of case law defining the parameters of the right in question. In 2009, the Court in Pearson v. Callahan allowed lower courts to decide which prong of the qualified immunity analysis to address first for more flexibility. The law requires that the right violated must be clearly established for officers to have fair warning of unconstitutional conduct. The level of generality in defining the legal rule is crucial for determining if a right is clearly established. The Court has instructed lower courts not to define a clearly established rule at a high level of generality. Existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate. In the use of force context, major Supreme Court precedents are written at a high level of abstraction, making them difficult to apply as precedents in use of force qualified immunity cases. The court granted qualified immunity to an officer in a taser-related death case due to lack of clear guidance from Supreme Court cases. Officers held liable under Section 1983 may be indemnified by state or local governments, which is determined by state or local law. Plaintiffs can also sue municipalities for excessive force incidents under Section 1983, following the Monell v. Department of Social Services of New York case. In Monell v. Department of Social Services of New York, municipalities can be held liable under Section 1983 if their \"policy or custom\" causes a constitutional violation. City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris established that a failure to train can be considered a \"policy\" if it shows deliberate indifference to individuals' rights. In Board of County Commissioners of Bryan Country v. Brown, the Court addressed whether a single hiring decision by a municipality can be a \"policy\" permitting Monell liability. The plaintiff was injured after a sheriff's deputy with a criminal history threw her to the ground during a traffic stop. The Court emphasized the need for rigorous standards of culpability and causation to hold municipalities liable for such incidents. The Court rejected the plaintiff's claim in Board of County Commissioners of Bryan Country v. Brown, emphasizing the need for rigorous standards of culpability and causation to hold municipalities liable for incidents involving law enforcement officers. The third federal remedy for unconstitutional conduct by law enforcement officers is 42 U.S.C. Section 14141, the \"pattern or practice\" statute. Section 14141 prohibits government authorities or agents from engaging in a \"pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers that deprives persons of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\" The Attorney General can sue for relief if there is reasonable cause to believe a constitutional violation pattern exists. Investigations by the Special Litigation Section of DOJ's Civil Rights Division cover issues like police use of force, unlawful stops, searches, and biases. Consent decrees are often used to resolve these investigations, outlining measures for the local agency to remedy unconstitutional police practices. The Department of Justice (DOJ) entered into a consent decree with the City of New Orleans to address unconstitutional police practices after finding numerous instances of misconduct. Consent decrees often include provisions for use-of-force reporting systems, citizen complaint systems, and early warning systems. In response to recent law enforcement-related deaths, bills have been introduced in Congress to address excessive force and provide accountability, such as the Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act of 2015 (H.R. 2052). Amend 18 U.S.C. Section 242 to include pressure on the throat as a form of punishment. Prosecutions under H.R. 2052 would occur when an officer uses a chokehold based on race, color, or alien status. The Police Accountability Act of 2015 (H.R. 1101) creates a federal crime for certain homicides by law enforcement officers. H.R. 1102 applies to state or local officers in agencies receiving funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance. The National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act of 2015 would reduce a state or local government's JAG funding by 10% if it fails to submit data concerning police use of excessive force. This includes data on identifying characteristics of the person targeted, the officer involved, time, date, location of the incident, alleged criminal activity, and nature of the deadly force used. The PRIDE Act requires data collection on incidents involving use of force resulting in serious injury or death, including details on individuals involved, date, time, location, weapons, and type of force used. President Barack Obama signed an executive order in December 2014 establishing the Task Force on 21st Century Policing to identify best police practices, including use of force policies. The task force recommended that law enforcement agencies develop clear and comprehensive policies on the use of force, emphasizing de-escalation and alternatives to arrest. Training, investigations, prosecutions, data collection, and information sharing should be included in these policies. The use of force policies should prioritize de-escalation and alternatives to arrest. External and independent investigations and prosecutors should be mandated for cases of police use of force resulting in death or injury. Data on officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths must be collected and reported to maintain transparency. A Serious Incident Review Board should be established to review cases involving serious incidents. The establishment of a Serious Incident Review Board is recommended to address issues related to officer-involved shootings and other serious incidents that could harm community trust in the agency. Proposed reforms include implementing nonpunitive peer reviews for critical incidents, lowering the mens rea standard, creating a standalone excessive force statute, adjusting the \"deliberate indifference\" standard for failure to train claims, and allowing private citizens to file lawsuits under specific statutes."
