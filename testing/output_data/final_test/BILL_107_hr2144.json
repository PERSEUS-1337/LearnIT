    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Control Act of 2001\". Congress finds that tan oak, coast live oak, Shreve's oak, and black oak trees in California and the Pacific Northwest are at risk of disease caused by the Phytophthora fungus. Scientists are still researching the causes and treatment of sudden oak death syndrome, which has also been found on Rhododendron and huckleberry plants, potentially affecting commercial blueberry and cranberry crops. The sudden oak death syndrome poses a threat to the commercial blueberry and cranberry industries in California and the Pacific Northwest. Oregon and Canada have implemented an emergency quarantine on the importation of oak trees and products from California due to the disease. SEC. 3. RESEARCH, MONITORING, AND TREATMENT OF SUDDEN OAK DEATH SYNDROME. The Secretary of Agriculture will implement a program to research, monitor, and treat sudden oak death syndrome in oak trees on public and private land. Activities may include surveys, workshops, database maintenance, and research on forest pathology and ecology. The program aims to research and treat oak decline, focusing on susceptibility evaluation and treatment application for oaks and other vulnerable species in the United States. SEC. 4. MANAGEMENT, REGULATION, AND FIRE PREVENTION. The Secretary conducts sudden oak death syndrome management, regulation, and fire prevention activities to reduce fire and fallen tree threats. This includes hazard tree assessments, grants for tree removal and reforestation, improving firefighting capabilities, and treating vegetation in infected areas. The Secretary conducts fire risk management in areas heavily infected with sudden oak death syndrome, conducts national surveys and inspections of commercial nurseries and native plants, monitors vulnerable species nationwide for early detection, and provides diagnostic services. The Secretary conducts education and outreach activities to provide information on sudden oak death syndrome to the public. This includes developing educational materials, maintaining a website, and offering support to states, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. Additionally, there is a sudden oak death syndrome advisory committee in place. The Secretary has established a Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Advisory Committee to assist in carrying out the Act. The Committee consists of representatives from various agencies and individuals appointed by the Secretary from affected states. The Secretary has established a Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Advisory Committee with members appointed within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Committee must hold its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. The Committee established to address sudden oak death syndrome must prepare an implementation plan and submit interim and final reports to Congress within specified timeframes. The final report should include a summary of Committee activities and an account of funds received and spent. The Committee must submit findings and recommendations to Congress. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2002 through 2007: $7.5 million for section 3, with $1.5 million for treatment; $6 million for section 4; $500,000 for section 5; and $250,000 for section 6."
