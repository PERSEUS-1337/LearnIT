    "content": "In late September 2008, Japan's major parties will hold leadership elections. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) will go first on September 21, with Ichiro Ozawa running unopposed. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will hold its election the next day, with five candidates vying for the premiership. New Komeito will hold its election on September 23, with Akihiro Ota expected to stay on. The new prime minister is expected to dissolve the chamber and schedule an early general election for early November. The ruling party plans to hold an early general election in early November to renew their mandate. Polls suggest a competitive race with both the LDP and DPJ having approval ratings in the 20-30% range. Observers predict the LDP-led coalition may lose its two-thirds majority in the Lower House, potentially changing Japanese politics. The economy is expected to be a major issue, focusing on reviving the economy, supporting the aging society, raising the consumption tax rate, and other related topics. Japan is facing decisions on raising the consumption tax rate and pursuing economic reforms. The country's high government debt is a concern. Five candidates are running for the LDP's presidency, with Taro Aso considered the front-runner. Aso advocates for increased government spending to stimulate the economy and postponing the consumption tax increase. He is known for his hawkish foreign policy stance. Taro Aso, a front-runner for the LDP's presidency, is a foreign policy hawk advocating for revising Japan's constitution to deploy Self-Defense Forces overseas. He aims to deepen Japan's alliance with the US and promote values-based diplomacy with democracies in Asia. Aso's revisionist views on historical issues may cause tensions with China and South Korea. Shinto shrine honoring Japan's war dead, strained relations with China and other Asian countries. Candidates for LDP Presidency include Kaoru Yosano, advocate for raising consumption tax; Yuriko Koike, first woman candidate supporting structural reforms; Nobuteru Ishihara, also supporting reforms; Shigeru Ishiba, advocating for increased government spending and enabling overseas deployment of Self-Defense Forces. The DPJ is expected to focus on economic and social issues in upcoming elections. Ozawa's populist policy blueprint includes income support for farmers, abolishing taxes, and reforming pension and healthcare systems. He plans to offset revenue shortfalls by cutting wasteful government programs and reducing bureaucrats' influence. Ozawa also supports Japanese troops participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Analysts foresee various outcomes from Japan's political turbulence, including continued paralysis if the LDP loses its majority, a potential shift in policies under a DPJ victory, a \"Grand Coalition\" or political realignment, and challenges for Fukuda's successor. The DPJ's focus on economic and social issues, led by Ozawa, includes support for U.N. peacekeeping operations and reforms in various sectors. In July 2007, the DPJ won a majority in the Upper House of the Diet, leading to Japan's two parliamentary chambers being controlled by different parties for the first time. Shinzo Abe resigned as prime minister, and Fukuda was chosen as his successor. Fukuda attempted to form a \"Grand Coalition\" with the DPJ, but after talks broke down, the DPJ used its control of the Upper House to block or delay legislative initiatives. The LDP has relied on coalitions with smaller parties since 1999, forming a governing coalition with the New Komeito party. New Komeito party, tied to Soka Gakkai, has gained influence in the coalition due to LDP's need for their support to override DPJ-led vetoes. In 2008, New Komeito became more assertive by resisting Fukuda's push to renew fuel authorization for coalition forces in Afghanistan. Junichiro Koizumi weakened the LDP's old opaque system of decision-making. The LDP's decision-making system, criticized for lacking transparency, helped overcome internal divisions. Koizumi broke the faction-based system using his popularity, but successors struggled with party discipline. The DPJ, formed in 1998, faced internal contradictions between hawkish/conservative and passivist/liberal factions. Contentious issues like economic reform and deploying Japanese troops abroad caused difficulties in decision-making. The DPJ has struggled with internal divisions between hawkish/conservative and passivist/liberal factions, particularly regarding deploying Japanese troops abroad and revising Article 9 of the constitution. Despite past reputation for incoherent policies, the party has shown more unity since winning the Upper House. However, internal battles and dissatisfaction with leadership style could still pose challenges. U.S. interests may be impacted by political gridlock in Tokyo, with potential consequences for the next election and party leadership. Continued ineffective leadership in Tokyo may hinder Japan's support for U.S. global efforts, leading to frustration in economic, diplomatic, and military coordination. Despite the mutually beneficial U.S.-Japan security alliance, an erosion of trust could limit both countries' ability to navigate controversies. Tokyo is expected to focus on domestic issues, with little progress anticipated on reforms. The new leadership in Japan is unlikely to prioritize controversial foreign policy legislation due to focus on domestic issues. This political gridlock may impact Japanese support for U.S.-led Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The emphasis on reforming pension and health care systems may divert resources from international security efforts. The DPJ and other opposition parties in Japan voted down the \"Anti-terrorism Special Measures Law\" authorization, causing a gap in MSDF participation. The LDP-New Komeito coalition overruled the rejection, but the current measure expires soon. Renewal support is uncertain, and sending ground troops to Afghanistan is controversial. The DPJ in Japan opposes refueling operations in Afghanistan due to lack of UN authorization. Speculation suggests Japan is waiting on the new US president's stance on Afghanistan before committing ground troops. Political shifts in Japan have slowed US-Japan alliance cooperation. Implementation of bilateral agreements depends on Tokyo's resources and political capital. The central government's leadership is crucial for successful implementation of unpopular transformation initiatives in Japan, such as relocating a Marine Corps air station in Okinawa. Public opposition and environmental concerns surround the agreement, which could impact the planned move of 8,000 Marines to Guam. Japan's relations with neighbors are less likely to be affected by political turmoil, with no distinct agendas for dealing with Korea and China among political parties. After tensions under Koizumi, Japan and China prioritize friendly relations for regional stability and trade. Aso is expected to follow Abe and Fukuda's approach. Japan-South Korea ties have strained over sovereignty issues and lack of attention from Tokyo. North Korea-Japan relations affected by Fukuda's resignation, delaying reinvestigation into kidnapped Japanese citizens. Progress on abduction issue may have slowed even without political uncertainty in Japan. Progress on the abduction issue may have slowed due to the Six-Party Talks struggling to make progress on North Korea's nuclear program."
