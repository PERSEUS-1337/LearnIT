    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new exclusion for small businesses and family farms in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The gross estate value excludes qualified small business or family farm interests of the decedent. This includes interests in closely held businesses related to farming if the decedent was actively engaged, and interests in small businesses where over 40% of the estate's value is from closely held businesses. Ownership of entities for determining ownership of a corporation is based on holding stock with the appropriate percentage of voting power and total value of shares. Ownership of partnerships is determined by owning the appropriate percentage of the capital interest. For tiered entities, ownership interest in one business may be disregarded when determining ownership of another business for tax purposes. For tax purposes, ownership of partnerships is determined by the capital interest percentage. In determining ownership of one business from another, ownership interest in one business may be disregarded. Individual ownership rules apply to interests owned by entities, shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries. The term 'interest in a closely held business' is defined in section 6166(b). An 'interest in a small business' refers to a closely held business with 100 or fewer employees. The 'adjusted value of the gross estate' is the gross estate value reduced by deductible amounts under specific sections. Applicable rules similar to certain rules shall apply. Rules similar to specific sections apply to the reduction in the value of the gross estate, including rules related to decedents who are retired or disabled, special rules for surviving spouses, community property, treatment of replacement property acquired in certain transactions, and certain structures taken into account for farmhouses. The dollar limitations under sections 2032A(a)(2) and 6601(j)(2) shall be reduced by the amount of such reduction. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part III of subchapter A of chapter 11. Exclusion for small businesses and family farms applies to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2000."
