The Electronic Fund Transfer Act is amended to require fee disclosures at electronic terminals by host operators providing transfer services to consumers. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act is amended to require fee disclosures at electronic terminals by host operators providing transfer services to consumers. The notice must be prominently displayed on the terminal screen or on a paper notice after the transaction is initiated but before the consumer is committed to completing it. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act now prohibits host electronic terminal operators from imposing undisclosed fees on consumers for electronic fund transfers unless the consumer receives proper notice and elects to proceed with the transaction. Definitions for electronic fund transfer are provided. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibits host electronic terminal operators from charging undisclosed fees for electronic fund transfers without consumer notification and consent.

A host electronic terminal operator operates terminals for fund transfers but is not the account-holding financial institution. The term 'host transfer services' refers to electronic fund transfers made by a host electronic terminal operator in connection with a consumer-initiated transaction at the operator's terminal. SEC. 3. Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to require disclosure of possible fees to consumers when an ATM card is issued. It includes a notice about potential fees imposed by terminal operators and networks. The Comptroller General of the United States will study the feasibility of requiring a notice to consumers before completing an electronic fund transfer, disclosing any fees imposed by terminal operators, financial institutions, and networks involved in the transaction. The Comptroller General will study factors like technology availability, costs, competitive impact, implementation time, and consumer benefits regarding a notice requirement before electronic fund transfers. The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress within 6 months of the enactment of the Act, detailing findings, conclusions, and recommendations on whether a notice requirement for electronic fund transfers should be implemented. Factors considered include technology availability, costs, competitive impact, implementation time, and consumer benefits. SEC. 5. NO LIABILITY IF POSTED NOTICES ARE DAMAGED.\n\nSection 910 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act is amended to state that if a notice required to be posted by a host electronic terminal operator is damaged by someone other than the operator, the operator is not liable for non-compliance.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act and its amendments will take effect six months after enactment."
