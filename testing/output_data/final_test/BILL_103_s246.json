    "content": "CHAPTER 154--SPECIAL HABEAS CORPUS PROCEDURES IN CAPITAL CASES. This chapter amends Part IV of title 28, United States Code, by inserting special habeas corpus procedures for capital cases. Special habeas corpus procedures for capital cases include the appointment of counsel, mandatory stay of execution, time requirements for filing petitions, evidentiary hearings, and standards for counsel in capital cases. Federal law controls habeas corpus proceedings, with specific time requirements outlined. The chapter applies to cases involving capital offenses or prisoners in State custody with a capital sentence, subject to certain conditions. The State must have a mechanism for appointing and compensating counsel for such cases. The chapter applies to cases involving capital offenses or prisoners in State custody with a capital sentence. A mechanism must be in place for appointing and compensating counsel for all State defendants and prisoners in such cases. The chapter applies to cases involving capital offenses or prisoners in State custody with a capital sentence. Counsel appointed for State defendants or prisoners in capital cases must not have previously represented them unless requested. Ineffectiveness of counsel in post-conviction proceedings is not grounds for relief under this chapter. ``Sec. 2262. Mandatory stay of execution for State prisoners under capital sentence. Stay of execution granted upon application to court with jurisdiction. Stay expires if prisoner fails to file habeas corpus petition within required time.`` The text discusses the conditions under which a petition for relief may be denied in a capital sentence case, including the expiration of the time for filing a petition for certiorari, denial of a timely petition by the Supreme Court, or a waiver of the right to pursue habeas corpus review by the State prisoner. The text outlines the conditions for denying relief in a capital case, including the waiver of habeas corpus review after being advised by counsel. No Federal court can grant relief unless the claim was not previously raised, resulted from a violation of the Constitution, or is based on a new retroactively applicable fundamental right recognized by the Supreme Court. The filing of a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus is authorized by the court of appeals if new facts could undermine confidence in the jury's guilty verdict or the validity of the death sentence. The filing of a habeas corpus petition must be done within 60 days after an order is issued in compliance with specific requirements. Time limits can be extended under certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court for review of a capital sentence. The filing of a habeas corpus petition must be done within 60 days, with the possibility of a 60-day extension granted for good cause shown by the State prisoner's counsel. A notice of appeal must be filed within 20 days of the district court judgment in a claim under this chapter. The petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court must be filed within 20 days of the court of appeals mandate. When a State prisoner files a habeas corpus petition, the district court will determine the sufficiency of the evidentiary record and may conduct a hearing if necessary. The district court will rule on the claims within the time limits set by law. A district court may only consider a successive claim under this chapter if the petitioner seeks leave to file in the appropriate court of appeals. The time limits established by this chapter apply to all further proceedings under the successive petition. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause does not apply to habeas corpus cases under this chapter. The provision of counsel services to indigents in capital cases includes representation for those charged with offenses seeking capital punishment, those sentenced to death appealing in State and Supreme Court, and the appointment of counsel by a court of record. In capital cases, provision of counsel includes representation for those seeking capital punishment or appealing death sentences, with appointed attorneys needing certification by a statewide authority. In capital cases, provision of counsel includes representation by defender organizations, private bar members, or capital litigation resource centers with staff attorneys. The certification authority must certify qualified attorneys for capital cases, publish certification procedures and standards, review certified attorneys regularly, and withdraw certification from those who do not meet performance standards. In states without a statewide public defender system, meeting certain requirements is sufficient. In states without a statewide public defender system, attorneys appointed before trial must demonstrate continuing competence to represent indigents in capital cases. At least one appointed attorney must have been admitted to practice for 5 years and have at least 3 years of experience. In states without a statewide public defender system, attorneys appointed before trial must demonstrate continuing competence to represent indigents in capital cases. At least one appointed attorney must have been admitted to practice for 5 years and have at least 3 years of experience. After trial appointments require an attorney with 5 years of practice and 3 years of felony trial experience. Another attorney may be appointed for good cause based on their background, knowledge, or experience. Upon a finding in ex parte proceedings, the court shall authorize the defendant's attorney to obtain investigative, expert, or other necessary services for the defendant's representation. The court may also order the payment of fees and expenses for such services. The compensation for appointed attorneys and fees for authorized services shall be fixed by the court. Sec. 2267 authorizes necessary services at determined rates for habeas corpus cases. Sec. 2268 sets time requirements for district court and appeals in such cases. The text establishes time limits for the granting, denial, or partial denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and for the Supreme Court to act on a petition for a writ of certiorari in cases brought under this chapter within 90 days. The Administrative Office of United States Courts is required to report annually to Congress on the courts' compliance with these time limits. Section 2254 of Title 28, United States Code is amended to include special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. An applicant in a capital case is considered to have exhausted state remedies when they have exhausted any right to direct appeal in the state."
