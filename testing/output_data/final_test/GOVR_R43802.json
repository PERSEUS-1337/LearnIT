    "content": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides two types of assistance for winter incidents: \"snow assistance\" and assistance for \"severe winter storms.\" These are triggered by a presidential disaster declaration based on criteria such as snow accumulations for snow assistance and severity of the event for severe winter storms. Requests for assistance must include estimated costs and are divided by the statewide population to measure per capita impact. This report outlines the process and criteria for providing assistance after a major disaster declaration for winter incidents. It includes historical data on obligations from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and explains the two forms of presidential action under the Stafford Act for authorizing federal assistance through FEMA. Emergency declarations are authorized to provide federal assistance to states and localities through FEMA to protect property and public health and safety. They are made prior to a recognized threat, such as Hurricane Katrina, to supplement local and state efforts. In contrast, major disaster declarations are made after the event to help communities and individuals recover from the damage caused. FEMA policy differentiates between snowstorms and severe winter storms. According to FEMA, a snowstorm is an event with record or near record snowfall that overwhelms state and local governments. Severe winter storms include snow, ice, high winds, blizzard conditions, causing physical damage. Prior to 2009, FEMA provided federal assistance for snow removal costs for a limited period. In 2009, new regulations allowed snow-related events to be defined as major disasters. The change aimed to align FEMA's snow policy with new regulations. The change in FEMA's snow policy in 2009 aligned it with the Stafford Act, allowing snow-related events to be considered for major disaster declarations. This revised policy no longer evaluates snow assistance requests under the criteria for an emergency declaration. The 2008 proposed policy for snow assistance was revised in 2009 by FEMA, allowing snow-related events to be considered for major disaster declarations. Data from 2009 to 2014 shows an increase in the number of declarations and federal funding for winter storm incidents since the new policy was implemented. The average annual number of major disaster declarations associated with winter storms increased from 7.5 to 12.4 between 2008 and 2013. Federal obligations also rose from $274 million to $508 million per year during the same period. Winter storms involve more obligations from certain FEMA programs, with nearly 80% of obligations for debris removal and infrastructure repair coming from the Public Assistance Program. The Stafford Act outlines procedures for requesting federal disaster assistance, requiring a governor or tribal leader to make the request for a major disaster declaration. In the case of winter storms, counties must have significant snowfall records, and the state or tribal government must demonstrate their capabilities to receive assistance. The tribal government must demonstrate that their capabilities to respond to the winter storm are exceeded. Requests for snow assistance must be submitted within 30 days of the snowstorm, including an overview of the incident, snowfall data from NWS and NCDC, county snow accumulations, and estimated costs of federal and nonfederal public assistance. FEMA calculates the per capita impact of the incident, with a threshold of $1.39. FEMA will make a recommendation for a major disaster declaration based on these factors. FEMA evaluates information and criteria to determine eligibility for a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. State and tribal governments must provide official snowfall data in their request for assistance. FEMA relies on government data to make declaration recommendations to the President, using snowfall measurements from NOAA, NCDC, and NWS sources. FEMA may also accept verified snowfall measurements from other sources. FEMA considers snowfall data from various sources, including NOAA, NCDC, and NWS, to determine eligibility for assistance. They define near record and record snowfall based on historical data. Snow assistance is available for costs incurred during overwhelming snow events. Snow assistance is available for eligible costs incurred over a continuous 48-hour period, extendable by 24 hours in counties with snowfall exceeding historical records by 50%. Assistance includes snow removal, deicing, and other measures to protect life and safety under FEMA's Category B. Federal assistance is available for immediate threats to life, public health, and safety during severe winter storms, including snow removal, search and rescue, and sheltering. State and tribal governments must notify FEMA of any insurance proceeds for snow assistance costs, which will be deducted from the anticipated amount. Assistance may also be provided for severe winter storms with snow, ice, high winds, blizzard conditions, or other wintry conditions causing physical damage or property loss. Governors or tribal leaders must follow specific procedures when requesting federal disaster assistance. Governors or tribal leaders must demonstrate that their capabilities to respond to severe winter storms will be exceeded when requesting federal disaster assistance. The estimated cost of assistance must be included in the request, but snow accumulations are not used as eligibility criteria. FEMA provides two types of assistance for severe winter storms: emergency work and permanent work, further divided into seven categories. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides two types of assistance for severe winter storms: emergency work and permanent work, divided into seven categories. Snow removal is often necessary for accessing downed power lines or damaged buildings during severe winter storms."
