    "content": "Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution tasks Congress with raising and supporting armies. Congress annually authorizes funds for the Army to modernize its ground combat systems. Congressional defense committees hold hearings on the Army's Budget Request and Modernization, as well as specific ground combat systems. Nations develop and improve ground combat systems based on technology, budgets, and observations from current conflicts. Nations modernize their ground combat systems based on technology, budgets, and observations from current conflicts. The U.S. Army's current fleet of main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and rocket systems was developed in the 1970s to counter the Soviet Union's forces. The U.S. Army's ground combat systems, developed in the 1970s to counter the Soviet Union, saw success in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. However, modernization efforts such as the Crusader SP artillery system and the Future Combat System were cancelled due to weight, cost, and unrealistic technology expectations. The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) replacement for the M-2 Bradley was also cancelled in 2014. These program cancellations have raised concerns about the Army's acquisition process. The 2011 Decker-Wagner Army Acquisition Review revealed that the Army had spent billions on canceled programs, representing a significant portion of its RDT&E budget. This raised doubts about the Army's ability to modernize its combat systems. Army leadership acknowledged the lack of new ground combat vehicle development and stated that current funding levels would keep the Bradley and Abrams in inventory for several more decades. The Army's Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) initiative aims to replace the Abrams and Bradley with a multi-decade effort expected to be completed by 2025. This effort includes four years of analysis and a focused science and technology push, with the first unit equipped in 2035. The Army anticipates relying on legacy systems for the next two decades as foreign armored vehicle capabilities could surpass existing U.S. systems. The Army's Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) initiative aims to replace legacy Cold War ground combat systems with new advanced systems. Limited funding and the U.S. defense acquisition process hinder similar U.S. developmental efforts, leading to delays and higher costs. The NGVC aims to replace legacy ground combat systems with new advanced ones, potentially including a single combat vehicle to replace the Abrams and Bradley. A clearer direction is needed to ensure program success and confidence in policymakers. Comparisons of tanks, IFVs, artillery systems, and MLRS are being made to stay competitive with modernizing enemies and allies. Many tank-producing countries prioritize protection over lethality or mobility in response to the proliferation of anti-armor weapons and improvised explosive devices. This emphasis is seen in the United States and Israel. Detailed technical military analysis of ground combat systems is classified, but general observations are provided for policy-related discussions. Many foreign tanks have incorporated an automatic loader for their main gun, allowing for a smaller design and potentially lighter vehicle. However, this can lead to a greater risk of jamming. Active protection systems (APS) are featured on some tanks to enhance crew survivability from various threats, but the U.S. has yet to field such a system. Some tanks, like the Israeli Merkava Mk 4 and Russian T-14 Aramata, have integral APS for better protection. Russian and Chinese tanks have larger caliber main guns for increased range and armor penetration. Main gun ammunition quality is crucial for lethality. Some tanks can also fire anti-tank guided missiles. Tanks now use FLIR, GPS, and thermal technology for fire control systems. The trend in IFV development is towards heavier vehicles, ranging from 20 to more than 60 tons, to address the proliferation of AT systems and combat operations in urban areas. The M-2A3 Bradley's 25 mm cannon is considered to be at a relative disadvantage compared to foreign counterparts with larger cannons, impacting its anti-armor capability. Many tracked IFVs, like the Bradley, have superior anti-armor capability and can fire ATGMS. Most countries design their IFVs to carry an infantry squad, with squad sizes varying from 6 to 8 soldiers. The M-2A3 Bradley cannot accommodate a full squad, but there are discussions about the advantages of having the squad split between two vehicles for combat resilience. Foreign IFVs may have APS for protection. The Army is exploring non-developmental and developmental APS options for the Bradley, considering weight and space constraints. The U.S. Army's Paladin howitzer lacks automation compared to top foreign self-propelled weapons like the PzH2000. Medium self-propelled howitzers with greater range and lethality are becoming more common. Paladin can compensate for range with expensive Excalibur rounds. The Paladin howitzer can make up for its range gap using expensive Excalibur rounds, but still falls short compared to top foreign self-propelled weapons like the PzH2000. A quick comparison shows the limitations of the U.S. system in delivering fires over a three-minute period, with the German platoon able to deliver 120 shells at distances up to 50 percent greater than Paladin's maximum range. U.S. MLRS systems are being outranged and have limited munition options according to RAND. The U.S. Army's MLRS and HIMARS rocket systems are falling behind in range compared to heavy foreign artillery rocket systems, particularly those developed by China. This trend has implications for the Army's fires system, as foreign rocket launchers can fire well over 100 km, while the U.S. systems have limited munition options. The Guided MLRS rocket is accurate but lacks a variety of munitions compared to foreign systems. The Army will need to replace a large portion of its rocket munitions due to limitations on submunitions in 2019. Observations from current conflicts and beliefs about future conflicts inform military modernization for ground combat systems in terms of lethality, survivability, mobility, and maintainability. The 2006 Israeli conflict in Lebanon and Gaza, along with ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, and Iraq, are seen as representative of the current operating environment and potential threats faced by the U.S. military. The 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel showcased how Hezbollah evolved into a \"hybrid\" force by acquiring advanced weaponry from other states like Russia and Iran. They used these weapons in hidden positions in southern Lebanon, creating challenges for Israeli forces unfamiliar with fighting such a well-equipped enemy. Israeli tank crews and commanders faced difficulties due to lack of training and knowledge in executing battle drills. The 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel highlighted Israeli training deficiencies in integrating heavy mortars and machine guns. This led to significant damage to Israeli armored vehicles, prompting changes in doctrine, training emphasis, and equipment acquisition. These changes improved performance and reduced casualties during combat operations in Gaza in 2014. The 2014 Ukrainian conflict reflects a closer interaction between Russia and Ukrainian separatists, using advanced weaponry not seen by the US since the Cold War. Russian forces supported separatists in Eastern Ukraine with advanced weaponry and conventional forces after annexing Crimea in 2014. This conflict provides insights for the US Army on the lethality of the modern battlefield, with Russian and separatist forces employing combined arms warfare and advanced weapons effectively. The Russian military in Ukraine is using advanced weaponry like tanks with 125mm guns, unmanned aerial systems for target location, and air defense systems that make it difficult for the Ukrainian Air Force to provide support. The battlefield in Eastern Ukraine requires armored vehicles for maneuvering. The Ukrainian battlefield demands mobile protected firepower, integration of all arms, and defenses against long-range artillery, UAS, air defenses, and tank protection systems. Russia's heavy use of electronic warfare in Ukraine includes identifying sources of fire and disrupting Ukrainian communications. In northern Ukraine, Russian electronic warfare (EW) took out Ukrainian tactical radios, caused UAVs to crash, and interfered with artillery shells. Russia may have jammed GPS signals, posing a threat to navigation and precision munitions. This could render combat vehicles ineffective and vulnerable. The Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria are combat ineffective and vulnerable to attack. They have significant ground military capabilities, including tanks, MANPADs, ATGMs, artillery, antiaircraft guns, and rocket launchers, mostly captured from Syrians and Iraqis. They have also acquired small arms and ammunition through capture or purchase. This shows that non-state groups can obtain modern weapons through various means. Russian military support of the Asad regime in Syria includes providing T-90 tanks and SA-17 air defense systems. This support has hindered U.S. air support missions for rebels in northern Syria. Alleged use of chemical weapons by Syrian government and ISIS adds complexity to the conflict. Russia's military campaign in Syria has also benefited Moscow. Russia's military campaign in Syria has showcased the efficiency of Russian weapons, leading to an increase in demand. Countries like Egypt, Iraq, and Libya have recently signed arms deals with Russia. The National Military Strategy identifies Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea as threats to national security interests. The National Military Strategy identifies Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea as threats to national security interests. Military Strategy notes the low but growing probability of U.S. involvement in interstate war with a major power. U.S. military officials assert that countering foreign combat systems exposes capability gaps in U.S. ground forces, putting future strategies at risk. This involves countering military formations, air defenses, ballistic missiles, and special operations forces on a new battlefield. The Russian T-90 and Chinese MBT-3000 tanks have export potential. The T-90 with new French Fire Control System and defensive systems has been effective in combat. The MBT-3000, developed for export, is digitized with advanced features. Both tanks have been exported to multiple countries. The MBT-3000 tank, developed for export, is said to have enhanced capabilities such as ERA and APS, a second-generation thermal imager, a laser range finder, and an autoloader for its 125mm smoothbore gun. China signed its first export deal for the MBT-3000 with the Royal Thai Army in May 2016. General Mark Milley predicts that future wars by 2030-2050 will be more lethal and fought in mega-cities, with a focus on cyber, electronic warfare, and robotics. Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensors will be prevalent, with the belief that \"If you can be seen, you will be hit.\" Future wars by 2030-2050 will be fought in mega-cities with a focus on cyber, electronic warfare, and robotics. General Milley emphasizes the need for small, dispersed, and constantly-moving formations to avoid being targeted. Air superiority will not be guaranteed, requiring integrated air and missile defense. The Army must learn to sink ships to be relevant in the Pacific and sustainment will be limited to combat essentials. Friendly ports will be attacked, requiring the Army to fight its way in. The future operating environment will involve fighting in mega-cities with a focus on cyber, electronic warfare, and robotics. General Milley stresses the need for small, dispersed formations to avoid being targeted. Air superiority cannot be guaranteed, necessitating integrated air and missile defense. The Army will have to fight its way into friendly ports that may be attacked. Many countries are upgrading their Cold War era equipment and developing new ground combat systems, posing implications for Army modernization efforts. Countries like Russia and China are developing new ground combat systems with advanced features, while the U.S. lacks new developments due to resource constraints and a lengthy acquisition process. This could lead to foreign systems surpassing U.S. counterparts, as allies modernize at a faster pace. The Army has acquired foreign-developed ground combat systems in the past, such as the Fuchs NBC reconnaissance vehicles from Germany. They also selected the General Dynamics Land Systems\u2013Canada LAV-3 8x8 for new brigade combat teams. This could have significant implications for U.S. ground combat operations and Army modernization priorities. The Army has a history of adopting foreign components for use, like the LAV-3 8x8 for new brigade combat teams. Currently, the Army is evaluating domestic and foreign APS for installation on U.S. ground combat vehicles. The cancelled GCV program evaluated options including the Israeli Namer IFV, German Puma IFV, and Swedish CV-90 IFV. The Congressional Budget Office released a report on the Army's Ground Combat Vehicle Program and Alternatives, which included options to purchase the Israeli Namer IFV, upgrade the U.S. Bradley IFV, or purchase the German Puma IFV. The Congressional Budget Office recommended purchasing the German Puma IFV as the most capable vehicle for the Army, noting that both the Puma and the upgraded Bradley would be more capable than the cancelled GCV. The study also highlighted the need to buy more Pumas due to their six-man seating capability and questioned the Army's urgency to acquire the GCV, which would not be widely fielded until 2032. The Congressional Budget Office recommended purchasing the German Puma IFV as the most capable vehicle for the Army, noting that both the Puma and the upgraded Bradley would be more capable than the cancelled GCV. The study estimated the total cost from 2014-2030 to continue the GCV program would be $28.8 billion while purchasing the Puma would cost $14.5 billion. The rise of foreign ground combat systems, lengthy development time, and defense budget constraints may prompt policymakers to consider acquiring existing foreign systems. The Army underwent a significant reduction in size, cutting the Active Duty force by more than 30%. This led to a decrease in certain types of units and capabilities, such as the absence of short-range air defense battalions in the Regular Army. The changing threat environment, highlighted by events in Ukraine and Syria, has underscored the need for a reevaluation of defense priorities. The lack of short-range air defense in the Regular Army and Army National Guard leaves U.S. ground forces vulnerable to enemy aerial systems. Additional short-range air defense units may be needed to protect ground combat units, and modernization programs should enhance protection against threat aerial systems. The National Commission on the Future of the Army recommends assessing field artillery capabilities, including changes in doctrine and war plans due to the Cluster Munitions ban and modernization needs. The National Commission on the Future of the Army recommends assessing field artillery capabilities, including changes in doctrine and war plans due to the Cluster Munitions ban and modernization needs. The examination of the Army highlights concerns about the impact of enemy artillery systems on U.S. combat operations, with a focus on increasing field artillery force structure and acquiring more capable systems. Russia's artillery capabilities are noted to surpass those of the U.S. Army. Russia and China have advanced artillery systems that outmatch U.S. Army capabilities, with a focus on long-range rockets and unmanned aerial systems for targeting. This poses a challenge for U.S. artillery forces, which face limitations in units, cluster munitions, and effective ranges. The U.S. Army faces significant battlefield challenges due to adversaries possessing longer range systems, a wider variety of munitions, and innovative target acquisition techniques. Modernization efforts include enhanced fire control systems, greater range capabilities, and new munitions like the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System Alternative Warhead. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union heavily invested in Electronic Warfare (EW) for security, command and control, reconnaissance, air defense, and camouflage. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union heavily invested in Electronic Warfare (EW) for security, command and control, reconnaissance, air defense, and camouflage. The Russian and Chinese armies have dedicated EW brigades and battalions, giving them a distinct advantage at the tactical level. Russia uses electronic warfare to deny communications, creating vulnerabilities for U.S. forces on the modern battlefield. Russian electronic warfare capabilities in Donbass region include disrupting electromagnetic communications, defeating unmanned aerial systems, artillery, and mortars, as well as targeting command and control nodes. This form of attack is considered highly effective and harder to trace, making it an attractive option for Russia in the conflict in Ukraine. The re-emergence of electronic warfare (EW) has implications for ground combat systems modernization, with efforts needed to reduce vehicle electromagnetic emissions and include redundant systems in design. Munitions should be hardened against EW attacks to prevent pre-detonation. RAND research highlighted the proliferation of EW capabilities in the Donbass region, showcasing Russia's effective use of EW in disrupting communications and targeting command nodes. The research on FLIR systems in MBTs and IFVs found a proliferation of modern FLIR technology among potential adversaries. Improvements in vehicle sensors are needed to maintain the battlefield advantage gained in 1991 and 2003. The Army should invest in research and development to enhance direct fire capability in all weather conditions. This will impact various combat vehicles, including MBTs, the Bradley, the Stryker MGS, and other systems with stabilized direct fire weapons. The Army is considering research and development options to maintain its direct fire advantage, including degrading FLIRs on foreign systems and exploring other sensor technologies. The upcoming M-1A2 SEP v4 Abrams will feature a third generation FLIR for better target identification. While the U.S. plans to upgrade its FLIR and FCS, other nations like Russia are also upgrading their MBTs. The report discusses Russian ground forces upgrading T-72 and T-90 MBTs with new target tracking and fire control systems similar to the T-14 MBT. Other nations are also enhancing their FLIR and FCS capabilities, prompting the Army to consider incorporating emerging sensor technologies into future combat systems. Many countries are adopting APS for their MBTs and IFVs, with examples like Turkey developing the AKKOR APS system for the Altay MBT. The Army is currently involved in two separate parallel APS efforts\u2014the Expedited NDI APS program and the Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) effort. The Expedited NDI APS program aims to field a \"hard kill\" APS capability for M-1 Abrams tanks, M-2/3 Bradley fighting vehicles, and M-1126 Stryker combat vehicles. In parallel, the MAPS effort is a modular framework to integrate commercial APS technologies. The Army is involved in two APS efforts - the Expedited NDI APS program for M-1 Abrams tanks, M-2/3 Bradley fighting vehicles, and M-1126 Stryker combat vehicles, and the Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) for integrating commercial APS technologies into combat vehicles. The Army may defer APS capability for ground combat vehicles until a more effective version is developed in the future, as indicated by comparisons of U.S. and foreign ground combat systems. The Army is exploring the incorporation of autoloaders for MBTs to increase rate of fire and potentially reduce crew size. There is a shift towards 30 and 40 mm main armament for tracked IFVs to engage both armored vehicles and buildings in urban environments. The Army's previous GCV effort included a 30 mm cannon, indicating a possible direction for future IFV modernization. The Army may pursue a 30 mm cannon for future tracked IFV modernization efforts, focusing on improving existing munitions and developing new ones like the XM1147 Advanced Multi-Purpose (AMP) 120 mm round. The AMP round will replace four tank rounds and target various threats including ATGM teams, infantry, concrete walls, bunkers, obstacles, and light armored vehicles. The AMP round will reinforce concrete walls, bunkers, obstacles, and light armored vehicles, joining the M-829A4 Armor-Piercing round to defeat threat armored vehicles with third-generation explosive reactive armor. The M109A6 Paladin, the U.S. Army's sole self-propelled howitzer, lacks the more powerful gun and automation of modern systems, resulting in lower range and burst rate of fire compared to foreign systems. The M109A6 Paladin, the U.S. Army's self-propelled howitzer, entered service in 1992 based on the M109 chassis from 1963. Previous attempts to replace it with newer systems like the Crusader and NLOS-C were unsuccessful. Paladin's age and low mobility are its weaknesses, leading to plans for a major upgrade called PIM, including a new chassis by BAE Systems with commonality to the Bradley family. This upgrade aims to address sustainment and mobility issues but not range and rate of fire limitations experienced in past operations. Modern artillery systems, like the PzH 2000, feature high levels of automation allowing for a high burst rate of fire and the ability to conduct Multiple Round Simultaneous Impact (MRSI) missions. The PzH 2000 has demonstrated firing a five-round MRSI against a target 17 km away. The U.S. military faces limitations in artillery ammunition due to the 2008 Cluster Munitions Ban. Solutions may involve developing new artillery systems and Cluster Munitions Ban-compliant munitions. Examples include the 5 Inch Multi Service-Standard Guided Projectile (SGP) with a range of 52 nautical miles and a variant with in-flight retargeting capabilities up to 70 kms. Another development is a round for effective counterbattery fires against longer-ranged enemy systems. The U.S. military is exploring new artillery systems and munitions to overcome limitations caused by the 2008 Cluster Munitions Ban. One potential solution is a 155mm ramjet powered projectile with a range of almost 200 kms for effective counterbattery fires. Developing new munitions could be costly and time-consuming, requiring stockpiles to meet warfighting requirements. Additionally, there is a recommendation to examine artillery force structure for potential modernization, which could involve equipping new artillery units with advanced systems like the M-109A6 Paladin. RAND's research report highlights the need for continued emphasis on increasing artillery rocket ranges to keep up with advancements in Russian systems. The latest Russian and Chinese rocket systems are surpassing GMLRS in range. Chinese rockets bridge the gap between rocket artillery and short-range ballistic missiles, with a variety of warhead types available. Russian and Chinese heavy rockets are typically controlled by higher-level headquarters for conventional missions. Army's rocket launchers lag behind foreign counterparts in range and capabilities. The Chinese Army's rocket launchers have limited warhead options compared to foreign counterparts, prompting a need for modernization. The Army may need to replace DPICM warheads and explore new warhead options for MLRS rockets to achieve greater ranges and capabilities. Additionally, the Army's Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) replacement for tactical rockets involves a new design with two rockets in a single launcher and new propulsion technology. The Army is looking to modernize its force, with a focus on air defense, ground mobility, and aviation survivability. General Mark Milley has mentioned a \"major effort\" to modernize the force in 2017, with a priorities list to be shared with Congress and the public soon. This modernization effort could involve developing a new MLRS with improved warheads and rockets, potentially leading to increased range and capabilities. The Army is focusing on modernizing its ground combat systems, including the integration of Active Protection Systems (APS) to counter threats like RPGs and ATGMs. Upgrading these systems is crucial as allies and adversaries enhance their own capabilities. Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) are artillery rounds or missiles filled with submunitions for area coverage, including anti-armor and antipersonnel types. Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) consists of high explosive between armor plates to damage penetrating weapons. Fire Control System (FCS) is used for targeting and aiming. The curr_chunk discusses the Fire Control System (FCS), Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR), High Explosive (HE), and Heavy Machine Gun (HMG) in military applications. FLIR uses thermal imaging for navigation and aiming in low visibility conditions. GMLRS refers to Guided MLRS Unitary. Gun (HMG) is a large caliber machine gun, GMLRS is a guided rocket system, NBC refers to Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical weapons, RPGs are rocket propelled grenades, TACMS is a tactical missile system, TOW is an anti-tank missile, and UAS are unmanned aerial systems."
