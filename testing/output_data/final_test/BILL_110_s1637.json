    "content": "GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION PROGRAM. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of General Services. A \"General Services Administration facility\" includes any building, structure, or facility used by the Federal Government, whether constructed, renovated, purchased, or leased by the Administrator. The Administrator of General Services can lease a General Services Administration facility to the Federal Government for a term of at least 5 years, or less than 5 years if cost-effective technologies are used. This includes buildings, structures, and associated energy-consuming support systems. The Administrator will establish a program to promote geothermal heat pump usage at General Services Administration facilities, ensuring coordination among federal agencies and providing technical assistance. The Administrator will conduct a review of current geothermal heat pump usage in General Services Administration facilities as part of the program to promote the technology. The review will examine the use of geothermal heat pumps in General Services Administration facilities and identify technology standards for all types of facilities. The Administrator will establish a geothermal heat pump technology acceleration program within 180 days of the Act's enactment to replace existing heating and cooling technologies in General Services Administration facilities. Within 1 year, a timetable with milestones will be set up to implement the program. The timetable for replacing existing heating and cooling technologies with geothermal heat pump technologies at General Services Administration facilities aims to be completed within 5 years of the Act's enactment. The Administrator must designate a manager for each General Services Administration facility to accelerate the use of geothermal heat pump technologies. A plan must be submitted to Congress within 5 years of the Act's enactment, detailing the funds needed for implementation. The section describes the status of implementing geothermal heat pump technologies at General Services Administration facilities, including program compliance, funding status, and identifying procedures hindering implementation. The section recommends uniform standards for Federal agencies to implement geothermal heat pump technologies and practices, reviews budget processes for capital programs to retain savings from using these technologies, and identifies cost savings in the short and long term. The section recommends uniform standards for Federal agencies to implement geothermal heat pump technologies and practices, achieving substantial operational cost savings through the application of these technologies. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of recommendations outlined in the section."
