    "content": "The Making Work Pay (MWP) credit provided up to $400 for individuals or $800 for joint returns per year in 2009 and 2010. To qualify, individuals needed earned income and a valid Social Security number. The credit phased out for those making over $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns) and excluded pension income. Noncitizens without valid Social Security numbers were ineligible. The credit reduced income tax withheld from paychecks. The MWP credit reduced income tax withheld from individuals' paychecks, resulting in higher take-home pay. The IRS issued revised withholding tables in 2009, affecting all individuals subject to income tax withholding. Taxpayers not eligible for the credit may have found their taxes underwithheld, leading to lower refunds or owed taxes during the 2009 or 2010 tax year. For example, an individual who received the full $400 MWP credit could have ended up with a tax liability of $200 for 2009. The IRS issued Notice 1036-P on May 14, 2009, providing an optional withholding schedule for pension plan payments to offset potential underwithholding. Some pension plans did not adopt this schedule, continuing to use the previous withholding table. In 2010, IRS Publication 15 included a method for calculating additional withholding for pension payments. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported on November 4, 2009, that millions of taxpayers may have been affected by changes in withholding tables for pension payments in 2010. 15.4 million taxpayers, including dependents, single taxpayers with multiple jobs, joint filers with multiple jobs, and taxpayers with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers, were identified as the most likely to be impacted. The MWP credit required valid Social Security Numbers for eligibility. Pension income was not considered earned income for the credit. Social Security recipients could receive a one-time $250 payment under ARRA. The MWP credit was reduced by any ARRA payments received. Taxpayers who received both the MWP credit and the Social Security payment had to repay the excess. The IRS was conducting outreach to increase awareness of the MWP credit and offering waivers for estimated tax penalties. The estimated tax penalty applies to individuals who fail to have enough income tax withheld throughout the year due to the expiration of the MWP tax credit in 2010. The MWP tax credit provided a federal income tax credit of 6.2% of wages up to $400 ($800 for married couples) in tax years 2009 and 2010. The MWP tax credit expired in 2010, leading to higher federal income tax withholding for individuals receiving pension payments in 2011. This resulted in lower income tax refunds or larger tax amounts due with their returns. The MWP tax credit expired in 2010, causing higher federal income tax withholding for pension payments in 2011. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended certain tax provisions until December 31, 2012, including a payroll tax holiday reducing the Social Security payroll tax for 2011. The MWP tax credit expired in 2010, causing higher federal income tax withholding for pension payments in 2011. Provisions extended under ARRA include Earned Income Tax Credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and child tax credit. P.L. 112-78 extended the 2% reduction in Social Security payroll taxes through February 29, 2012, and P.L. 112-96 extended it through the end of 2012. The MWP tax credit was equal to 6.2% of wages, with a maximum credit of $400 for single filers and $800 for married filers. Adjusted gross income (AGI) includes various types of income such as rental, interest, and royalty income. Salaries and wages made up 72.0% of AGI for 2008 tax returns. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the dollar amounts available for single and married filers under the MWP tax credit and the Social Security payroll tax holiday. For individuals earning less than $20,000, the MWP tax credit in 2010 exceeded the reduction in payroll taxes in 2011. The reduction in Social Security payroll taxes plateaued for individuals with higher incomes. The reduction in Social Security payroll taxes plateaued at $2,136 due to the maximum amount of wages subject to the tax in 2011. Married filers making less than $40,000 received more from the MWP tax credit than the reduction in payroll taxes. For those with wages of $40,000, the MWP tax credit equaled the reduction in Social Security payroll taxes. Workers with income over $95,000 ($190,000 for married filers) benefited from the payroll tax holiday if they were not eligible for the MWP tax credit. In 2009, 2.4 million filers had wage income of $95,000 or more and may not have received the MWP tax credit but could get a 2% reduction in Social Security payroll taxes. Of the 49.9 million married couples, 3.4 million had wages of $190,000 or more and may not have received the MWP tax credit but could receive the 2% reduction in Social Security payroll taxes. Workers earning less than $20,000 may find the reduction in payroll taxes in 2011 was less than the MWP tax credit they received in 2010. For example, someone with annual wages of $14,500 would have received a $400 MWP tax credit in 2010, while their payroll tax reduction in 2011 would have been $290. In 2009, 41.5% of single households had wages below $20,000, while 24.2% of married households had wages below $40,000. Approximately 27.4% of state and local government workers were not covered by Social Security in 2009. The percentage varied widely by state, ranging from 3.1% in New York to 97.4% in Ohio. H.R. 772, the Extended Tax Relief for All Act of 2011, aimed to extend the MWP tax credit through December 31, 2011, and adjust it based on the Social Security Payroll Tax reduction. Larry Summers mentioned that some workers might benefit more from the MWP tax credit than the payroll tax holiday, but P.L. 111-312 included expiring tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for third children and the American Opportunity Tax Credit. Larry Summers discussed the impact of the payroll tax holiday compared to the Making Work Pay credit, highlighting a potential $80 difference for minimum-wage workers. The proposal in question also includes three refundable tax credits for families with incomes above $3,000. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of a compromise bill, including refundable tax credits, unemployment insurance benefits, and potential GDP growth. The bill provides more support for a $16,000-a-year family compared to no deal or the House bill. When considering the compromise bill, it is important to look at the overall program rather than comparing individual provisions with other bills."
