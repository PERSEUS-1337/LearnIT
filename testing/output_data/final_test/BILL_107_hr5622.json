    "content": "The \"Trade Enhancement Act of 2002\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Congress finds that recent financial crises in closed markets highlight the importance of open, competitive markets for the international economic system. Restrictive foreign policies and barriers contribute to a growing US trade deficit and harm US industries by limiting exports and enabling dumping. The World Trade Organization agreements do not effectively address market access barriers, including joint public-private barriers, which burden US and global commerce. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also falls short in addressing these barriers. The investigative abilities of the United States Trade Representative are limited. The United States Trade Representative found that Canada granted the Canadian Wheat Board special monopoly rights disadvantaging US wheat farmers and refused to provide necessary information for the investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 301(D) OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974. Amendment to Section 301(d)(4)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974 defines unjustifiable acts, policies, or practices as those that violate US international legal rights or promote anticompetitive activities that restrict access of US goods/services in foreign markets or divert foreign goods/services to the US market. Amendment to Section 301(d)(3)(B)(i)(IV) of the Trade Act of 1974 addresses the toleration of anticompetitive activities by foreign governments that restrict access of US goods/services in foreign markets or divert foreign goods/services to the US market. Amendment to Section 304 of the Trade Act of 1974. Amendment to Section 304 of the Trade Act of 1974 includes changes regarding private anticompetitive conduct determination and referral to the Attorney General. Amendment to Section 304 of the Trade Act of 1974 now includes referral to the Attorney General for investigation of anticompetitive practices. SEC. 103. Transition rule for outstanding determinations by the Trade Representative. The United States Trade Representative has the authority to review preexisting determinations to identify any remaining burdens on U.S. commerce or anticompetitive practices. These determinations must be made within 120 days of a request by the original petitioner or its legal successor-in-interest. The United States Trade Representative can review previous determinations to address any remaining burdens on U.S. commerce or anticompetitive practices. This review process includes giving interested parties a chance to comment and referring any ongoing anticompetitive conduct to the Attorney General. SEC. 104 of the Sherman Act is amended to include a new section, SEC. 7A, outlining procedures following a referral from the Trade Representative. Upon referral from the United States Trade Representative, the Attorney General will investigate potential violations of the Trade Act of 1974. Following the investigation, the Attorney General will determine if there is reason to believe that any provisions of the Act have been violated within 180 days of the referral. The Attorney General will investigate potential Trade Act violations referred by the Trade Representative. If complex issues arise, the Attorney General must notify and make a determination within 270 days. If the determination is affirmative, the Attorney General will seek injunctive relief in a district court. The Attorney General may seek relief through a court against those violating the Trade Act or submit a report to Congress explaining reasons for not taking action. The Attorney General may seek relief through a court or report to Congress for not taking action against violations of the Trade Act. Relief may include agreements to cease conduct, foreign enforcement actions, or impossibility of obtaining personal information. The Attorney General may seek relief through a court or report to Congress for not taking action against violations of the Trade Act. Relief may include agreements to cease conduct, foreign enforcement actions, or impossibility of obtaining personal jurisdiction over individuals in compliance with due process under the US Constitution. In the interests of comity, actions should consider factors such as the significance of conduct in the US compared to abroad, the nationality of those involved, and the intent to affect the US. The Attorney General may seek relief through court or report to Congress for violations of the Trade Act that affect US consumers, markets, or exporters. Factors considered include the significance of conduct in the US compared to abroad, conflict with foreign law, and enforcement activities of other countries. The Attorney General will submit a report to Congress within 30 days if a negative determination is made regarding violations of the Trade Act that impact US consumers, markets, or exporters. The report will compare enforcement actions by foreign countries to those taken by the United States. The Attorney General will submit a report to Congress within 30 days explaining the determination made regarding violations of the Trade Act. The report will compare enforcement actions by foreign countries to those taken by the United States. TITLE II--ADVERSE INFERENCES BY TRADE REPRESENTATIVE\n\nSEC. 201. ADVERSE INFERENCE WARRANTED. This section adds a new provision to the Trade Act of 1974 regarding adverse inferences. In determining non-cooperation under section 304, the Trade Representative may use adverse inferences if a foreign government fails to comply with information requests. This may include relying on information from other US agencies and interested parties. The Trade Representative may use adverse inferences if a foreign person fails to cooperate by not complying with information requests.
