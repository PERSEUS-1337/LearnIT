The \"SMART Research and Development Compact\" Act recognizes the common Mid-Atlantic region shared by Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. This region boasts 618 colleges and universities, including 38 leading engineering colleges with diverse research programs in science and technology. Additionally, there are federally owned laboratories dedicated to research and development in various fields. The Mid-Atlantic region, encompassing Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, is rich in private manufacturers, laboratories, and nonprofit organizations focused on various scientific and technological fields. Increased cooperation between these institutions and state governments can enhance the region's contribution to the United States in science and technology. An organization can link institutions across jurisdictions and promote partnerships to effectively use limited funding resources in the United States. The Congress consents to the SMART Research and Development Compact between Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The compact outlines the terms and conditions for collaboration in research and development efforts. The SMART Organization aims to promote research and development in the Mid-Atlantic region by facilitating funding and fostering partnerships among various entities in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The compact between Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania takes effect upon ratification by two or more of these states, with the consent of Congress. The SMART Organization is established by party States with a Board of Directors representing each state and technology class. The Board oversees projects, administration, and policies, utilizing technology-designated Working Groups for goal identification and funding sources. The SMART Organization's Board of Directors and Working Groups identify goals, funding sources, and technology advances for the region. They hold regular quarterly meetings and may conduct studies, acquire funds and property, cooperate with other groups, and adopt necessary rules and procedures. The SMART Organization's Board of Directors and Working Groups oversee technology development and other necessary functions to achieve the organization's goals. The Organization Board of Directors and Technology Working Groups may represent various technology classes, with the ability to designate new classes and remove existing ones. The Board of Directors appoints a full-time executive director familiar with scientific funding, research, and development. The director administers Working Groups and may hire staff. The director serves at the pleasure of the Board. The compact remains in force until a party State gives notice of withdrawal. The Congress reserves the right to alter, amend, or repeal the Act."
