    "content": "The \"External Regulation of the Department of Energy Act\" eliminates the Department of Energy's regulatory authority over nuclear safety and occupational safety and health responsibilities, transferring them to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission takes over nuclear safety regulatory and enforcement responsibilities from the Department of Energy for its facilities. The Commission can regulate the Department and its contractors through licensing. Contractors operating Department-owned facilities are not liable for decommissioning costs. No enforcement action can be taken against them for violations. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission assumes regulatory responsibilities from the Department of Energy for its facilities, including decommissioning. A memorandum of understanding will establish decommissioning procedures by January 1, 2002. The Commission will administer these responsibilities, not the States. Chapter 21 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is repealed, and the Commission will create a dedicated organizational element. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will establish a dedicated organizational element for regulating defense nuclear facilities within the Department of Energy. They will utilize available resources for this purpose. Additionally, any final orders or regulations issued by the Commission for Department of Energy facilities will be subject to judicial review. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will regulate Department of Energy facilities to ensure compliance with standards and regulations. Contractors must adhere to employee protection laws, and conflict of interest rules apply to contracts entered into by the Commission. SEC. 4. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH. Effective October 1, 2001, OSHA assumes regulatory and enforcement responsibilities for Department of Energy facilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Contractors at these facilities are considered employers under the Act. If a hazard at a Department facility poses an occupational exposure risk, OSHA regulates both radiological and non-radiological components. Effective October 1, 2001, OSHA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will share regulatory and enforcement responsibilities for occupational exposure hazards at Department of Energy facilities. Before January 1, 2001, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will establish a memorandum of understanding regarding nuclear and occupational safety at Department of Energy facilities. The Department of Energy's contractor will not be subject to civil penalties for actions taken before October 1, 2001, in preparation for the transfer of regulatory responsibilities. The Secretary of Energy will indemnify Department-owned facilities as per the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Additionally, there is a reporting requirement for the Department of Energy. The Secretary of Energy must submit a plan by April 1, 2001, to terminate the Department's regulatory responsibilities for its facilities. The plan should include a transition schedule, coordination with other agencies, and unresolved issues. The Secretary of Energy must submit a plan by April 1, 2001, to terminate the Department's regulatory responsibilities for its facilities, including unresolved issues with external regulators and cost estimates for self-regulation. The implementation of this Act will result in staff reductions at facilities."
