    "content": "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) was signed by President Bush after ongoing efforts in Congress to develop comprehensive energy legislation. The final version of H.R. 6 had significant differences from the House and Senate versions, particularly in environmental provisions such as limits on MTBE use and a renewable fuel mandate for gasoline. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) included provisions such as limits on MTBE use, a renewable fuel mandate for gasoline, stricter regulation of underground storage tanks, climate change initiatives, and incentives for alternative fuels and vehicles. Title XV of the law addressed gasoline additives like MTBE and ethanol under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The focus was on major environmental issues in the debate, with a discussion of key provisions related to environmental regulations and renewable energy standards. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions to limit MTBE use in reformulated gasoline to improve air quality. Many states have banned or regulated MTBE due to groundwater contamination concerns. The Act repealed the Clean Air Act requirement for oxygenates in RFG, reducing the incentive for refiners to use MTBE. The repeal took effect in 2006, except in California where it was immediate in 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the Clean Air Act requirement for oxygenates in reformulated gasoline, leading to a ban on MTBE in motor vehicle fuel nationwide. The law now mandates an increasing amount of gasoline to contain renewable fuels like ethanol, with specific gallon requirements each year until 2012. Funds were also authorized for cleaning up MTBE contamination in groundwater. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the Clean Air Act requirement for oxygenates in reformulated gasoline, banning MTBE in motor vehicle fuel nationwide. The law includes \"anti-backsliding\" provisions to maintain emissions reductions achieved by the RFG program, with baseline emissions set at 2001 and 2002 levels. The controversial \"safe harbor\" provision for fuels containing MTBE, which would have shielded manufacturers and retailers from liability, was dropped in conference. The House version of the bill had set a retroactive effective date of September 5, 2003, for the safe harbor provision, protecting oil and chemical industry defendants from defective product claims in lawsuits filed after that date. Both the House and Senate versions of the bill included a safe harbor for producers of renewable fuels, like ethanol, which was less controversial but ultimately dropped from the enacted version. The enacted legislation (P.L. 109-58) amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to use funds from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for enforcing UST leak prevention regulations and remediation of gasoline tank leaks involving MTBE and other oxygenated fuels. It introduces new leak prevention provisions, requirements for states, EPA, and tank owners, and modifies the UST regulatory program to address groundwater contamination from leaking tanks. The LUST Trust Fund was established in 1986 to help clean up leaking petroleum USTs. Issues include the discovery of MTBE at many sites, which spreads easily and is costly to remediate. States lack resources to oversee the UST regulatory program effectively. Subtitle B, based on the House bill, adds leak prevention provisions to the UST program. It mandates compliance inspections every three years, prohibits fuel delivery to ineligible tanks, and requires training for tank operators. It also expands compliance requirements for federal facilities and addresses releases on tribal lands. Additionally, it considers the ability of tank owners to pay for cleanup while maintaining business operations. The enacted law allows EPA and states to use LUST funds for inspections and enforcement of UST release prevention requirements. States must require new tanks near water sources to be secondarily contained or have evidence of financial responsibility for corrective actions. The law also mandates certification for UST installers and authorizes appropriations from the LUST Trust Fund. Subtitle authorizes appropriations from the LUST Trust Fund for cleaning up petroleum tank leaks and responding to leaks involving oxygenated fuel additives. It also authorizes funds for EPA and states to administer the cleanup program and enforce leak prevention requirements. Title XVI establishes a national program to promote less-carbon-intensive technology for reducing greenhouse gases. Title XVI establishes a national program to promote less-carbon-intensive technology for reducing greenhouse gases, encouraging voluntary reductions in emissions and supporting actions to reduce U.S. carbon intensity. The law does not mandate emission reductions but includes a program to export carbon intensity-reducing technologies to developing countries. The Senate bill included a resolution attributing greenhouse gas accumulation to human activities and calling for a comprehensive national program, which was dropped in conference. The Senate debated a resolution calling for a national program to limit greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy, encouraging global action. This resolution followed previous concerns about economic impacts and the need for developing countries to participate in emission control efforts. The Senate also considered an amendment similar to the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2005, which proposed a mandatory cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions. The Senate rejected a mandatory cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions to year 2000 levels by 2010. Climate change has been a congressional concern for over two decades, with various voluntary and regulatory actions proposed, including monitoring utility emissions and promoting renewable energy sources. Legislative action has been hindered by debates over the causes and costs of greenhouse gas reduction strategies. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, focusing on voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gas intensity. Section 323 of P.L. 109-58 provides a permanent exemption from Clean Water Act stormwater runoff rules for oil and gas exploration facilities. Section 323 of P.L. 109-58 exempts oil and gas exploration facilities from Clean Water Act stormwater runoff rules, including construction activities. EPA's Phase II stormwater program requires small construction sites and municipal storm sewer systems to have discharge permits to prevent pollution from entering water bodies. The Phase II stormwater program required construction sites larger than five acres, including oil and gas facilities, to obtain discharge permits. EPA granted a two-year extension for small oil and gas construction sites to assess economic impact. GAO reported uncertainty on the number of affected oil and gas construction activities and their financial and environmental implications. The EPA extended the exemption for small oil and gas construction sites until June 2006, with a proposed rule by September 2005. Section 323 of the law makes the regulatory delay permanent for all oil and gas development sites. Industry argued that the stormwater rule creates unnecessary permitting requirements, while supporters claim it clarifies existing CWA language. Opponents dispute that oil and gas construction causes less pollution than other activities. The legislative provision in House-passed H.R. 6 exempts uncontaminated stormwater discharges from the Clean Water Act at oil and gas sites. EPA is expected to develop a new rule for contaminated stormwater discharges from oil and gas operations. Section 322 of P.L. 109-58 amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to exclude certain fluids used in hydraulic fracturing operations. The legislative provision in House-passed H.R. 6 exempts uncontaminated stormwater discharges from the Clean Water Act at oil and gas sites. EPA is expected to develop a new rule for contaminated stormwater discharges from oil and gas operations. Section 322 of P.L. 109-58 amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to exclude certain fluids (including diesel fuels) used in hydraulic fracturing operations related to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities, removing EPA's authority to regulate underground injection for hydraulic fracturing purposes. The practice of hydraulic fracturing for coalbed methane production involves injecting fluids into coal beds to enhance oil and gas recovery. Water-based and diesel fluids, along with toxic chemicals like methanol, are commonly used. Concerns have been raised about the large volumes of fluids injected into each well, ranging from 55,000 to 350,000 gallons. EPA reports growing concerns about the environmental impact of this practice. The EPA has reported that hydraulic fracturing for coalbed methane production can introduce toxic and carcinogenic substances into underground sources of drinking water. Fracturing can also create pathways for contaminants to enter drinking water aquifers, raising concerns about the impact on water resources, especially in water-scarce regions. The National Drinking Water Advisory Council raised concerns about hydraulic fracturing, underground injection control, and coalbed methane production's impact on water quality. They recommended eliminating the use of diesel fuel and toxic additives in fracturing fluids. EPA entered into a voluntary agreement with three major hydraulic fracturing service providers to address these concerns. The EPA entered into a voluntary agreement with major hydraulic fracturing service providers to remove diesel fuel from fluids injected into drinking water sources. The National Drinking Water Advisory Council recommended further study on the public health and environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing for coalbed methane production. Oil and gas industry representatives argue against regulation, citing potential delays in natural gas development. In response to a 1997 court decision and citizen complaints about water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, the EPA studied the impacts of hydraulic fracturing in coalbed methane production on drinking water sources. A draft report in 2002 identified water quality issues in several states, but the EPA tentatively concluded that the health threats were small. A final report in 2004 stated that hydraulic fracturing fluids in CBM wells posed little threat to underground drinking water sources and required no further study. The EPA studied the impacts of hydraulic fracturing in coalbed methane production on drinking water sources. The final report in 2004 concluded that hydraulic fracturing fluids in CBM wells posed little threat to underground drinking water sources. EPA noted the lack of research on the environmental impacts of injecting fracturing fluids and the difficulty in estimating the concentration of diesel fuel components beyond the injection point. The report has faced criticism and the EPA Inspector General has been asked to review a whistle-blower's claims. P.L. 109-58 includes provisions for hydrogen and fuel cell research to promote alternative fuels and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Title VIII of P.L. 109-58 authorizes $3.3 billion for hydrogen fuel and fuel cell R&D over FY2006-FY2010, with the House version proposing $4.0 billion and the Senate bill $3.2 billion. The law also funds a nuclear plant for electricity and hydrogen production. Funding for hydrogen R&D has been increasing since FY2003, with the Bush Administration seeking $1.8 billion for FY2004-FY2008. This represents a significant boost in research funding. The enacted law, P.L. 109-58, authorizes research on vehicle energy efficiency, promotes domestic production and sale of hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles, establishes tax credits for alternative fuel vehicles, and provides grant funding for replacing diesel engines with alternative fuel technologies. Section 241 of P.L. 109-58 allows applicants for hydroelectric licenses increased flexibility in complying with federal agency conditions. The enacted law, P.L. 109-58, grants federal agencies the authority to impose conditions on FERC licenses, such as building fish passageways, scheduling water releases, and controlling erosion. These conditions can bring environmental benefits but may also increase costs and limit operational flexibility. The law allows entities to propose alternative license conditions, which federal agencies must consider. The law grants federal agencies the authority to impose conditions on FERC licenses, including building fish passageways and controlling erosion. Entities can propose alternative license conditions that agencies must consider. Agencies issuing conditions must provide FERC with a written statement demonstrating equal consideration of various factors. The impact of this equal consideration clause on agencies' resources and responsibilities remains to be seen. P.L. 109-58 amends conditions for Alaska's small hydroelectric dams regulation. Alaska can now decide against certain conditions if they don't align with FERC licensing and regulation goals. The State of Alaska is finalizing regulations for small hydroelectric dams, aligning with FERC licensing goals. Section 1443 of H.R. 6 would extend deadlines for ozone nonattainment areas if upwind areas significantly contribute to their nonattainment. The enacted law does not include the provision to extend deadlines for ozone nonattainment areas affected by upwind sources of pollution, as proposed in Section 1443 of H.R. 6. Instead, it establishes a demonstration project in Western Michigan to address upwind pollution issues. EPA is required to collaborate with State and local officials to assess alternatives for achieving compliance with the 8-hour ozone standard. The enacted law establishes a demonstration project in Western Michigan to address upwind pollution issues and collaborate with State and local officials to assess alternatives for achieving compliance with the 8-hour ozone standard. EPA is prohibited from imposing requirements or sanctions during the project. The law includes provisions to expedite environmental requirements for energy projects, known as \"streamlining,\" particularly for complex federal actions like oil and gas development projects. The enacted law includes provisions for streamlining environmental requirements for energy projects to expedite federal authorizations and comply with NEPA. These provisions aim to coordinate interagency consultations and facilitate the completion of applicable environmental requirements. Federal authorizations may be needed for energy projects under various local, state, tribal, or federal regulations. Compliance with NEPA is required for all federal actions impacting the environment. NEPA compliance is required for all federal actions impacting the environment, necessitating consideration of environmental impacts before final decisions. Significant actions require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), while those with unclear impacts need an Environmental Assessment (EA). Projects with no significant effects are categorically excluded from EIS or EA requirements. Streamlining provisions for NEPA aim to expedite federal authorizations for energy projects. Streamlining provisions for NEPA aim to expedite federal authorizations by designating a lead agency, coordinating interagency consultations, and specifying categorical exclusions. Some argue these provisions are necessary to reduce delays and efficiently deliver projects. Environmental streamlining provisions aim to expedite federal authorizations for various projects, including geothermal leasing, natural gas facilities, oil and gas leasing, right-of-way corridors, and commercial development on federal land. Public land can be used for natural gas pipelines and utility facilities. Environmental permitting is required for new petroleum refineries. Specific actions by the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture managing public lands will be presumed as categorical exclusions under NEPA if conducted for oil or gas exploration. Individual surface disturbances of less than 5 acres are allowed under certain conditions. The lease for drilling oil or gas wells is limited to 150 acres, with specific conditions for site-specific analysis. Activities such as drilling in previously used locations, within developed fields, or placing pipelines in approved corridors are allowed under certain circumstances. Maintenance of minor activities is also permitted. The energy debate in the 109th Congress includes discussions on approving energy-related actions. The 109th Congress debated whether to allow energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. The House proposed opening ANWR to energy leasing with environmental stipulations and revenue allocation changes, while the Senate version had no ANWR development provisions. Ultimately, the enacted law did not include ANWR development provisions. The enacted law dropped ANWR development provisions, with the debate likely to resurface during reconciliation for the FY2006 budget. The Senate's H.R. 6 included a renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS), but it was removed in conference. An RPS sets a minimum requirement for electricity production from renewable resources or tradable credits. A proposed amendment to add an RPS to H.R. 6 was rejected by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 6 included a renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) with initial targets set for 2008 and reaching 10% by 2020. Proponents highlighted benefits such as reduced electricity bills, while opponents raised concerns about exclusion of existing hydropower facilities and renewable energy resource limits. The RPS was ultimately removed in conference, with projections showing renewable energy peak generation slightly greater than 500 billion kWh by 2020. The proposed renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) aimed to increase production from new renewable energy sources, excluding existing hydropower and municipal solid waste facilities. \"Existing renewable energy\" referred to electricity from already operational solar, wind, geothermal, ocean, or biomass facilities, while \"new renewable energy\" would come from facilities placed in service after the RPS enactment. Additional incentives were proposed for production on Indian land and from distributed generators. The proposed federal RPS aimed to increase production from new renewable energy sources, with incentives for production on Indian land and from distributed generators smaller than one megawatt. Retailers could meet targets through direct generation, purchases of renewable energy, or tradable credits. Tradable credits had a cost cap and surplus generation credits could be carried forward. Noncompliance penalties would be imposed, and DOE collections would fund state grants to promote renewables. State grants are provided to promote renewables, particularly in states with a low renewable energy capacity. Retail suppliers exempted include those in Hawaii and those producing less than four million megawatt-hours of electricity annually."
