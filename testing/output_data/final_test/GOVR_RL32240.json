    "content": "Federal regulation is a key tool used by the government to implement public policy. The rulemaking process is essential in translating laws passed by Congress into specific requirements. Federal agencies issue over 3,000 final rules annually on a wide range of topics. The rulemaking process is crucial for federal agencies to implement public policy by developing, amending, or repealing rules. The costs and benefits of federal regulations are a subject of controversy, with costs estimated in the billions and benefits even higher. The Administrative Procedure Act defines a rule as an agency statement designed to implement law or policy. Figure 1 illustrates the basic process most agencies follow in writing or revising a significant rule. The rulemaking process involves agencies implementing public policy through developing, amending, or repealing rules. Some rules may skip steps, while others may be published for public comment multiple times. Independent regulatory agencies are not required to submit rules to OMB's OIRA for review unless they are \"significant.\" The process begins when Congress passes a statute authorizing agencies to write regulations, prompted by events like recommendations or accidents. In response to chemical releases in Bhopal, India, and West Virginia, Congress enacted the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act in 1986. This act required facilities to report toxic chemical releases above certain thresholds to the EPA, which then made the information public. The EPA has since required reporting for over 300 toxic substances beyond those listed in the law, showing that regulatory authority comes from Congress and is delegated to agencies through statutes. Regulatory authority comes from Congress and is delegated to agencies through statutes, with varying levels of specificity. Congress and the courts can play roles in the rulemaking process, which may result in rules being returned or vacated. There are elaborate procedures and requirements developed over the past 60 to 70 years to guide federal regulations. Over the past 60 to 70 years, Congress and Presidents have established rulemaking requirements for federal agencies. These provisions, while extensive, have led to delays in finalizing rules, with some agencies taking up to 10 years to develop standards. Congressional and presidential rulemaking requirements, along with other factors like lack of data, congressionally imposed delays, and court challenges, contribute to long time-frames for developing and publishing final rules. These requirements can be agency- or program-specific, with statutes sometimes outlining what the agency's rules should entail. For example, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act gives the Pension Benefit Guaranty. The Retirement Income Security Act mandates specific minimum pension insurance premium rates without agency discretion. Agency-specific statutes may impose procedural requirements on rulemaking processes. The Agricultural Adjustment Act grants broad rulemaking authority to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Agricultural Adjustment Act grants broad rulemaking authority to the Secretary of Agriculture for orderly agricultural marketing. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act gives federal agencies broad authority to issue necessary regulations. Court decisions also influence agency rulemaking, such as the Supreme Court's requirement for OSHA to demonstrate significant risk before promulgating new health standards. The court decision requires OSHA to evaluate risks and demonstrate significant risk before issuing regulatory standards. Other court decisions have required OSHA to show technical and economic feasibility of requirements, permit public participation, and explain their actions. This discussion focuses on cross-cutting rulemaking requirements applicable to multiple agencies. The Federal Register Act, enacted in July 1935, established a system for handling agency regulations by requiring documents to be filed with the Office of the Federal Register. This allowed for a more efficient way for citizens to know about regulations that affected them. The Federal Register Act, enacted in July 1935, established a system for handling agency regulations by requiring the filing, placement on public inspection, publication, and permanent codification of rules in the Code of Federal Regulations. Publication in the Federal Register provides official notice of a rule's existence and contents, along with other documents like presidential proclamations and executive orders. The Office of the Federal Register is responsible for printing and distributing the Federal Register. The Federal Register Act of 1935 established a system for handling agency regulations, with rules published in the Federal Register for official notice. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 outlines federal rulemaking requirements, including formal and informal processes. Informal rulemaking, or \"notice and comment\" rulemaking, is used more frequently and focuses on agency decision-making. In informal rulemaking, agencies must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register, including details like time, place, legal authority, and the proposed rule. Interested parties can comment, and after considering feedback, the final rule is published with a statement of its basis and purpose. The public comment period is typically at least 30 days. The final rule under the APA must be available for public inspection in a rulemaking docket. It cannot become effective until at least 30 days after publication, unless certain exemptions apply. The rulemaking process can be challenged in court if found to be arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with the law. The APA allows courts to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. Agencies can amend or revoke rules through the APA process, with exceptions to the notice and comment procedures for certain cases like military or foreign affairs. Good cause exceptions must be explicitly stated with a rationale in the Federal Register. The APA outlines categories of regulatory actions exempt from notice and comment requirements, such as rules related to military or foreign affairs, agency management, and public property. The legislative history emphasizes that the good cause exception must be supported by a finding of necessity or emergency, and agencies are encouraged to use notice and comment procedures even when exceptions apply. The APA encourages agencies to use notice and comment procedures, even when exceptions apply. Judicial review can determine if an agency's use of the good cause exception was authorized. \"Direct final\" rulemaking allows for expedited rulemaking without NPRMs unless adverse comments are received. The \"direct final rule\" can be withdrawn if comments are filed, and the rule may be published as a proposed rule under normal procedures. Agencies use this rulemaking method as a good cause exception to avoid unnecessary NPRMs. The use of \"interim final\" rulemaking is also endorsed, allowing for immediate effectiveness with a post-promulgation comment period for potential revisions based on public feedback. Interim final rulemaking is a specific application of the good cause exception in the APA, with a comment period after the rule becomes effective. Congress may require agencies to use this method and specify the length of the comment period. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates a 60-day comment period for interim final rules recommended by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that in 1997, half of the final regulatory actions published in the Federal Register did not have Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRMs). Most of these actions were related to administrative or technical issues with limited impact. However, 11 major rules with significant economic impact did not have NPRMs. Agencies often cited the good cause exception in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for not publishing NPRMs, citing time-sensitive nature or categorical exceptions like management or personnel matters. GAO sometimes found agencies' explanations for not using NPRMs unclear. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that agencies' explanations for not using NPRMs were unclear, with broad assertions that NPRMs would delay rules in the public interest. NEPA requires federal agencies to include detailed environmental impact statements for major actions affecting the human environment. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions. Agencies determine if a rule will have a significant impact and may issue a \"finding of no significant impact\" or prepare an \"environmental impact statement\" if significant effects are expected. The statement must outline direct, indirect, and cumulative effects, as well as alternatives and adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions. Agencies must consult with other agencies and consider alternatives, short-term uses, long-term productivity, and irreversible commitments of resources. The adequacy of an agency's environmental impact statement is subject to judicial review. In 2002, a task force was established to review NEPA implementation practices. A task force of federal agency employees reviewed NEPA implementation practices in 2003, issuing over 50 recommendations to expedite the process. Legislation since 2008 has aimed to streamline NEPA procedures, including the Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce paperwork burdens for individuals and businesses. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires agencies to justify information collections from the public, estimating burden and showing it is the least burdensome way to gather information. OIRA within OMB oversees efforts to reduce paperwork burden. Agencies need OIRA approval for each collection. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) mandates OIRA approval for information collections, with renewals every three years. Failure to obtain approval triggers the PRA's public protection provision. OIRA can disapprove collections inconsistent with PRA requirements. Agencies must submit proposed rules to OIRA for new collections. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires OIRA approval for information collections, with renewals every three years. OIRA reviews proposed collections to ensure statutory authorization, necessity, and reasonable burden estimates. OIRA takes action on 3,000 to 5,000 information collection requests annually. The PRA was amended in 1995, reaffirming principles and assigning new responsibilities. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) was amended in 1995, giving new responsibilities to OIRA and executive branch agencies. OIRA oversees information resources to improve government efficiency, while federal agencies must evaluate proposed information collections and ensure public access to information products. The PRA covers actions by Cabinet departments, independent agencies, and regulatory agencies, requiring clearance for various types of information collections. The 1995 amendments to the Paperwork Reduction Act expanded OIRA's responsibilities and required annual government-wide goals for reducing information collection burdens. Federal agencies estimated 7 billion burden hours on the public before the act took effect. The burden-hour estimate for federal agencies did not decrease as expected, instead increasing to over 8.2 billion hours by September 30, 2002. Agencies attribute the inability to reduce paperwork requirements to underlying statutes. As of January 2013, there were over 9,000 active agency information collections totaling over 10 billion hours. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their forthcoming actions. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 mandates federal agencies to evaluate the effects of their upcoming regulations on small entities, including small businesses and not-for-profit organizations. This involves preparing initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses to outline reasons for the regulatory action, identify affected small entities, and estimate compliance requirements. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their regulations on small entities. This includes analyzing the number of affected small entities, compliance requirements, and potential alternatives to minimize impact. The act gives agencies discretion on when to initiate analytical requirements and does not apply to final rules without a proposed rule. Amendments in 1996 allowed for judicial review under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. Amendments to the Regulatory Flexibility Act in 1996 allowed for judicial review under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, strengthening the act by permitting small entities to challenge agencies' determinations on the impact of final rules. This addition is seen as a significant improvement in agencies' compliance with the act. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) contains provisions such as requiring federal agencies to publish a \"regulatory flexibility agenda\" listing regulations with significant economic impact on small entities. It also mandates agencies to review rules with significant impact within 10 years and requires monitoring of agencies' compliance by the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires federal agencies to review and comment on proposed regulations in the Federal Register. The Chief Counsel can also appear as amicus curiae in court actions. Small entities must have the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process, with special requirements for agencies like EPA, OSHA, and CFPB. These agencies must convene advocacy review panels before publishing a regulatory flexibility analysis for proposed rules. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires federal agencies to review proposed regulations in the Federal Register. Small entities must have the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process through advocacy review panels. The panels consist of federal employees and representatives of affected small entities who provide advice on the potential impact of draft rules. The panel's recommendations must be made public within 60 days, and the agency may or may not adopt them. The Government Accountability Office has noted a lack of clarity in the implementation of the RFA in its reports over the past 20 years. Over the past 20 years, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently reported a lack of clarity in the implementation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), leading to variability in how federal agencies interpret and comply with the act's provisions. GAO has recommended that Congress consider clarifying the act's requirements and potentially assigning responsibility to develop criteria for RFA analyses to the Small Business Administration (SBA) or another entity. In 2001, GAO testified that defining \"significant economic impact\" and \"substantial number of small entities\" in the RFA is crucial for its effectiveness. Legislation like H.R. 527 in the 112th Congress aims to clarify and expand RFA rules, requiring SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy to issue compliance rules. Amendments like SBREFA allow judicial review and small entity participation in EPA and OSHA rulemaking. SBREFA allows small entities to participate in EPA and OSHA rulemaking before significant impact rules are published. It requires agencies to develop compliance guides for final rules, but the decision to do so is discretionary. Section 212 of SBREFA gives agencies broad discretion in preparing separate guides for small entities and using plain language. However, a 2001 GAO report found that its impact on agencies' rulemaking activities varied and agencies could legally exclude rules from coverage or develop guides without input from small entities. The GAO recommended changes to strengthen and clarify requirements in Section 212 of SBREFA, which allows agencies to publish guides for small entities without their input. Section 213 requires agencies to establish a program for responding to inquiries from small entities regarding compliance with regulations. Additionally, Section 222 amended the Small Business Act to designate a \"Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman\" to work with agencies on enforcement issues. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) established an ombudsman to evaluate agencies' enforcement activities and create Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards to address excessive enforcement actions against small businesses. It also required agencies to provide relief from civil monetary penalties to small entities. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) established an ombudsman and Fairness Boards to address excessive enforcement actions against small businesses. GAO reported on agencies' penalty reduction policies for small entities, suggesting changes to make them more consistent and data-driven. The Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002 implemented recommendations from SBREFA, including the Congressional Review Act which allows Congress to disapprove agency rules. Agencies must provide cost-benefit analysis and reports to Congress and GAO before final rules can take effect. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) applies to rules issued by various agencies, including major rules that require a 60-day delay before taking effect. The General Accounting Office (GAO) must report to Congress on major rules within 15 days. The CRA procedures for disapproving regulations apply to all rules, not just major ones. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to nullify agency rules within 60 days. A resolution of disapproval can be introduced by a Member of Congress, preventing the agency from issuing a similar rule without authorization. Senate must act on the resolution within 60 days of submission, with an expedited procedure in place for timely voting. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to nullify agency rules within 60 days. If a disapproval resolution is rejected, the rule can take effect immediately. Despite over 57,000 rules submitted, only one has been overturned through CRA procedures. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to nullify agency rules within 60 days. If a resolution of disapproval is vetoed, a two-thirds majority in Congress is needed to override it. The rejection of the ergonomics rule was due to a party transition in the presidency. Congress can use the CRA in transition-related situations and can also halt agency rulemaking through appropriations provisions. Appropriations legislation often includes restrictions on regulatory activity, implementation, or enforcement of rules. These provisions can be based on economic considerations or transition-related situations. They are typically applicable for the period and agencies specified in the appropriations bill but can have broader implications depending on wording. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995 aims to reduce costs associated with federal imposition of responsibilities on state, local, and tribal governments and the private sector without providing appropriate funding. UMRA established procedures for Congress to consider the effects of unfunded mandates before imposing them in legislation. This includes the Congressional Budget Office providing cost statements for reported bills containing mandates. Title II of UMRA requires covered federal agencies to prepare a written statement with descriptions and cost estimates for any proposed rule with a federal mandate costing $100 million or more. This statement must include a cost-benefit assessment and consider regulatory alternatives to minimize costs. Title II of UMRA mandates federal agencies to prepare a written statement for proposed rules with federal mandates costing $100 million or more. The statement must include cost estimates, a cost-benefit assessment, and consider regulatory alternatives to minimize costs. Additionally, agencies must select the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative for each rule, provide notice of regulatory requirements to affected small governments, and allow input from elected officers of state, local, and tribal governments in regulatory proposals with significant intergovernmental mandates. OIRA monitors agency compliance with UMRA title II and issues guidance on implementation. In February 1998, GAO reported that title II of UMRA had little effect on agencies' rulemaking actions during its first two years of implementation. Many requirements did not apply to economically significant rules, and agencies were not mandated to take certain actions if they deemed them duplicative or infeasible to estimate accurately. Even when UMRA was triggered, agencies often had to take actions they were already required to take. UMRA's requirements, such as cost-benefit analysis and consultation, were already in place before UMRA was enacted. GAO reported in May 2004 that UMRA's written statement requirements did not apply to most major rules issued in 2001 and 2002. UMRA's requirements have potential financial impacts on affected nonfederal parties similar to those of actions identified as mandates. GAO found that various sectors cited issues with UMRA's definitions, exclusions, and exceptions. The Data Quality Act amended the Paperwork Reduction Act to ensure quality and objectivity in federal agency guidelines. The Information Quality Act (IQA) provides guidance to Federal agencies on ensuring the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated by them. Agencies were instructed to issue their own guidelines within one year of OMB's government-wide guidelines, establish mechanisms for correcting information, and report complaints to OMB. In FY2003, OMB reported to Congress on the implementation of the IQA. In FY2003, OMB reported to Congress on the implementation of the IQA. Agencies received about 35 correction requests, but it was deemed premature to assess the impact. OMB stated that correction requests came from various sectors, with no evidence of affecting rulemaking pace. OMB Watch criticized the report for understating correction requests and not disclosing that most were from industry. In March 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that agencies' denials of information correction requests under the IQA are not subject to judicial review. OMB published a proposed bulletin in September 2003 on \"Peer Review and Information Quality\" to standardize the peer review process for regulatory information, citing the IQA, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Executive Order 12866. The proposed bulletin in September 2003 aimed to standardize the peer review process for regulatory information used by regulatory bodies. It required federal agencies to have significant regulatory information peer-reviewed, with especially significant information subject to higher standards. Agencies were also required to provide OMB with information about upcoming significant regulatory disseminations annually. The proposed bulletin in September 2003 aimed to standardize the peer review process for regulatory information used by regulatory bodies. It required federal agencies to have significant regulatory information peer-reviewed, with especially significant information subject to higher standards. OMB could waive the requirements for peer review in cases of imminent health hazards or homeland security threats. OMB received 187 comments on the proposed bulletin, leading to a revised bulletin published on April 15, 2004, with a request for further public comments. In 2004, OMB published a final version of the peer review bulletin, incorporating minor revisions based on public feedback. The bulletin requires agencies to disclose peer reviewer names, includes an annual reporting requirement, and allows agencies discretion in determining peer review needs. OMB has not updated the bulletin since 2004. The peer review bulletin highlights the importance of consistent peer review standards in government to enhance the credibility of regulatory science and protect science-based regulations. Opponents criticize the bulletin for potentially introducing political considerations and causing delays in implementing new rules. Concerns have been raised about the need for the bulletin and OMB's authority to issue it, while other statutory provisions impact the rulemaking process by requiring or permitting the use of advisory committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of 1972 requires agencies to use advisory committees composed of experts, interest group representatives, and agencies to provide impartial and relevant expertise in the rulemaking process. FACA ensures that advisory committee meetings are open to the public, with advance notice in the Federal Register and public access to meeting records. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of 1972 mandates that advisory committees must be balanced in viewpoints and their meetings accessible to the public. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 prohibits regulatory standards that hinder foreign commerce, emphasizing the use of performance standards over design standards and consideration of international standards. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 seeks to improve the relationship between agencies and interest groups during rulemaking by encouraging the use of negotiated rulemaking committees. This process, also known as reg-neg, supplements traditional regulatory procedures and involves representatives from agencies and affected interest groups in developing regulations. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 aims to enhance collaboration between agencies and interest groups by utilizing negotiated rulemaking committees. This process involves representatives from agencies and affected interest groups in developing regulations, with the expectation that any rule drafted through this method would be easier to implement and less likely to face litigation. The major provisions include the composition of the committee, selection of an impartial facilitator, and the non-binding nature of any proposal agreed upon. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 emphasizes consensus approval, unanimous agreement for negotiated rulemaking, and criteria for establishing a committee with balanced representation. Agencies may cover expenses for committee members and must adhere to FACA regulations. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 emphasizes consensus approval and balanced representation in establishing committees for rulemaking. Agency procedural actions related to committees are not subject to judicial review, but any review regarding resulting rules is unaffected. Negotiated rulemaking can improve participants' perception of the final rule and the overall process, although expectations of timeliness and reduced litigation have not always been met. Congress has at times mandated the use of negotiated rulemaking by agencies, setting specific procedures and time frames. Section 5602 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish criteria for designating medically underserved populations and health professions shortage areas. The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act requires federal agencies to use technical standards developed by voluntary consensus bodies, with exceptions as necessary. The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act mandates federal agencies to use technical standards from voluntary consensus bodies, with exceptions as necessary. This provision aligns with existing policies in OMB Circular A-119 and authorizes NIST to coordinate agencies' conformity assessment activities. Federal agencies utilize consensus standards in numerous procurement and regulatory programs, ensuring product safety and professional competency standards are met. Section 624 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001, known as the \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act,\" requires OMB to include an accounting statement and report with the budget. The OMB is required to prepare and submit an \"accounting statement and associated report\" with the budget, estimating the total costs and benefits of federal rules and paperwork. This includes quantifiable and nonquantifiable effects, aggregated by agency, agency program, and major rule. The report also analyzes the impacts of federal regulation on state, local, and tribal governments, small businesses, wages, and economic growth. OMB relies on agencies' estimates of costs and benefits for individual rules published in the previous 10 years, monetizing estimates if necessary. The Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) requires federal agencies to offer electronic options for information submission by October 21, 2003. GPEA has prompted agencies to adopt IT-based approaches to rulemaking and regulatory management. The E-Government Act of 2002 aims to improve government management and promotion. The E-Government Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C.A. \u00a73601 note) enhances electronic government services and processes, requiring agencies to ensure public access to information, accept electronic comments on proposed rules, and maintain electronic dockets for proposed rules. It also mandates agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments before collecting information using technology. The E-Government Act of 2002 established an Office of Electronic Government within OMB to oversee the e-government program. The \"Regulations.gov\" website was launched in January 2003 for electronic rulemaking, managed by the EPA. In June 2002, Congress enacted the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-198) amending the Paperwork Reduction Act to establish a single point of contact for small business concerns. Agencies were directed to reduce information collection burdens for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees and provide compliance assistance resources. OMB was tasked with publishing an annual list of resources and reporting penalty relief to Congress. A task force was also established to streamline information collection requirements for small businesses. The federal rulemaking process for small businesses has been guided by executive orders and presidential directives for the past 20 years. Executive Order 12866 outlines the principles and process of presidential regulatory review, with centralized review within the Executive Office of the President for over 30 years. President Reagan's Executive Order 12291 in 1981 marked a significant development in the evolution of presidential review of rulemaking. President Reagan's Executive Order 12291 in 1981 established general requirements for rulemaking, expanding OIRA's responsibilities to include reviewing the substance of covered agencies' rules. This order also mandated agencies to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for major rules with a significant economic impact. Additionally, Executive Order 12498 in 1985 further expanded OIRA's influence by requiring covered agencies to submit a regulatory plan to OMB for annual review. President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 on September 30, 1993, revoking previous orders and establishing a new process for OIRA review of rules. The new executive order limited OIRA's reviews to \"significant\" regulatory actions, defined as those with a $100 million impact on the economy or those raising novel legal or policy issues. This resulted in a more focused review process for OIRA. Executive Order 12866 limited OIRA's reviews to \"significant\" regulatory actions with a $100 million impact on the economy or novel legal/policy issues, reducing the number of rules reviewed annually. It requires reviews to be completed within 90 days and mandates disclosure of changes made to rules and communications between OIRA and external parties. The executive order requires agencies to provide OIRA with draft rules, cost-benefit analysis, and consider risks when setting regulatory priorities. The executive order mandates that agencies consider risks and maximize net benefits when choosing regulatory approaches. OIRA reviews draft rules in line with the order's principles and engages with stakeholders for input. OIRA reviews draft rules in accordance with the executive order's principles and may return rules to agencies for further consideration. Agencies sometimes withdraw draft rules during OIRA's review process. OIRA's formal review process has remained largely unchanged since Executive Order 12866 in 1993, but there have been some policy and practice changes under different administrators. The OIRA review process has seen changes such as increased emphasis on cost-benefit analysis, peer review, and transparency. There has been a shift in OIRA's role from counselor to gatekeeper. Despite some improvements, the process is still not very transparent to the public, leading to recommendations for disclosure policy changes. Executive Order 12866 also includes other requirements. Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to review existing regulations periodically. President Clinton directed agencies to conduct a thorough review in 1995, resulting in the elimination of 16,000 pages from the Code of Federal Regulations. However, a report by GAO in 1997 found that some actions taken had little impact on regulatory burden. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13422 in 2007 to further address regulatory issues. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13422 in 2007, which made significant amendments to Executive Order 12866. The changes included requirements for agencies to identify market failures, designate regulatory policy officers, estimate regulatory costs and benefits, expand OIRA review to include guidance documents, and consider formal rulemaking procedures. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13497 on January 30, 2009, revoking Executive Order 13422 and returning Executive Order 12866 to its original form. In addition, on January 18, 2011, President Obama issued Executive Order 13563, which reaffirmed the principles of Executive Order 12866 from 1993 and introduced new provisions such as requiring agencies to provide timely online access to rulemaking dockets on regulations.gov. The new order requires agencies to conduct retrospective reviews of existing rules within 120 days. Each agency must develop a plan to periodically review significant regulations for potential modification, streamlining, expansion, or repeal to enhance regulatory effectiveness and reduce burdens. The new executive order mandates agencies to conduct retrospective reviews of existing rules within 120 days to enhance regulatory effectiveness and reduce burdens. Agencies must update their plans for retrospective analysis as per the guidance issued by the OIRA Administrator. Independent regulatory agencies are also required to follow key principles for retrospective analysis outlined in Executive Order 13579. The executive order on \"Federalism\" mandates federal agencies to involve State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies with federalism implications. Agencies must consult with officials early on, prepare a federalism summary impact statement, and avoid regulations with unfunded federalism implications. The executive order gives agencies discretion in implementing the rule, without clearly defining certain terms or specifying requirements. Executive Order 12630 emphasizes protecting property rights and limiting takings to real threats. Executive Order 12889 requires agencies to allow a 75-day comment period for certain regulations. Executive Order 12898 on environmental justice mandates agencies to address adverse health and environmental effects on minority and low-income populations. It also requires diverse population inclusion in research and revision of rules to meet its objectives. Executive Order 12988 on civil justice reform aims to improve regulatory drafting by eliminating errors and ambiguity. Executive Order 13045 and 13175 direct agencies to consider environmental health risks, safety risks, and consultation with Indian tribal governments in regulatory drafting to minimize litigation. Agencies must provide OIRA with evaluations of effects on children and reasons for choosing planned regulations over other alternatives. Executive Order 13175 requires agencies to consult with Indian tribal governments before promulgating regulations with tribal implications and substantial costs. Executive Order 13211 mandates agencies to prepare a \"statement of energy effects\" for significant energy actions. Executive Order 13272 requires federal agencies to consider impacts on small entities when issuing regulations. Executive Order 13272 mandates federal agencies to develop procedures for considering the impact of draft rules on small entities. It also requires agencies to notify the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy of rules that may affect small entities significantly and to consider any comments provided. Executive Order 13609 and 13610 focus on international regulatory cooperation and regular reviews of significant regulations, respectively. During the past 60 to 65 years, Congress and various Presidents have made numerous attempts to add structure, economy, efficiency, accountability, and greater public access and transparency to the regulatory process through executive orders and presidential memoranda. These directives have focused on results over process, expanded the use of negotiated rulemaking, waived or reduced penalties in certain circumstances, reduced reporting requirements for the public, and required the use of plain language in rulemaking documents. Congress and Presidents have enacted laws and requirements to add structure, efficiency, and transparency to the regulatory process. This includes procedures, reviews, and analyses of draft rules by agencies or outside parties. Presidential requirements focus on coordinating regulatory efforts with priorities, improving regulations through analysis, and considering specific factors like environmental justice and property rights. The goal is to ensure certain interests are considered and minimize burdens associated with federal regulations. Federal agencies must be aware of the various statutory and executive requirements underlying their regulations to avoid having their rules returned by OIRA or rejected by Congress or the courts. Some statutes and orders allow for integration of requirements, such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act which permits agencies to develop regulatory agendas in conjunction with other required analyses. Some observers suggest integrating and consolidating rulemaking requirements to improve the process. The Administrative Conference of the United States recommended a coordinated framework to enhance efficiency. Agencies have discretion in applying statutory and executive order provisions, such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 13132 provide agencies with discretion in determining when regulatory flexibility analysis and assessing federalism implications are required. Some rulemaking requirements apply to only a small number of rules, such as those exempt under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Agencies may also be exempt from preparing regulatory flexibility assessments under certain conditions. Efforts to tighten existing regulatory requirements or impose new ones are likely to continue despite exemptions from preparing regulatory flexibility analyses for proposed rules. Understanding existing requirements and their implementation can inform future regulatory efforts. Additional information on regulatory issues can be found at various websites. Various websites provide information on regulatory issues, including the Center for Progressive Regulation, Center for Regulatory Effectiveness, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Government Accountability Office, Government Printing Office, Office of Management and Budget, Center for Effective Government, Regulations.gov, and Regulatory Information Service Center."
