Congress has made significant changes over the past 20 years, overseeing revisions to noncitizen eligibility rules in welfare programs like SNAP, SSI, TANF, and Medicaid. The eligibility of non-U.S. citizens for federally funded public aid in the United States has been a contentious issue since the 1990s. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 established restrictions on noncitizens' eligibility for means-tested public assistance, with exceptions for those with a substantial U.S. work history or military connection. Legal permanent residents (LPRs) who were residents as of August 22, 1996, are also affected by these rules. Under current law, eligibility for federal means-tested benefit programs for legal permanent residents (LPRs) depends on their immigration status, entry date before or after August 22, 1996, work history, military connection, length of legal residence, and state options. Refugees and asylees have limited eligibility for the first five years after entry/grant of status. Nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens are generally ineligible for federal programs. Under current law, eligibility for federal means-tested benefit programs for legal permanent residents (LPRs) depends on their immigration status, entry date before or after August 22, 1996, work history, military connection, and length of legal residence. Refugees and asylees are eligible for food stamps/SNAP, SSI benefits, and Medicaid for seven years after arrival, and TANF for five years. LPRs with a substantial work history or military connection are eligible for the full range of programs. LPRs are not eligible for SSI during the first five years, even with 40 credits of earnings. LPRs with 40 credits of earnings are eligible for SSI. Noncitizen SSI recipients are also eligible for Medicaid. Disabled LPRs who were legal residents before August 22, 1996, can receive SSI and SNAP benefits. Elderly LPRs and those who have been legal residents for five years or are children can receive SNAP benefits. LPRs entering after August 22, 1996, are ineligible for TANF and Medicaid for five years. Nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens are not eligible for SNAP, SSI, and TANF, except for emergency Medicaid coverage. Nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens are ineligible for most benefits, except for emergency Medicaid coverage. States have the option to cover pregnant nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens who are children and meet the definition of \"lawfully residing\" in the United States. Special rules apply to certain limited noncitizen categories, including citizens of the Freely Associated States (FAS) who have certain immigration-related benefits. Citizens of the FAS can travel freely to and from the United States and live, study, and work in the US under the Compact of Free Association. FAS citizens from the RMI and FSM can live, study, and work in the US under the Compact of Free Association. They can acquire LPR status if eligible and use their passports and I-94 cards for documentation. Palau citizens need valid travel documents to enter the US but do not have the same benefits as RMI and FSM citizens. FAS citizens are not eligible for federal public benefits. FAS citizens were previously eligible for federal benefits under PRUCOL status, but this changed in 1996 with the establishment of limitations on noncitizen eligibility for public assistance. This resulted in FAS citizens losing access to federal benefits. Foreign nationals, including citizens of the FAS, are barred from most federal public benefits due to deeming rules that consider the income and resources of their immigration sponsors. These rules make it harder for sponsored aliens to qualify for benefits, even if they meet other eligibility criteria. Deeming rules apply to aliens entering after December 19, 1997, who apply for TANF, Medicaid, SSI, or SNAP. All income and resources of a sponsor may be deemed available to the sponsored applicant until naturalization or 40 quarters of Social Security earnings. Previous law had specific deeming requirements for SSI, food stamps, and AFDC, lasting three years after entry. Section 213A of the INA makes affidavits of support legally binding, with some policymakers using \"213A\" as shorthand for those covered by deeming rules. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) changed the obligations of sponsors of Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) in the US. It made affidavits of support a legally binding contract and required the inclusion of sponsor's social security numbers in the SAVE system. The SAVE system helps agencies determine immigration status for public benefit eligibility. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) changed sponsor obligations for Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) in the US. It made affidavits of support legally binding and required sponsors' social security numbers in the SAVE system to aid eligibility workers in determining immigration status for public benefit eligibility. Unauthorized aliens are not eligible for most federal benefits, regardless of means testing. The scope of benefits denied is broad, including retirement, welfare, health, disability, housing, education, food assistance, and unemployment benefits. Unauthorized aliens are barred from receiving certain benefits under the 1996 welfare act, unless they fall within limited exceptions such as emergency medical treatment under Medicaid, disaster relief, immunizations, and services designated by the Attorney General. The 1996 welfare act prohibits unauthorized aliens from receiving certain benefits, except for limited exceptions like emergency medical treatment, disaster relief, and services designated by the Attorney General. The act also aims to prevent unauthorized aliens from receiving the Earned Income Tax Credit by requiring valid social security numbers for eligibility. Eligibility for free public education benefits ensures continued eligibility for school lunch and school services. The 1996 welfare act prohibits unauthorized aliens from receiving certain benefits, except for limited exceptions like emergency medical treatment and disaster relief. It also aims to prevent them from receiving the Earned Income Tax Credit by requiring valid social security numbers for eligibility. Unauthorized aliens remain eligible for school lunch and breakfast benefits under state and local law, but are barred from most state and locally funded benefits.

It also aims to prevent them from receiving the Earned Income Tax Credit by requiring valid social security numbers for eligibility. Unauthorized aliens remain eligible for school lunch and breakfast benefits under state and local law, but are barred from most state and locally funded benefits, with exceptions for specific emergency services designated by the Attorney General. The 1996 law allows states to provide unauthorized aliens with state and local benefits restricted by federal law. Despite this, states may still need to spend significant state funds on unauthorized aliens for public education and emergency medical services. Other costs like criminal justice expenses are also incurred due to the presence of unauthorized aliens. Prior to the 1996 amendments, there was no uniform rule for which noncitizens were eligible for federal benefits. Lawful permanent residents and legally present noncitizens were generally eligible for programs like AFDC, SSI, food stamps, and Medicaid. Prior to the 1996 amendments, noncitizens were generally eligible for federal benefits like AFDC, SSI, food stamps, and Medicaid. However, unauthorized aliens were barred from major federal assistance programs, but could potentially participate in other programs like the WIC program, child nutrition programs, EITC, and community health centers. The 1996 Welfare Reform Law established new restrictions on noncitizens' eligibility for means-tested public assistance, with exceptions for those with a U.S. work history or military connection. Legal permanent residents (LPRs) before August 22, 1996, faced eligibility restrictions for food stamps/SNAP and SSI, while new entrants after this date were denied eligibility for these benefits. Medicaid and TANF eligibility for new entrants were barred for five years, then allowed at state discretion. The 1996 Welfare Reform Law imposed restrictions on noncitizens' access to public assistance. Legal permanent residents faced eligibility limits for food stamps and SSI, while new entrants were denied these benefits. Medicaid and TANF eligibility for new entrants were restricted for five years, then allowed at state discretion. Post-1996 revisions included controversial changes to alien eligibility rules, terminating benefits for recipients and legal residents as of August 22, 1996. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act, included in P.L. 105-33, amended the welfare reform law to allow legal immigrants receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, to continue eligibility. Food stamp/SNAP eligibility was expanded by P.L. 105-185 to include elderly, individuals receiving government disability benefits, and children who were in the U.S. by August 22, 1996. The Victims of Trafficking Protection Act of 2000 created the T visa for noncitizen victims of trafficking, making them eligible for public assistance and other benefits available to refugees. The \"farm bill\" in the 107th Congress expanded food stamp eligibility for noncitizens, including LPR children and those receiving government disability payments. The changes to rules for noncitizen eligibility for government benefits, including food stamps/SNAP, were implemented for LPRs receiving disability payments, children, and qualified aliens who have resided in the US for five or more years. Additional revisions were made in 2007 to include Iraqi and Afghan aliens with special immigrant status. The Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibited funds from providing homeowners assistance to foreign nationals not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or authorized to work in the US. P.L. 110-328 extended eligibility for certain refugees, asylees, and aliens in humanitarian categories for SSI benefits to nine years, including victims of trafficking. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 allows states to waive key elements of PRWORA for certain LPRs and battered individuals, providing Medicaid and CHIP for the first five years of residency in the US. The historical development of sponsorship and deeming \"Public Charge\" in the United States dates back to colonial times, with a policy evolving to allow immigrants to overcome exclusion based on their own funds, employment, or support from a resident. Starting in the 1930s until the 1980s, affidavits of support were required by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) without a specific legal basis. Court decisions in the 1950s stated that these affidavits were not legally binding on U.S. sponsors, leading to legislative changes in the late 1970s and early 1980s to make them more effective. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 altered the obligations of sponsors for immigrants in the U.S. arriving or adjusting to LPR status. The IIRIRA standards, part of the INA, cover requirements for sponsors of immigrants in the United States. Sponsors must demonstrate the ability to maintain income above the federal poverty line or share liability with joint sponsors. Affidavits of support are required for all family-based and some employment-based immigrants. Sponsors who fail to support immigrants are legally liable. The affidavit of support is a legally binding contract enforceable against sponsors if the immigrant collects means-tested benefits. Sponsors must reimburse the cost of benefits if the immigrant receives them, with a 10-year limit on actions to obtain reimbursement. In the context of Medicaid, sponsors are not liable for any debt under the affidavit of support. The legislative language (P.L. 111-3) states that no debt shall accrue under an affidavit of support against any sponsor of an alien receiving assistance. This provision applies to LPRs covered under Section 214, such as pregnant women and children receiving CHIP and Medicaid during their first five years in the US. Legislation in the late 1970s and early 1980s limited SSI, food stamps/SNAP, and AFDC for sponsored immigrants to address concerns about welfare abuse. The legislation amended the programs to include sponsor-to-alien deeming for financial eligibility, based on affidavits of support. The 1996 welfare reform law expanded deeming to restrict new immigrants from federal means-tested programs. Qualified aliens were categorized for benefit eligibility under the 1996 welfare law. The 1996 immigration law established two categories for benefit eligibility: qualified aliens, such as legal permanent residents and refugees, and non-qualified aliens, including unauthorized immigrants and nonimmigrants. Non-qualified aliens are generally ineligible for most federal assistance programs. Qualified aliens are generally eligible for federal assistance programs, with some exceptions. Eligibility restrictions vary by program, and sponsor-to-alien deeming rules may affect financial eligibility. Qualified aliens can access benefits such as SNAP, SSI, TANF, and Medicaid. Qualified aliens can gain eligibility for SNAP, SSI, TANF, and Medicaid by meeting specific criteria such as work history, military connection, residency as of August 22, 1996, age, disability, or being within a certain number of years of entry. Eligibility for each program varies, with some requiring a substantial work history or being an SSI recipient as of August 22, 1996. Qualified aliens can gain eligibility for Medicaid by having a substantial work history or military connection, residing in a state that allows eligibility for those present as of August 22, 1996, or being within seven years of entry. New entrants are not eligible for Medicaid for five years after entry, except in states that cover children and pregnant LPRs. For CHIP, new entrants face a five-year ban as the only additional citizenship-related eligibility requirement."
