    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers the HUBZone program, which aims to create jobs and increase investment in distressed communities. It was authorized in 1997 and provides contracting opportunities for small businesses in low-income areas through set-asides, sole-source awards, and price-evaluation preferences. The HUBZone program, administered by the Small Business Administration, allows for set-asides and sole-source awards in government procurement contracts. Set-asides restrict competition to specified contractors, with the most common mechanism being SBA-certified HUBZone businesses. Sole-source awards are contracts awarded without competition, accounting for a smaller percentage of HUBZone program contract dollars. In FY2017, the federal government awarded $7.53 billion in contracts to HUBZone-certified businesses, with $1.90 billion awarded with a HUBZone preference. Price-evaluation preferences made up 18.2% of HUBZone program contract dollars. The HUBZone program awarded $7.53 billion in contracts in FY2017, with $1.90 billion given with a HUBZone preference. The program's administrative cost is $9.8 million annually, with an appropriation of $3 million for FY2019. Congressional interest has increased due to reports of fraud and efforts to ease eligibility requirements. Arguments for and against targeting assistance to geographic areas are being examined. The report assesses arguments for and against the HUBZone program, its structure, operation, and performance in meeting federal contracting goals. It also analyzes the SBA's administration of the program and related legislation, including P.L. 114-92, which expanded eligibility criteria for businesses in BRAC military base closure areas to qualify for the program. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 expanded HUBZone program eligibility criteria, including extending BRAC base closure area eligibility to not less than eight years and adding Native Hawaiian Organizations. Small businesses with HUBZone status before December 31, 2019, can retain it until the SBA updates the online tool in December 2021. The Small Business Administration (SBA) must update the new online HUBZone map every five years for qualified areas. Governors can petition the SBA annually from January 1, 2020, to designate nonurban areas with specific criteria as HUBZones. HUBZone certification applications must be processed within 60 days, and BRAC areas receive HUBZone eligibility for eight years. The Small Business Administration (SBA) must update the online HUBZone map every five years. Governors can petition the SBA annually to designate nonurban areas as HUBZones. BRAC areas receive HUBZone eligibility for eight years. P.L. 114-187 exempts Puerto Rico from the 20% population cap on qualified census tracts in MSAs for 10 years. The SBA must implement a risk-based approach for HUBZone small business applications. Bills are discussed to increase small business contracting goals. During the 113th, 114th, and 115th Congress, bills were introduced to increase federal government contracting goals for small businesses, including small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone-certified small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. For example, S. 259 and H.R. 3175 aimed to raise the overall small business contracting goal from 23% to 25%, and specific goals for different types of small businesses were also proposed to be increased. Additionally, H.R. 273 sought to increase the overall small business contracting goal to 25% and specific goals for small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small businesses to 10%. The HUBZone program, authorized by P.L. 105-135, aims to create opportunities for moving people off welfare and into jobs in areas with low incomes and high unemployment. This program targets government assistance to geographic areas with specific characteristics to stimulate investment and economic growth. The British experiment in urban revitalization in the late 1970s led to the establishment of market-based enterprise zones by Sir Geoffrey Howe. These zones provided government regulatory and tax relief in economically distressed areas to encourage entrepreneurship. Evaluations showed that tax incentives and regulatory relief were useful but not decisive economic development tools in these areas. In the United States, targeting regulatory and tax relief to economically distressed areas appealed to liberals frustrated by the lack of progress under conventional government assistance programs. Conservatives also supported this approach, viewing it as a way to reduce government regulation and taxes. Support for federal assistance to distressed places came from a diverse group of individuals. Federal assistance to economically distressed areas had support from a diverse group of individuals and organizations, including the Congressional Black Caucus, National Urban League, National League of Cities, NAACP, President Ronald Reagan, Republican Representative Jack Kemp, and Democratic Representative Robert Garcia. Opponents argued that targeting government assistance to distressed areas would provide incentives regardless of the industry benefiting from it. Some argued for targeting federal assistance to businesses offering high-wage, full-time jobs with benefits for more efficient job creation. Others opposed, viewing it as a partisan extension of supply-side economics. The National Federation of Independent Businesses doubted marginal tax reductions would stimulate new businesses in depressed areas. Some economists argued for letting the private market determine business locations rather than government policies. Disagreements delayed the federal enterprise zone program until 1993. State programs showed conflicting results on job creation and economic impact in distressed areas. The federal enterprise zone program, enacted in 1993, led to the establishment of other programs like the HUBZone program. These programs aim to provide federal assistance, such as government contracts, to economically distressed areas to create new jobs and attract businesses. The trend is for businesses to locate where there are customers and a skilled workforce. The HUBZone program aims to provide government contracts to small businesses in economically distressed areas, creating job opportunities for unemployed or underemployed individuals. Critics argue that contract set-asides unfairly discriminate against more efficient producers and advocate for lower taxes and freer markets. Critics of the HUBZone program argue that contract set-asides may unfairly benefit businesses that would have located in the area anyway, potentially diminishing the effectiveness of other small business programs like the SBA's 8(a) program. The SBA's 8(a) program offers training, technical assistance, and contracting opportunities to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. In FY2017, over 5,100 firms participated in the program, receiving more than $22.3 billion in contracts from the federal government. Eligibility is limited to small businesses meeting specific criteria, including being owned by Indian tribes, Alaska native corporations, native Hawaiian organizations, and community development corporations. The HUBZone program has faced criticism for potential fraud and abuse, with recommendations for stricter certification and monitoring of firms. Some Members of Congress have questioned the program's effectiveness in creating opportunities for small businesses in low-income communities. The HUBZone program aims to help small businesses in struggling neighborhoods but has been plagued by underfunding, program flaws, and mismanagement, leading to fraud and abuse. There are five types of HUBZones, including qualified census tracts, nonmetropolitan counties, Indian reservations, military bases, and disaster areas. Governors can petition the SBA for eligibility changes starting in 2020. Starting in 2020, governors can petition the SBA annually to grant HUBZone eligibility to designated covered areas outside urbanized areas with a population of 50,000 or fewer and an unemployment rate at least 120% of the national or state rate. Qualified census tracts are determined by HUD for low-income housing tax credit programs. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development uses census data to identify areas with low household income or high poverty rates for eligibility. Metropolitan statistical areas are limited to designate areas meeting specific criteria. Each metropolitan area is treated separately, and nonmetropolitan areas in a state are treated as one area. HUD uses census data to identify areas with low household income or high poverty rates for eligibility. Metropolitan statistical areas are limited to designate areas meeting specific criteria, and all nonmetropolitan areas in a State are treated as 1 area. In MSAs with over 20% qualifying population, census tracts are ordered from highest to lowest percentage of eligible households. Tracts with the highest percentage are designated as qualified until the 20% limit is reached. Puerto Rico is exempt from the 20% population cap for 10 years under PROMESA. As of June 1, 2018, 20.2% of all census tracts are included in the HUBZone map. The SBA's HUBZone map shows that 20.2% of census tracts have QCT status as of June 1, 2018. The next update for QCT eligibility is scheduled for December 2021 and will occur every five years thereafter. Qualified nonmetropolitan counties have specific criteria based on income and unemployment rates. As of June 1, 2018, 18.9% of the nation's counties qualified as nonmetropolitan, with 21 counties eligible solely as difficult development areas (DDAs). The SBA updates nonmetropolitan county eligibility every five years, with the next update scheduled for December 2021. The HUBZone Act of 1997 expanded eligibility to include Indian reservations, trust lands, Indian Country, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and Alaska native village areas. A study showed that mean income on reservations is significantly lower than state levels, especially in states with numerous reservations. Reservations have low income and high unemployment and poverty rates compared to state levels, but some, like Osage reservation in Oklahoma and reservations in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Michigan, are exceptions possibly due to casinos and oil. HUBZone-qualified Indian lands designated before December 31, 2019, maintain that status until an updated online tool is prepared by the SBA, expected in December 2021. The act does not specify when the tool should be updated to reflect changes in HUBZone-qualified Indian lands. During the 113th and 114th Congresses, bills were introduced to ease HUBZone eligibility for military bases closed through privatization processes under specific laws. Eligibility starts on the effective date of closure or formal closure date. During the 113th and 114th Congresses, bills were introduced to make it easier for businesses in BRAC military base closure areas to meet the HUBZone requirement. P.L. 114-92 expanded BRAC HUBZone eligibility to census tracts and nonmetropolitan counties, extending eligibility from five to at least eight years. As of June 1, 2018, there were 125 HUBZone-qualified base closure areas, with P.L. 115-91 ensuring retention of HUBZone status for designated areas until December 31, 2019. The act extends HUBZone eligibility for qualified disaster areas and requires the SBA to update its online tool immediately after an area is designated as a HUBZone-qualified base closure area. The act extends HUBZone eligibility for qualified disaster areas, with exceptions for major disasters and catastrophic incidents. As of June 1, 2018, there were eight designated qualified disaster areas. The act extends HUBZone eligibility for qualified disaster areas designated before December 31, 2019, until an updated online tool is prepared by the SBA in December 2021. The goal of the HUBZone program is to improve the economic standing of assisted areas. Small businesses in HUBZones may lose eligibility due to changes in economic data. Congress included a provision in P.L. 106-554 to address concerns about HUBZone areas losing eligibility due to changes in data. The provision allows census tracts and nonmetropolitan counties that lose eligibility to have an automatic extension for 3 years. These areas are labeled as redesignated areas. As of June 1, 2018, there were 221 redesignated nonmetropolitan counties and 5,174 redesignated census tracts. According to P.L. 115-91, all redesignated areas before December 31, 2019, retain their status until the SBA updates the online tool depicting HUBZone qualified areas. As of June 1, 2018, 25.7% of the nation's counties and 27.2% of census tracts had HUBZone status. Legislation in the 114th and 115th Congress aimed to extend the eligibility of redesignated HUBZones to seven years. The 115th Congress introduced bills to extend HUBZone eligibility to 7 years, with additional bills proposing up to 10 years and at least 5 years of eligibility. SBA certification is required for participation in the program. The Small Business Administration's database shows fluctuations in the number of HUBZone firms from 2010 to 2018, with an increase in 2011 followed by a decline until 2015. The number has since somewhat increased, with 6,769 firms certified as of April 2019. To become certified, firms must meet size standards, be majority owned by U.S. citizens, and submit specified application forms to the SBA. To qualify as a HUBZone small business concern, a company must be 51% owned by U.S. citizens, have a principal office in a HUBZone, ensure 35% of employees reside in a HUBZone, and commit to meeting specific contract performance requirements. The Small Business Administration (SBA) requires nonqualified HUBZone small business concerns to provide an active Dun and Bradstreet profile, DUNS number, and Central Contractor Registration profile. In response to fraud reports, the SBA reengineered its applicant review process, requiring additional documentation to prove program requirements, resulting in a 5 to 12-month determination timeline. The SBA has reduced processing time for HUBZone applications, with 61% processed in three months or less. P.L. 115-91 mandates processing within 60 days of receipt. Approved applications receive written notice and are listed as certified HUBZone businesses. Denials must be in writing with specific reasons. Past SBA staff conducted random program examinations to verify eligibility requirements. The SBA conducts program examinations and site visits to verify HUBZone businesses' eligibility requirements. Certified firms must recertify every three years and report any material changes to the SBA. Since 1978, federal agency heads have been required to establish federal procurement contracting goals in consultation with the SBA to reflect the potential of small businesses and those owned by disadvantaged individuals. Each agency must report its progress in meeting these goals annually to the SBA. In 1988, Congress authorized the President to set government-wide minimum participation goals for procurement contracts awarded to small businesses and those owned by disadvantaged individuals. Businesses in the HUBZone program must notify the SBA of any changes that could affect their eligibility, such as ownership or residency requirements. The government-wide minimum participation goal for small businesses is set at 20% of total prime contract awards and 5% for small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals. Federal agencies must also establish annual goals to maximize opportunities for small businesses in contract performance. The SBA is responsible for reporting progress to the President and Congress annually. The Small Business Administration (SBA) negotiates goals with federal agencies for small business participation in federal procurement. If agreement cannot be reached, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may intervene. Certain contracts are excluded from the small business eligible baseline. The Small Business Administration (SBA) negotiates goals with federal agencies for small business participation in federal procurement. Exclusions from the small business eligible baseline include contracts not covered by Federal Acquisition Regulations, acquisitions for foreign governments, and contracts not reported in the Federal Procurement Data System. The SBA evaluates agencies' performance annually and agencies failing to meet goals must submit justifications and corrective action plans. The federal government sets procurement contracting goals for small businesses, including those owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and women. Contracts awarded to specific categories count towards their respective goals but are not combined to inflate the total count. The federal government sets procurement contracting goals for small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women, HUBZone small businesses, and service-disabled veterans. The goals include specific percentages for each category to receive prime contract awards and subcontract awards. The federal government sets procurement contracting goals for small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women, HUBZone small businesses, and service-disabled veterans. The goals include specific percentages for each category to receive prime contract awards and subcontract awards. The SBA's Small Business Goaling Report is distributed widely and serves to heighten public awareness of small business contracting issues. Federal agencies met the federal contracting goal for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses in FY2017. In FY2017, federal agencies awarded a percentage of their small business eligible contracts to various categories: small businesses ($105.7 billion), small disadvantaged businesses ($40.2 billion), women-owned small businesses ($20.8 billion), HUBZone small businesses ($7.3 billion), and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses ($17.9 billion). Congressional interest in the HUBZone program has increased due to reports of fraud and efforts to ease eligibility requirements. The SBA has faced challenges in administering the HUBZone program, including a two-year backlog in program examinations. Despite efforts to implement recommendations, administrative challenges persist. In 2008, GAO reported issues with the map used to publicize qualified HUBZone areas. In 2008, GAO found inaccuracies in the SBA's map for HUBZone areas, leading to ineligible businesses participating and eligible ones being excluded. The SBA's certification and monitoring processes lacked assurance, with many firms not recertified as required. Additionally, the SBA lacked formal guidance for processing decertifications, leaving many firms in limbo. GAO identified vulnerabilities in the program, highlighting its susceptibility to fraud and abuse. The GAO found vulnerabilities in the HUBZone program, including fraud and abuse. They obtained certification for fake firms using false information and identified ineligible businesses participating in the program. The SBA's lack of proper monitoring and certification processes allowed for these issues to occur. The GAO found fraud and abuse in HUBZone businesses in Dallas, TX; Huntsville, AL; San Antonio, TX; and San Diego, CA. They identified ineligible firms and submitted applications for fake firms with false information. The SBA struggled with proper monitoring and certification processes. The SBA faced challenges in reducing fraud risks in its HUBZone certification process despite efforts to improve controls. They committed to reviewing 5% of certifications in 2006 and moved to verifying 100% of firms receiving contracts in 2009. By 2010, all HUBZone firms were required to submit supporting documentation for their applications. The SBA implemented a new recertification process for HUBZone firms, requiring wet signature certification of eligibility. The SBA increased site visits to ensure only legitimate firms benefit from the program. Site visits rose from 680 in FY2008 to 529 in FY2018. The SBA faced delays in processing HUBZone certification applications due to increased demand. Processing times varied from 5 to 12 months, but have since improved with 61% of applications processed in three months or less. A new law requires the SBA to process applications within 60 days starting in 2020. The OIG audited 12 firms that received HUBZone certification between July 2012 and December 2012, accounting for 94% of federal contract dollars. Three firms were found to have received certification without meeting program requirements. The HUBZone program's SOP manual was last updated in 2007 and does not align with the new certification process. The SBA did not make eligibility determinations within the required timeframe for all 12 applications reviewed. The SBA did not make eligibility determinations within the required timeframe for all 12 applications reviewed. The agency planned to update the HUBZone program SOP and amend the certification process to ensure actions are completed within an average of 90 days from application verification. The new SOP has not been published, possibly due to ongoing review of program regulations. The SBA is working on amending regulations for the HUBZone program to address issues. An audit by the OIG found that 15 firms received $29.4 million in HUBZone contracts, with some firms not being detected for fraud by the SBA. The OIG found that the SBA certified firms that did not meet requirements, questioned $598,000 in contract obligations, and identified delays in eligibility determinations due to lack of guidance and staff turnover. The OIG found issues with SBA's certification process, including lack of guidance, IT issues, and staff turnover. Recommendations were made to reexamine firm eligibility and address IT issues. SBA agreed with recommendations and had already reexamined one firm's eligibility. The SBA should implement policies to ensure only eligible firms participate in the HUBZone program, use technology to control costs and maximize efficiency, and notify Small Business Committees of any backlogs in applications. S. 3572, the Restoring Tax and Regulatory Certainty to Small Businesses Act of 2012, included HUBZone provisions and was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. During the 114th and 115th Congress, legislation such as P.L. 114-187 and P.L. 115-91 required the SBA to implement a risk-based approach for HUBZone small businesses. GAO is tasked with assessing the approach and providing recommendations for improvement. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 mandates the SBA to conduct program examinations of qualified HUBZone small businesses starting in January 2020. Any small business misrepresenting its HUBZone status will be liable for fraud. GAO previously reported that the SBA had taken limited steps to assess the effectiveness of the HUBZone program. The SBA was mandated to conduct program examinations of HUBZone small businesses, but limited steps were taken to assess the program's effectiveness. GAO recommended developing measures to evaluate the program's impact on firms and communities, which the SBA responded to by planning an assessment tool and periodic reports. As of March 25, 2009, the SBA had not implemented these measures. The SBA had not developed measures to assess the HUBZone program's effectiveness. An independent review found that the program had limited impact nationally, with only a small percentage of HUBZones seeing substantial benefits. The SBA had limited measures to assess the HUBZone program's effectiveness. GAO criticized the SBA for seeking public comment on a proposed methodology for measuring the program's economic impact instead of conducting a thorough review. The SBA was criticized by GAO for not conducting a comprehensive review to develop measures for assessing the effectiveness of the HUBZone program. The SBA abandoned the proposed methodology and initiated a new effort to address the issue, but did not provide details on the new methodology. The SBA was criticized by GAO for not developing measures to assess the effectiveness of the HUBZone program. Legislation during the 112th Congress aimed to address this by requiring the SBA to implement GAO's recommendations. The SBA has stated it is taking steps to implement these recommendations. The SBA is implementing GAO's recommendation by publishing performance metrics for the HUBZone program and submitting annual reports to Congress. Legislation in the 115th Congress mandates these actions to promote economic development in distressed areas. The small business procurement contracting goals for various categories like small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses have specific percentage targets. Bills have been introduced to increase these goals, but the executive branch has not supported such increases. The federal government has not advocated increasing small business contracting goals, with the sitting Administration often blamed for not achieving them. Goals for small disadvantaged businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses have been achieved multiple times, but the 3% goal for HUBZone small businesses has not been met. The federal government has not met the 3% contracting goal for HUBZone small businesses in recent fiscal years. Proposals to increase small business contracting goals have mainly originated in the legislative branch due to reluctance from sitting Administrations to advocate for an increase. Several bills were introduced during the 112th Congress to address this issue. Several bills were introduced during the 112th Congress to address the issue of increasing small business contracting goals, including the Opportunities for Main Street Act of 2011, Expanding Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2011, Small Business Opportunity Expansion Act of 2011, Government Efficiency through Small Business Contracting Act of 2012, Small Business Contracting Opportunities Expansion Act of 2012, and Small Business Goaling Act of 2012. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 included provisions to increase contracting goals for small businesses, but these were later dropped from the bill. The Assuring Contracting Equity Act of 2013 aimed to increase federal contracting goals for small businesses, including raising goals for small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small businesses. Similar provisions were reintroduced in subsequent Congresses. The Greater Opportunities for Small Business Act of 2014 also sought to increase contracting goals for small businesses and establish a subcontracting goal. H.R. 273, the Minority Small Business Enhancement Act of 2015, aimed to increase federal government contracting goals for small businesses to 25% and for small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small businesses to 10%. Advocates argue that higher goals are necessary to ensure fair opportunities for small businesses in government contracts. The Obama Administration opposed increasing the contracting goal for small businesses in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, citing concerns about unrealistic individual agency goals that could undermine the process. The SBA's HUBZone program has gained increased congressional interest due to debates over its impact on economically distressed communities, challenges in meeting contracting goals, fraud findings by the GAO, and small business concerns about eligibility determinations. The SBA has reengineered its processes to reduce fraud and abuse in the program. The SBA's HUBZone program has been reengineered to reduce fraud and abuse. Administrator Karen Mills testified about the progress made and the need for more upfront certification, compliance efforts, and pursuing bad actors. The program initiated a Legacy Portfolio Review to address fraud, waste, and abuse, with 2,040 firms completing the review in FY2011. Additionally, 987 site visit reports were conducted to assess compliance. In FY2012, the SBA will implement a HUBZone recruitment initiative to target eligible firms and educate them on program benefits. The new business processes have increased processing time for new HUBZone certifications to about three months on average. The SBA takes about three months on average to certify HUBZone applications. P.L. 115-91 requires the SBA to process applications within 60 days starting January 1, 2020. The effectiveness of the new processes in reducing fraud will determine the future of the HUBZone program."
