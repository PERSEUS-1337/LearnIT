    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding the production of cellulosic biofuel. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows a tax credit of $1.28 per gallon for qualified cellulosic biofuel production in the United States. Qualified production includes sales for use in biofuel mixtures, as fuel in a business, or for retail sale. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 offers a tax credit of $1.28 per gallon for qualified cellulosic biofuel production in the US. Cellulosic biofuel is defined as a liquid transportation fuel derived from renewable lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic material. Qualified cellulosic biofuel mixtures are eligible for the tax credit when sold for use as fuel. The tax credit for cellulosic biofuel production is $1.28 per gallon. If the biofuel is not used as fuel, a tax of $1.28 per gallon is imposed. No double benefits are allowed if a taxpayer already received a credit for the same biofuel under other sections. The tax credit for cellulosic biofuel production is limited based on the taxpayer's regular tax liability and other credits available. Any excess credit can be carried back to the previous year. The tax credit for cellulosic biofuel production can be carried forward for up to 20 taxable years. The credit cannot be applied to a taxable year before the enactment of the section. The section applies to qualified cellulosic biofuel production after the enactment date and before the production of 1 billion gallons of biofuels in the US. A deduction is allowed for the unused credit. The tax credit for cellulosic biofuel production can be carried forward for up to 20 taxable years. If the credit is not fully utilized, the taxpayer can deduct the remaining amount in the following taxable year. If the taxpayer dies or ceases to exist before utilizing the credit, the deduction can still be claimed in the next taxable year. The tax credit for cellulosic biofuel production can be carried forward for up to 20 years. If not fully utilized, the remaining amount can be deducted in the following year. In case of taxpayer's death or cessation, the deduction can still be claimed in the next taxable year. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include adding cellulosic biofuel production credit and updating the heading to include cellulosic biofuels credits. The table of sections for part II of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include cellulosic biofuels credits. Additionally, the table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 is updated to add a new item after section 40A for cellulosic biofuel credits. The amendments made by this section regarding cellulosic biofuel production will apply to fuel produced after the enactment of this Act."
