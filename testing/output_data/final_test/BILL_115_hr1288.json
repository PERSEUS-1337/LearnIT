Numerous studies show the academic benefits of high-quality early childhood education, such as improved math scores in North Carolina and better readiness in Michigan. Participation in early education programs also leads to lower high-school dropout rates. The positive economic impacts of quality early education programs are long-lasting, with each dollar invested returning approximately seven dollars in workforce development. There is a growing need for STEM workers, with STEM occupations projected to grow at a faster rate and offer higher median annual salaries compared to other professions. Beginning STEM education early is crucial for future success in STEM fields. Businesses like National Grid aim to inspire young learners through corporate citizenship programs. Simple activities can encourage STEM learning from a young age, as research shows children start developing hypotheses about the world in infancy. The Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that early childhood practitioners lack the necessary skills to teach early STEM concepts, highlighting the importance of professional development and training opportunities. The grant program is established to address the lack of necessary skills in early childhood practitioners for teaching early STEM concepts. The Secretary of Education will award grants to eligible entities for early childhood STEM programs. Priority will be given to specific entities, and applications must be submitted as requested. Grants must be used for professional development in early childhood STEM activities for teachers. The Act focuses on early childhood STEM activities for teachers, including the necessary materials, partnerships with higher education institutions for training, and professional development programs. Definitions include early childhood programs for children up to 5 years old and eligible entities like local educational agencies or educational service agencies. The Act emphasizes early childhood STEM activities for teachers, partnering with higher education institutions for training.

The Secondary Education Act of 1965 defines STEM as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics."
