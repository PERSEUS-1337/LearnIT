The Urban Asthma Assistance Act outlines key findings regarding asthma in the United States, including its impact on millions of individuals, lost workdays, and school days. Asthma is a common and costly disease with increasing mortality and morbidity rates over the past few decades. Treatment is available, but a significant percentage of individuals do not receive proper care. Urban areas face public health problems due to pests like cockroaches and rodents, which spread infectious diseases and worsen respiratory illnesses like asthma. Research shows that these pests, along with allergens like mold and tobacco smoke, contribute to asthma-related hospitalizations in children. Childhood asthma rates are disproportionately high in urban areas. In 1996, asthma prevalence rates were higher in blacks than in whites, with significant differences from 1982. Emergency room visits for asthma attacks were more common among blacks than whites in 1995. Hospitalization rates for asthma were highest in children 4 years old and younger, with higher rates for blacks than whites. Asthma disproportionately affects minority children, with higher prevalence rates in black children compared to white children. Asthma is the most common chronic illness in childhood, affecting nearly 5 million children under 18 years old. Hospitalization rates due to asthma have increased significantly, with an estimated 7% of children now affected. The majority of children who develop asthma do so before starting school. From 1980 to 1994, asthma prevalence increased significantly among children aged 0 to 4 years (160 percent) and 5 to 14 years (74 percent). Children aged 0 to 5 exposed to maternal smoking are 201 times more likely to develop asthma. Data from the 1988 NHIS shows 25 percent of children reported frequent pain or discomfort from asthma. Asthma costs the nation $8.1 billion annually in healthcare and indirect costs. Asthma costs the nation $12.7 billion annually, with inpatient hospital services being the largest direct medical expenditure. Managing asthma requires a multifaceted approach including patient education, specialty care, and pharmacologic therapy. Missed school days contribute to a significant cost of lost productivity for parents of children with asthma. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established the National Asthma Control Program in 1999 to address the increasing public health crisis of asthma in the United States. Enhancing prevention, education, research, and treatment resources for asthma will help effectively manage this growing threat to health and well-being. The CDC's Urban Asthma Prevention Programs aim to provide intervention grants to address asthma in urban areas. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2003, with additional funding for 2004-2007. Additionally, the Medicaid Model Treatment Centers Demonstration Program is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services allows States to create asthma treatment centers based on validated models. These programs include education, screening, treatment services for children, nonprofit involvement, specialty care, and improved health outcomes. Creating asthma treatment centers based on validated models can improve health outcomes while lowering overall healthcare expenditures. The CDC will develop guidelines for collecting asthma data to improve comparability. $4,000,000 is authorized for increasing CDC health professionals in asthma programs from 2003 to 2007."
