    "content": "The report provides background information on the John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler shipbuilding program, which aims to build 20 fleet oilers for the Navy. Congress is faced with decisions on approving funding for the program, determining the number of oilers needed, and potentially increasing ship self-defense equipment. These decisions could impact Navy capabilities, funding, and the U.S. shipbuilding industry. The primary role of Navy fleet oilers is to transfer fuel to Navy surface ships at sea to extend their operating endurance. Fleet oilers also provide lubricants, fresh water, and small amounts of dry cargo during underway replenishments. Oilers are part of the Navy's combat logistics force, along with ammunition ships, dry cargo ships, and multiproduct replenishment ships. Fleet oilers, also known as Navy's combat logistics force (CLF) ships, play a crucial role in transferring fuel to Navy surface ships at sea to extend their operating endurance. Operated by the Military Sealift Command (MSC), these ships are essential for the Navy's ability to operate in forward-deployed areas around the world. Without fleet oilers, the Navy's ability to perform underway replenishments in areas like the Western Pacific or the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf region would be significantly compromised. The Navy's Combat Logistic Force (CLF) ships, including fleet oilers, are crucial for rearming, refueling, and re-provisioning Navy ships at sea. The existing force of fleet oilers consists of 15 Henry J. Kaiser class ships procured between FY1982 and FY1989. These ships have an expected service life of 35 years and play a vital role in enabling Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups to operate forward with minimal reliance on host nation support. The TAO-205 class ships, built by Avondale Shipyards, have a full load displacement of 41,000 tons. The ships were later named after individuals who fought for civil and human rights, with the first ship named after Representative John Lewis. The class is now known as the John Lewis (TAO-205). The Navy plans to procure a total of 20 TAO-205 class ships as part of its goal to achieve a fleet of 355 ships. The number of oilers needed depends on the types of surface ships and aircraft to be refueled. The first four TAO-205 ships were procured in FY2016, FY2018, and FY2019. The Navy's shipbuilding plan includes procuring the next seven ships in annual quantities of 2-1-1-2-1 and the remaining nine ships at a rate of one per year starting in FY2025. The first TAO-205 is set for delivery in November 2020. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission estimates the total procurement cost of the 20 planned TAO-205s at $12.2 billion in then-year dollars. The TAO-205 class design will have capabilities similar to those of the Kaiser-class ships and will be double-hulled to guard against oil spills. The Navy issued a combined solicitation for the TAO-205 program, limiting bidding to two shipbuilders - Ingalls Shipbuilding and GD/NASSCO. The TAO-205s are being built by GD/NASSCO in San Diego, CA, with a total procurement cost estimated at $12.2 billion for 20 ships. The design will be double-hulled to prevent oil spills. The Navy awarded a contract for the DD&C of the first six TAO-205s to GD/NASSCO and the DD&C of LHA-8 to HII/Ingalls. HII/Ingalls also received the majority of the LPD-17 Flight II contract design engineering man-hours. The Navy was granted authority to procure the first six TAO-205s using a block buy contract, resulting in significant cost savings compared to annual contracting. The savings are estimated to be around $10 million per ship, with $35 million coming from advance procurement funding for components. The FY2019 Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds for the TAO Fleet Oiler program to award new contracts for certain components unless they are manufactured in the United States. The Navy's FY2020 budget includes procurement of the 5th and 6th ships in the program, with an estimated combined cost of $1,056.3 million. The Navy's FY2020 budget requests $981.2 million in procurement funding to complete the two ships' estimated combined cost of $1,056.3 million. Additionally, $73.0 million in advance procurement funding is requested for future TAO-205s, with a total procurement funding request of $1,057.9 million. Congress must decide on approving, rejecting, or modifying the Navy's funding request for the TAO-205 program. The Navy's FY2020 budget requests funding for the TAO-205 program, which includes procurement funding for two ships and advance procurement funding for future TAO-205s. Congress is concerned about accurately pricing the work and the number of oilers needed to support Navy operations under the new Distributed Maritime Operations concept. Recapitalizing the auxiliary and sealift fleet to support DMO has become a top priority, with potential growth in logistics requirements across various areas. The Navy is working on distributing logistics in a contested maritime environment using smaller, faster, multi-mission transports. The urgency to recapitalize the fleet is reinforced by a 2017 GAO report showing a decline in readiness of surge sealift and combat logistics fleets since 2012. Maintenance issues and equipment casualties have increased, indicating declining materiel readiness. The Navy has not assessed the effects of widely distributed operations on the required number and type of combat logistics ships. The Navy has not assessed the effects of widely distributed operations on the required number and type of combat logistics ships, potentially leading to poor investment decisions in fleet modernization. Waiting until 2019 or 2020 to conduct an assessment could exacerbate the demand on the combat logistics fleet, especially if in-port refueling becomes less reliable. The Navy risks being unprepared for logistics operations by not adjusting force structure plans. Congress is debating whether to enhance TAO-205 ships with more self-defense equipment. The Navy historically used shuttle and station ships for underway replenishment during the Cold War. During the Cold War, Navy used shuttle and station ships for underway replenishment. AORs and TAOEs had varying amounts of ship self-defense equipment. Post-Cold War, threats reduced, leading to less equipment on TAOEs and AORs. Now, with renewed great power competition, there's a potential increase in threats to Navy ships. The question arises whether TAO-205s should be equipped with more or less ship self-defense equipment due to renewed threats from China and Russia. Increasing the equipment could raise procurement costs significantly. An independent assessment of the Navy's combat logistics force ships was required by the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act, with the report delivered to Congress in February 2016. The T-AO(X) will have limited capability against submarine-launched torpedoes and no capability against missile attacks. It will be equipped with NIXIE Torpedo Countermeasure System, Advanced Degaussing System, and ability to embark Navy Expeditionary Combat Command Expeditionary Security Teams for self-defense against small boat attacks. Future installations may include Close In Weapon System or SeaRAM for defense against missile attacks. The T-AO(X) will require air and surface escorts for protection in non-benign environments, validated by JROC in June 2015. Congressional action on FY2020 procurement funding for the TAO-205 program is summarized in Table 2. The Navy has matured critical technologies for the Lewis class ships and stabilized their design. In 2014, the Navy identified three critical technologies for the Lewis class ships, including a new system for transferring cargo at sea. Prototype tests confirmed the maturity of these technologies before detail design activities began in June 2016. One critical technology, the Heavy e-STREAM cargo delivery system, was removed from the design in 2017 as the Navy opted to deliver F-35 Lightning II power modules by air instead. Lead ship construction started in September 2018 with 95 percent of the design effort complete, indicating that basic and functional design were fully established. The Navy has maintained the Lewis class program's performance requirements and utilized commercial vessel designs to minimize risks. The modern double-hull construction allows the ships to dock at ports-of-call. A flooding incident at a NASSCO graving dock in July 2018 has impacted the delivery schedule of future ships, but current ship fabrication activities remain unaffected. The Navy's Lewis class program has faced delays due to a flooding incident at a NASSCO graving dock in July 2018, impacting future ship delivery schedules. The Navy plans to add three additional ships to the fleet, with increased budget requests for fiscal years 2019, 2021, and 2023. Program officials aim to compete for a new contract for the remaining 12 ships using construction knowledge gained from existing efforts. The program office for the Navy's Lewis class program is revising its acquisition baseline to include 20 ships. They have funded the third and fourth ships in fiscal year 2019 and advanced procurement for the fifth ship. The program office follows GAO shipbuilding best practices and leverages commercial vessel design practices to minimize risk."
