    "content": "The Trump Administration proposed a FY2020 budget for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, including funding for diplomatic activities, development assistance, and emergency funds for COVID-19 response. The total request was $42.94 billion in discretionary funds, 3% higher than FY2019, but 21% below the FY2019 enacted funding level. The FY2020 SFOPS funding level was $57.21 billion, including $2.37 billion for COVID-19 response. This amount was higher than the previous decade's funding levels and represented about 3% of the total discretionary budget authority. The Obama Administration saw a disparity between requested and enacted appropriations for SFOPS funding, with Congress typically providing less than requested. In contrast, the Trump Administration has enacted significantly more SFOPS funding than requested, due to large requested cuts and high enacted funding levels. The appropriations process since FY2012 has been shaped by discretionary spending caps, which have been raised by Congress through amendments like the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. In addition to raising the caps, Congress has used Overseas Contingency Operations funding to work around the constraints of the BCA budget caps. Originally intended for short-term programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, OCO funds now support various SFOPS accounts. Despite the raised BCA caps for FY2019, the Administration did not request OCO funding for SFOPS, but Congress allocated $8 billion. Congress did not request OCO funding for FY2019 SFOPS, but $8 billion was allocated. FY2020 SFOPS did not include OCO funding, but the defense budget request had a significant amount of OCO funding. Congress designated $8 billion for foreign affairs OCO for FY2020 and FY2021, indicating continued use of OCO in SFOPS appropriations. In FY2019, $8 billion in OCO funding was provided in the final FY2020 SFOPS appropriation, representing nearly 14% of the total SFOPS funding. The House passed the FY2020 SFOPS legislation with a total funding of $56.54 billion, including $48.54 billion in base funding and $8 billion designated as OCO. The House also approved a \"minibus\" measure that included the SFOPS legislation along with three other appropriations bills. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved an SFOPS measure for FY2020, S. 2583, with $55.16 billion in total new funding, including $47.16 billion in base funding and $8 billion designated as OCO. The Senate also approved the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, to continue funding federal agencies at FY2019 levels through November 21, 2019. On November 21, 2019, the Senate approved a second continuing resolution, H.R. 3055, funding federal operations at the FY2019 level until December 20, 2019. The President signed the legislation on the same day. On December 20, 2019, P.L. 116-94 was signed into law, providing $54.84 billion in total SFOPS funding, a nearly 1% increase from FY2019, with $16.72 billion for State Department operations and $38.70 billion for foreign operations. In March 2020, Congress enacted multiple supplemental appropriations to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. These acts allocated significant funds for various SFOPS accounts, such as Diplomatic Programs, USAID Inspector General, Global Health Programs-USAID, International Disaster Assistance, and Economic Support Fund. In March 2020, Congress enacted supplemental appropriations for SFOPS accounts, including Diplomatic Programs, USAID Operating Expenses, International Disaster Assistance, Migration and Refugee Assistance, and the Peace Corps. The enacted SFOPS funding for FY2020 totaled $57.208 billion, a 5.2% increase over FY2019. The Administration sought to cut funding for the Department of State and Related Agency appropriations accounts, but the enacted amount exceeded the Administration's request. The FY2020 initial enacted appropriation (P.L. 116-94) provided $16.72 billion for the Department of State and Related Agency accounts, exceeding the Senate committee bill by 1.1% and the House bill by approximately 3.6%. The FY2020 initial enacted appropriation provided $16.72 billion for the Department of State and Related Agency accounts, exceeding the Senate committee bill by 1.1% and the House bill by approximately 3.6%. Additional funding was requested for COVID-19 response activities, with a total enacted funding of $17.31 billion, representing a 5.2% increase from the FY2019 level. The Administration requested the creation of a new standalone account for the Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) funds to increase transparency in expenditures for diplomatic programs and security-related activities. However, no legislation has been introduced in Congress for this account yet. The Administration requested funding for diplomatic programs, security, embassy construction, and international contributions. These programs accounted for the majority of the budget authority provided by Congress. The State Department's priorities in these areas were detailed in the Congressional Budget Justification. The Diplomatic Programs account funds key functions such as personnel salaries and department operations. The State Department's Diplomatic Programs account received $9.13 billion in FY2020, slightly less than the previous year but more than the Administration's initial request. This funding supports various department units and foreign policy programs, with the House bill and Senate committee bill proposing different amounts for this account. The enacted legislation provided funding to sustain State Department personnel levels at end-of-2017 levels, including not less than 12,870 permanent Civil Service staff and 13,031 permanent Foreign Service Officers. Additionally, $500,000 each was allocated to the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs for the implementation of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The Senate committee report accompanying its bill sought increased funding to hire additional staff for implementing the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. Concern was expressed about the lack of information sharing between the Departments of State and Treasury for sanctioning individuals involved in corruption or human rights violations. A reporting requirement was included in the appropriations law for the Secretary of State to submit a plan to improve coordination with the Treasury. An additional $115 million was allocated for these efforts. An additional $115 million was requested in March 2020 for Diplomatic Programs to help the State Department respond to the coronavirus epidemic. Congress appropriated an additional $588 million in FY2020 supplemental Diplomatic Programs funds for this purpose. The Administration's FY2020 budget request sought approximately $5.41 billion for diplomatic security accounts. The WSP allocation supports the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) for security programs at U.S. embassies and posts. The ESCM account funds construction and maintenance of overseas posts. The Administration's request showed an 8% decline for WSP and 18% for ESCM compared to FY2019. Priorities included new embassy compounds in Qatar, Brazil, and Malawi. The enacted legislation, P.L. 116-94, appropriated $6.08 billion in diplomatic security funding, including $4.10 billion for Worldwide Security Programs (WSP) and $1.98 billion for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM). This funding supported the construction of new embassy compounds in Qatar, Brazil, and Malawi, as well as new U.S. consulates in Italy and Indonesia. Notable cuts included a $50 million reduction in DS operations in Iraq due to the suspension of operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah. The funding for diplomatic security was around 12% more than the Administration's request, 7% more than the Senate committee bill, and 0.2% less than the House bill. Additionally, around $7.4 million more was appropriated for Worldwide Security Upgrades within ESCM. The enacted appropriations law allocated funds for new embassy construction projects abroad and required consultation with Congress for any changes to operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah. Congress provided indefinite appropriations for Worldwide Security Programs and Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance, allowing the State Department to retain unspent funds. The State Department has carried over large balances of unexpired, unobligated funds for Worldwide Security Programs and Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance each year. For FY2019, over $7.2 billion was carried over for ESCM. P.L. 116-94 included a rescission of $242.5 million in unobligated ESCM funds for embassy construction projects in high-threat countries. The United States pays its assessed contributions to international organizations through the Contributions to International Organizations (CIO) account. The United States provides funding to international organizations through various accounts, including the Contributions for International Peacekeeping Operations (CIPA) account. The Administration prioritizes funding for organizations that advance U.S. foreign policy interests while cutting contributions to those that do not directly affect national security interests. Funding levels for these accounts are detailed in Table 5. The Administration's request for funding international organizations sought to maintain levels for NATO and the International Atomic Energy Agency but proposed cutting funding for the WHO and FAO by 50% each. The request also aimed to negotiate reductions in U.N. peacekeeping budgets, with the U.S. contribution capped at 25%. If enacted, the request would cover 58% of total U.S. assessed dues for FY2020. The State Department estimated that the United States accumulated about $725 million in peacekeeping arrears from FY2017 to FY2019 as a result of the U.S. cap. The FY2020 appropriations law provided a combined total of $3 billion for CIO and CIPA, which marked an increase of 40% relative to the Administration's request. The joint explanatory statement explicitly provided that not less than $67.4 million of the CIO appropriation was for the FY2020 U.S. contribution to NATO, which totaled approximately 9% more than the U.S. contribution to the alliance in FY2018. The Department of State intends to fund the WHO and FAO through NATO account near recent-year levels. The joint explanatory statement maintained sufficient funds for the United States to continue providing contributions at the statutory level of 25% for CIPA. Both House and Senate committee reports noted U.S. peacekeeping arrears, with the House recommending using a share of the FY2020 CIPA appropriation for arrears payment. The Senate encouraged the State Department to review peacekeeping missions for potential cost savings to address the issue of compounding arrears. The Administration's initial FY2020 foreign operations request totaled $29.01 billion, about 1.5% more than the Administration requested for FY2019. Total foreign aid, including food aid programs, would have been cut by 27%. The request outlined four general priorities: Supporting U.S. friends and allies, winning the great power competition, promoting self-reliance for developing countries, and sharing the burden of international security and development with more partners. The House legislation, H.R. 2740, included $39.2 billion for foreign operations, a slight increase compared to FY2019, and about 34% more than the Administration requested. The Senate committee bill, S. 2583, included $38.95 billion for foreign operations accounts, almost level with the House recommendation. The omnibus appropriation, P.L. 116-94, included $38.70 billion for foreign operations accounts, a 1.2% increase over FY2019 funding and 33% more than requested. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Administration requested an additional $105 million in the USAID Operating Expenses and Peace Corps accounts for FY2020. Congress enacted $1.777 billion in additional foreign operations funds in COVID-19 supplemental appropriations legislation. The Administration proposed consolidating accounts in the FY2020 request, including combining non-health development assistance accounts into a new Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF). This restructuring was not enacted by Congress in FY2018 and FY2019. Additionally, the Administration proposed consolidating humanitarian assistance accounts for the first time. The Administration proposed consolidating accounts in the FY2020 request, including combining non-health development assistance accounts into a new Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF). The House passed legislation, H.R. 2740, did not adopt the account structure proposed by the Administration, but moved the Economic Support Fund account to Title IV. The report notes that ESF funds are provided to advance US interests by helping countries meet political and security needs. The Senate committee bill did not adopt the account structure changes proposed by the Administration or the House bill, but added a $20 million line for \"restructured debt\" under Treasury Programs. P.L. 116-94 maintained the development and humanitarian assistance account structure from FY2019 legislation, with an additional $15 million for debt restructuring. Funding for independent SFOPS agencies would have been reduced by 12% under the original FY2020 request. The FY2020 budget request proposed reductions in funding for independent SFOPS agencies, including a 3.5% decrease for the Peace Corps and an 11.6% decrease for the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The request also included plans to eliminate the Inter-American Foundation and the U.S. Africa Development Foundation, transferring their activities to USAID. However, H.R. 2740 maintained funding for the MCC and USADF at FY2019 levels, while increasing funding for the Peace Corps and IAF. The committee report recommended increasing funding for the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) by 44% to support various strategies and programs in Central America, the Caribbean, and Colombia. The enacted legislation adopted Senate funding levels for all independent agencies, resulting in a 1.3% increase over FY2019 funding. Additionally, in March 2020, the Administration requested $73 million for the Peace Corps to fund the emergency evacuation of volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Congress enacting $88 million for this purpose. The FY2020 appropriations for independent agencies total $1.474 billion, with $88 million allocated for the emergency evacuation of Peace Corps volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Administration requested no funding for the International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) account, which funds U.S. contributions to international organizations like UNICEF. Congress appropriated $339 million for IO&P in FY2019. The House legislation, H.R. 2740, proposed a 26% increase in funding for international organizations to $2.34 billion, including significant increases for specific agencies like UNICEF and the U.N. Population Fund. The bill also allocated funds for the U.N. Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) and specified support for humanitarian efforts in the West Bank and Gaza. Additionally, it included funding for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The Senate committee bill, S. 2583, included $2.07 billion for multilateral aid. The Senate committee bill, S. 2583, included $2.07 billion for multilateral aid accounts, with a 11.5% increase over FY2019 funding. The enacted legislation had a total of $2.082 billion for multilateral assistance, a 12% increase over FY2019 funding. IO&P funding was increased by 15% to $390.5 million, while other multilateral accounts remained at the same level as FY2019. The FY2020 budget request included increased funding for the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the elimination of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA). The request also included $200 million in program funds for DFC credit subsidies and technical assistance. The FY2020 budget request included increased funding for the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the elimination of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA). H.R. 2740 did not include funding for OPIC, anticipating its termination under the BUILD Act, and instead provided funds for the DFC, including $164 million for the capital account. The Senate committee bill, S. 2583, would have funded the DFC through specific budget allocations. The Senate committee bill, S. 2583, included $79.5 million for TDA and provided $299 million for a DFC corporate capital account in FY2020. The enacted legislation assumed that offsetting collections would make appropriations for the DFC unnecessary. The total request for Global Health Programs (GHP) for FY2020 was $6.34 billion, a 28% cut from the FY2019 funding level, with cuts across global health sub-accounts. The FY2020 budget proposed significant cuts to global health programs, including a 30% reduction in HIV/AIDS funding and a 55% cut in family planning and reproductive health programs. The House legislation, H.R. 2740, allocated nearly $9.30 billion for Global Health Programs, a 5% increase from FY2019 levels and 47% more than requested. Sub-sector allocations maintained level funding or slight increases compared to FY2019. The FY2020 budget proposed cuts to global health programs, but the House legislation allocated nearly $9.30 billion for Global Health Programs, with most subsectors maintaining level funding or slight increases compared to FY2019. The bill included $1.56 billion for the Global Fund, with a 30% increase in family planning and reproductive health funding. S. 2583 would have provided $9.12 billion for GHP in total, about 3% more than the FY2019 funding, with slight increases in all areas. The Senate committee bill allocated $9.12 billion for Global Health Programs, with increases in all health subsectors except for family planning and reproductive health (-22%) and more for malaria programs (+4.5%). The Global Fund would receive $1.56 billion, similar to the House bill. The total funding in P.L. 116-94 was $9.09 billion, with modest increases in global health subcategories, except for family planning and reproductive health which remained at FY2019 levels. Notable increases were seen in HIV/AIDS (+3.5%) and nutrition (+3.4%) activities. The enacted appropriation allocated $1.56 billion for the Global Fund, with additional funding of $435 million for Global Health Programs in response to COVID-19. The total funding for FY2020 was $9.53 billion, an increase of nearly 8% from FY2019. The initial FY2020 budget request for humanitarian assistance was $5.97 billion, a 37% decrease from the previous year. The Administration's budget justification for FY2020 proposed consolidating all humanitarian assistance into a new International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) account managed by USAID. This would have shifted the administration of refugee and migration assistance funding from State to USAID. The State Department would have retained 10% of MRA funding for refugee diplomacy and administrative expenses, resettlement costs, and support for refugee resettlement in Israel. The proposal would have eliminated Food for Peace Act funding administered by USAID, with emergency food assistance funded through the IHA account. H.R. 2740 provided $7.97 billion in foreign operations humanitarian assistance, a 2% increase over FY2019 funding. The Senate committee-passed agriculture appropriation included $1.85 billion for Food for Peace, while S. 2583 allocated $7.82 billion for foreign operations. The enacted omnibus legislation maintained funding levels for humanitarian assistance at $9.55 billion, with slight increases to the IDA and Food for Peace accounts. The COVID-19 supplemental appropriations in March 2020 provided additional humanitarian assistance totaling $10.46 billion, with reductions in military and security assistance requested for FY2020. The bulk of security assistance would have been Foreign Military Financing aid to Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. The FY2020 request sought authority to provide FMF assistance through a combination of grants and loans, with a focus on promoting burden sharing in security cooperation activities. There was a notable increase in funding requested for Colombia and a decrease for Afghanistan. The House legislation included a significant increase in security assistance funding compared to the Administration's request, mainly due to the inclusion of the Economic Support Fund account under security assistance. The Senate committee bill, S. 2483, included traditional security assistance accounts totaling $9.11 billion, on par with FY2019 funding. However, INCLE funding would have decreased by 9% and NADR funding would have increased by 11% compared to FY2019. P.L. 116-96 provided $9.014 billion in security assistance accounts, a reduction of about 1.5% from FY2019 funding, with cuts to INCLE, PKO, and FMF accounts, while NADR and IMET funding increased. The FY2020 budget request proposed cuts to global health and humanitarian assistance. The FY2020 budget request proposed significant cuts to development sectors, with reductions in funding for environmental protection, microenterprise, water and sanitation, education, democracy promotion, and food security. Gender equality funding saw an increase of about 80%, driven by the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. The House legislation recommended similar allocations to FY2019, except for a 77% increase in environment programs. The FY2020 budget proposed cuts to development sectors, except for a 77% increase in environment programs. Funding may support the Paris Agreement, and the USAID Administrator must provide a plan for the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative within 90 days. Senate committee bill would increase funding for democracy and environment programs, while reducing funds for education and gender equality programs. The Senate committee allocation for FY2020 included higher funding for education, water, sanitation, and gender equality programs compared to the Administration's request. The enacted legislation also increased funding for the environment sector significantly. Top aid recipients would have been allies in the Near East, such as Israel and Egypt. The FY2020 aid request emphasized significant reductions for South Africa and West Bank/Gaza, with the Near East and Africa remaining top aid recipients. The request also included increases for the Indo-Pacific and Europe regions to counter Chinese and Russian influence, although funding for East Asia and the Pacific, as well as South and Central Asia, saw decreases compared to previous years. The FY2020 aid request proposed significant cuts in aid to Europe and Eurasia by 54%, sub-Saharan Africa by 35%, and the Western Hemisphere by 30%. The MENA region would have the smallest cuts at 8% and an increased share of regionally allocated aid. The allocations do not include nearly $6 billion for humanitarian assistance, which could change aid totals once allocated. Nonhumanitarian funds for COVID-19 response were not appropriated by country or region. The House and Senate legislation did not provide comprehensive country allocations but specified aid levels for various countries and regions, including Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Colombia, Indo-Pacific Strategy, Central America, Countering Russian Influence Fund, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Total allocations included funds for Central America, Countering Russian Influence Fund, and a new initiative. The House and Senate legislation allocated funds for various countries and regions, including Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Colombia, Ukraine, and Iraq. Major allocations include $3.305 billion for Israel, $1.525 billion for Jordan, $1.432 billion for Egypt, $448 million each for Ukraine and Colombia, and $452 million for Iraq. Additionally, funds were allocated for regional activities such as the Indo-Pacific Strategy, Central America, and Countering Russian Influence Fund. The International Affairs budget includes funding for various programs outside of the Department of State, such as foreign food aid programs and international commissions. The Countering Russian Influence Fund is allocated $290 million for its purposes."
