The Congress acknowledges that money services businesses provide essential financial services to a diverse customer base, including under-banked communities. These services encompass various transactions such as funds transfers, check cashing, and electronic bill payments. Regulatory guidance requires depository institutions to monitor money services businesses' anti-money laundering compliance programs. The trend of insured depository institutions refusing or closing money services businesses' accounts threatens the legitimate industry and national security by driving transactions underground.

Regulators are authorized to oversee compliance and impose sanctions on these businesses. Coordination between State and Federal regulators is crucial for effective supervision and enforcement. Insured depository institutions and Federal banking regulators rely on a regulatory process for overseeing money services businesses' compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations. Self-certification by legitimate businesses is also important to reduce regulatory burden and promote access to the banking system. Federal and State agencies have authority to supervise and enforce compliance with these obligations. To reduce regulatory burden and promote access to the banking system, self-certification processes are necessary under the Act and its implementing regulations.
