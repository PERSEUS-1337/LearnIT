    "content": "The Act titled \"Nanotechnology Regulatory Science Act of 2011\" establishes a Nanotechnology Regulatory Science Program under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Nanotechnology Regulatory Science Act of 2011 mandates the establishment of a program within the FDA to investigate nanomaterials in regulated products. The program aims to study the toxicology and effects of nanomaterials on biological systems. The FDA is tasked with developing databases and models to understand the behavior of nanomaterials with biological systems, promoting collaborative efforts to study toxicity and novel properties at the nanoscale, advancing measurement and detection methods for nanomaterials, and collecting and disseminating scientific information on nanomaterial interactions with biological systems. The FDA is responsible for developing expertise on nanomaterials, monitoring their presence in products, providing ongoing training, participating in standards activities, and conducting other necessary activities. The FDA, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, designates a program manager to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of a program related to nanotechnology. The program manager is responsible for developing a strategic plan, coordinating with other agencies, and conducting intramural activities. The FDA program related to nanotechnology involves developing cooperative arrangements, meeting long-term challenges, and achieving specific technical goals. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by March 15, 2014, including a review of program goals, funding levels, and coordination with other departments and agencies. Authorization of Appropriations: $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $16,000,000 for fiscal year 2014, and $17,000,000 for fiscal year 2015 for the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Amounts remain available until expended."
