    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Mandate Reduction, Reform, and Budget Act of 1993\" amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to include a Federal Mandate Budget Cost Control system. This system requires OMB-CBO reports for budget control. Within a year of the Act's enactment, OMB and CBO must issue a report projecting the total cost to States and local governments of complying with Federal mandates, as well as the cost as a percentage of GDP. The estimated marginal cost to States and local governments of compliance with Federal mandates exceeding the allowable cap, the impact on the domestic economy of different types of mandates, and the required reduction in costs to States and local governments by Federal agencies. The text chunk discusses the incremental reduction of costs for Federal mandates over the years, recommendations for budgeting improvements, and the requirement for update reports every five years. Within 30 days of enactment, OMB and CBO will issue an initial aggregate mandate baseline report projecting the costs to States and local governments of complying with Federal mandates for the upcoming budget year and outyears. \"SEC. 322. AGGREGATE MANDATE BASELINE.\" The aggregate mandate baseline projects the direct cost to States and local governments of complying with Federal mandates. It is adjusted for GDP growth each fiscal year. The first budget year with an aggregate mandate baseline is determined by the initial OMB-CBO baseline report. The OMB and CBO issue a joint report by September 15 each year containing the baseline for the upcoming budget year. SEC. 323. RECONCILIATION AND ALLOCATIONS. Reconciliation Directives in a budget resolution must include changes to reduce the cost of federal mandates on states and local governments by 6.5% for the budget year and subsequent years. Additionally, laws must be changed to achieve reductions in costs. Reconciliation directives in a budget resolution mandate reductions in federal mandates on states and local governments by specified percentages over several years. Section 310(c) does not apply to directives made under this section. Section 310(c) does not apply to directions made under this section. Committees in the House and Senate allocate mandate authority among committees and categories for each budget year. Committees must further allocate their authority among subcommittees or programs. It is not allowed to consider any bill that would exceed the allocated mandate authority for a fiscal year. The point of order may only be waived by a three-fifths vote. The level of mandate authority is determined by the Budget Committees. If a House Committee exceeds its allocation, a bill can be offered to prohibit mandates for that fiscal year. The Budget Committees determine the level of mandate authority. If a House Committee exceeds its allocation, a bill can be offered to prohibit mandates until the breach is eliminated. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is required to analyze the costs of mandates for bills reported by committees, providing estimates for state and local government costs for the fiscal year and the following four years. Additionally, the CBO must compare its cost estimates with those from the committee or federal agencies. The definitions in this part clarify terms like CBO, OMB, costs, and direct costs related to Federal mandates. The President's annual budget submissions will now include a mandate authority budget analysis of the costs to States and local governments for complying with Federal mandates. Additionally, there will be estimation and disclosure of the costs of Federal mandates. The Regulatory Flexibility Act is amended to include a requirement for initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the monetary costs incurred by State and local governments in complying with new Federal mandates. This is part of a broader effort to include mandate authority budget analysis in the President's annual budget submissions. The Regulatory Flexibility Act is amended to require agencies to provide cost estimates and cost benefit analysis for new Federal mandates with direct costs to State and local governments of at least $10,000,000 per fiscal year."
