The new section SEC. 45C RESERVE FORCES PARTICIPATION CREDIT in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 offers a credit for reserve forces participation, including employment credits for qualified employees and self-employed taxpayers participating in qualified reserve duty. The new section SEC. 45C RESERVE FORCES PARTICIPATION CREDIT in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides a credit for reserve forces participation, including employment credits for qualified employees and self-employed taxpayers participating in qualified reserve duty. Qualified compensation refers to compensation contingent on the employee's presence for work, deductible under section 162(a)(1), and not characterized as vacation, holiday, sick leave, or nonspecific leave absence pay. The new section SEC. 45C RESERVE FORCES PARTICIPATION CREDIT in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides a credit for reserve forces participation, including employment credits for qualified employees and self-employed taxpayers participating in qualified reserve duty. A qualified employee is defined as a full-time employee who has been with the taxpayer for 21 days before participating in reserve duty and is a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the US Armed Forces. This employment credit is in addition to any deduction allowable for compensation actually paid. The self-employment credit for a qualified self-employed taxpayer is 50 percent of the excess of average daily self-employment income over average daily military pay and allowances received during qualified reserve duty. The self-employment credit for a qualified self-employed taxpayer is based on the excess of average daily self-employment income over average daily military pay and allowances received during qualified reserve duty, calculated by dividing net earnings from self-employment by the number of days participating in reserve duty. The term 'average daily military pay and allowances' refers to the amount paid to the taxpayer for participating in qualified reserve duty, divided by the total number of days in duty, including time in travel status. A 'qualified self-employed taxpayer' is someone with net earnings from self-employment for the taxable year. The maximum credit for the taxable year under subsection (a) is $7,500 for a taxpayer who is a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States. No credit is allowed if the taxpayer fails to comply with employment or reemployment rights of reserve component members. No credit allowed under subsection (a) for taxpayers on active duty for training under specific provisions of the United States Code. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to military pay, allowances, and qualified reserve duty, including full-time National Guard duty and active duty in support of a contingency operation. During qualified reserve duty, a person must not engage in normal employment or self-employment activities unless on authorized leave. If they do, it is considered as engaging in such activities for the entire period of reserve duty. During qualified reserve duty, individuals must not engage in regular employment or self-employment activities unless on authorized leave. All persons treated as a single employer under certain sections are considered a single employer for this purpose. The reserve forces participation credit is added to the general business credit. The reserve forces participation credit under Sec. 45C applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
