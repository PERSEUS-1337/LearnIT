    "content": "The Senate considers nominations from the President, which can be a lengthy process involving committees and a cloture process for final confirmation. A standing order in the 112th Congress aimed to streamline the nominations process. In the 112th Congress, a standing order created privileged nominations subject to special procedures to streamline the appointments process. There are 285 privileged positions, including part-time oversight board members and full-time CFOs and assistant secretaries. The report details the processing procedures and how Senators can refer privileged nominations to their committees. The report discusses the legislative history of privileged nominations and Senators' requests to refer them to committee. It outlines the procedures for processing privileged nominations and how they can be expedited before consideration by the full Senate. The Senate refers privileged nominations to its committee of jurisdiction or the \"Privileged Nominations\" section of the Executive Calendar. The nominee, position, and date of nomination are recorded. The Executive Clerk notifies the committee to request information from the nominee, marked in the calendar. The Senate committees are responsible for obtaining background information from privileged nominees as directed by S.Res. 116. Committees have discretion in collecting biographical and financial questionnaires from nominees. Once the information is received, the chair notifies the Executive Clerk. Committee practices in obtaining information from privileged nominees can vary. After a committee affirms receipt of requested information from a nominee, the nomination is moved to the \"Nominations\" section of the Executive Calendar. Senators have 10 session days to request referral to the committee of jurisdiction. After 10 days, the nomination is eligible for consideration on the Senate floor. Privileged nominations are designated as \"Placed on the Calendar pursuant to S.Res. 116, 112.\" Once a privileged nomination moves to the Nominations section of the Executive Calendar, there is no expedited process for the Senate to consider or vote on it. These nominations are equally eligible for consideration as any other on the Executive Calendar. Some privileged nominations may never receive a Senate floor vote and are returned to the President when the Senate adjourns sine die or recesses for more than 30 days. Senators can request a privileged nomination to be referred to its committee of jurisdiction without needing recognition on the floor or providing a reason. The request is recorded in the Congressional Record and the nomination is then sent to the committee. Requests can be made for various reasons, such as concerns over qualifications or fitness. Senators may have concerns over the qualifications or fitness of a nominee, leading to a request for a privileged nomination to be referred to committee. This ensures a higher threshold for support and allows for individual meetings or public hearings to discuss the nominee's credentials. The special procedures for privileged nominations were part of a Senate reform effort during the 112th Congress. On January 5, 2011, Senate leaders Reid and McConnell discussed the slow pace of nominations, highlighting delays in confirming well-qualified individuals for critical positions. They acknowledged the need for reform to address the issue in the 112th Congress. In the 112th Congress, Senate leaders formed a bipartisan nominations reform working group to address delays in confirming individuals for critical positions. By March, the group introduced two measures: S. 679, the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011, and S.Res. 116, a resolution for expedited Senate consideration of certain nominations. The Rules Committee met on May 11 and ordered the resolution reported favorably by voice vote without amendment. The Senate considered S.Res. 116 on June 29, with three amendments proposed. A \"managers' amendment\" with negotiated and technical changes was agreed to. Senator Tom Coburn's amendment on reporting requirements for new federal programs was not adopted. Senator Tom Harkin's amendment on cloture for executive branch nominees was ruled out of order. The final amendment, offered by Senator Schumer, expanded privileged nominations to include certain positions and required a justification report for new presidentially appointed positions. It was adopted by unanimous consent. The Senate agreed to S.Res. 116, as amended, by a vote of 89-8 on June 29, 2011. H.R. 26 during the 114th Congress created a new 13-member Board of Directors for the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers, designating these positions as privileged nominations. This legislation marks the first and only expansion of privileged nominations. The legislation expanding privileged nominations to include 13 positions was first introduced in the 113th Congress. Since then, the Senate has considered 467 privileged nominations, with only 4.7% being referred to committee at the request of a Senator. This suggests Senators generally support expedited consideration of privileged nominations. Table 1 provides data on 22 instances of requested referrals for privileged nominations, including details such as Congress, nominee name, position, Senate disposition, committee of jurisdiction, and Senator's affiliation with the committee. Most requests for referral have been made by Senators from the nomination's committee of jurisdiction. Out of 20 privileged nomination requests, 14 were made by the chair or ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction."
