    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Aviation Noise Limit Act of 1993\". Congress finds the accurate assessment and control of aviation noise impact is necessary to protect public health and welfare, improve aviation capacity, and prevent significant noise impact on areas distant from airports. The current Federal system for determining noise impact at airports does not adequately consider area characteristics, such as proximity to an airport and non-aircraft background noise. The Federal system for determining noise impact at airports is less restrictive than State and local criteria, inconsistent with maintaining accepted interior quiet levels for residences, and does not protect against disturbances in human activities. It also promotes Federal interference with the right to quiet enjoyment of private property. Research suggests that low noise levels can impact human health and welfare, necessitating changes in Federal noise management programs. Factors like population density, background noise, and proximity to airports influence individual expectations and acceptance of aviation noise. Different approaches should be taken when addressing noise changes in developed, populated areas compared to nonpopulated or industrial areas. The Aviation Noise Limits are outlined in Section 3. The Secretary is required to develop a plan to reduce aviation noise in residential areas near airports by 75% by 2001. Various methods such as soundproofing, relocation incentives, and the use of quieter aircraft will be considered. Recommendations on actions and policy changes will be made as part of the plan. The Secretary will make recommendations on actions and policy changes to reduce aviation noise near airports. Regulations will be modified to assist in meeting noise reduction objectives. The Administrator can only make airspace traffic changes that do not increase aviation noise. In residential areas not near airports, violations include exceeding sound levels of 6 decibels above background levels for 1 hour and maximum sound levels of 70 decibels during the day and 55 decibels at night. The Administrator will review airspace traffic changes that are still causing significant complaints or controversies. Aviation activity must not exceed 20 decibels above background sound levels for 1 hour, with no more than 3 violations in a 24-hour period. If the day-night average sound level exceeds 45 decibels, aviation activity can only contribute up to 3 decibels to the total sound level. The Administrator will address ongoing complaints or controversies regarding airspace traffic changes to prevent aviation noise violations. Airport operators can propose alternative boundaries for the vicinity of the airport if ground noise distribution differs significantly from the defined geographic area. The Act requires that areas near airports have a day-night average sound level of at least 60 decibels. If sound level limits cannot be met in a residential area due to airspace changes, the area can be added to the airport vicinity upon property acquisition. The Secretary must report to Congress within a year with a plan for compliance. The Secretary must report to Congress with a plan for compliance, including airspace changes and recommendations for administrative and legislative actions. The Secretary of Transportation is responsible for regulating all non-military aviation activities within and outside controlled airspace to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, airspace traffic change, average sound level, and background sound level. The curr_chunk defines terms related to sound levels, including day-night average sound level, nighttime hours, normal circumstances, Secretary, and single event maximum sound level. The curr_chunk defines terms related to sound levels near airports, including single event maximum sound level and vicinity of an airport. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of safety zones around airport runways to ensure safety in the direction of heaviest traffic."
