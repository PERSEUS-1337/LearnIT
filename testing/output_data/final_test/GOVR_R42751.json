    "content": "The Sportsman's Act of 2012, S. 3525, addresses issues related to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal and state lands. It focuses on physical access to federal lands for these activities and aims to balance them with game management, public safety, and resource management. S. 3525 aims to expand sport fishing programs, allow imports of polar bear trophies, support migratory bird conservation, and amend the duck stamp program. It would also make funding changes for conservation programs and control nutria. H.R. 4089, another hunting and fishing bill, focuses on opening more lands for these activities but has different approaches than S. 3525. H.R. 4089 and S. 3525 have different approaches. H.R. 4089 would change agency planning practices, eliminate reviews under NEPA, and allow certain activities on federal lands. S. 3525 focuses on access to hunting and fishing areas on federal land. S. 3525 was originally part of an amendment to the 2012 farm bill but was later introduced as a separate bill. S. 3525, presented in the Senate on September 11, 2012, focuses on physical access to federal lands for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. It addresses land acquisition, permits for importing sport-hunted polar bear trophies, carrying bows and crossbows in national park units, funding for state land purchase, and exclusion of lead ammunition from regulation. Access to hunting and fishing areas on federal land has been a criticism of federal land management. The bill S. 3525 aims to improve access to federal lands for hunting, fishing, and recreational purposes by directing federal land management agencies to acquire land or rights-of-way where access is significantly restricted. This includes using eminent domain and allocating at least 1.5% of annual funds under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act for acquisition projects. Section 102 of S. 3525 would allow hunters with polar bear trophies legally hunted in Canada before May 15, 2008, to import these trophies to the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Permit fees would apply for importing the sport-hunted trophies. Section 102 of S. 3525 would allow hunters to import polar bear trophies legally hunted in Canada before May 15, 2008, under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Permit fees of $1,000 per trophy would support polar bear conservation activities. Despite warnings from FWS about the impact of ESA listing, import of trophies continued until the listing became final. The permitting process was expedited by court order, allowing entry of any harvest before May 15, 2008, from legal populations. The FWS does not oppose legislation allowing importation of polar bear trophies for hunters who applied for a permit and completed their hunt before ESA listing. However, others believe allowing these permits would encourage hunting of species at risk. The Humane Society of the United States warns that allowing polar bear imports would undermine conservation efforts and weaken protections under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Section 103 of S. 3525 would allow bowhunters to carry their weapons across national park units to access hunting on adjacent lands, based on convenience rather than personal protection. Portage is permitted as the most direct means of access to the adjacent land. Under Subtitle B of Title I of the Senate bill, states and territories could use more funds from the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act for projects involving public target ranges for firearms or archery. The federal share for operating and maintaining target ranges would remain at a maximum of 75%. Section 114 of S. 3525 increases the federal share from the Pittman-Robertson program to 90% for projects related to target ranges. It also defines public target ranges as archery or shooting ranges. Section 115 emphasizes cooperation between federal agencies and state/local authorities in managing waste on federal lands used as public target ranges. Section 121 exempts lead shot, ammunition, and fishing sinkers from certain regulations. Section 121 of S. 3525 exempts lead shot, ammunition, and fishing sinkers from regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). It seeks legislative certainty for a denied citizen petition to regulate lead in ammunition and fishing sinkers. The EPA denied a petition to regulate lead in ammunition under TSCA, but lead shot has been banned for hunting migratory waterfowl since 1991. S. 3525 exempts lead shot, ammunition, and fishing sinkers from TSCA regulations. Title I, Subtitle C, and Title II, Subtitle A of S. 3525 address fish-related issues such as prohibiting the sale of billfish, requiring a report on artificial reefs, and providing aid for modifying fish habitat. Section 122 prohibits the sale of billfish or billfish products, treating violations as prohibited acts under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Exemptions are provided for Hawaii and the Pacific Insular Area, allowing foreign vessels to land and sell billfish for export or local consumption. Section 123 mandates two reports to Congress by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior is required to provide two reports to Congress regarding the removal of decommissioned outer continental shelf drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and the creation of offshore artificial habitats to enhance fishing and recreational activities. Senator Lieberman introduced a bill to address threats to fish species and improve fish habitats. Subtitle A of Title II aims to establish a program involving various stakeholders to address fish habitat decline, based on the North American Wetlands Conservation Act model. It defines terms related to aquatic habitat and fish conservation projects. Section 202 proposes a 27-member committee to oversee these efforts. Section 202 establishes a 27-member National Fish Habitat Board to coordinate aquatic habitat conservation efforts, set national goals, and recommend projects. Board members serve three-year terms and are not compensated but receive travel expenses. The board can designate Fish Habitat Partnerships for regional implementation. Fish Habitat Partnerships would coordinate regional implementation, identify strategic priorities for fish habitat conservation, recommend projects, and develop and implement projects. Partnership applicants must meet seven criteria, including diverse representation and ability to address issues on a nationally significant scale. Section 204 requires partnerships to submit recommendations for fish habitat conservation projects annually. Projects recommended by the board for funding must have at least 50% of the cost covered by nonfederal funds, with exceptions for projects on federal lands, waters, or associated with Indian tribes. The board recommends projects for funding with evaluation plans to assess activities, make changes if needed, and report findings. Projects involving real property acquisition must include property management obligations. Section 205 establishes a National Fish Habitat Conservation Partnership Office within FWS to coordinate partnerships, funding, project consideration, and scientific reporting. Staffing includes employees from Commerce, Interior, states, and Indian tribes. Section 206 requires NOAA, FWS, and USGS to provide technical assistance to partnerships and project participants. Section 207 mandates federal agencies to cooperate with NOAA and FWS for aquatic habitat conservation. Section 208 necessitates coordination with state and tribal agencies before project implementation. Section 209 mandates the board to report to Congress every two years on habitat conservation efforts. Section 210 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to implement regulations for the act, while Section 211 imposes restrictions on water rights, state authority, Indian tribes, adjudication of water rights, land and water acquisition, private property protection, and use of funds for mitigation. Section 212 states that the Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the board and partnerships. Section 213 authorizes $7.2 million annually for projects, with 5% reserved for Indian tribes, and additional authorizations for national office and administrative expenses. FWS, NOAA, and USGS are each authorized $0.5 million for technical and scientific purposes. Subtitle II of S. 3525 authorizes $0.5 million each for FWS, NOAA, and USGS for technical assistance. There are concerns about the adequacy of the $7.2 million annual authorization for aquatic habitat improvements and the need for a new program when the DJ program already exists with more funding. Title II, Subtitle B addresses duck stamps. Subtitle B of S. 3525 addresses duck stamps, with four sections discussing the purchase by hunters for the right to hunt migratory birds. The stamps cost $15 and proceeds go to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund for habitat acquisition. A pilot program for online stamp sales has been ongoing since 2008 in eight states. Section 222 would allow the Secretary of the Interior to adjust the stamp price every three years starting in 2013. Section 223 of S. 3525 allows the Secretary to waive the stamp purchase requirement for certain individuals with minimal impact on MBCF collections. Section 224 permanently authorizes electronic duck stamp issuance, with states applying for authority and provisions for revocation. Title II, Subtitle C authorizes the Joint Ventures Program to promote sustainable migratory bird populations through partnerships with federal agencies and states. The Joint Ventures Program (JVP) aims to promote sustainable populations of migratory birds through partnerships with various stakeholders. Eligible partners include federal, state, and tribal agencies, as well as NGOs and landowners. Each partnership agreement establishes a management board with diverse stakeholder representatives, appointing a coordinator for the implementation plan approved by the Director of FWS. The Joint Ventures Program (JVP) requires implementation plans approved by the Director of FWS, including strategies for bird conservation, communication among members, and community outreach. Federal employees can be detailed to the board, and financial assistance may be awarded for conservation actions. The Secretary can accept gifts for JVP conservation. Management boards must submit annual reports, with a comprehensive review every five years open to public comments. JVP does not preempt other laws or state wildlife authorities. Section 238 of S. 3525 would exempt boards established by the JVP from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Title II, Subtitle D reauthorizes 10 current wildlife conservation laws through FY2017. The NFWFEA (Section 243) is amended to increase the number of directors on the board of the foundation, set terms at six years, and allow acceptance of restitution and community service payments for conservation purposes. The bill also requires the naming of an executive director and provides procedures for accepting amounts from federal agencies. The MSCFSSA would be reauthorized for six years in Section 244, allowing federal agencies to waive competitive processes for environmental emergencies. The NMBCA would be reauthorized through FY2017 in Section 246, with a directive to use at least 75% of funds for international projects. Section 247 would amend the FLTFA. Section 247 of the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) focuses on using proceeds from the disposal of public land to acquire inholdings and other lands for federal land management. It requires proceeds from the sale or exchange of public land to be deposited into the Federal Land Disposal Account (FLTFA fund) in the Treasury of the United States. Section 247 of S. 3525 amends FLTFA by extending the act's expiration and eliminating the expiration of the FLTFA fund authorization. It adds lands from various bills whose sales revenue would not go to the FLTFA fund. The Land Management Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-11) includes provisions for land exchanges in Washington County, Utah, Carson City, Nevada, and Douglas County, Washington. Section 248 of S. 3525 would expand the Nutria Eradication and Control Act of 2003 to other coastal states to address the invasive rodent species. The Senate bill expands the Nutria Eradication and Control Act of 2003 to other coastal states where the invasive rodent species has been found. $6 million annually is authorized for FY2012 through FY2016, with $2 million each allocated to Maryland and Louisiana, and the rest to other coastal states."
