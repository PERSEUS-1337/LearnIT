    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Humanitarian Assistance to Combat HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean and National Security Act of 2003\". Congress finds that Africa faces challenges of disease, war, and poverty, threatening both human dignity and global security. The Director of Central Intelligence also highlighted Africa as a breeding ground for threats to US interests due to lack of accountability and natural disasters. Sub-Saharan Africa is severely affected by HIV/AIDS, surpassing malaria as the leading cause of death in the region. In 2002, an estimated 3,500,000 people were newly infected with HIV in Africa, which has more than 70% of the worldwide total of people infected with HIV. In 2002, 29,400,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, an increase from the previous year. In 2001, an estimated 21,500,000 Africans had died from AIDS, with 2,200,000 deaths that year. UNAIDS predicts that by 2020, an additional 55,000,000 Africans will die from the epidemic. The impact on children is significant, with over 600,000 infants getting infected annually through mother-to-child transmission. Around 1,000,000 children may currently be living with HIV in Africa, and in 2001, 11,000,000 children had become orphans due to AIDS. Children orphaned by AIDS in Africa face high risks of malnutrition, abuse, and lack of education. Women make up 58% of the HIV-positive adult population in sub-Saharan Africa. Young women are particularly vulnerable, with higher HIV infection rates compared to young men. The HIV infection rate among adults in Africa is 8.8%, significantly higher than the global rate of 1.2%. In sub-Saharan African countries, high HIV infection rates are prevalent, with Botswana reaching 38.8%, Cameroon increasing to 11.8% in 2001, and Nigeria having 5.8% of adults infected in 2001. Efforts to combat the epidemic focus on reducing new infections and addressing the impact on families, societies, and economies. Community-based organizations, supported by NGOs, provide labor, home care, and other services to AIDS-affected families. Programs aim to educate on HIV prevention through various channels. Public-private partnerships are crucial in responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa. The United States Agency for International Development estimates that donors and African governments spent $500 million in combating HIV/AIDS in Africa in fiscal year 2000. Leaders at the G-8 summit pledged to reduce HIV infections by 25%, costing at least $5 billion per year for 5 years according to the World Health Organization. The World Bank launched the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for Africa. The Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for Africa was launched in September 2000 with $1 billion committed by October 2002. UNAIDS called for increased assistance in sub-Saharan Africa, requiring $5 billion annually. In the Caribbean, there are 420,000 people living with AIDS, with high prevalence rates outside of Africa. In the Caribbean, Haiti and the Bahamas have the highest HIV infection rates, with poverty and governance issues contributing to the spread of AIDS in Haiti. Access to treatment is lacking for many infected individuals in the region. Despite the lack of access to treatment for many HIV-infected individuals, projects in severely impoverished countries show that sustained treatment for people with HIV/AIDS is possible. Congress recognizes the urgent need to address the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, emphasizing the moral and national security importance. They urge the President to engage in discussions with other G-8 and European Union countries to increase financial support for combating the pandemic in these regions. Additionally, grants are proposed to combat HIV/AIDS in these countries. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development is authorized to award grants to nongovernmental organizations for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and control in sub-Saharan Africa and Caribbean countries. This includes efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission and provide medical care and support services. Congress suggests the Secretary of Health and Human Services offer medical and technical expertise. Additionally, health officers will be appointed to U.S. embassies in these regions. The Secretary of State, along with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, can appoint health officers to U.S. embassies in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean to advise the Ambassador on combating HIV/AIDS. $500,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008. Amounts remain available until expended. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms related to HIV/AIDS, including AIDS, Caribbean countries, HIV, HIV/AIDS, and countries in sub-Saharan Africa."
