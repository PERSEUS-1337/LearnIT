    "content": "Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task forces, designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), provide specialized assistance after structural collapses. Each task force consists of at least 70 members with skills in engineering, emergency medicine, canine handling, firefighting, and more. FEMA administers federal funding for these task forces, which are considered part of the federal emergency response network. Congress authorized emergency search and rescue response activities in 1990. Federal involvement in urban search and rescue has increased since the establishment of task forces in the 1990s. Task forces have been deployed successfully after various disasters, gaining general support for the concept. Recent efforts include task forces from multiple states assisting in Haiti after earthquakes. The Obama Administration requested $28 million for task forces in FY2012, a reduction from previous years. During the FY2012 budget debate, Congress is uncertain about accepting the Administration's proposal for urban search and rescue (USAR) funding. Interim continuing resolutions have been enacted, with one providing $38 million for USAR task forces. Discussions may focus on the appropriate federal financial support for teams with shared responsibilities. Each USAR team's cost ranges from $1.8 million to $2.2 million. During the FY2012 budget debate, Congress is uncertain about accepting the Administration's proposal for urban search and rescue (USAR) funding. The cost of each USAR team ranges from $1.8 million to $2.2 million per year, with the federal contribution accounting for roughly $1 million. Some may question if the current federal support is enough, suggesting that local resources should play a larger role in funding. The teams' training, equipment, and capabilities are largely due to past federal support. Calls for greater reliance on the USAR concept for international crises may increase following successful rescue efforts in Haiti and deployment to Japan. The federal role in urban search and rescue efforts has evolved since the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, which mandated the President to establish a coordinated earthquake hazards reduction program. This program focused on earthquake prediction, mitigation, organizing emergency services, and educating the public and officials on reducing adverse consequences. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was established in 1979 to lead earthquake hazard mitigation efforts. In 1980, Congress required FEMA to submit an interagency coordination plan for earthquake response. After the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, Congress and FEMA reassessed disaster response responsibilities. In response to the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, Congress and FEMA expanded the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program in 1990. This included developing federal interagency plans for earthquake response in high-risk areas, ensuring emergency medical resources, search and rescue personnel, and emergency broadcast capability. In 2004, further amendments were made to the earthquake hazards act, requiring the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response to coordinate the National Urban Search and Rescue Response System. The FEMA Administrator, along with Response, coordinates the National Response Plan to ensure emergency resources are available for natural disasters, terrorism, and other catastrophic incidents. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 authorizes FEMA to lead national preparedness efforts. The Urban Search and Rescue Response System was established under this authority, allowing FEMA to coordinate USAR task forces for domestic and international disasters. In 2010, four USAR teams were deployed to Haiti. In 2010, four USAR teams were deployed to Haiti and in 2011 two task force teams were sent to Japan. The search and rescue work in Haiti was successful, but the teams in Japan couldn't find survivors due to the extensive damage. DHS activates up to three task forces closest to a disaster in the US, requiring them to deploy personnel and equipment within six hours and sustain operations for 72 hours. Each task force must have a wide range of emergency response capabilities and a deployable roster of at least 70 trained individuals. The DHS requires each task force to have at least 70 fully trained individuals with specialist skills in technical search, rescue, emergency medicine, structural engineering, logistics, communications, canine search, and hazardous materials handling. Task forces work in 12-hour shifts and are supported by Incident Support Teams (ISTs) for technical assistance and logistical support. They remain on-site until the Incident Commander determines no more survivors could be found. Comprehensive information on USAR funding is limited. Federal funding for USAR activities is primarily provided through the Disaster Relief Fund administered by FEMA. Host employers, usually local government units, are the main source of funds for task forces. The federal government covers costs when task forces are activated by FEMA and provides funding for team preparation, equipment, and maintenance through FEMA's Management and Administration account. Historical data shows that in FY1998 and FY1999, $4 million was allocated to the teams, and in FY2001, approximately $6.4 million was distributed based on need for training and equipment. In FY2001, FEMA allocated $3 million for upgrading six task forces to weapons of mass destruction capability. Following the 9/11 attacks, federal funds were provided to cover costs for USAR task forces responding to the World Trade Center and Pentagon sites. Congress allocated roughly $32.4 million to the USAR program in FY2002 supplemental appropriations. In FY2002, Congress allocated $60 million for the 28 existing USAR task forces, with funds designated for operational costs, equipment, and training. Additional funding of $60 million was provided in FY2004, and $30 million in FY2005. In recent years, Congress has allocated around $32 million for the task forces and system administration. The deployment of USAR teams to Haiti and Japan may present opportunities for modifying existing practices. Some argue for increased deployments to reduce lives lost, but this could strain funding and lead to state and local governments relying solely on USAR for search and rescue efforts. In the past five years, proposed funding reductions and program eliminations have targeted the State and Local Programs account, potentially affecting USAR teams' funding and operations. Members of Congress may consider directing DHS to establish additional task forces or passing legislation to establish USAR task forces. The USAR task forces have evolved through administrative actions in response to Congress's earthquake statute. Congress may consider legislation to specify task force attributes, requirements, and permanent funding. Examples of bills include H.R. 706 and Section 105 of H.R. 3377. Funding for task forces, including equipment and reserves, could be increased. Legislation like S. 930 in the 108th Congress could require grants from the Secretary of DHS to task forces.

Legislation like S. 930 in the 108th Congress could require grants from the Secretary of DHS to task forces to ensure operational, administrative, and training costs are met. Congress may debate the role of USAR task forces in federal disaster response efforts and consider if they duplicate capabilities of other federal response teams. The deployment of USAR task forces to Haiti in 2010 showcased their capabilities in saving lives and sharing burdens internationally. Funding for these efforts was provided by the Department of State and USAID. Discussions are ongoing about expanding the number of teams qualified for international crises. Deployment of USAR forces abroad may raise concerns about limiting resources for domestic incidents. Congress may need to consider appropriating funds for USAR from multiple sources for international response efforts. They may also need to limit the use of USAR teams to domestic incidents or restrict the number of teams deployed overseas simultaneously."
