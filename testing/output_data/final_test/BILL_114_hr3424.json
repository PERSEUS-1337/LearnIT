    "content": "The \"Moving to Work Reform Act of 2015\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The terms of Moving to Work agreements are outlined in the Act. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development cannot enter into or extend any Moving to Work agreement for a public housing agency unless certain terms and conditions are met, including restrictions on implementing rent policy changes that increase burdens for participating families. The policy change will undergo a detailed evaluation using a rigorous research methodology, including random assignment to treatment and control groups. The Secretary must ensure adequate resources are available for the evaluation. Public housing agencies can only use funds for tenant-based rental assistance for eligible families. On behalf of eligible families, public housing agencies can use funds for housing costs, with up to 10 percent allowed for other purposes. Funding for tenant-based rental assistance is determined using a formula, with a provision for inflation adjustments. Agencies are prohibited from reducing the number of families receiving housing assistance. The public housing agency must provide housing assistance to eligible low-income families with cost burdens no higher than those assisted under sections 8 and 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. If a low share of families live in neighborhoods with high opportunities, the agency must create a plan to increase access to such areas. The public housing agency must develop a plan to expand families' access to neighborhoods with high opportunities. Funding for public housing operation will be determined using the same formula, with a phased approach to avoid significant funding reductions. The Secretary cannot waive certain provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937. In 1937, various sections of the United States Housing Act are outlined, including targeting for new admissions, tenant representatives on the public housing agency board, definitions for low-income families, formation of a resident advisory board, and compliance with housing quality standards. The curr_chunk discusses various sections of the United States Housing Act related to housing quality standards, grievance procedures, housing for elderly and disabled households, confidentiality regarding domestic violence, rights of applicants, and public housing lease requirements. The curr_chunk discusses lease requirements, eviction protections, and the use of voucher funds for project-based vouchers under the United States Housing Act. The curr_chunk explains that public housing agencies under a Moving to Work agreement can use voucher funds for project-based vouchers exceeding the 20-percent cap, up to a higher percentage specified in the agreement or 35 percent. The curr_chunk outlines criteria for project-based vouchers, including serving homeless or special needs families, being used in low-poverty areas, and being part of a program subject to evaluation. It also mentions the ability for families with project-based vouchers to move using tenant-based vouchers after 12 months. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for resident councils and jurisdiction-wide resident organizations, including their establishment under section 20 and the minimum amount of support from public housing agencies. The curr_chunk highlights the involvement of resident councils and organizations in public housing agency operations as authorized by specific sections. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will evaluate the Moving to Work demonstration program and submit a report to Congress on the risks and benefits of expanding the program. Reforms and selection criteria will be identified to improve the program's effectiveness while minimizing negative impacts on low-income families and ensuring efficient use of Federal funds."
