    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act\". It includes findings related to the act. Congress finds that aircraft landing strips play essential safety roles as emergency landing areas, provide access to national parks and other Federal lands, support State economies by facilitating recreational activities, and are crucial for search and rescue operations, forest management, research, and disaster relief. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture should adopt a nationwide policy for governing landing strips. Agriculture should adopt a nationwide policy for backcountry aviation issues on Federal land and require regional managers to comply with the policy. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. The term \"aircraft landing strip\" means an established landing strip on Federal land used for aircraft activities. \"Permanently close\" refers to a closure lasting more than 90 days in a calendar year. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior for land under their jurisdiction. The Secretary of Agriculture has jurisdiction over land under their control. SEC. 4. PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF ACTIONS AFFECTING CERTAIN AIRCRAFT LANDING STRIPS. The Secretary must follow specific procedures before taking any action to permanently close, restrict, or render an aircraft landing strip unserviceable. This includes approval from the head of the aviation department of each State, publishing a notice in the Federal Register, allowing a 90-day public comment period, and considering any received comments. The Secretaries must adopt a nationwide policy for backcountry aviation issues on Federal land within 2 years of the Act's enactment. Regional managers must adhere to this policy. Any policy affecting air access to landing strips must state that the Administrator has sole authority over aviation and airspace control. The Secretary consults with State aviation departments and interested parties for maintaining aircraft landing strips in line with resource values. Cooperative agreements can be made for strip maintenance. Federal acquisitions or exchanges involving private property with landing strips cannot require closure, neglect, or actions that restrict use. These conditions apply to actions not finalized before the enactment of the Act and do not affect the Federal Aviation Administration's authority over aviation or airspace."
