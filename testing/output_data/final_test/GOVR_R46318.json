    "content": "The Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA) requires the DOJ to collect and report data on crimes showing evidence of prejudice based on various factors. Initially focused on race, religion, sexual orientation, and ethnicity, Congress has expanded the definition over the years to include more categories. The purpose is to provide a basis for more effective law enforcement efforts to address hate crimes. The Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA) requires the DOJ to collect data on hate crimes based on various factors including race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, and disability. Congress has amended the act to include data on hate crimes committed by and against juveniles. The DOJ collects and reports hate crime data through the Hate Crime Statistics program and the NCVS, as well as through the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program. The Hate Crime Statistics Program collects data on hate crime offenders' bias motivations for offenses reported to the UCR program. Victim can be an individual, business, institution, or society. Data is reported to the FBI by law enforcement agencies voluntarily. In 2018, over 16,100 agencies participated, representing jurisdictions with nearly 307 million people. The FBI requires law enforcement agencies to follow a two-step process for investigating and reporting hate crimes. The first step involves determining if there is bias motivation, and if so, the incident is labeled as a suspected bias-motivated crime. The second step involves a final determination by an investigator if the crime meets the definition of a hate crime according to the Hate Crime Statistics Program. The FBI requires law enforcement agencies to report hate crimes only when there is sufficient evidence of bias motivation. Data on single and multiple bias incidents can be submitted, with the FBI only including reported offenses in their hate crime data, unlike traditional UCR crime data which estimates missing data. The FBI only includes reported offenses in their hate crime data, with no estimation for missing data. The Bureau of Justice Statistics collects data on hate crime victimizations through the National Crime Victimization Survey since 2003, interviewing residents of a nationally representative sample of households. The NCVS collects self-reported data on various personal and property crime victimizations, using the same hate crime definition as the FBI based on bias against race, gender, religion, disability, and sexual orientation. The NCVS collects data on hate crime victimizations based on bias against race, gender, religion, disability, and sexual orientation. Hate crime victimizations are classified based on evidence of bias, such as hate language or symbols left at the scene. Comparing methodologies of the UCR Hate Crime Statistics Program and the NCVS can cause confusion for those unfamiliar with data collection goals. The difference between hate crime incidents reported by the FBI and hate crime victimizations reported by BJS can be attributed to their different data collection goals. FBI data only include incidents reported to law enforcement, while BJS data aim to capture all victimizations based on bias. The NCVS collects data on reported and unreported hate crime victimizations, resulting in larger totals than the FBI's hate crime data. The FBI requires sufficient evidence of bias for a hate crime to be counted, while the NCVS counts incidents based on victim perception. The NCVS counts hate crimes based on victim perception of bias, including incidents involving hate language or symbols. This approach results in higher estimates of hate crime victimizations compared to the FBI, which requires evidence of bias for a hate crime to be counted. The FBI collects data on a wider range of bias-motivated crimes, such as homicides and vandalisms, not captured by the NCVS. The FBI collects data on bias-motivated crimes like homicides and vandalisms, not captured by the NCVS. Critics point out that many law enforcement agencies report zero hate crimes, leading to accusations of underreporting. Discrepancies between FBI data and self-reported figures by community organizations serving targeted communities support these accusations. Research suggests that some law enforcement agencies have underreported hate crime incidents to the FBI, particularly those targeting LGBTQ, Jewish, Muslim, or Arab communities. A study reviewed assault incident reports from seven agencies, finding that misclassification errors of bias-motivated assaults were relatively infrequent. The study found that misclassification errors of bias-motivated assaults by law enforcement agencies were relatively infrequent, ranging from zero to 8% of all assault incidents. If this percentage is generalizable, it could account for thousands of unreported hate crimes. Another study evaluated hate crime reporting accuracy using incident-based crime data from four local agencies. The study examined misclassification of hate crimes in criminal incidents reported to four agencies in 2008. It found undercounting of hate crimes as the most common error, leading to noticeable unaccounted bias crimes. Critics argue that local law enforcement agencies reporting zero hate crimes are likely to underreport. The Hate Crime Statistics Program shows that the majority of participating law enforcement agencies report zero hate crimes, leading to concerns about significant underreporting to the FBI. From 1996 to 2017, at least 80% of agencies reported zero hate crimes, with the proportion increasing from 2001 to 2014. In 2018, nearly 9 out of 10 agencies reported zero hate crimes. Agencies may report zero hate crimes due to various reasons, including the possibility that no hate crimes occurred in small or homogeneous communities. Additionally, many hate crime victimizations are not reported to the police, leading to underreporting to the FBI. Many hate crime victimizations go unreported due to fear of retaliation, embarrassment, lack of familiarity with hate crime laws, distrust of law enforcement, and fear of being exposed or re-traumatized. Law enforcement agencies face challenges in investigating perceived bias to determine if an offense qualifies as a hate crime, especially in small agencies with limited resources. Few states mandate training for law enforcement on investigating hate crimes, leading to potential undercounting. Ambiguity in bias recognition and reporting standards can hinder accurate identification of hate crimes. Response/retaliation events involve incidents where bias exacerbates a situation into a hate crime, such as a dispute between a white and black motorist escalating into assault with racial slurs. Target-selection events occur when a victim is chosen based on bias. Target-selection events involve the selection of a crime target due to the offender's bias against a specific group, even if the bias is not obvious. This can lead to crimes like robbing men leaving bars frequented by same-sex couples, assuming they won't report the offense. Differences in hate crime definitions between state laws and the HCSA can create ambiguities for law enforcement officers in identifying hate crimes. For example, gender identity may be protected under the HCSA but not recognized as a bias motivation under state laws, leading to potential oversight of gender-bias hate crimes. The processing of bias-crime reporting by law enforcement agencies is variable and prone to errors. The FBI's hate crime data is incomplete, and self-reported hate crime victimization data may include incidents that do not meet the legal standard for hate crimes. The intent of the HCSA was to collect national data on bias-motivated offenses to inform federal hate crime policy. The FBI's Hate Crime Statistics program lacks complete data due to various complications in data collection. One potential solution could be the adoption of the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) to improve data quality. The FBI plans to transition to NIBRS-compliant data collection from law enforcement agencies by January 1, 2021. This change aims to enhance the accuracy and completeness of hate crime data for policymakers at the state and local levels. The FBI plans to transition to NIBRS-compliant data collection from law enforcement agencies by January 1, 2021. NIBRS collects more detailed data on a wider range of offenses compared to the UCR summary reporting system. Reporting agencies under NIBRS can identify bias-motivated offenses for each reported incident. The FBI plans to transition to NIBRS-compliant data collection from law enforcement agencies by January 1, 2021, to collect more detailed data on a wider range of offenses. Hate crime reporting is expected to increase as more agencies adopt NIBRS, which includes reporting bias motivations. NIBRS makes it easier for law enforcement to report hate crimes and provides data on various offenses motivated by bias. The FBI plans to transition to NIBRS-compliant data collection from law enforcement agencies by January 1, 2021, to collect more detailed data on a wider range of offenses, including hate crimes. Participation in the NIBRS program is voluntary, but Congress could consider incentivizing adoption through programs like JAG. The JAG program provides financial incentives for participating in the FBI's crime reporting program, with allocations based on violent crime data. NIBRS data will eventually replace the current reporting system for calculating JAG awards. Despite these incentives, some law enforcement agencies in the US do not participate in the UCR due to data compilation challenges. Congress could consider authorizing a new grant program to help small agencies transition to NIBRS by covering expenses like software, training, and computers. While NIBRS may improve reporting efficiency for hate crimes, it does not address issues such as victims' reluctance to report, the need for officer training on identifying hate crimes, or improving investigation processes. The transition to NIBRS may enhance reporting efficiency for hate crimes but will not resolve differences in hate crime definitions or improve investigation processes for law enforcement agencies."
