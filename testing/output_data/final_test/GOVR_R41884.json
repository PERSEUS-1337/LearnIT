    "content": "Large-scale disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy and the 9/11 terror attacks prompt discussions on the effectiveness of the federal response framework. Studies after Hurricane Katrina highlighted deficiencies in leadership, organizational failures, overwhelmed systems, and inadequate authorities for disaster response and recovery. Reforms in federal emergency management laws and policies have been proposed due to issues with bureaucratic and untimely federal assistance after large-scale disasters. One suggested reform is adding a \"catastrophic declaration\" category to the Stafford Act to streamline response and recovery processes and increase federal assistance for events with extraordinary devastation. The report examines concerns about the adequacy of current Stafford Act declarations for responding to highly destructive events and presents arguments for and against adding a catastrophic declaration amendment. Data analyses of past disasters are used to frame these arguments, along with exploring alternative policy options to avoid the need for catastrophic declarations. The Stafford Act is the main authority for federal assistance during emergencies and disasters in the US, allowing the President to issue declarations for federal aid. FEMA coordinates the federal response, with two guiding principles for the declaration process: the governor's request for assistance and the President's decision to approve it. The President can only declare an emergency or disaster with a gubernatorial request, except in cases where the emergency falls under federal responsibility. The governor must determine if state resources are overwhelmed before requesting federal assistance. The Stafford Act allows for three types of presidential declarations, with a proposal for a fourth type. The Stafford Act allows for three types of presidential declarations: Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG), emergency declarations, and major disaster declarations. A proposal for a catastrophic declaration would add a fourth type of declaration, giving the President or FEMA the authority to issue FMAG declarations for federal assistance in managing and mitigating fires on public or private land. Emergency declarations authorize activities to save lives, protect property, and prevent catastrophes in the United States. They allow states and communities to carry out essential services and take steps to reduce future damage. These declarations do not provide assistance for infrastructure repairs but can be declared before an incident to prevent loss, such as before a hurricane landfall. The Stafford Act defines a major disaster narrowly as any natural catastrophe. The Stafford Act defines a major disaster as any natural catastrophe or any fire, flood, or explosion in the United States that causes severe damage warranting major disaster assistance. Major disaster declarations provide a broader range of assistance to state and local governments, organizations, and individuals. A major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act provides assistance for repair or restoration of public infrastructure and additional programs like disaster unemployment assistance. It may also include recovery programs such as community disaster loans. Moss and Shelhamer suggest that catastrophic incidents tend to occur in large metropolitan regions due to the concentration of people and infrastructure. The authors recommend amending the Stafford Act to define catastrophic incidents broadly as any natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster that results in extraordinary levels of casualties or damage severely affecting the population. Recent catastrophes mentioned include the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, Hurricane Andrew (1992), Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2005), and the September 11 attacks of 2001. The Post-Katrina Act defines a catastrophic incident as an event causing extraordinary casualties, damage, and disruption, with far-reaching consequences beyond state borders and national implications. This definition is used to improve planning documents and is not meant to replace the definition of a major disaster in the Stafford Act. The Post-Katrina Act defines a catastrophic incident as an event causing extraordinary casualties, damage, and disruption with consequences beyond state borders and national implications. Supporters argue that large-scale disasters warrant their own declaration due to unique challenges inadequately addressed by major disaster declarations. The President can declare an emergency without a gubernatorial request, but must wait for one for most emergencies and all major disasters, potentially delaying federal response and assistance efforts. The response and recovery efforts for large-scale disasters involve multiple federal agencies requiring higher levels of leadership to resolve inter-agency conflicts and coordinate efforts efficiently. Current procedures for major disasters are too rigid and slow to provide assistance quickly after destructive incidents. States and localities struggle to pay their cost-share due to the economic impacts of large-scale disasters. A catastrophic declaration could address these challenges. A catastrophic declaration can trigger mechanisms before, during, and after a catastrophe, allowing for the deployment of federal resources and assets in anticipation of imminent disasters. This includes pre-positioning resources, monitoring the situation, communicating with state officials, and deploying teams to enhance response capabilities. The Stafford Act allows for federal support in catastrophic incidents without a gubernatorial request, potentially through amending Sections 401 or 402 to authorize immediate deployment of federal response assets. Some suggest amending the Act for precautionary measures in major disasters without a catastrophic declaration. The National Response Framework (NRF) provides guiding principles for a unified national response to all types of hazards, assigning roles and responsibilities to government, NGOs, private sector, and communities. The NRF is supported by Emergency Support Functions (ESF) Annexes and Incident Annexes, which group federal agencies by their authorities and functions related to specific incidents. ESFs have coordinating and supporting federal agencies responsible for incident response missions. Incident Annexes also identify agencies by their authorities. The National Response Framework (NRF) includes Incident Annexes that identify agencies by their authorities, resources, and functions to support specific incidents. These Annexes also designate coordinating and cooperating agencies. The NRF is scalable, flexible, and adaptable to respond to all types of hazards, including catastrophic incidents. The Catastrophic Incident Annex provides a strategy for coordinating a national response to large-scale events, defining catastrophic incidents as natural or manmade events, including terrorism. The Catastrophic Incident Annex defines catastrophic incidents as natural or manmade events, including terrorism, that result in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the population, infrastructure, environment, economy, national morale, and/or government functions. These incidents could exceed resources normally available to State, tribal, local, and private-sector authorities, significantly interrupt governmental operations and emergency services, and threaten national security, requiring coordinated national planning for accelerated Federal and/or national assistance. In such events, states and localities may not be able to establish or maintain a command structure for incident response initially, leading to potential federal government intervention. The Catastrophic Incident Annex is part of the National Response Framework (NRF) and defines catastrophic incidents as events that result in mass casualties, damage, or disruption. The DHS Secretary can designate an Incident of National Significance if federal assistance is immediately needed due to overwhelming circumstances. The Incident National Significance designation was eliminated due to confusion during the Hurricane Katrina response. The Catastrophic Incident Annex is retained in the NRF, but criteria for its activation is unclear. Some argue for a triggering mechanism like a catastrophic declaration. Proponents argue that a catastrophic declaration could streamline response activities by triggering the Catastrophic Incident Annex and removing barriers to response. It could also establish a chain of command with higher leadership levels. Opponents believe the NRF is scalable enough to handle catastrophic events without a unique declaration. The NRF, with its annexes, allows for responding to catastrophic events without a unique declaration. Opponents argue that additional flexibility during a catastrophic declaration could lead to a chaotic federal response due to tightly coupled operational plans among federal agencies. They also suggest that using a different command structure may duplicate problems and create bureaucratic layers that hinder response efforts. A catastrophic declaration could automatically adjust recovery policies and regulations, triggering changes in federal resource allocation and delivery systems. A catastrophic declaration could automatically increase the federal cost-share to 90% or 100%, providing fiscal relief to states and localities. This adjustment may also extend the 100% funding window for immediate federal aid, encouraging quicker response to catastrophic incidents. The assurance of fiscal relief could prompt quick action for repairs and recovery planning after a catastrophic declaration. Changes may include block grants for immediate needs, gap funding, reimbursement for disaster work labor, increased funding caps, and resources for long-term recovery. The potential for catastrophic declarations could expedite disaster relief funding without waiting for congressional approval. Congressional action on emergency funding has become more rapid in recent years. In recent years, Congress has acted expeditiously in providing supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance, with funding being provided in less than a week after incidents like Hurricane Katrina and 9/11. When Congress took longer than 30 days to enact funding, the incidents generally had fewer damages. The delay in funding for Hurricane Sandy was partly due to a large balance in the Disaster Relief Fund at the time. The 2005 hurricane season resulted in historic levels of disaster response and recovery funding. The 2005 hurricane season resulted in historic levels of disaster response and recovery funding, with the Stafford Act providing broad authority for various forms of assistance. Authorities such as Section 402 for \"General Federal Assistance\" and Section 403 for \"Essential Assistance\" give FEMA discretion to use federal help to achieve disaster response and recovery goals. This section analyzes incidents that could be considered catastrophic to discuss amending the Stafford Act to include a catastrophic declaration. The analysis in this section is based on data from past large-scale incidents in the United States and studies predicting damage levels and loss of life for future disasters. The report uses the value of statistical life (VSL) to assign a monetary value to each fatality caused by an incident, allowing for comparison between incidents with many fatalities and little damage versus those with significant damage but few or no fatalities. The section is divided into four subsections ranking incidents based on previous large-scale events. The analysis ranks some of the costliest incidents in the United States based on previous large-scale disasters, using percentiles derived from estimated damage costs. The data used for this analysis have limitations and variations. If incidents with $63 billion or more in damages are considered catastrophic, then Hurricane Katrina would be the only event meeting that criteria. If incidents with $63 billion or more in damages are considered catastrophic, only Hurricane Katrina qualifies. At the 40th percentile ($50 billion or more), Hurricane Sandy also qualifies. This trend continues until the 30th percentile ($38 billion or more), which includes Hurricane Andrew. Most expensive disasters in American history have occurred recently, with six of the costliest incidents since 1992 and two within the last decade. This suggests large-scale disasters are happening more frequently. Large-scale disasters have been occurring more frequently in the last 30 years, leading to discussions about declaring them as catastrophic events. However, the argument against this is that only Hurricane Katrina truly qualifies as catastrophic in terms of damage costs compared to recent incidents. The increased costs associated with recent disasters are influenced by various factors such as federal expenditures, infrastructure replacement, and development in uninhabited areas. Therefore, opponents argue that damage costs alone are not a sufficient determinant for declaring an event as catastrophic. The report discusses the ranking of incidents based on combined VSL and damage costs. Hurricane Katrina is the only incident that qualifies as catastrophic at the 50th percentile, while Hurricane Sandy, the 1900 Galveston Hurricane, September 11th terrorist attacks, and Hurricane Andrew would qualify at the 30th percentile. Hurricane Ike and the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fire would also be considered. The analysis extends to include potential disasters, changing the order of percentile rankings. If the threshold is set at the 50th percentile ($206 billion or more), only two incidents qualify as catastrophic: the \"ARkStorm\" and South San Andreas Earthquake. Lowering the threshold to the 30th percentile ($124 billion or more) would include Hurricane Katrina as catastrophic. At the 20th percentile ($83 billion or more), the number of catastrophic incidents remains low. The analysis includes potential disasters, changing the order of percentile rankings. If the threshold is set at the 50th percentile ($206 billion or more), only two incidents qualify as catastrophic: the \"ARkStorm\" and South San Andreas Earthquake. Lowering the threshold to the 30th percentile ($124 billion or more) would include Hurricane Katrina as catastrophic. At the 20th percentile ($83 billion or more), the number of catastrophic incidents remains low. Table 5 and Figure 3 provide rankings based on damage for hypothetical incidents, with the New Madrid Earthquake projected to produce more damage than historical incidents. When VSL estimates are combined with damage totals, only the New Madrid Earthquake scenario and \"ARKStorm\" qualify as catastrophic incidents at the 50th percentile ($321 billion or more). The South San Andreas Earthquake would be considered catastrophic at the 30th percentile ($193 billion or more). Highly destructive events occur too rarely to warrant a catastrophic declaration. Only Hurricane Katrina falls under the 20th percentile threshold of $128 billion or more. The 1871 Chicago Fire and Hurricane Katrina are the only incidents that exceed the 80th percentile benchmark, separated by over 130 years. Similar conclusions can be drawn for combined VSL and damage estimate costs, with only two incidents in the last 100 years meeting the criteria for a new declaration category. Critics argue that adding a new catastrophic declaration category is unnecessary as only two incidents in the last 100 years meet the threshold. Adjusting the threshold to include more incidents may be necessary. Proponents point out that recent disasters show an increase in catastrophic incidents, with 8 of the top 17 incidents occurring in the last 30 years. Critics argue against adding a new catastrophic declaration category, citing only two qualifying incidents in the last 100 years. Proponents highlight a recent increase in catastrophic incidents, with 8 of the top 17 occurring in the last 30 years. The analysis suggests future disasters could be more destructive due to population growth and infrastructure development. Data sources are from various governmental sources listed in the Appendix. The analyses in the report are based on data from multiple governmental sources listed in the Appendix. Fatality figures were calculated using average numbers from reported ranges. Hypothetical scenarios used for the analyses do not cover all possible incidents. Some anomalies in reporting were addressed, such as using fatality numbers from historical events when necessary. The 1919 Influenza Pandemic and other incidents were excluded from the analyses due to skewed data results. The report's computations do not consider advancements in development, infrastructure, and population growth over the past century. VSL computations range from $5 million to $10 million per individual, with this report using a VSL of 6.3 million. FEMA did not publish a VSL, so the calculations are based on Customs and Border Protection's figure. The report developed by Customs and Border Protection in 2014 aims to determine catastrophic incidents based on damages and VSL costs. However, other factors like economic and social impacts are not considered in the analysis. Forecasting future events based on this data is limited due to insufficient data points. The data presented in the report is not definitive and should be interpreted carefully. Using a catastrophic declaration for large-scale disasters can provide benefits such as accelerated federal assistance to states. The potential benefits of a catastrophic declaration include accelerated federal assistance to states and more robust federal assistance prior to an incident. Drawbacks may include unclear authority designations, increased federal costs for disaster assistance, and increased federal involvement in incident response and recovery. Upon review of potential policies regarding the use of a catastrophic declaration for large-scale incidents, policymakers may consider the broad definition of an emergency in the Stafford Act, which critics argue gives the President too much discretion. This has led to increased federal involvement and expenditures for disaster assistance through declaration \"creep.\" Critics also point out that once an incident is declared an emergency, similar incidents in the future are more likely to receive the same designation. The Post-Katrina Act similarly uses a broad definition for defining a catastrophe. The Stafford Act and the Post-Katrina Act both use broad definitions for emergencies and catastrophes, potentially leading to declaration \"creep\" for large-scale incidents. Amending the Stafford Act to include a catastrophic declaration would require measurable criteria for determinations. One suggestion to control assistance costs is to allow a catastrophic declaration to be downgraded to a major disaster if damages do not warrant a catastrophic declaration, although this may create confusion. The declaration may seem indecisive and cause confusion, especially in political aspects. Denying a catastrophic declaration could be seen as a failure to respond adequately to a calamitous event. Some argue that unique resources for catastrophic incidents may not be necessary if already provided for major disasters. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed caps on discretionary spending, leading to sequestration if exceeded. The Budget Control Act of 2011 created allowances for disaster relief separate from emergency appropriations, leading to larger appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund. This allowed for immediate funding of needs without the need for a catastrophic declaration, giving Congress more time to target assistance needs. Some may question the need for catastrophic declarations to expedite funding packages, as reports show improved federal response to disasters like Hurricane Sandy. Incentivizing requests for catastrophic declarations could drive up federal funding costs for disaster relief. Some may question the need for catastrophic declarations for efficient response processes to rare catastrophic events like the San Francisco earthquake, the fire of 1906, and Hurricane Katrina. Infrequent use of catastrophic declarations could lead to confusion and antiquation, suggesting special legislation on an as-needed basis may be more effective. The rationale for catastrophic declarations stemmed from the Hurricane Katrina response and recovery experience. The Hurricane Katrina response led to the creation of a template for legislative attempts to improve disaster response and recovery. The Post-Katrina Act made significant changes to the Stafford Act, including the authority to provide case management for disaster victims. These changes have not been fully tested as they were not retroactive to the Katrina disaster. The Post-Katrina Act removed the $5,000 cap on home repairs and allowed repairs to be done up to the maximum amount available under the Individuals and Households Program. It also included a pilot program for Public Assistance that accelerated debris removal and decreased the state and local share of costs. FEMA intends to develop regulations for these changes. FEMA plans to implement regulations for a pilot program that reduced costs by 5% and expired in 2008. The program allowed repairs on rental units to increase housing stock after disasters. FEMA released a report on the program two years ago, stating that additional authorities will be considered later. FEMA has determined that they can repair multi-family rental housing units for disaster survivors through existing authority. Congress enacted the Hurricane Sandy Recovery and Improvement Act, which made changes to the Stafford Act, potentially impacting the federal government's response to future catastrophic events. This includes alternative procedures for public assistance, allowing FEMA to administer the program based on cost estimates to accelerate repairs of public infrastructure. Child care services for disaster victims are now eligible for funding under the \"Other Needs Assistance (ONA)\" grants, part of the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides post-disaster funds for mitigation efforts, with a cost-share of 75% federal/25% state and local. This program aims to reduce future hazards by allocating funds based on total disaster spending. SRIA authorized FEMA to advance up to 25% of the estimated HMGP award to expedite the administration of disaster recovery projects. A joint process for environmental and historical reviews was created to speed up the process. These changes to the Stafford Act have created a more flexible framework for extraordinary events, but there is debate on whether additional changes are needed to enhance FEMA's assistance capabilities. FEMA's ability to assist state and local governments and individuals and families affected by disasters is highlighted through historical events such as the 1871 Chicago Fire, 1900 Galveston Hurricane, 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, and 1919 Influenza Pandemic. These disasters showcase FEMA's role in providing assistance during times of crisis.
