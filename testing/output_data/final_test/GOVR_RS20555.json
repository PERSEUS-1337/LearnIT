    "content": "Federal income tax laws provide special allowances for the blind, including an additional standard deduction amount. In 2008, single individuals could deduct $5,450, heads of households $8,000, and married couples filing jointly $10,900. Married taxpayers aged 65 or older, or blind, could claim an additional standard deduction amount of $1,050 each. The additional standard deduction amount for blind individuals or those aged 65 or older is $2,100 for married couples and $1,350 for singles or heads of households. This deduction is not applicable for dependents who are blind or 65 years old. There is currently no additional standard deduction for other forms of handicap according to federal tax laws. The special tax provisions for blind taxpayers are justified based on the additional expenses they incur due to their condition. Blind individuals incur additional expenses due to their condition, such as transportation costs, home maintenance services, and higher rent near their place of employment. This led to the introduction of a special tax deduction of $500 for blind taxpayers in the Revenue Act of 1943. In the Revenue Act of 1948, the tax provision for blind individuals was changed to an additional personal exemption of $600, providing tax relief throughout the year. This change allowed blind persons to benefit more than just the $100 increase in amount and did not affect their ability to use the standard deduction. The tax provision for the blind was included in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, with the exemption amount increasing over the years. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to create a fairer tax system by broadening the tax base and lowering tax rates. Personal exemption and standard deduction amounts were raised as well. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 raised the personal exemption and standard deduction amounts, reducing the number of taxpayers who itemize deductions. It replaced the additional personal exemption for the blind and elderly with an extra standard deduction for them. This change targeted tax benefits towards lower and moderate income taxpayers. Congress in the 1986 tax act targeted tax benefits to lower and moderate income elderly and blind taxpayers by substituting an additional standard deduction for the additional personal exemption. Advocates argue that the blind face increased living costs due to expenses like hiring readers and guides, as well as additional costs associated with earning income. The extra standard deduction aims to compensate the blind for these added expenses. The additional standard deduction for the blind may not meet horizontal equity principles as it benefits lower or moderate income blind taxpayers more than higher income blind taxpayers. Critics argue that this provision does not provide equivalent treatment to other taxpayers with different handicapping conditions who may also be in need of tax relief. Many handicapped individuals, including the blind, incur special expenses due to their impairments such as travel costs and upkeep services. The additional standard deduction for the blind may not effectively provide tax relief as some low-income blind individuals do not benefit from it. The additional standard deduction for blind individuals may not benefit those with other serious handicapping conditions, leading to questions about the fairness of the provision. Critics argue that providing a subsidy to lower-income blind individuals should also extend to other lower-income groups facing similar handicaps. Some suggest shifting to a grant program to target benefits more precisely, but this could result in taxable income for recipients. Extending the tax advantage to other handicaps would lead to a significant loss of federal revenue. Legislation proposing a revenue loss may face hurdles under the congressional budget process, but can be considered with House and Senate support. Additional enforcement procedures like the \"pay-as-you-go\" requirement expired in FY2002, with no agreement on renewal. Tax expenditures are still considered \"hidden\" expenditures, with more focus on them now. Tax expenditures are seen as \"hidden\" expenditures that can grow in revenue size without periodic review. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated a $8.9 billion revenue cost over five fiscal years for those using additional standard deductions for the elderly and blind."
