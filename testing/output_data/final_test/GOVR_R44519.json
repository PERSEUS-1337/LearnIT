    "content": "This report provides background information on war-related and international emergency funding since FY2001, totaling approximately $2 trillion. The funding was designated for emergencies, Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, and related international affairs activities. The report serves as a reference on these funding sources and related policy issues. The report provides background information on war-related and international emergency funding since FY2001, totaling approximately $2 trillion. It does not estimate war costs within the OCO/GWOT account or in the DOD base budget. For more details on the FY2019 budget and related issues, refer to other CRS reports. Congress may consider supplemental appropriations bills for unforeseen needs or to increase appropriations for other activities. For more information on the Budget Control Act and U.S. policy in Afghanistan and the Middle East, refer to CRS reports. Supplemental appropriations are additional funds provided by Congress for specific activities, often in response to unforeseen needs like war-related expenses. Throughout history, supplemental appropriations have been used to fund war efforts, such as during the Korean War and post-9/11 conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since FY2001, DOD funding for OCO/GWOT has averaged 17% of the department's total budget authority, compared to 6% during the Vietnam conflict. Supplemental appropriations offer flexibility for addressing unforeseen demands, raising questions about their appropriate use. Supplemental appropriations have been used for defense and foreign affairs activities related to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq since 9/11. Initially meant for unforeseen needs, they were later used for both war and non-war-related activities. The Obama Administration shifted away from submitting supplemental appropriations requests for war-related activities, using the regular budget process instead. They also replaced the term \"Global War on Terror\" with \"Overseas Contingency Operations.\" Both the Obama and Trump Administrations sought to exempt OCO funding from BCA limits on defense spending. There is currently no limit on emergency or OCO/GWOT-designated spending. There is no limit on emergency or OCO/GWOT-designated spending, with both Congress and the President playing roles in determining the amount provided to federal agencies each fiscal year. The spending must be designated within the President's budget request for congressional consideration and separately designated by the President after Congress enacts appropriations for it to be available for expenditure. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 defines emergency requirements as for \"unanticipated\" purposes, without specifying eligible activities. The designation of emergency funding by Congress and the President exempts it from certain budget enforcement mechanisms. Definitions of OCO/GWOT or emergency activities have evolved over time to meet strategic and political needs. Prior to February 2009, U.S. operations in response to the 9/11 attacks were known as the Global War on Terror. Between September 2001 and February 2009, funding for post-9/11 military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan was designated as an emergency requirement without a separate budget for the Global War on Terror (GWOT). The term Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) was introduced in 2009 by the Obama Administration in reference to ongoing military operations. Since FY2010, the Department of Defense has requested both base budget and OCO funding in its annual budget submissions to Congress. Since FY2010, annual defense authorization bills have referenced additional appropriations for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) rather than specific military operation names. The BCA amended the BBEDCA to create the OCO/Global War on Terrorism designation, allowing funding exemptions without emergency designation. Starting in 2012, appropriations bills have used the OCO/GWOT designation, with foreign affairs agencies requesting OCO/GWOT funding to differentiate between base and extraordinary costs in supporting U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The State Department and USAID support U.S. operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress adopted the OCO/GWOT approach for foreign affairs funding in FY2012, providing funds for various recipient countries beyond the President's request. OCO/GWOT funds were also allocated for the Global Security Contingency Fund. Budgetary legislation is enforced by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) sets limits on defense and nondefense spending to reduce federal budget deficits. The spending limits are enforced by sequestration, which cancels appropriations to reach specified levels. Certain discretionary spending, like OCO/GWOT funding, is exempt from these limits. Congress and the President have designated funding for OCO to support activities previously funded within the base budget, in response to spending limits enacted by the BCA. This allows for an increase in defense and foreign affairs spending without triggering sequestration. Congress has amended legislation to raise spending limits, reducing deficit-reduction effects. The Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013, 2015, and 2018 raised discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act. The 2018 act increased defense and nondefense funding for FY2019 but did not change limits for FY2020 and FY2021. The Department of Defense has used OCO funding for non-war related activities. The Department of Defense has used OCO funding for activities unrelated to war, with $68 billion categorized for non-war activities from FY2015 through FY2019. Additionally, a DOD Cost of War report shows $219 billion in non-war funds from FY2001 through FY2018. International affairs agencies have also increased their OCO budget allocations. International affairs agencies have increased their OCO budget allocations, with OCO as a share of the international affairs budget growing from about 21% in FY2012 to nearly 35% in FY2017. The State Department and USAID have not specified whether OCO-designated funds are part of their base budgets. The Obama Administration planned to transition enduring costs funded in the OCO budget to the base budget by 2020. This transition may not be possible if the agencies continue to apply OCO designation to unrelated activities. The BCA remains in effect, and OCO funding is used for base-budget requirements, providing flexibility and a safety valve to the spending caps. Without OCO funding, DOD and other agencies would have to cut base budgets and revise strategic priorities, potentially impacting national defense strategies. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warns that allowing defense spending caps to take effect would make the 2018 National Defense Strategy unsustainable. Critics, including Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, have described the OCO account as a \"slush fund\" for military and foreign affairs spending unrelated to contingency operations. OMB criteria for OCO funding include combat losses of equipment and replenishment of munitions expended in combat operations. The OCO funding is used for various purposes such as purchasing vehicles, aircraft, and equipment, replenishing munitions, and transporting personnel and supplies to and from the theater of operations. There is debate over what activities are directly related to war operations. Some question the use of OCO funds for purchasing F-35 fighter jets, while others argue it is necessary to replace planes used in current conflicts. Congress has allocated around $2 trillion for war-related and international activities. Approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority has been allocated for war-related and international emergency activities since 9/11. This includes funding for the Department of Defense, Department of State, USAID, DHS, and the Coast Guard. DOD received $1.8 trillion for OCO/GWOT from FY2001 through FY2009, which was about 17% of its total discretionary budget authority during that period. Funding peaked in FY2008 at $186.9 billion. In FY2008, funding for the Department of Defense peaked at $186.9 billion, accounting for 28.1% of its discretionary budget, due to additional military personnel deployment to Iraq. OCO funding also increased in FY2009 and FY2010 for Afghanistan deployment, and in FY2017 in response to additional appropriations. In FY2019, OCO/GWOT funding totaled $68.8 billion, representing 10% of discretionary spending, with over two-thirds allocated to Operation and Maintenance (O&M) expenses. O&M funds cover military operating costs like fuel, maintenance, and mobilization. DOD defines war-related operational costs as operations, training, facilities support, equipment maintenance, and combat losses replacement. Over half of OCO/GWOT funding since FY2001 has gone to the Army. OCO funding for DOD has not decreased despite reduced U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria has significantly decreased from FY2008 to FY2019, along with a decline in OCO funding. Despite the reduction in troops in these countries, support forces deployed elsewhere have remained relatively steady. The number of U.S. military personnel outside of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other countries decreased from 112,000 in FY2009 to 76,073 in FY2019. When combined with in-country force levels, the total force level decreased from 297,000 in FY2009 to 93,796 in FY2019. The reason for the discrepancy in OCO funding and troop levels is attributed to fixed infrastructure costs. The U.S. military's high costs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria are due to fixed infrastructure and support requirements. In FY2019, $20 billion was requested for in-theater support, with analysts noting a significant increase in costs since the Budget Control Act. Roughly $25 billion in base budget costs shifted to the Afghanistan budget, totaling around $32 billion annually. The actual funding needed for operations in Afghanistan is approximately $20 billion in FY2019. The Department of Defense defines contingency operations as military actions against an enemy of the United States. Costs for these operations cover incremental expenses not incurred during peacetime, excluding base pay and equipment modernization. Criteria for funding requests were issued by the Office of Management and Budget in collaboration with the DOD in 2010. The Government Accountability Office found outdated criteria for deciding base budget or OCO funding, lacking coverage of activities like military operations in Syria and Libya. Legislation directed the Secretary of Defense to update guidelines for OCO budget items. Congress also mandated DOD reports on costs of specific contingency operations. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 directs the Secretary of Defense to submit the Cost of War report quarterly to congressional defense committees and the GAO. The Department of Defense is required to report incremental costs for operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 requires the Secretary of Defense to report quarterly on the costs of operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries in the U.S. Central Command area. The June 2018 Cost of War report to Congress details $1.5 trillion in obligations for contingency operations from FY2001 through FY2018, including funds for Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, Operation Inherent Resolve, and Operation Enduring Freedom. The June 2018 Cost of War report details $1.5 trillion in obligations for contingency operations from FY2001 through FY2018, including funds for Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, Operation Inherent Resolve, and Operation Enduring Freedom. The report also highlights issues with the proportion of OCO appropriations not associated with specific operations due to outdated criteria used by DOD for funding requests. The June 2018 Cost of War report does not mention three recent classified overseas operations targeting militants linked to al-Qaeda and ISIS. Observers have criticized the report for incomplete cost accounting, limited distribution, and formatting issues. Congress allocated $154 billion in OCO funds for State Department and USAID between FY2001 and FY2018, with OCO funding making up 22% of the total appropriations for foreign affairs agencies in FY2018. The Obama Administration's FY2012 International Affairs budget request included OCO funds for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to align military and civilian costs. The request addressed resource demands for State Department missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, emphasizing the importance of a stable Pakistan for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. The FY2012 International Affairs budget request included funding for U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, consulates in Iraq, security costs, Police Development Program, military and development assistance in Iraq, oversight through Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction; for Afghanistan, funding to strengthen Afghan government, support civilians, provide economic assistance, oversight through Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction; for Pakistan, funding for diplomatic presence, security, Counterinsurgency Capability Funds. The Administration has expanded the use of State OCO funds to support various activities such as countering Russian aggression, counterterrorism, humanitarian assistance, and aid to Africa. Emergency supplemental funding has also been requested to support State/USAID efforts in countering the Islamic State and responding to global health threats. The Trump Administration requested no OCO/GWOT funding for the Department of State and USAID in FY2019. However, approximately $8 billion in OCO-designated funding was appropriated for various priorities in the House and Senate SFOPS bills. The enacted emergency and OCO/GWOT appropriations for State/USAID include aid for natural disasters and global health threats like the Ebola and Zika viruses, as well as funding for diplomatic operations and foreign aid programs. Since 2012, OCO funds have been appropriated for foreign affairs activities, exceeding annual requests and expanding to additional countries. Approximately $3 billion in post-9/11 emergency and OCO funding has supported U.S. Coast Guard missions, including homeland security and operations in support of the Navy. Funding has been allocated through appropriations or transfers from Navy accounts. Usage of these funds has varied, with one FY2009 request including a transfer for funding purposes. The supplemental appropriations request included funding for Coast Guard operations in support of OIF and OEF, as well as other classified activities. The FY2017 OCO request for Navy Operations and Maintenance included $163 million for Coast Guard operational support. The Trump Administration initially requested $89 billion in OCO funding for FY2019, with $20 billion shifted into the DOD base budget request after Congress raised the spending caps. In a budget amendment statement, Mulvaney proposed shifting certain costs funded in OCO to the base budget starting in FY2020. The revised amount requested for DOD OCO funding in FY2019 is $69 billion, with majority allocated to Operation Freedom's Sentinel in Afghanistan, Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria, European Deterrence Initiative, and security cooperation. The FY2019 OCO budget assumes a total force level of 93,796 personnel. The FY2019 force level for DOD OCO funding is 93,796 personnel, with 3,153 personnel increase for in-theater support. OCO funding has not declined at the same rate as troop strength due to fixed costs. The FY2019 DOD OCO budget request includes in-theater support for contingency operations, combat support like ISR assets, equipment reset, and international programs. The budget is broken down by functional category. The FY2019 DOD OCO budget request includes $20 billion for in-theater support, $14.7 billion for operations and force protection, and $9.9 billion for unspecified classified programs. Approximately $47 billion (68%) of the budget consists of enduring activities that could be funded in the DOD base budget. The Executive Branch budget documents for FY2019 show varying projections for OCO funding over the FYDP. The President's initial budget request projected increasing caps on defense discretionary base budget authority and defense funding for OCO totaling $73 billion in FY2020 and $66 billion in FY2021. Projected defense discretionary funding for FY2020 and FY2021 is $733 billion and $743 billion, respectively. FY2019 DOD budget documents show a consistent defense discretionary topline for these years, with additional funding for OCO totaling $20 billion in FY2020-FY2023 and $53 billion in FY2020, and $45.8 billion in each year from FY2021-FY2023. Congress has appropriated $68.8 billion for DOD OCO funding in FY2019. In FY2019, Congress passed two bills providing defense funds totaling $921 million. OCO levels for State, USAID, Homeland Security, and Coast Guard remain at FY2018 levels due to continuing resolutions. The House and Senate SFOPS bills would have allocated $8 billion in OCO funding. The House Homeland Security appropriations bill did not include OCO/GWOT funding for the Coast Guard. The Senate committee-reported version of the bill (S. 3109, 115th Congress) proposed $165 million for OCO/GWOT funding for the Coast Guard. The 116th Congress may need to decide on changing discretionary defense and nondefense spending limits under the Budget Control Act, which could impact future OCO funding levels. Lawmakers are faced with questions on whether to keep the BCA as is, repeal it, amend the limits, or reduce DOD and international affairs funding to stay within the caps. The National Defense Strategy Commission recommended eliminating the final two years of caps under the Budget Control Act and gradually integrating Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending back into the base Pentagon budget. The 115th Congress included about $8 billion in OCO funding for State/USAID, and it is uncertain if the 116th Congress will pass this level of OCO funding. Congress may need to decide on changing discretionary defense and nondefense spending limits under the Budget Control Act, which could impact future OCO funding levels. The Trump Administration projected increasing defense spending in FY2020 and FY2021 beyond the statutory limits of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The President's initial FY2019 budget request projected $733 billion in defense discretionary spending in FY2020, including a base budget of $660 billion and an OCO defense budget of $73 billion. These figures serve as possible scenarios for Congress to consider. The revised FY2019 budget request projected $733 billion in defense discretionary spending in FY2020, with a base budget of $713 billion and an OCO budget of $20 billion. Congress could potentially keep the BCA defense cap unchanged at $576 billion and designate an additional $157 billion for OCO. The President's initial FY2019 budget request projected $743 billion in defense discretionary spending in FY2021, with a base budget of $677 billion and an OCO budget of $66 billion. The President's revised FY2019 budget request projected $743 billion in defense discretionary spending in FY2021, with a base budget of $723 billion and an OCO budget of $20 billion. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the National Defense Strategy Commission recommend increasing the defense budget by 3-5% annually above inflation to meet U.S. strategic goals. President Donald Trump has proposed a discretionary defense spending request of $700 billion in FY2020, a potential decrease from FY2019. However, there are reports that he may request $750 billion instead. Senator James Inhofe and Representative Mac Thornberry argue against any cuts in the defense budget, with Thornberry suggesting the transfer of OCO costs into the regular budget for more predictable budgeting. Representative Adam Smith and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan express concerns about the high defense budget and the need for a flat topline for national defense. Under Secretary of Defense David Norquist is reportedly preparing two budgets for FY2020, one assuming $733 billion and another amount. An analyst has raised concerns about the impact of including enduring OCO costs in the base budget for FY2020, which could complicate bipartisan agreement on increasing defense and nondefense budget caps. The GAO highlighted the need for a reliable estimate of DOD's enduring OCO costs to make informed budget decisions. The DOD has not fully estimated these costs due to constraints from the BCA. The Department of Defense has not fully estimated enduring Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) costs due to constraints from the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Congressional Budget Office estimated OCO funding for DOD enduring activities to be over $50 billion annually from 2006 to 2018, projected to be around $47 billion per year starting in FY2020. The Department of Defense projected $53 billion for \"OCO to Base\" in FY2020, consistent with DOD's published projections. Analysts warn that reliance on OCO for base budget needs could harm national security by undermining budget controls, creating insecurity in the defense workforce, and causing long-term uncertainty in defense planning. Transitioning OCO expenses to the base budget would require increased budget caps, targeted program cuts, and higher revenues. The European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) is a potential enduring activity in the OCO budget. The European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), previously known as the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), is a potential enduring activity in the OCO budget. EDI funding in the OCO budget does not include projections for future years, creating uncertainty for allies and adversaries. However, some argue that the flexibility of EDI allows for quick responses to security needs in Europe and ensures funds for deterrence will not be redirected. The National Defense Strategy Commission warns against relying on OCO funding to increase the defense budget for great power competition with China and Russia. Lawmakers and the Department of Defense have turned to OCO funds due to budget constraints, leading to problems and distortions in resourcing. The use of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding has led to problems and distortions in resourcing, as it no longer aligns with warfighting operations in the Middle East and is not a top priority according to the National Defense Strategy. Relying on OCO for long-term military reorientation towards high-end competition is not sustainable due to its unpredictability and limitations on what the funds can be used for. Funding designation for OCO is governed by various statutes, OMB guidance, and DOD regulations. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA) of 1985 includes statutory definitions of emergency and unanticipated for budget enforcement through sequestration. Appropriations can be designated by Congress and the President as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, exempt from discretionary spending limits. Title 10, United States Code\u2014Armed Forces 10 U.S.C. 101\u2014Definitions Section 101 provides terms definitions. DOD and Department of State are subject to guidance on OCO spending. In October 2006, under the Bush Administration, the DOD was directed to request supplemental funding for the \"longer war on terror.\" The Obama Administration later required some OCO costs to be moved back into the base budget, but restrictions on pay were waived within six months. The agency revised its criteria for delineating base and OCO spending in 2009, which was deemed successful. The updated guidance in 2010 imposed stricter definitions for equipment repair and procurement, limited OCO funds for RDT&E, excluded certain expenses like pay and allowances, family support initiatives, and BRAC amounts. OMB further revised its guidance in September 2010 due to GAO reports questioning the reliability of DOD reporting on OCO costs. The Department of Defense revised its criteria for delineating base and OCO spending in 2009 and further updated guidance in 2010. The OMB imposed stricter definitions for equipment repair and procurement, limited OCO funds for RDT&E, and excluded certain expenses. DOD incorporated the September 2010 OMB criteria for war costs into the Financial Management Regulation, including general cost categories for contingency operations and transfer authorities for shifting funds between budget accounts. The Department of Defense has the authority to transfer funds for higher priority items based on unforeseen military requirements, with specific limits set by annual defense authorization and appropriation acts. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill sets the base budget transfer cap at $4 billion and the OCO transfer cap at $2 billion. The Department of State also has OCO transfer authority provided in appropriations acts. The Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF) was established for DOD in FY1997 to provide flexibility for operational requirements. Transfers from OCOTF are processed using existing reprogramming procedures, with quarterly reports submitted to congressional oversight committees documenting all transfers to DOD components' base budget accounts. Beginning in FY2002, funds for contingency requirements were appropriated directly to DOD components' Operation and Maintenance and Military Personnel accounts. The Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF) was established in FY1997 for DOD to provide flexibility for operational requirements. Funds for certain DOD contingency operations have been moved to the base budget request, no longer designated as emergency or OCO/GWOT requirements. This shift typically occurs as the operational activities of an enduring nature. In FY1997, the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF) was established by DOD to provide flexibility for operational requirements. Certain DOD contingency operations have been shifted from emergency or OCO/GWOT requirements to the base budget request as operational activities evolve over time. For example, funding for Operation Noble Eagle was moved to the base budget request in 2005. Contingency operations funded through DOD's base budget have included NATO Operations in the Balkans and Joint Task Force - Bravo. Operation Juniper Shield, formerly known as Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans Sahara, supports efforts to defeat violent extremist organizations in East Africa. It also includes military engagement with partner African countries and readiness for crisis response and evacuation. Operation Noble Eagle continues to defend the United States from airborne threats. Operation Noble Eagle funds efforts to defend the United States from airborne attacks and maintain sovereignty of U.S. airspace. Operation Enduring Freedom-Horn of Africa supports defeating violent extremist organizations in East Africa and provides military engagement with partner African countries. Operation Enduring Freedom-Caribbean and Central America focuses on counterterrorism to support DOD's military objectives. Operation Observant Compass is also mentioned. Operation Observant Compass and Operation Spartan Shield were established to support U.S. military personnel in countering the Lord's Resistance Army and Central Command missions. Congress has created funds and programs through the OCO process to finance overseas contingency operations-related activities. These funds have expiration dates and require reauthorization by Congress. Congress has authorized OCO programs and funds like Afghan Security Forces Fund, Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund, Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund, and Commander's Emergency Response Program to support military and security forces, counterterrorism efforts, and infrastructure improvements. These funds require reauthorization by Congress and provide flexibility for unpredictable situations. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device (IEDs) Defeat Fund coordinates counter-IED efforts in DOD, while the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle (MRAP) Fund expedites MRAP procurement. The European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) provides funding to NATO allies for security reassurance. The curr_chunk discusses funds established to support allies and partners in Europe, address security challenges, prevent crises, and assist with refugee crises. The fund was created to provide assistance to refugee crises in Africa, the Near East, South and Central Asia, Europe, and Eurasia, as well as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. This initiative offers training, equipment, defensive weapons, logistics support, and intelligence to Ukraine's military and national security forces. The report was updated by various specialists in defense policy and budget. The curr_chunk discusses the Legislative Process and mentions the CRS Analyst in Public Finance. A Research Assistant helped compile the graphics."
