    "content": "The President and the Senate share the power to appoint principal officers of the United States. The appointment process involves selection and nomination by the President, Senate consideration, and official appointment if confirmed. Nominations are referred to Senate committees for review before being placed on the Executive Calendar for floor consideration. The President submits nominations to the Senate for advice and consent positions, which are then referred to the appropriate committee based on Senate Rule XXV. Most nominations are sent to a single committee, guided by precedents, standing orders, and unanimous consent agreements. The Senate referral process for nominations involves sending most nominations to a single committee, but occasionally, multiple committees may be involved based on UC agreements or standing orders. Nominations can be referred jointly or sequentially, with all committees required to report to the full Senate before consideration on the floor. The Senate referral process for nominations involves sending most nominations to a single committee, but occasionally, multiple committees may be involved based on UC agreements or standing orders. Nominations can be referred jointly or sequentially, with committees required to report within a specified period of time. Joint referral occurs when multiple committees have equal jurisdictional claims, while sequential referral is more likely when one committee has jurisdictional predominance. In cases where jurisdictional predominance favors one committee for nominations, they are usually referred to that committee first before being sequentially referred to other committees. Occasionally, nominations may be referred to multiple committees on an ad hoc basis. For example, a 2004 nomination for Under Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement was first referred to the Committee on Finance before being referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and then back to the Committee on Finance. In 2006, nominations for Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research and federal coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects were referred to different committees before being discharged and referred to other committees. Different committees may have jurisdiction over positions within the same department or agency. The appointment provisions for executive branch chief financial officers (CFOs) are unique. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 covers CFOs in 25 specified departments and agencies, with 17 positions requiring appointment by the President with Senate approval. These CFO positions are detailed under specific committees in the report. On June 29, 2011, the Senate adopted S.Res. 116, a resolution. The Senate adopted S.Res. 116 on June 29, 2011, establishing expedited procedures for certain presidential nominations. Over 40 specified nominations are placed directly on the Senate Executive Calendar without committee referral. Nominations remain in a special category until the committee chairman certifies receipt of required documents from the nominee. The Senate adopted S.Res. 116 on June 29, 2011, establishing expedited procedures for certain presidential nominations. Nominations in question are transferred to a separate section of the Executive Calendar for 10 days before being placed in the \"Nominations\" section. Any Senator can request a nomination be referred to a Senate committee while it is on the Executive Calendar. The Senate established new precedents for cloture on presidential nominations in 2013 and 2017, requiring a majority vote of Senators present. This report identifies positions under each Senate committee's jurisdiction for nominations. The lists are based on referrals as of June 30, 2016. The report categorizes positions as full- or part-time under each committee list based on referrals as of June 30, 2016.
