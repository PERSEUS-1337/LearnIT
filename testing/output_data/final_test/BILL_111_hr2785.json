The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will restore a toll-free hotline for physicians to inquire about the Medicare program. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose. Definitions for \"physician\" and \"carrier\" are provided in this section.

The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must follow specific steps before implementing new evaluation and management guidelines under the Medicare program, including physician assessment, pilot projects in different regions, and meeting specified objectives. Pilot projects under this subsection must be of sufficient length for education, analysis, and assessment of E&M guidelines, conducted in consultation with medical societies. One pilot project will focus on peer review by physicians evaluating medical records for outlier services based on CPT guidelines. The pilot projects will assess the impact of potential E&M guidelines on different physician practices and compliance costs. A report on meeting objectives must be submitted within 6 months after the conclusion of all pilot projects. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will report to specific committees on pilot projects' outcomes related to E&M guidelines.

OVERPAYMENTS UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. If a carrier conducts a post-payment audit of a physician under Medicare, they must provide the physician with a personalized notice of billing issues within 3 months. The notice should offer suggestions on how to resolve the billing problem. Physicians are allowed to repay Medicare overpayments without penalty or interest within 3 months of notification, as long as the overpayment was not due to fraudulent actions. If a physician discovers an overpayment before being notified by the carrier, they can reimburse Medicare without penalty. First-time billing errors may not result in fines unless fraudulent claims are involved. Carriers must inform physicians of problem claims before using extrapolation for reimbursement or penalties. Physicians can dispute carrier's charges of overpayment by submitting additional information without waiving their right to a hearing. Carriers conducting pre-payment screens must not delay reimbursements for more than one month after a post-payment audit."
