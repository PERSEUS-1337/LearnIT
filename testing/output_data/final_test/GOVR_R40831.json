    "content": "Health care reform is a top priority for the 111th Congress due to concerns about the uninsured and rising health care costs. Improving access and controlling costs will require changes to financing and delivery. Experts highlight the system's failure to consistently provide high-quality care. The National Priorities Partnership identified four major challenges, including improving patient safety and eradicating disparities in care. The challenges in healthcare include reducing disparities in care for minorities and low-income groups, addressing chronic diseases, and eliminating unnecessary and ineffective care. Health reform proposals aim to improve access and quality of care while reducing wasteful spending. Health care delivery reform proposals focus on expanding the primary care workforce, promoting preventive services, and enhancing chronic care management to improve patient outcomes and reduce waste in the healthcare system. Coordination of care is crucial to avoid unnecessary treatments and medication use. Health workforce policy is a key component of health reform, aiming to shift focus from specialty care to primary care and chronic disease management. Concerns about a future physician shortage exist, but simply adding more physicians may not improve accessibility or quality of care. Disparities in physician supply are driven by physician preferences rather than patient needs. Health policy analysts recommend training more primary care physicians and developing integrated systems of care instead of focusing on overall physician supply. Clinical preventive services, such as immunizations and screening tests, are key in delivery reform to improve health and reduce costs. Delivery reform focuses on improving the quality of care through partnerships between patients and primary care physicians, known as medical homes. Disease management programs, like those for diabetes, help patients manage their own care through education, monitoring symptoms, and following treatment plans. These programs aim to address rising costs and lack of care coordination. Health care delivery reform requires mechanisms like performance measurement, comparative effectiveness research, adoption of health information technology, and alignment of payment incentives with high-quality care. Improvements in healthcare quality depend on providers having financial incentives to change their delivery methods, which is hindered by fee-for-service payment models. Public and private payers are increasingly tying provider payments to performance on quality measures to incentivize changes in the healthcare delivery system. The use of performance measures to track care quality is growing, but concerns about data development and use persist. Public reporting of quality information is crucial for patients to make informed healthcare choices. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $17 billion for biomedical research, a step towards reforming the healthcare delivery system. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) allocated $17 billion for biomedical research and health-related programs, including $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research. It also included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act to promote the adoption of health information technology for electronic sharing of clinical data. $2 billion was allocated for HIT grant programs. HIT is seen as a vital component of healthcare reform. Health Information Technology (HIT) is a crucial part of healthcare reform, involving electronic health records, computerized systems for ordering tests and medications, and a national health information network for secure data exchange among providers. HIT can improve efficiency by eliminating paper records, reduce duplicate tests, enhance care quality by identifying drug interactions, and help manage patients with multiple conditions. It also offers vast clinical data for research and performance measurement. Senator Harkin introduced the Affordable Health Choices Act (S. 1679) for health care reform, including private insurance, a public option, quality improvement, preventive services, workforce expansion, and more. The Senate HELP bill, as amended by the HELP Committee, includes provisions to increase the primary care and public health workforce, prevent health care fraud and abuse, and address access to medical therapies. The bill covers various aspects such as health centers, workforce programs, health care quality, prevention, FDA, emergency care, behavioral health, pain management, and the PHSA 340B drug pricing program. The report provides background on current law and practice for various sections, including the PHSA 340B drug pricing program. References to \"the Secretary\" refer to the Secretary of HHS. A companion report summarizes comparable provisions in the House health reform legislation, H.R. 3200. The report will be updated to reflect future legislative actions. The committees have held markups and ordered legislation to be reported, focusing on titles under their jurisdiction. PHSA Sec. 330 authorizes the health center program, providing grants to Community Health Centers, migrant health centers, and others. Health centers offer primary care to uninsured and underinsured patients, regardless of ability to pay. They are located in medically underserved areas and have bipartisan support. The Health Center program has seen significant growth in recent years, with an increase from 3,500 sites in 2002 to an estimated 9,000 sites in 2009. The program was reauthorized by the Health Care Safety Net Act of 2008, which also mandated a study on the economic costs and benefits of school-based health clinics. Studies show that health centers improve access to primary care services, reducing disparities and costs by preventing expensive emergency room visits. The proposed amendments to PHSA Sec. 330 would authorize increasing amounts for the health center program from FY2010 to FY2014. The Health Center program has seen significant growth, with an increase in sites from 3,500 in 2002 to 9,000 in 2009. The program was reauthorized in 2008, with proposed amendments to authorize increasing amounts for FY2010 to FY2014. For FY2016 and beyond, funding would be based on a formula considering previous appropriations, per patient costs, and patient increases. CHCs can contract with specified entities for primary health care services, with criteria for eligibility specified. The proposed changes to the health center programs include expanding the definition of health centers, allowing facilities to be located outside of medically underserved areas if accessible to the service population, permitting grant applications for additional centers in established catchment areas, amending grant application requirements, providing flexibility to modify budgets, and authorizing collaboration for joint purchasing agreements.

Funding under PHSA Title VII supports medical schools, community-based practice, primary care, and opportunities for minorities and disadvantaged students. Annual funding for Title VII programs in the early 1970s exceeded $2.5 billion (in 2009 dollars) but has since decreased to around $200 million. PHSA Title VIII also supports nursing education and training programs. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program offers scholarships and loan repayments for medical students and other healthcare providers who serve in Health Professional Shortage Areas. Demand for NHSC clinicians exceeds availability. The NHSC program faces high demand for clinicians, exceeding availability. HHS estimates only 8% of the total need for primary care practitioners in HPSAs is being met. A comprehensive methodology and criteria for designating medically underserved populations and HPSAs would be established through a negotiated rulemaking process. The Secretary must consider data availability, timeliness, and impact on various populations, institutions, and stakeholders. Appointing a rulemaking committee, publishing an interim final rule by July 1, 2010, and receiving timely reports are required. The NHSC program aims to address the high demand for clinicians in underserved areas. A rulemaking process will establish criteria for designating HPSAs. Funding amounts for NHSC scholarships and loan repayments are specified for fiscal years 2010-2015. PHSA Title VII authorizes student loan programs for health professions students.

The Secretary must submit an annual report on activities and effectiveness under Title IV of the bill, with the authority to require recipients of funds to submit reports as well. Various stakeholders have made efforts to address healthcare quality. Efforts to improve healthcare quality have focused on metrics, reporting quality performance, and value-based purchasing. However, there is no federal strategy or coordinated infrastructure for this purpose. The Senate HELP bill addresses quality measurement, patient safety, care coordination, and comparative effectiveness research. National priorities for performance improvement are not currently required by law. The Secretary is required by law to have a contract with a consensus-based entity to develop national priorities for health care performance improvement. AHRQ has statutory authorities to promote quality improvement through research and development of quality measures. The AHRQ is responsible for developing and disseminating quality measures for health outcomes. Current law does not require multi-stakeholder input in selecting quality measures for CMS programs. The Senate HELP bill aims to establish a national strategy for quality improvement and endorse comprehensive quality measures.

The Director of AHRQ would award grants or contracts to develop, update, and produce patient decision aids, test materials for balance and evidence-based content, educate providers on their use, establish Shared Decision Making Resource Centers, and award grants to providers for shared decision-making techniques. Quality measures for shared decision making would be adopted, providers receiving grants would report data on these measures to the Secretary, who would provide feedback. Authorization for appropriations would be provided for FY2010 and subsequent fiscal years. This section would amend PHSA. The legislation would amend PHSA Sec. 340A to require minimum core proficiencies for patient navigators funded by grants, with an appropriation of $3.5 million for FY2010 and subsequent years. Additionally, a new PHSA Sec. 937 would establish requirements for the Secretary to establish standards for patient decision aids and shared decision-making techniques. The new section would establish a Center for Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation within AHRQ to conduct research on comparative health outcomes and effectiveness of healthcare treatments. The Center would use various methodologies to reduce treatment disparities among populations and provide informational tools for healthcare decision making. The new section establishes a Center for Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation within AHRQ to conduct research on comparative health outcomes and effectiveness of healthcare treatments. The Center would use scientifically based methods and ensure transparency in research conduct, with a process for stakeholders to review and comment on the research. It would disseminate research findings to healthcare providers, patients, and specified groups. The Center for Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation was established within AHRQ to conduct research on comparative health outcomes and effectiveness of healthcare treatments. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act's Administrative Simplification provisions instructed the Secretary to adopt standards for electronic transmission of health care transactions. A final rule was published in 2000 adopting existing standards for specified transactions. The HIPAA Administrative Simplification standards, established in 2000, include ASC X12 standards for health care transactions. In 2009, updated versions of these standards were adopted to replace the existing ones. These standards apply to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and providers transmitting HIPAA-specified transactions electronically. While HIPAA does not mandate electronic transactions, providers choosing to do so must comply with the standards. The Administrative Simplification Compliance Act of 2001 mandates electronic submission of Medicare claims in the HIPAA standard format, with exceptions for small providers. Unique identifiers for providers and employers have been adopted, while the health plan identifier is still under review. Congress has blocked the development of a unique individual identifier. The Secretary is required to adopt and update standards for electronic financial and administrative transactions within two years of enactment. The standards for electronic financial and administrative transactions must be unique, authoritative, comprehensive, and enable real-time determination of patient financial responsibility. They should also provide timely acknowledgment and describe all data elements clearly. Additionally, the initial set of standards must clarify, refine, and expand HIPAA Administrative Simplification standards, include requirements for acknowledgments and electronic funds transfers, and ensure timely and transparent claim processing. The section outlines procedures for expediting the adoption of additions and modifications to the initial set of standards for electronic financial and administrative transactions. Within two years, the Secretary must submit a five-year implementation plan to Congress. Within one year, a final rule must be established for a unique health plan identifier. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits offering or accepting remuneration to induce patient referrals or purchases. The federal anti-kickback statute and the Medicare physician self-referral (Stark) law prohibit certain financial relationships in healthcare to prevent patient referrals for services. Violations can result in civil and criminal penalties, and exclusion from federal health care programs. Safe harbors and exceptions are established to mitigate potential violations. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 created safe harbors for HIT and training services related to electronic prescribing. The final rule, published in August 2006, created safe harbors for EHR software with e-prescribing capabilities. Sec. 231 establishes safe harbors for HIT and related services provided by hospitals to physicians, and for services provided to physicians by various healthcare entities specified by the Secretary. The provision of HIT and related services by a PDP sponsor, MA organization, or similar entity must be outlined in a written agreement with the physician to improve healthcare quality. The entity cannot tie services to referrals or limit interoperability with other systems. Sec. 232 creates an exception to the Stark law for HIT services provided to physicians by specified entities, including hospitals and group practices. The HIT safe harbors and Stark exception cover hardware, software, and other technology for clinical health information exchange. They would take effect 120 days after enactment and preempt state laws penalizing HIT provision. The Secretary must report to Congress within three years on their impact and make recommendations for changes if needed. The HITECH Act codified ONCHIT and established interoperability standards for electronic health information exchange among healthcare stakeholders. It also created an HIT Policy Committee and an HIT Standards Committee to develop and recommend policies and standards for nationwide HIT infrastructure implementation. The HITECH Act established an HIT Standards Committee to develop interoperable and secure standards for electronic health information exchange, in consultation with the HIT Policy Committee. The Secretary was required to develop standards facilitating enrollment in federal and state health programs within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary would establish standards for enrollment in health programs, including verification of eligibility, reuse of stored information, online management of eligibility, system expansion for new programs, notification of eligibility status, and streamlining the enrollment process. States and entities receiving federal HIT funds would need to incorporate these standards, with grants awarded for IT system development or upgrades. The Secretary would establish standards for enrollment in health programs, including verification of eligibility and online management. The adoption and implementation plan must demonstrate collaboration with other grantees. The HIT Policy Committee would recommend standards for certified EHRs to collect quality measures. Prevention interventions can improve patient and population health, including clinical and community-based services. Many clinical preventive services, including cancer screenings, may not result in cost savings for payers but rather incur a net cost. There is debate on whether these services could lead to savings in a broader context and what savings may accrue to the federal government or society from community-based prevention activities. Current laws address prevention through coverage of services under Medicare and Medicaid, funding for community-based programs, support for evidence review processes, and regulation of employer wellness programs. The Senate HELP bill proposes new coverage requirements for private insurance providers, focusing on disease prevention, health promotion, community-based research, and workforce improvement in public health and primary care. The bill aims to balance flexibility and compliance with federal privacy and civil rights laws. The federal government supports the development of evidence-based recommendations for clinical and community preventive services through advisory committees like the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the Task Force on Community Preventive Services. These committees review scientific evidence to develop recommendations for healthcare providers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) develop science-based recommendations for vaccines and preventive services. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services (TFCPS) recommends reducing beneficiary cost-sharing for screening mammography to increase utilization, but found insufficient evidence for cervical or colorectal cancer screening. Wellness programs offered by employers may be subject to federal laws such as HIPAA, which established nondiscrimination requirements to prevent discrimination based on health status-related factors. HIPAA prohibits group health plans and insurance issuers from basing coverage eligibility on health-related factors. This includes physical or mental health status, claims experience, medical history, genetic information, and disability. Premiums cannot be higher based on these factors, but discounts can be offered for participation in wellness programs. The Departments of Labor, Treasury, and HHS issued regulations on HIPAA's nondiscrimination provisions for wellness programs, creating new statutory requirements for group health plans and insurers. The regulations prohibit eligibility rules based on health status-related factors and codify provisions of the HIPAA wellness program regulations. HIPAA wellness program regulations establish two types of programs: those that do not condition rewards on health factors and those that do. The reward for the latter type cannot exceed 30% of employee-only coverage cost, potentially increased to 50% by HHS and Treasury Secretaries. The new PHSA Sec. Sec. 2708 would require a group health plan and a health program to offer rewards that do not exceed 20% of the cost of employee coverage under the plan. The wellness program must be designed to promote health or prevent disease and must be available to all individuals. A reasonable alternative standard must be provided for individuals with medical conditions that make it difficult to meet the standard. New PHSA Sec. Sec. 2708 and 2709 require group health plans and health insurance issuers to cover preventive services with minimal or no cost-sharing, including USPSTF-recommended items, ACIP-recommended immunizations, and preventive care for infants, children, and adolescents. Additionally, coverage for women must include additional preventive care and screenings as outlined by HRSA guidelines. This bill also introduces a new PHSA Sec. 3103 specifying required health benefits. The new PHSA Sec. 3103 specifies health benefits required for plans to participate in the American Health Benefit Gateway, including coverage for prevention and wellness services. Plans can offer incentives for participation in wellness programs. The PHSA Sec. 3103 requires health plans to offer variations in employee contributions for wellness programs. It also establishes a National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council to coordinate federal prevention efforts and develop a national health strategy. The proposal aims to establish a Prevention and Public Health Fund with increasing annual appropriations from $2 billion in FY2010 to $10 billion in FY2014 through FY2019, and $10 billion for each fiscal year thereafter. The Secretary would transfer funds to HHS accounts for prevention, wellness, and public health activities, subject to annual appropriations Act transfer authority. The proposal establishes a Prevention and Public Health Fund with increasing annual appropriations. The Committees on Appropriations could transfer funds to eligible activities. The AHRQ Director would convene a Preventive Services Task Force to review scientific evidence and develop recommendations for clinical preventive services. The Task Force would have specified duties, including development of topic areas for review, revision of recommendations every five years, and integration with federal health objectives. AHRQ would provide support for Task Force operations. Recommendations made by Task Force members would be independent and not subject to political pressure. Funding would be authorized for Task Force activities. The Community Task Force, similar to the Preventive Services Task Force, would review scientific evidence on community preventive interventions for recommendations in the Guide to Community Preventive Services. CDC would provide support for the Community Task Force, with authorized funding for its activities. Coordination with other Task Forces and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices would be required. The Secretary, in consultation with the IOM, would plan and implement a national public-private partnership for a prevention and health promotion outreach campaign. The purpose is to raise public awareness of health improvement and preventive services. Annual grants would be provided to each state for a \"Right Choices\" program. The \"Right Choices\" program would be established by the state through Medicaid or a similar program. Outreach would be conducted to provide eligible individuals with a \"Right Choices\" card. Eligibility criteria include being a US citizen or legal resident, having no private insurance for six months, having a family income at or below 350% of the federal poverty level, and not being eligible for other health benefits. Participants would receive a health risk appraisal and care plan from a primary care physician. The \"Right Choices\" program would establish care plans for participants with chronic illnesses, referring them to state or federal safety net providers. Providers would be reimbursed based on Medicaid rates, with states requiring contributions from individuals above 200% of the federal poverty level. Grants would be distributed based on uninsured rates and prevalent chronic diseases, with the Secretary determining grant usage and administration. The program would allocate funds for participant treatment, with a limit of 20% of the total appropriation. The Secretary would determine payment methods to states for program access until federal or state Gateways are available. The program would not exceed $5 billion per fiscal year and would be evaluated annually. States are not required to use state revenues for program activities, and it would sunset once Gateways are available. This section would create a new PHSA Part S for \"Oral Healthcare Prevention Activities.\" The new PHSA Sec. 399GG would establish a national public education campaign on oral health care prevention and education, targeting oral diseases like dental carries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer. It would ensure culturally and linguistically appropriate activities and use science-based strategies. Additionally, a new PHSA Sec. 399GG-1 would award grants to demonstrate research-based dental caries disease management activities by community-based dental service providers. The new section would mandate a school-based dental sealant program and require the Secretary to award program grants to states, territories, and Indian organizations. It would also authorize the appropriation of funds to carry out the new PHSA Part S. The new section mandates a school-based dental sealant program and requires the Secretary to award program grants to states, territories, and tribal entities. It also includes provisions for establishing oral health leadership programs and implementing oral health components in national health surveys and surveillance systems. Authorized funds are available through FY2014. The National Oral Health Surveillance System (NOHSS) would receive funding through FY2014 to expand participation to all 50 states, territories, and the District of Columbia. The Secretary would ensure that NOHSS includes measuring early childhood caries. Competitive grants would be awarded for evidence-based community preventive health activities to reduce chronic disease rates and address health disparities. Eligible entities include state or local government agencies, national community-based organizations, or Indian tribes. Grantees must develop community transformation plans. The CDC Director would award grants to state and local health departments and Indian tribes for five-year pilot programs to provide public health community interventions, screenings, and clinical referrals for individuals aged 55-64. Grantees must develop community transformation plans promoting healthy living and reducing health disparities. Grant funds cannot be used for activities that may lead to higher rates of obesity or inactivity. Authorized funding would be available through FY2014 for this program. The CDC Director would award grants to state and local health departments and Indian tribes for five-year pilot programs targeting individuals aged 55-64. Grantees must collaborate with relevant agencies to deliver interventions focusing on nutrition, physical activity, tobacco use, mental health, and healthy lifestyles. Health screenings would be conducted to identify cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes risk factors, with clinical referrals for follow-up services. uninsured individuals would be referred to participating providers for treatment. The grantee's community-based clinical partner would assist uninsured individuals in determining eligibility for public coverage options and community health resources. Grantees must measure changes in chronic disease risk factors among participants using program funds. The Secretary would evaluate program effectiveness annually by comparing changes in chronic disease risk factors among new Medicare enrollees in grant-receiving states with national data. Authorization for funding through FY2014 is provided under this section. This section adds a new requirement to the Rehabilitation Act for architectural and transportation standards. The new Sec. 510 of the Rehabilitation Act would require standards for medical diagnostic equipment in medical settings to be accessible to individuals with disabilities. It also grants the Secretary authority to negotiate contracts for adult vaccines and conduct a demonstration program to improve immunization coverage. The program provides grants to states to enhance immunization coverage for children, adolescents, and adults. States must use funds to implement evidence-based interventions and report progress to the Secretary within three years. The Secretary will report to Congress on the program's effectiveness and make recommendations for its extension or expansion. Funding is authorized through FY2014, and the program of immunization grants to states is permanently reauthorized. The bill ensures that children's access to immunizations is not reduced. It establishes a pilot program in up to 10 community health centers to provide at-risk individuals with personalized wellness plans to reduce preventable conditions. Plans may include nutritional counseling, physical activity, smoking cessation, stress management, approved dietary supplements, and compliance assistance. Risk factors like weight, tobacco and alcohol use, exercise rates, and nutrition will be assessed. The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to require employers to provide break time and a private place for nursing mothers to express breast milk. Employers with fewer than 50 employees would be exempt from this requirement. The bill would require employers to provide break time and a private place for nursing mothers to express breast milk. Employers with fewer than 50 employees may be exempt if it causes significant difficulty or expense. Additionally, the bill mandates a study on the health status of new Medicare enrollees and funding for research in public health services and systems. The proposed bill includes provisions for employers to provide break time and a private place for nursing mothers to express breast milk. It also mandates a study on the health status of new Medicare enrollees and funding for research in public health services and systems, including data collection and analysis for effective strategies in community settings. The Secretary would be required to develop data standards for demographic data collection, including race, ethnicity, gender, geographic location, socioeconomic status, primary language, and disability. Standards for self-reported data and data from parents or legal guardians would also be established. The Secretary would be required to develop national standards for data management, interoperability, and security systems. Data collected would be analyzed to detect health disparities trends at federal and state levels, with analyses made available to specified agencies and the public for research and dissemination. The section emphasizes the need for privacy safeguards and protection of data collected, including racial and ethnic minority groups and underserved populations. Funding is authorized for implementation until 2014. The section authorizes funding for health impact assessments until 2014, with a focus on privacy safeguards and data protection. It aims to assess the impact of the built environment on health outcomes by defining key terms, establishing a program at the CDC, and providing grants for technical assistance and training. The new PHSA Part T, \"Employer-Based Wellness Program,\" would require the CDC Director to conduct educational campaigns to promote workplace wellness programs and provide technical assistance for program evaluation. The Director of the CDC would be responsible for measuring employee participation in wellness programs, developing standardized measures for positive health outcomes, and evaluating program effects on health, absenteeism, productivity, workplace injuries, and medical costs. They would also need to build evaluation capacity among workplace staff and conduct national surveys on employer-based health policies and programs. Additionally, workplace demonstration projects would be instituted in collaboration with academic institutions and employers. The Director of the CDC would collaborate with academic institutions and employers to implement workplace demonstration projects across various employers to determine best practices for workplace wellness interventions. The Director would report findings to Congress and make recommendations for effective policies and programs. Additionally, a new PHSA Sec. 399HH-4 would require evaluation of CDC-funded programs before privately funded programs, unless requested by the entity. A new PHSA Sec. 399HH-5 would prohibit using findings to mandate requirements for workplace wellness programs. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a grant program to strengthen national epidemiology, laboratory, and information management capacity for responding to infectious diseases and public health conditions. Eligible entities include state health departments, local health departments, tribal jurisdictions, or partnerships with academic centers. Grantees must use funds for activities like expanding surveillance and laboratory capacity, responding to outbreaks, staffing, and training. The grant program requires grantees to establish secure web-based information systems for receiving electronic case reports, analyzing and reporting data to CDC within 24 hours, conducting specified analyses, sharing information with other jurisdictions and partners, and securing information systems. The grant program requires grantees to establish secure web-based information systems for receiving electronic case reports, analyzing and reporting data to CDC within 24 hours, conducting specified analyses, sharing information with other jurisdictions and partners, and securing information systems. The Secretary would allocate funds to eligible entities based on need, prioritize public health laboratories integration, and allow funds for systems development, maintenance, staff hiring, and training. $190 million would be authorized for each of FY2011 through FY2013, with at least $95 million per fiscal year for grants. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on activities under this section. The Secretary must allocate funds for grants for capacity-building activities, secure information systems, and laboratory system expansion. Communications activities for health promotion and disease prevention are required, focusing on common chronic health issues like poor nutrition, tobacco use, and obesity. This includes developing a science-based media campaign, creating a website with information on chronic diseases, and implementing specified conditions through the CDC Director. The Secretary must develop programs for disseminating health promotion information to healthcare providers and creating personalized prevention plans through a web-based tool. An Internet portal for accessing risk-assessment tools will be established, with funding prioritized over CDC grants. This section introduces a new PHSA Title XXXIV, \"Coordinated Environmental Public Health Network,\" with specific provisions. The new PHSA Sec. 3400 and Sec. 3401 establish a Coordinated Environmental Public Health Network, requiring the Secretary to expand data sources and create a publicly accessible database. States can receive grants for network establishment and pilot projects, with activities protecting health information under HIPAA privacy rule. The new PHSA Sec. 3402 requires training and placing epidemiology fellows in state and local health departments to expand public health capacity. Sec. 3403 integrates activities with existing environmental health tracking and assists in developing state programs. Sec. 3404 aims to expand federal and state biomonitoring capability through cooperative agreements with states. Authorized funding is provided through FY2014. The Secretary would enter cooperative agreements with states for biomonitoring training and quality assurance, ensuring HIPAA privacy rule compliance. A new PHSA Sec. 229 would establish an Office on Women's Health with specific duties, including a National Women's Health Information Center and HHS Coordinating Committee on Women's Health. Funding and evaluations would be conducted through FY2014. The new Office on Women's Health would conduct evaluations of activities and report to Congress, with authorized appropriations through FY2014. It would transfer functions from the existing Office on Women's Health and establish new offices in CDC, AHRQ, HRSA, and FDA. Funding would be authorized for these offices through FY2014, amending current authority for offices in NIH and SAMHSA. The section establishes that office directors report to agency senior officials without altering existing regulatory authority. It addresses challenges in estimating prevention program costs and suggests improving scoring methodologies for progress in prevention and wellness programs. The Secretary must evaluate federal health and wellness programs to assess their effectiveness in improving the health status of the American public and federal workforce. This includes measuring absenteeism, productivity, workplace injuries, and medical costs. The evaluation also covers workplace fitness, healthy food options, and incentives in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. The Secretary is required to report to Congress on the program effectiveness. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of foods, human drugs, biologics, and medical devices. FDA's regulation of medical products, including blood components and medical devices, impacts the cost, quality, and accessibility of healthcare. Medical products make up over 15% of healthcare costs and their effectiveness is crucial for healthcare quality. FDA's regulation of food, such as nutrition labeling, can also affect individuals' health. The HELP bill contains FDA-related provisions that could impact the agency's regulatory authority. The HELP bill contains FDA-related provisions that would impact the agency's regulation of prescription drugs, foods, and biologics. It includes requirements for labeling and advertising of prescription drugs, nutrition labeling at certain establishments, and creating a licensure pathway for biosimilars. Misbranded drugs introduced into interstate commerce are subject to penalties under the FFDCA. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for drug labeling under FFDCA Sec. 502, including the necessary information to be listed, how it should be presented, and the inclusion of health benefits and risks in advertising. This aims to improve health care decision-making by clinicians, patients, and consumers. The curr_chunk discusses the potential requirement for nutrition labeling on restaurant foods to promote healthy eating, as part of efforts to address rising obesity rates. The Secretary would need to review scientific evidence and consult stakeholders to make this determination, with proposed regulations to be implemented within three years if deemed necessary. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for nutrition labeling on standard menu items in chain restaurants or similar establishments with 20 or more locations, as mandated by FFDCA Sec. 403A. States and localities may petition for an exemption from this preemption clause. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for nutrition labeling on standard menu items in chain restaurants or similar establishments with 20 or more locations. It includes details on providing detailed written nutritional information, establishing standards for nutrient content disclosures, and requiring vending machine operators to display calorie information. The Secretary is tasked with promulgating regulations to implement these requirements. The section amends FFDCA Sec. 403A to preempt states and localities from establishing different nutrition labeling requirements. It also prohibits the amendments from preempting state or local laws that provide safety warnings about food. Congress must be provided with quarterly reports on progress towards final regulations. A biosimilar, also known as a \"follow-on\" biologic, is similar to a brand-name biologic, while a generic drug is the same as a brand-name chemical drug. Biologics are complex proteins made from living organisms, requiring special handling and usually administered via injection or infusion. Comparing the structure of a biosimilar to the brand-name biologic is scientifically challenging. Biosimilars, like generic drugs, aim to provide cost savings by offering similar versions of brand-name biologics. The approval process for biosimilars may require additional clinical trials before FDA approval. Congress is considering creating an expedited pathway for biosimilar approval, similar to the Hatch-Waxman Act for generic chemical drugs. This pathway would rely on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the brand-name biologic. The generic drug industry saves costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. Brand-name biologics like Enbrel can be expensive. FDA approval of biosimilars may lead to market competition and price reduction. Proposed amendment would create a pathway for FDA approval of biosimilars defined as highly similar to reference products. The proposed amendment would allow the Secretary to determine the interchangeability of biological products with reference products based on specified criteria. It also provides a 12-year data exclusivity period for reference products, with exceptions for orphan drugs. The proposed amendment allows for a 12-year data exclusivity period for reference products, with exceptions for orphan drugs. It also establishes a process for determining the interchangeability of biological products and sets forth guidelines for patent infringement claims. The section proposes new processes for identifying disputed patents between reference product and biosimilar companies, requiring all biological product applications to be submitted under PHSA Sec. 351. Approved applications under FFDCA Sec. 505 would be deemed licenses under Sec. 351 after 10 years. User fees for biosimilar application reviews would be collected, with the Secretary developing recommendations for review goals from FY2013 to FY2017. Recommendations would be published in the Federal Register for public comment, with a required public meeting. The revised recommendations for a user fee program for biosimilar products would be presented to Congress by January 15, 2012. The Secretary would collect data on application review costs and perform audits every two years. The user fee amount would be altered based on audit results. The Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of HHS, would determine the amount saved to the federal government for each fiscal year. The Secretary of HHS would transfer saved funds to the Biological Product Savings Fund for authorized activities under the PHSA. The GAO would study pediatric studies of biological products under the FFDCA, recommend ensuring pediatric testing, and consider incentives. The Treasury Secretary, with the HHS Secretary, would determine saved funds from the biosimilars approval pathway for each fiscal year. The PHSA Title XII authorizes funding for trauma care research, training, evaluations, and demonstration projects, including improving trauma care in rural areas and awarding grants to states for trauma care systems. Grants are also provided to trauma centers in areas affected by drug-related violence for uncompensated costs. The geographic distribution of trauma centers varies widely across states and regions, with many areas not well served. More than 84% of U.S. residents can reach a level I or II trauma center within an hour, but access lags in rural areas. This section aims to amend PHSA Sec. 1910 to expand trauma care services. This section aims to amend PHSA Sec. 1910 to lengthen grant period for emergency services for children to four years, with optional fifth year, and authorize funding for FY2010-FY2014. It also modifies PHSA Sec. 1203 to provide competitive grants for trauma systems improvement and transfers administration to Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Additionally, it adds a new PHSA Sec. 1204 for competitive grants for pilot projects to improve regional trauma care. The section proposes competitive grants for pilot projects to enhance regional coordination of emergency services, focusing on improving emergency medical and trauma systems. Applicants must include plans for pediatric patient coordination and grants must be matched at a rate of $1 for every $3 of federal funds. Priority will be given to entities in medically underserved areas. Grantees must submit a detailed evaluation of the program within 90 days of completion, with the Secretary responsible for disseminating information to the public and Congress. Additionally, $24 million is authorized for trauma care grant programs for FY2010-FY2014. The section proposes competitive grants for pilot projects to enhance regional coordination of emergency services, focusing on improving emergency medical and trauma systems. It includes plans for pediatric patient coordination and grants must be matched at a rate of $1 for every $3 of federal funds. Priority will be given to entities in medically underserved areas. The Secretary would establish three programs to award grants to qualified trauma centers to help defray substantial uncompensated care costs and further the core missions of such centers. Authorized $24 million for trauma care grant programs for FY2010-FY2014. The section proposes grants for trauma centers to help cover uncompensated care costs and support core missions. Trauma centers must be part of the state's emergency care plan to be eligible for grants. Funding would be based on the percentage of charity, self-pay, and Medicaid patients seen, with grants covering a specified percentage of uncompensated care costs. Category A centers could receive grants covering 100% of their costs. Funding allocated for core mission. The proposed grants for trauma centers would cover uncompensated care costs and support core missions. Funding would be distributed based on the levels of trauma centers, with a preference for centers in areas facing a decline in trauma care availability. Grantees must maintain access to trauma care services and provide data to a national registry. $100 million would be authorized for FY2009 and SSAN for FY2010 through FY2015 for the grant programs. The Secretary would award grants to states for trauma-related physician specialties and trauma care services, with distribution based on annual appropriation levels. States with trauma centers providing substantial uncompensated care would receive priority funding. If the appropriation is less than $10 million, funds would be limited to these states. A biennial report to Congress on grant program status would be required. The funds would be distributed among states with category A centers, with $100 million authorized for state grants annually from FY2010 to FY2015. Behavioral health programs under PHSA Title V and Title IX fund mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment through SAMHSA. Most Title V programs lack appropriations authorities but still receive funding. Graduate programs in mental and behavioral health are eligible for health professions training grants under Title VII. In 2007, 11% of Americans experienced serious psychological distress, while 8% were current users of illicit drugs. The behavioral health care system faces issues like access to services, quality of care, insurance coverage, and coordination of care. The Senate HELP bill aims to address these issues, focusing on coordinated care for individuals with mental disorders and co-occurring physical illness. The Senate HELP bill aims to address issues in the behavioral health care system by focusing on coordinated care for individuals with mental disorders and co-occurring physical illness. It includes provisions for education and training of mental health providers, mental health parity rules compliance, and grants for co-locating primary and specialty care in community-based mental health settings. The Senate HELP bill includes provisions for grants to co-locate primary and specialty care in community mental health settings. The funds allocated must primarily be used for healthcare services, with a limit on spending for information technology or facility improvements. Grantees must evaluate the effectiveness of activities within three months of grant expiration. The Secretary must report to Congress on the impact of the program within five years of enactment. Authorized funding is $50 million for FY2010 and SSAN for FY2011 through FY2014. The Senate HELP bill includes provisions for grants to co-locate primary and specialty care in community mental health settings. The bill authorizes funding for FY2010 and FY2011 through FY2014 to support mental and behavioral health education and training grants. These grants aim to support the recruitment and education of students in social work programs, psychology training programs, and internships in child and adolescent mental health. Additionally, state licensed mental health organizations can receive grants to train paraprofessional workers in this field. At least four grant recipients must be historically black colleges or universities or other minority-serving institutions. Priority for grants in education and training in social work is given to accredited institutions with a high graduation rate and ability to place social workers in high-need areas. Grants in graduate psychology prioritize institutions focusing on vulnerable groups. Grants for training child and adolescent mental health professionals prioritize applicants with data collection abilities, familiarity with evidence-based methods, and programs to increase professionals from high-priority populations. Priority for grants in training child and adolescent mental health workers is given to applicants with data collection abilities, familiarity with evidence-based methods, and programs to increase professionals from high-priority populations. Funding for training in social work, graduate psychology, and professional child and adolescent mental health workers is authorized for FY2010 through FY2013. $12 million allocated for graduate psychology training, $10 million for professional child and adolescent mental health training, and $5 million for paraprofessional child and adolescent work. NIH established the Pain Consortium to enhance pain research and collaboration among researchers. NIH Director required to submit biennial report on research activities, including chronic disease category like pain and palliative care. Applicants for health professions education grants under Title VII must undergo peer review evaluation. The Senate HELP bill includes sections addressing pain research, education, and awareness as a national public health problem. It requires a Conference on Pain to increase recognition of pain's significance, with a report to Congress. $500,000 authorized for FY2010 and FY2011. Amend PHSA Title IV, Part B to encourage NIH Director to continue aggressive research on pain causes. The NIH Director is urged to expand research on pain causes through the Pain Consortium, which would provide recommendations for research initiatives annually. The Secretary would establish the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee to coordinate pain research efforts across federal agencies. Additionally, a program to train health professionals in pain care would be established. The Secretary would prioritize awards for implementation programs focusing on pain care education and information. Applicants must include topics like pain assessment, laws on controlled substances, interdisciplinary care, barriers to care, and recent advancements. Evaluation of implemented programs is required, and peer review groups must include pain care experts. The Secretary would be authorized to establish a national pain care education outreach campaign with funding of $5 million for FY2010 through FY2012. Additionally, a public awareness campaign would receive $2 million for FY2010 and $4 million for each of FY2011 and FY2012 to educate the public about pain as a national health issue. Under PHSA Sec. 340B, pharmaceutical manufacturers in the Medicaid drug rebate program must enter into pricing agreements to provide discounts on outpatient drugs for covered entities. Approximately 14,000 covered entities and 800 manufacturers participate in the program, allowing eligible entities like hospitals serving Medicaid beneficiaries and federally qualified health centers to receive discounts on prescription drugs. Covered entities under the 340B program include clinics, state-operated AIDS drug assistance programs, Ryan White CARE Act grantees, family planning and sexually transmitted disease clinics. Discounts are based on the average manufacturer price reduced by the Medicaid rebate percentage. Entities are prohibited from diverting drugs purchased under the program and obtaining multiple discounts. Manufacturers must report AMP and best price to the Secretary. Children's hospitals exempt from Medicare prospective payment system were added as covered entities under the 340B program. Manufacturers can audit covered entity records for product diversion or multiple discounts. Proposed rules for children's hospitals were issued in 2007, with a final rule in 2009. This section would amend PHSA Sec. 340B to include certain children's and free-standing entities for discounted drug prices. The 340B program now includes certain children's and free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access and sole community hospitals, and rural referral centers for discounted drug prices. New 340B-eligible facilities must meet participation requirements and can access discounts for inpatient drugs. Participating hospitals can join group purchasing arrangements for inpatient drugs, with exceptions for outpatient drug group purchasing. The Secretary would ensure that 340B hospitals have multiple options for purchasing covered inpatient drugs under this program. Hospitals would be required to issue a credit to the state Medicaid program for inpatient drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. The changes in this provision would be used to determine whether manufacturers met 340B participation requirements. The Secretary would develop systems to improve compliance and program integrity activities. The Secretary would develop systems to improve compliance and program integrity activities for manufacturers and covered entities in the 340B program. This includes increasing transparency, monitoring prices, and resolving disputes. The system would also address drug diversion and multiple discounts, with a dispute resolution process for overpayment claims and manufacturer claims. Manufacturers must report quarterly ceiling prices for covered drugs. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for quarterly ceiling prices for covered drugs in the 340B program and a report to Congress on the program's effectiveness. It also mentions the rebuttable presumption of eligibility for Black Lung Benefits for miners with specific criteria. Section 174 of the bill extends provisions for Black Lung Benefits Act claims filed after January 1, 2005, requiring the Secretary to publish authorities provided under the law within 30 days of enactment. The proposed law prohibits actions that threaten the solvency of Medicare or Social Security programs and prohibits discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide services for assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing. The proposed law prohibits discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide services for assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing. The HHS Office of Civil Rights would receive complaints of discrimination related to withholding medical treatment, nutrition, abortion, or pain relief. The Secretary is prohibited from creating regulations that hinder access to appropriate medical care or interfere with communication between patients and providers. This section of the proposed law prohibits health care providers from restricting treatment options, limiting disclosure of information, violating informed consent principles, or impeding access to necessary medical treatment for patients. It also prevents penalties for insurers who choose not to participate in federal health insurance programs."
