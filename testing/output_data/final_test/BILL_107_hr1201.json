    "content": "The \"Reading Readiness Act of 2001\" requires a report and evaluation of current best reading readiness practices. Section 649(d) of the Head Start Act is amended to require all Head Start programs to provide tools for children's reading readiness. The Head Start Act is amended to require all programs to focus on reading readiness, including incentives for adopting best practices in reading activities. The Head Start Act is amended to prioritize grants for reading readiness activities and emphasize the importance of seamless Head Start programs. The Congress acknowledges the importance of early intervention for children's success in school and life, citing the success of the Early Head Start pilot program. There is a growing interest in expanding Head Start programs to include infants and toddlers, with no restrictions on using funds for children under 3 years old. The Secretary of Health and Human Services should allow Head Start grantees to enroll infants and toddlers in Head Start programs without needing a separate Early Head Start grant if there is evidence of community need. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct an enrollment campaign for Head Start and Early Head Start programs, emphasizing the benefits for children's reading abilities. Additionally, outreach activities will target various health programs serving children and pregnant women. Eligibility threshold will be increased. The eligibility threshold for Head Start programs will be increased to allow children from families with incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty line to participate. Congress should provide full funding for the Head Start Act to ensure all eligible children can participate. SEC. 9. Authorization of appropriations for Head Start Act amended to allocate $9.2 billion for fiscal year 2002 and $11.2 billion for fiscal year 2003. Additional funds of up to $1 billion each for 2002 and 2003 to expand existing programs or support new grantees with best practices in reading readiness activities."
