The \"Hanford Land Management Act\" defines terms related to the Hanford Reservation, including hazardous substances, removal actions, and remedial actions as per the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The term \"radioactive material\" is defined in various sections of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to nuclear waste, including spent nuclear fuel, mixed waste, and transuranic waste.

Additionally, it defines the terms \"treatment, storage, and disposal.\" The curr_chunk defines the terms \"treatment, storage, and disposal\" as per the Solid Waste Disposal Act. The curr_chunk focuses on the environmental management plan. The Secretary is responsible for managing federal lands, hazardous substances, and radioactive materials at the Hanford Reservation. They must submit an environmental management plan to Congress within two years, which includes a land use plan, risk assessment statement, waste management plan, and site restoration plan. The Act will take effect immediately upon enactment, and the Secretary can make revisions to the environmental management plan as needed, submitting any amendments to Congress. SEC. 4. LAND USE. The policy for lands within the Hanford Reservation states that they will be retained in Federal ownership unless Congress determines disposal is in the national interest. The Secretary must include a land use plan in the environmental management plan, designating parcels for Department use, national systems, or transfer to the Secretary of the Interior for public land management or sale. The Secretary must designate parcels within the Hanford Reservation for Department use, national systems, or transfer to the Secretary of the Interior for public land management or sale based on criteria including risks to human health and the environment, worker safety, availability of technologies, and cost considerations.

The costs of remedying hazardous substances, assessing risks, and the importance of the area for scenic and historical purposes are also taken into account. The Secretary of the Interior must consider various factors when designating parcels within the Hanford Reservation, including scenic, historical, recreational, ecological, cultural, or archeological values, water resources, community expansion, and economic development. The views of relevant authorities and the availability of Federal funds for cleanup are also important.

This assessment will inform future use recommendations, establish standards, select environmental management activities, and allocate resources based on the identified risks. The Secretary must conduct a risk assessment at the Hanford Reservation, quantifying risks to human health, safety, and the environment. This includes comparing these risks to other regulated and familiar risks, as well as estimating the costs of environmental management activities. The Secretary must certify that environmental management activities at the Hanford Reservation are based on scientific information, will reduce risks significantly, and have no equivalent alternative. The Secretary must certify that environmental management activities at the Hanford Reservation are based on scientific information, will reduce risks significantly, and have no equivalent alternative.
