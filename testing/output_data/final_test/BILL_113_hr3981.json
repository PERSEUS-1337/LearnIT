    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Accelerated Revenue, Repayment, and Surface Water Storage Enhancement Act.\" It involves the prepayment of certain repayment contracts between the United States and contractors of federally developed water supplies. The Act allows for the conversion and prepayment of water service contracts between the United States and water users' associations under mutually agreeable terms. Water service contracts can be converted to repayment contracts, facilitating prepayment of the repayment contract. Water service contracts entered under subsection (c)(2) of section 9 of the Act of August 4, 1939 can be converted to a contract under subsection (c)(1) of that Act. Contracts converted may provide for repayment of remaining construction costs through lump sum or accelerated prepayment. The contractor must repay remaining construction costs within 3 years after the effective date of the repayment contract, discounted by \\1/2\\ the Treasury rate. Any additional costs incurred after the contract's effective date must be repaid within 5 years. The Secretary will provide an estimate of the remaining net present value of construction costs to the contractor upon request. The contractor must repay construction costs within 3 years after the effective date of the repayment contract, discounted by \\1/2\\ the Treasury rate. Costs over $5,000,000 must be repaid as per reclamation law. Power revenues cannot aid in repayment for irrigation costs. The contract continues as long as applicable charges are paid. The Act of August 4, 1939 outlines contract requirements for repayment of construction costs for water projects. The contractor can request repayment in lump sum of the remaining net present value of construction costs, as adjusted by the Secretary. Repayment must be made within 3 years at a discounted rate. Power revenues cannot be used for irrigation cost repayment. The contract requires repayment of construction costs within 5 years if under $5,000,000, or as per reclamation law if $5,000,000 or more, as long as applicable charges are paid. Contracts entered into must adhere to specific conditions, including not adjusting based on prepayment financing, conforming to agreements, and not modifying existing contractual rights between the water users' association and the Bureau of Reclamation. The water users' association must adhere to specific conditions in their contracts with the Bureau of Reclamation, including accounting for payments subject to adjustment by the Secretary of the Interior based on final cost allocation. If costs properly assignable to the contractor are greater than what has been paid, the contractor must repay the remaining allocated costs over a period of 1 to 10 years. Conversely, if costs are less than what the contractor has paid, the Secretary will credit the overpayment as an offset. The Secretary will credit any overpayment made by the contractor against future obligations. Compliance with repayment obligations under a contract triggers the application of certain provisions related to affected lands. Repayment of construction costs does not impact the contractor's status or the applicability of specific sections of the Reclamation Reform Act. The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 applies once the contractor has paid the required amount under the repayment contract. Implementation of this Act does not change the repayment obligations of water contractors or shift costs to water users' associations. Additionally, a Surface Water Storage Enhancement Program will be initiated three years after the Act's enactment. Three years after the enactment of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, excess receipts from prepayment of contracts will be directed to the Reclamation Surface Water Storage Account for funding surface water storage construction. The Secretary may also enter into cooperative agreements with water users' associations for this purpose. The Surface Storage Account can fund surface water storage projects not federally authorized. Repayment for construction must follow Federal reclamation law. Amounts deposited in the Account are available for use. The Surface Storage Account funds projects for various purposes including increased water supply, floodwater management, agricultural improvements, recreation, and wildlife protection. The Act defines the \"Account\" as the Reclamation Surface Water Storage Account and \"construction\" as the designing and building of surface water storage facilities. The term \"surface water storage\" refers to federally owned or non-Federal facilities used for storing and supplying water resources. The term \"Treasury rate\" is defined as the 20-year Constant Maturity Treasury rate published by the US Department of the Treasury. A \"water users' association\" is an entity recognized under State laws eligible to enter into contracts with reclamation for water delivery and payment of charges. The curr_chunk discusses entities involved in water management and payment of charges, including associations, conservatory districts, irrigation districts, municipalities, and water project contract units."
