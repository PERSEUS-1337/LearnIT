    "content": "The \"Foster Care Tax Credit Act\" allows for a new tax credit for foster care expenses under section 25E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Foster Care Tax Credit Act\" provides a tax credit for qualifying foster children residing with eligible taxpayers, calculated based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. The \"adjusted gross income\" for tax purposes includes exclusions under specific sections, with a defined \"threshold amount.\" A \"qualifying foster child\" must meet certain criteria, including age, citizenship, residency, and not being eligible for the tax credit under section 24. The term \"eligible taxpayer\" refers to any taxpayer, with restrictions on single households, married individuals filing jointly, and individuals with the highest adjusted gross income in the same household. If a foster child resides in the taxpayer's home for more than 15 consecutive days of a calendar month, specific rules apply. If a foster child resides in the taxpayer's home for more than 15 consecutive days of a calendar month, the child is treated as residing in the home for the full month. The aggregate credits allowed to a taxpayer may be increased by a certain amount under specific conditions. The credit under section 24(a) may increase if the limitation in section 26(a) is increased by 15 percent of earned income exceeding $3,000, or by the excess for taxpayers with 3 or more qualifying foster children. The credit allowed under this subsection reduces the amount of credit otherwise allowable without regard to section 26(a) and treats excluded income as earned income for computing taxable income. The subsection allows a credit that reduces taxable income and treats excluded income as earned income. Social security taxes are defined as in section 24(d)(1). Identification requirements include providing the name and taxpayer identification number of a qualifying foster child on the tax return. Taxpayers who improperly claimed credit in prior years may not claim the credit for 10 years after a final determination of fraud. Taxpayers who improperly claimed credit in prior years may not claim the credit for 10 years after a final determination of fraud. If denied credit for any taxable year due to deficiency procedures, no credit shall be allowed for subsequent years unless eligibility is demonstrated.
