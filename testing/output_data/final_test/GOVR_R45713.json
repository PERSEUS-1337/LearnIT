    "content": "According to the FBI, the internet and social media have played a significant role in the evolution of the terrorism threat landscape since 9/11. Hate crime organizations also point to the internet as a tool for intimidation and harassment based on various attributes. Some critics question the link between hate speech and bias-motivated crimes, while others are concerned about criminalizing protected speech. Despite debates on the relationship between online speech and criminal behavior, terrorist groups have extensively used the internet. Terrorist groups like ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hamas, and Al Shabaab use social media to spread their ideologies, recruit members, and claim credit for attacks. The internet plays a significant role in individuals' paths to terrorism and violent extremism. The process of radicalization leading to terrorism often involves individuals self-radicalizing online and adopting extremist ideologies. The digital influence of figures like Anwar al Awlaki has been linked to terrorist activities, with social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter prohibiting speech advocating violence. Current judicial interpretations of First Amendment law do not apply to private platforms, which have increased efforts to remove terrorist-related content. However, banned users may find new platforms without restrictions, creating echo chambers that reinforce violent rhetoric. This report focuses on government regulation of online content promoting terrorism or violence. The report discusses the First Amendment's reach in relation to foreign nationals posting online content from outside the United States. While the Supreme Court has not directly addressed this issue, past decisions suggest foreign nationals may face barriers in claiming First Amendment protections for such speech. The Court's decision in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez provides insight into the extraterritorial reach of constitutional protections. In United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, the Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches of a Mexican citizen's home in Mexico by U.S. authorities. The majority opinion stated that the Fourth Amendment protects \"the people\" as a term of art in the Constitution, and any violation would have occurred solely in Mexico. The Fourth Amendment protections do not apply to foreign nationals without a voluntary attachment to the United States, as suggested by textual analysis of the Constitution. Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh have indicated that the First Amendment may not extend to foreign nationals abroad, citing the case of Verdugo-Urquidez. Kavanaugh specifically addressed free speech protections for foreign nationals in a 2014 case involving an Al Qaeda associate. In a case involving an Al Qaeda associate, Judge Kavanaugh addressed the issue of First Amendment rights for non-U.S. citizens abroad, stating that they may have some rights at U.S. military bases or territories, but not abroad. Non-U.S. citizens have no First Amendment rights abroad in foreign countries, as constitutional rights are not extended to aliens in foreign countries. The Supreme Court has not applied constitutional rights to aliens in foreign countries in various cases. The D.C. Circuit ruled that non-U.S. citizens, like the defendant in Al Maqaleh v. Gates, have no First Amendment rights in foreign countries. The court rejected the defendant's First Amendment challenge, stating that aliens outside the U.S. generally cannot claim First Amendment protections. However, the Court has recognized a right to receive information and ideas, resisting government control of information. The Court has rejected governmental attempts to control information based on how the government views it, as seen in Lamont v. Postmaster General. The Court found that withholding foreign mailings classified as \"communist political propaganda\" without addressees' consent violated First Amendment rights. The uncertainty lies in whether the government must observe the First Amendment in interactions with foreign nationals to protect U.S. citizens' rights. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Ginsburg emphasized the importance of the First Amendment in protecting individuals' rights to communicate and associate with foreign entities. She referenced a case involving a violation of the First Amendment in international correspondence and highlighted the principle that the Constitution's protections extend to the government's actions in foreign relations. Judge Ginsburg emphasized the importance of the First Amendment in protecting individuals' rights in international interactions, stating that it should apply in United States-foreign citizen encounters. This could impact cases involving social media content posted by foreign nationals that implicate the free speech rights of U.S. citizens, with potential limitations on foreign nationals' ability to assert those rights. The First Amendment may not necessarily protect online activities of foreign nationals solely based on the interests of other Internet users. The Supreme Court recognizes the importance of First Amendment rights in online communication for U.S. citizens. When considering the regulation of online content promoting terrorism or violence, the key consideration is whether the law regulates conduct or speech. This distinction can be complex as speech may be intertwined with conduct, and actions themselves can be considered expressive speech protected by the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects expressive speech, which can be regulated if it targets expression. Courts consider the law's terms, purpose, and application to determine if it targets certain content or speakers. If a law does not target expression, the government has more leeway to regulate the activity even if it burdens speech incidentally. The First Amendment allows for regulation of expressive speech if it targets expression, even if it incidentally burdens speech. The Supreme Court has clarified that restrictions on protected expression are different from restrictions on economic activity or nonexpressive conduct. However, laws focused on conduct may still be subject to First Amendment review if the government penalizes a person based on the ideas or messages they communicated. This was demonstrated in the 2010 case Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project regarding material support to foreign terrorist organizations. The statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who provides material support to U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs). In Humanitarian Law Project, U.S. citizens challenged the law, arguing it would be unconstitutional to punish them for supporting FTOs through training and teaching on humanitarian and international law. The Humanitarian Law Project Court addressed the First Amendment implications of applying the statute to the plaintiffs' activities, rejecting extreme positions from both sides. It concluded that most activities constituted training or expert advice under the law, while noting that the statute did not ban pure political speech or prevent advocacy for FTOs. The Court rejected the government's position that the law only implicated conduct, not speech, as it regulates speech based on content. It noted that the statute covers a narrow category of speech involving terrorist organizations and specific skills or specialized knowledge. The Court upheld the material support statute, ruling that it did not violate the First Amendment as applied to plaintiffs' proposed activities involving communicating a message. The statute focuses on conduct related to terrorist organizations and specialized knowledge, not just speech. The Supreme Court has considered laws restricting online content in relation to speech, distinguishing between content-based and content-neutral justifications. Government regulation of speech is considered content-based if it applies to speech based on the topic discussed or the message expressed. Courts scrutinize content-based distinctions to prevent the government from silencing certain ideas or viewpoints. Justice Anthony Kennedy emphasized the importance of not allowing the government to drive certain ideas from the marketplace. In a case involving federal restrictions on sexually explicit cable programming, Justice Anthony Kennedy emphasized the importance of not allowing the government to drive certain ideas from the marketplace. The Supreme Court has stated that content-based laws are presumptively unconstitutional and must survive strict scrutiny, meaning they must be narrowly tailored to serve compelling governmental interests. A law that regulates topics in social media posts would likely be considered a \"content-based\" restriction on speech, subject to strict scrutiny and presumptively invalid. The next consideration in the First Amendment analysis is whether the speech is protected or falls within narrow categories of \"unprotected\" speech recognized by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court considers political and ideological speech as core to the First Amendment, creating an open marketplace for differing ideas without government interference. The government cannot prohibit ideas it dislikes or force endorsement of approved ideas, even if the speech is offensive or hateful. The First Amendment protects speech, including political and ideological, without government interference, even if it is offensive or hateful. The government cannot restrict expression based on message, ideas, subject matter, or content, unless it falls under narrow categories of unprotected speech recognized by the Supreme Court. This includes online speech promoting terrorism or violence. In 1969, the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader for advocating violence during a speech, citing First Amendment protection of speech, even if offensive or hateful. The Supreme Court overturned a conviction for advocating violence, stating that the First Amendment protects speech unless it incites imminent lawless action. The Court clarified that advocating force is different from preparing a group for violent action. The Supreme Court overturned a conviction for disorderly conduct at an anti-war rally, stating that speech must incite imminent lawless action. The Court clarified that advocating force is different from preparing a group for violent action. In People v. Rubin, a California state court ruling, the defendant was charged with solicitation of murder during a protest against the American Nazi Party. The state appeals court reversed the trial court's decision, applying Brandenburg's imminence and likelihood requirements to conclude that the defendant's speech was not protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that solicitation of murder in connection with a public event, even if five weeks away, can qualify as incitement to imminent lawless action. Context is crucial in determining if strong rhetoric incites violence. In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., a boycott organized to protest racial discrimination led to a lawsuit for tortious interference with trade. The Claiborne Hardware Court held that Charles Evers' speech during a boycott, where he threatened discipline for violators, was protected under the First Amendment despite potentially inciting fear of violence. The Court ruled that Charles Evers' speech during a boycott, although emotionally charged, did not exceed protected speech boundaries set forth in Brandenburg. The Court noted that if the strong language had been followed by acts of violence, liability would be a substantial question, but there was no evidence of violence occurring. In a later case, Texas v. Johnson, the Supreme Court ruled on a First Amendment challenge involving burning a flag during a political protest. The Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. Johnson that burning a flag during a political protest is protected speech under the First Amendment, even if it may offend some people. The Court emphasized that free speech is meant to invite dispute and can stir people to anger, without necessarily leading to imminent lawless action. The Supreme Court has established that offensive speech is constitutionally protected, even if it may provoke violence. There are concerns about the limitations of the incitement doctrine in regulating content on social media, particularly regarding the definition of \"imminence\" and the criteria for speech that is \"directed to\" or \"likely to\" incite violence. Some lower courts have discussed how the Brandenburg test applies to internet speech, noting that certain content may not constitute incitement but could be considered a true threat. For example, the Third Circuit found that using past incidents to instill fear in future targets could be unprotected speech. This raises questions about regulating online content and the definition of incitement. The government can restrict speech that constitutes a \"true threat,\" defined as a serious expression of intent to commit unlawful violence against specific individuals or groups. This differs from protected political hyperbole and incitement, as established in the Watts v. United States case. In a 1969 decision, the Court ruled that a statute prohibiting threats against the President was constitutional but improperly applied in a case involving political hyperbole at a public rally. The Court emphasized the importance of uninhibited debate on public issues. In Virginia v. Black, the Supreme Court upheld a state law prohibiting cross burning with the intent to intimidate, stating that it is a form of true threat directed at causing fear of bodily harm or death. The Court found that the First Amendment allows for the outlawing of cross burnings done with the intent to intimidate, as it is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. The Supreme Court declined to review the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's interpretation of the true threats doctrine in a case involving alleged \"terroristic threats\" posted to social media, citing concerns about distinguishing between real threats online and protected expression. In Commonwealth v. Knox, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered whether a rap-music video with threatening lyrics towards law enforcement officers constituted a true threat. The defendant argued it was a form of self-expression and not meant to be taken literally. Despite support from various organizations citing First Amendment protections, the court ruled the song as a true threat. In Commonwealth v. Knox, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court analyzed a rap-music video with threatening lyrics towards law enforcement officers, determining it as a true threat. The court considered the First Amendment's broad application to different types of expression but noted that speech threatening unlawful violence can lead to criminal sanctions. The court debated the relevance of the speaker's subjective intent in a true-threat analysis, ultimately concluding that the speaker's mental state could be discerned from the context of the lyrics in the defendant's song. The court concluded that the defendant's song, which mentioned two police officers by name and described in graphic terms how the defendant intended to kill them, was not just artistic expression but a true threat. The lyrics were tied to recent interactions with the officers, and the court found that the defendant intended for the song to be heard by them, even though it was uploaded online by a third party. The court accepted findings that the defendant intended for the song to be published or knew publication was inevitable, as a link to the YouTube video was posted on a Facebook page thought to belong to a codefendant. Case law on online communications shows not all alleged intimidation falls under true threats doctrine. In a lower court case, a federal district court rejected First Amendment arguments of an \"alt-right website\" publisher accused of launching an anti-Semitic \"troll storm\" against a plaintiff. The defendant published personal information of the plaintiff and her family, leading to over 700 threatening messages. The court did not categorize the defendant's speech as a true threat, citing no exception to the First Amendment for harassing speech. Instead, it considered if the defendant's speech was on a matter of public concern. The court considered if the defendant's speech on a matter of public concern could be protected under the First Amendment, despite using inflammatory language to harass the plaintiff. The Supreme Court has distinguished between \"proposal[s] to engage in illegal activity\" and \"the abstract advocacy of illegality,\" extending First Amendment protections to the latter type of speech. However, the line between advocacy and action can be hazy, especially in cases of inchoate offenses where the criminalized action may seem minor or benign. Some courts have used the speech integral to criminal conduct doctrine to reject First Amendment challenges to criminal convictions based on online communications. The scope of the doctrine on online communications, particularly in the internet context, is unclear. Scholars have differing views on the prosecution of online speech for criminal activity, with some suggesting it is a tall order while others believe it is too easy, especially in federal terrorism cases. There are proposals to limit the doctrine's reach to prevent the criminalization of speech without proper First Amendment analysis. This category of unprotected speech appears to be less well-defined and susceptible to misuse. The First Amendment imposes limitations on regulating protected and unprotected speech. Laws regulating protected speech require strict scrutiny, while those regulating unprotected speech may not. Challenges can arise if laws are deemed overbroad in their application. The section examines the strict scrutiny test and overbreadth doctrine in the context of terrorism-related offenses and criminal prosecutions involving online speech. Courts require the government to prove a compelling interest and narrow tailoring for laws regulating protected speech promoting violence. The government's interests in regulating such speech may not always be compelling, and even if they are, the law must be sufficiently tailored. The Supreme Court has recognized the government's compelling interests in national security and combating terrorism, allowing for limitations on free speech in certain situations. The government must demonstrate actual harms that regulations can address, but the Court has upheld the authority of political branches to maintain international relations and defend against foreign threats. The government's compelling interests in national security and defending against foreign threats allow for limitations on free speech. The focus of the First Amendment inquiry is on whether the law is tailored to achieve that interest, with narrow tailoring required under strict scrutiny. For example, in Reno v. ACLU, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of the Communications Decency Act that restricted internet messages to minors. The Court in Reno v. ACLU struck down vague terms in the Communications Decency Act that threatened free speech. It found the Act's restrictions on indecent content to be overly broad and not narrowly tailored, as more effective parental control software was available to limit minors' access. The challenged provisions were found to not be narrowly tailored as a less restrictive provision would not be as effective as the CDA. The Humanitarian Law Project decision showed deference to Congress and the Executive in national security matters, construing the material support statute to ban only coordinated support with an FTO, not independent advocacy promoting the group's legitimacy. The statute was considered carefully drawn as it targeted speech rather than conduct. The Court upheld the statute as applied to the plaintiffs' activities, considering the government's compelling interest in combating terrorism and the potential for support to further terrorist objectives. The Court upheld the statute as applied to the plaintiffs' activities, clarifying that it was not addressing future applications of the material-support statute to speech or advocacy, nor extending the prohibition to domestic organizations. The decision was criticized for deviating from established First Amendment standards. The government has a \"compelling\" interest in protecting US security by denying financial resources to FTOs. Critics argue the statute lacks scrutiny on how it achieves security goals. Legal scholars debate if the decision aligns with political advocacy protections. Some believe the Court erred in prohibiting \"mere advocacy\" without considering incitement. National security concerns may have influenced the Justices. Lower courts have applied the Court's reasoning in Humanitarian Law. In United States v. Mehanna, the defendant was convicted for providing material support to Al Qaeda through activities including traveling to Yemen and translating Arabic materials into English for an online community sympathetic to al-Qa'ida. The defendant in United States v. Mehanna was convicted for providing material support to Al Qaeda through translating materials supportive of violent jihad. The trial court's instructions on free speech protections were deemed proper by the First Circuit. In United States v. Elshinawy, a U.S. citizen was indicted for providing material support to ISIL through social media communications and receiving funds transfers from overseas. The defendant in United States v. Elshinawy challenged the indictment on First Amendment grounds, arguing that the government sought to criminalize protected speech and association related to ISIL. The district court largely rejected this argument, stating that the allegations went beyond just expressing support on social media, drawing a line between independent advocacy and operating under an FTO's \"direction and control.\" The court in United States v. Nagi rejected the defendant's argument that his First Amendment right of association was violated when charged with attempting to provide support to ISIL. The court emphasized that the defendant's statements of support must be viewed in conjunction with his conduct, which included traveling to Turkey with the intent of joining ISIL. The court rejected the defendant's argument that his charges were based on \"something that \u00a7\u00a02339B does not prohibit: simple membership in a terrorist organization.\" The government planned to introduce the defendant's Twitter pledge to support ISIL's leader and his purchase of combat gear to show his intent. The First Amendment has not greatly restricted material support prosecutions concerning online speech, especially when contextualized within a course of conduct. The overbreadth doctrine may limit Congress's ability to regulate online speech, as a law may be invalidated if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech. This rule prohibits the Government from banning unprotected speech if it also restricts protected speech. The overbreadth doctrine is considered \"strong medicine\" by the Court and should be used sparingly as a last resort. Rarely will an overbreadth challenge succeed against a law not specifically targeting speech. Challenges have arisen in statutes involving online communications, with at least one circuit court upholding the material support statute against such a challenge. In United States v. Ackell, a defendant convicted of stalking challenged the federal law as overbroad on appeal. The law criminalizes conduct causing emotional distress using online communication services with intent to harm. The First Circuit ruled that the law targets conduct, not speech, due to its focus on a course of conduct involving interstate commerce facilities. The court concluded that the federal statute on interstate commerce covers various nonexpressive conduct, such as sending unknown substances or infecting computers with viruses. It primarily implicates unprotected speech like true threats and speech integral to criminal conduct. The court noted only one case where the statute was used against protected speech, deeming other hypothetical applications as too speculative. While acknowledging potential unconstitutional applications, the court declined to take drastic action. Regulating online content in accordance with the First Amendment presents challenges due to the complexities of free speech jurisprudence. The lack of controlling authority on how doctrines developed decades ago apply to speech on the internet adds to the difficulty. Despite this, there are general guideposts for evaluating proposals to restrict online content promoting terrorism or violence. A law that primarily regulates conduct online may have unconstitutional applications, but drastic action of holding the statute facially overbroad was declined. Regulating online content promoting terrorism or violence involves evaluating laws based on their impact on free speech. Laws that regulate online conduct rather than speech may not face heightened scrutiny. Narrowly drafted laws targeting specific types of online speech may not trigger First Amendment concerns. Speech advocating violence in the abstract is likely protected, while speech inciting imminent violence may be deemed unprotected. Laws directed at nonexpressive conduct also require careful consideration. Laws regulating online content may face overbreadth challenges if they restrict a significant amount of protected speech. Content-based regulations are likely to be subject to strict scrutiny, especially if they target specific viewpoints. However, laws related to national security and foreign affairs may have more flexibility in regulating online content, but they still need to uphold protected speech rights. Laws regulating online content may face overbreadth challenges if they restrict protected speech, subject to strict scrutiny. Legal challenges regarding enforcement of existing laws online can guide lawmakers in balancing First Amendment interests with citizen safety."
