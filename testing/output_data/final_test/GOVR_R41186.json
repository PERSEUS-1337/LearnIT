    "content": "The reconciliation process aims to align existing spending, revenue, and debt-limit laws with current fiscal priorities set in the annual budget resolution. It is a relatively new congressional process with only 23 bills passed since 1980. Budget reconciliation involves stages starting with the adoption of the budget resolution. The reconciliation process involves the adoption of the budget resolution, which includes reconciliation directives instructing committees to develop legislation to change laws related to spending, revenue, or the debt-limit. Directives specify reporting deadlines, budgetary changes, and measurement periods. If multiple committees are involved, they may report directly to their full chamber. During the reconciliation process, committees are instructed to report legislation to their respective Budget Committee for packaging into an omnibus measure. The specified committee develops legislation in response to the reconciliation directive in the budget resolution and votes on whether to report the language favorably or unfavorably. If multiple committees are involved, they submit their language to the Budget Committee for packaging into an omnibus. The Budget Committee packages committee responses into an omnibus reconciliation bill and votes to report it to the full chamber. Legislative committees and Budget Committees in both chambers play important roles in the reconciliation process. Differences in the reconciliation legislation passed by the two chambers must be resolved before the bill can be sent to the President for approval or veto. Sometimes the reconciliation process triggered in the annual budget resolution of a specific year is not completed until the subsequent year. The FY2006 budget resolution included reconciliation directives that led to two bills being enacted in 2006. Reconciliation directives are included in the annual budget resolution to trigger the reconciliation process, requiring committees to develop legislation to achieve budgetary goals. Reconciliation directives in a budget resolution specify the date for reporting, budgetary changes needed, and the timeframe for measuring impact. They direct committees to develop legislation to achieve desired budget outcomes, either by a single committee or multiple committees. If more than one committee is directed, they must report their reconciliation legislation to the full chamber. The budget resolution instructs multiple committees to report reconciliation legislation to the Budget Committee, which then packages the responses into an omnibus bill without changes. Committees with jurisdiction over spending, revenues, or the debt limit may be directed to report reconciliation legislation. Since the 101st Congress, budget resolutions have included reconciliation directives to Senate and House committees. The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee have been directed to report reconciliation legislation in most cases. Reconciliation typically involves mandatory spending legislation, not discretionary spending, which is handled differently. The Appropriations Committees have rarely been instructed to report reconciliation legislation, with only two instances occurring, the most recent in 1981. In some cases, budget resolutions include multiple reconciliation directives to a single committee. This can happen for various reasons, such as directing the committee to report different types of reconciliation legislation (revenue, spending, or debt-limit legislation) or a combination of spending and revenue legislation to achieve deficit reduction. Committees may respond with separate pieces of legislation if given more than one directive. The committee may respond with separate pieces of legislation based on reconciliation directives that aim to achieve budgetary goals over different time periods. These directives specify the dollar amount by which spending or revenue levels should be altered, with the goal of reducing or eliminating a deficit. Conversely, directives that increase spending or reduce revenues aim to reduce or eliminate a surplus. The directives set a minimum amount of deficit reduction or surplus increase that the committee must achieve. The Budget Act provides reconciliation directives with a dollar amount as a maximum, known as a ceiling. Reconciliation legislation must not include extraneous provisions that increase the deficit beyond the specified period. Compliance is measured on a net basis, allowing for provisions that increase spending as long as overall spending decreases are met. The Budget Act provides reconciliation directives with a dollar amount ceiling to ensure overall spending decreases are met. Committees failing to respond may have legislative language included by the chambers to meet the directive. Reconciliation legislation can include spending, revenue, and debt limit directives, with the possibility of a combination of the three to achieve deficit reductions. The Budget Act allows for reconciliation directives to be issued to committees to reduce spending and increase revenues. These directives can result in up to three reconciliation bills being considered on the floor, one each for spending, revenue, and the debt limit. Direct spending directives focus on programs under the jurisdiction of legislative committees, not discretionary spending handled by the Appropriations Committees. Committees must respond to the directives by proposing changes to direct spending programs. Reconciliation directives involve reporting changes to direct spending programs or recommending changes in offsetting collections, which are treated as negative spending. The outlay level is the projected level of dispersed federal funds and is used to assess the impact of legislative changes on the federal budget. Directives instruct committees to reduce or increase spending by specific amounts. Reconciliation directives instruct committees to recommend legislation that would increase or decrease revenues. The amount specified in the directive is the minimum or maximum by which revenues should be increased or decreased. The reconciliation process is used by Congress to consider debt-limit legislation, with reconciliation directives to amend the public debt limit falling under specific committees. An example of a revenue instruction is provided, specifying the maximum amount by which revenue should be decreased. Legislation can be enacted to alter the statutory limit on the total amount of debt the federal government may incur. The Senate Committee on Finance may receive directives to report changes in law for increasing the public debt limit or achieving deficit reduction through legislation that includes spending cuts, tax increases, or a combination of both. Only the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee have jurisdiction over revenue legislation. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee have the authority to report legislation to reduce outlays, increase revenues, or a combination of both. They are granted flexibility under the \"fungibility rule\" when instructed to report both spending and revenue legislation. An example of such a directive is a reconciliation bill that aims to reduce revenues and increase outlays for specific fiscal years. The fungibility rule ensures that the committees meet the reconciliation directive requirements. The fungibility rule allows committees to meet reconciliation directives even if spending or revenue changes exceed or fall below by more than 20%, as long as the total changes reported match the instructed amount. Directives can cover single or multiple years, requiring legislation for specific fiscal periods. For example, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry must report changes in laws within its jurisdiction. The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry must report changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce outlays by $86 billion in fiscal year 1997 and $251 billion for fiscal years 1997 through 2002. Reconciliation directives in annual budget resolutions require committees to submit legislation by specific dates, which can vary. Committees have varied due dates for reconciliation directives, with staggered deadlines to regulate legislative activity. Responses to directives have been both early and late, with no impact on the bill's privileged status. There is no procedural mechanism to enforce directive dates, but chambers have methods to move forward with reconciliation legislation. The non-reporting committee's jurisdiction must satisfy the committee's directive. Budget resolutions may include contingent provisions in reconciliation directives, dictating changes based on specific events. For example, the FY1996 budget resolution required certification from the Congressional Budget Office for certain recommendations to balance the budget. Upon certification, the Senate Committee on Finance submits recommendations to the Senate Committee on the Budget. The Committee on the Budget adds recommendations to the reconciliation bill without substantive revision. Reconciliation directives in budget resolutions instruct committees to recommend legislation with specific budgetary effects, leaving programmatic details to the committees' discretion. Programmatic direction in reconciliation instructions can communicate policy preferences. The Budget Committee can provide policy instructions in a reconciliation directive, but it does not mandate compliance. Examples include allocating funds for an economic stimulus package and directing the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to reduce the deficit. Congress is expected to complete reconciliation legislation by June 15, but there is no enforcement mechanism for this deadline. The Budget Act establishes deadlines for reconciliation directives in the budget resolution, but there is no enforcement mechanism for these dates. Committees can still report reconciliation legislation after the specified deadline without losing its privileged status. In the case of omnibus reconciliation measures, the House and Senate Budget Committees have sometimes delayed reporting bills due to late committee submissions. Committees may not formally respond to reconciliation directives for various reasons, such as a shift in policy priorities or failure to approve reconciliation language. There is no procedural mechanism to enforce timely reporting of reconciliation legislation. In the House and Senate, committees may delay reporting reconciliation legislation for various reasons. Each chamber has methods to move forward with reconciliation legislation if a committee has not responded to a reconciliation directive. It is possible to consider reconciliation legislation on the Senate floor through a motion to recommit the bill to the committee with instructions for a swift report back with an amendment. This motion does not need to be germane and allows any Senator to propose legislative language within the committee's jurisdiction."
