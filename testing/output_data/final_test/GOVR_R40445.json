    "content": "The United States consumed 13 billion gallons of fuel ethanol in 2010, representing 10% of all U.S. gasoline consumption. Federal policies promoting ethanol use, such as tax incentives and mandates, have led to its growth from 1 billion gallons in the early 1990s. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of renewable fuel, with most of it being corn-based ethanol. The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates the use of renewable fuels, with a focus on ethanol. However, there are limitations on the amount of corn-based ethanol that can be used. The mandate for \"advanced biofuels\" is likely to be met using ethanol from sugarcane and cellulosic feedstocks. By 2022, 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels are required, with much of it expected to be ethanol from various sources. The main obstacle to using more ethanol in gasoline is the current limit of 10% ethanol blend for conventional vehicles. The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates the use of renewable fuels, with a focus on ethanol. The current limit of 10% ethanol blend for conventional vehicles may hinder meeting the mandate. Gasoline blenders are likely to hit a limit in the next few years due to the \"blend wall\" restricting ethanol blending into U.S. motor gasoline. The current 10% ethanol blend limit for conventional vehicles may hinder meeting the Renewable Fuel Standard mandate. Interest exists in increasing ethanol concentration in gasoline due to the \"blend wall.\" Research is ongoing on intermediate-level blends like E15, E20, E30, and E40. Growth Energy applied for a waiver to increase the maximum concentration to 15% (E15) in 2009. EPA noted the need for ethanol levels greater than 10% to meet the mandate. EPA granted a partial waiver for MY2007 and later vehicles to use ethanol blends greater than 10%, with a decision deferred for MY2001-MY2006 vehicles. The waiver was denied for MY2000 and older passenger vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles, marine engines, and non-road equipment. Engine and equipment manufacturers have challenged the waiver in court. The EPA failed to estimate the likelihood of misfueling with E15 equipment and its economic and environmental consequences. They stated concerns about using E15 in nonroad products due to emissions durability and materials compatibility issues. The agency granted a partial waiver for MY2007 and later vehicles but deferred a decision for MY2001-MY2006 vehicles. The waiver was denied for older vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles, marine engines, and non-road equipment. Engine and equipment manufacturers have challenged the waiver in court. The EPA stated that insufficient data have been submitted on the use of E-15 in older vehicles and non-road engines, hindering a decision on a waiver for E-15 use. Granting Growth Energy's petition for E-15 only addresses one aspect of the blend wall, with other obstacles like state laws, warranties, and infrastructure still needing to be resolved. Additionally, fuel suppliers must register E-15 with the EPA and submit health effects testing before its sale is allowed. The blend wall represents the maximum amount of ethanol that can be blended into U.S. gasoline. The blend wall limits the amount of ethanol that can be blended into U.S. gasoline to around 14-15 billion gallons due to EPA regulations and automaker warranties. Fuel manufacturers would need EPA approval for blends higher than 10%. Despite EPA approval of higher ethanol blends for some vehicles, automakers have not approved them yet. Small engine manufacturers advise against using gasoline with more than 10% ethanol in machines like lawnmowers and snowmobiles. Existing infrastructure may not tolerate higher ethanol concentrations, although Underwriters Laboratories supports blends up to 15% in fuel pumps certified for E10. UL supports blends up to 15% in fuel pumps certified for E10, but a variance exists for E10 and E15 ethanol levels. To dispense E15, a higher maximum level, possibly 18%, would be needed. In a study by NREL, conducted by UL, some equipment listed for E10 showed inconclusive results and corrosion issues with E15. UL certified two new pumps for blends up to E25 in March 2010. In 2010, UL certified two new pumps for blends up to E25, and Gilbarco expanded warranty coverage to E15 for pumps made after April 1, 2008. State laws limit ethanol in gasoline to 10%, requiring amendments for E15. This report focuses on addressing the CAA restriction on ethanol concentration in gasoline, with EPA defining gasoline to have an upper limit of 2.7% oxygen content, limiting ethanol concentration to roughly 7.5%. The EPA allows manufacturers to apply for a waiver from the \"substantially similar\" requirement if they can prove that their fuel or additive will not cause a vehicle to fail emissions standards. The EPA Administrator may waive prohibitions or limitations if it is determined that the fuel or additive will not harm emission control devices. The EPA may grant waivers for fuels or additives that will not cause emission control devices to fail standards. Waivers must be approved within 270 days of application. EPA has previously granted waivers for 10% ethanol blends. To allow E15 or E20, EPA would need to revise the definition of \"substantially similar\" or manufacturers would need to meet new requirements. To obtain a waiver for higher oxygen content in fuel, manufacturers must submit comprehensive data on evaporative and exhaust emissions, assess short-term and long-term effects on various vehicles, and evaluate durability and compatibility with the new fuel. EPA has granted waivers for ethanol blends in the past but may need to revise regulations for E15 or E20. The EPA requires comprehensive data on emissions and engine compatibility for new fuel blends, especially higher-level ethanol blends. Ethanol's oxygen content can affect engine performance by making it run leaner. After obtaining a waiver, new fuel blends must be registered with the EPA, including health impact assessments. Minnesota has conducted much of the research on E20 fuel, with plans to mandate its use in 2013. Preliminary research on materials compatibility and driveability for mid-level ethanol blends has been completed or is ongoing, as highlighted by Chrysler and Honda in a presentation to EPA's Clean Air Act Advisory Committee. Research areas for cars and trucks include durability, tailpipe emissions, evaporative emissions, driveability, materials compatibility, emissions inventory, and on-board diagnostic integrity. Comprehensive testing is still ongoing, with completion expected after 2009. Research on materials compatibility and driveability for mid-level ethanol blends has been ongoing, with testing of newer vehicles expected to be completed by May 2010. EPA noted that durability testing was ongoing at DOE, with a significant amount of data expected by mid-June. Testing for older vehicles and non-road engines was not mentioned in the update. EPA later pushed back the completion date for testing of newer vehicles to the end of September 2010. The EPA granted a partial waiver in October 2010 after completing testing on vehicles between model years 2001 and 2006. The testing for older vehicles and non-road engines did not provide sufficient data to alleviate concerns, leading to a denial of that part of the waiver. The partial waiver has been challenged in court by automakers and equipment manufacturers. EPA must grant or deny waiver requests within 270 days of receipt, as per CAA Section 211(f)(4). The EPA granted a partial waiver in October 2010 after completing testing on vehicles between model years 2001 and 2006. The testing for older vehicles and non-road engines did not provide sufficient data to alleviate concerns, leading to a denial of that part of the waiver. A question has been raised on whether EPA can grant a partial waiver, such as allowing E12 or E13 while taking more time to review Growth Energy's application for E15. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack supported this strategy, and ADM requested a waiver for E12 or determination that E12 is \"substantially similar\" to E10. EPA's decision on the Growth Energy petition found insufficient data to determine that E12 was substantially similar. The EPA determined that there were insufficient data to determine if E12 was substantially similar to E15, with similar concerns for older vehicles and non-road engines. Any gasoline or ethanol producer can petition EPA for a waiver under CAA Section 211(f)(4), with Growth Energy filing on behalf of 52 U.S. ethanol manufacturers. The EPA determined that there were insufficient data to determine if E12 was substantially similar to E15, with concerns for older vehicles and non-road engines. The Ethanol Vehicle Coalition is exploring legislative options to allow the use of E15, including amending the Clean Air Act and promoting the use of E85 fuel. Growth Energy petitioned the EPA for a waiver to allow up to 15% ethanol in gasoline. Energy petitioned EPA for a waiver to allow up to 15% ethanol in gasoline. EPA granted a partial waiver for MY2007 and later passenger vehicles, denied the waiver for older vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles, and deferred a decision for MY2001-MY2006 passenger vehicles. Growth Energy stated that higher ethanol blends would benefit the environment by reducing emissions and using less energy. Growth Energy argued that E-15 will not harm emission control devices based on studies showing a decrease in carbon monoxide emissions and a slight increase in acetaldehyde and formaldehyde emissions. The EPA granted a partial waiver for newer vehicles using E15 fuel, but deferred a decision for older vehicles. Growth Energy asserts that studies show emissions from E15 are within limits, but EPA wants more long-term testing data before making a final decision. EPA needs to prove that emissions from E15 would cause vehicles to fall out of compliance with standards. The EPA granted a partial waiver for newer vehicles using E15 fuel but deferred a decision for older vehicles. EPA determined insufficient data to alleviate concerns over emissions from older passenger vehicles and non-road engines. Approval by EPA for use in newer vehicles is not the only hurdle for intermediate-level ethanol blends. Existing infrastructure may not support ethanol blends above E10. Fuel suppliers and retailers may be hesitant to sell E15 fuel without assurance that it won't damage their systems, lead to liability issues, or compromise insurance coverage. Owners of underground storage tanks must prove compatibility with E15, and modifications to loan covenants and insurance policies may be necessary. Engine and auto manufacturers would need to address concerns for vehicle and machine owners to accept the new fuel. EPA is considering updates to guidance on demonstrating compatibility with E15. Engine and auto manufacturers would need to convince customers that new fuel won't damage equipment or void warranties. Small-engine manufacturers and users are concerned about effects of E10 and higher ethanol blends. A group of manufacturers has challenged the partial waiver in court due to misfueling concerns. State laws limiting ethanol to 10% would need updating for E15 use. Gasoline retailers fear losing insurance coverage if they distribute E15 with over 10% ethanol. EPA introduced rules to prevent misfueling, including new labels for fuel pumps dispensing E15, finalized in June 2011 after consulting with the FTC. The label design and content were harmonized with current FTC rules for motor fuels. The key question was whether the label should be a cautionary warning or informational. The EPA and FTC settled on using the word \"attention\" on the label for E15 fuel pumps, aligning it with other FTC labels and providing the necessary information without causing undue concern among vehicle owners."
