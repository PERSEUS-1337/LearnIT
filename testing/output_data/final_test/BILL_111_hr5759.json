    "content": "The \"Protecting Rural Landscapes Act of 2010\" may be cited as such. It addresses the issue of split estate. The \"Protecting Rural Landscapes Act of 2010\" addresses the issue of split estates by amending Section 17 of the Mineral Leasing Act to define terms related to land where the United States holds oil and gas resources but not the surface estate. It also defines lease and lessee in relation to the development of oil and gas resources on covered land. The \"Protecting Rural Landscapes Act of 2010\" defines terms related to oil and gas operations on covered land, including the terms operator, Secretary, and surface owner. The \"Protecting Rural Landscapes Act of 2010\" outlines compensation and reclamation requirements for operators conducting oil and gas operations on covered land. Operators must compensate surface owners for damages such as loss of agricultural production, income, land value, use, access, and improvements. Additionally, operators are obligated to reclaim the land affected by their operations. The \"Protecting Rural Landscapes Act of 2010\" mandates operators to reclaim the surface affected by their oil and gas operations. Prior notice requirements include providing 5 days notice for activities not disturbing the surface and 30 days notice with operation details before commencing oil and gas operations. The notices required by this section must be given to the surface owner at the address on record with the county clerk. Notices are considered received five days after mailing or immediately upon hand delivery. The operator must provide a proposed surface use agreement to the surface owner when giving notice of operations. The operator must provide sufficient disclosure of planned oil and gas operations to the surface owner, including details on facilities, equipment, water protection, reclamation, and minimizing surface damages. Compensation must also be offered. The surface owner must be offered compensation for damages caused by oil and gas operations. Within 30 days of receiving the proposed surface use agreement, the owner can accept or reject it. Failure to accept within this period may be seen as a rejection. Negotiations can take place between the owner and operator regarding the agreement. The operator and surface owner may enter into an agreement specifying rights and obligations for surface activities. If no agreement is reached, the operator can enter the property with financial assurance for the owner's benefit. The Secretary must ensure the release of financial assurance once reclamation is complete and the surface owner is compensated. Written notice of lease sales for oil or gas leases must be provided to surface owners and permit holders at least 30 days before the sale. The Secretary of the Interior must promulgate regulations within 180 days of the Act's enactment to implement the amendment regarding lease sale notifications and drilling permit issuance timelines. This subsection does not preempt any relevant State laws."
