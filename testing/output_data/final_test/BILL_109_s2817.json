    "content": "The Biofuels Security Act of 2006, also known as the Renewable Fuels Program, includes provisions for the installation of E-85 fuel pumps, minimum Federal fleet requirements, and the manufacturing of dual-fueled automobiles. The Clean Air Act is amended to determine applicable volume for biofuels annually, ensuring requirements are met for specified years. The Clean Air Act is amended to set annual renewable fuel requirements, including 10 billion gallons for 2010, 30 billion gallons for 2020, and 60 billion gallons for 2030. SEC. 102. Mandates major oil companies to install E-85 fuel pumps at owned and branded stations. Section 211(o) of the Clean Air Act is amended to require major oil companies to install E-85 fuel pumps at owned and branded stations. E-85 fuel is defined as a blend of gasoline with approximately 85% ethanol produced in the United States. A major oil company is defined as a person with at least 4,500 retail outlets. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies, must ensure major oil companies with 4,500 retail outlets install E-85 fuel pumps at owned or branded stations in the US. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies, must ensure major oil companies install E-85 fuel pumps at owned or branded stations in the US, meeting specified percentages. The Secretary of Energy mandates major oil companies to install E-85 fuel pumps at owned or branded stations in the US, with increasing percentages from 5% in 2007 to 45% in 2015. The Secretary of Energy requires major oil companies to have E-85 fuel pumps at their stations, with a minimum percentage of 50% starting in 2016. The Secretary mandates major oil companies to install E-85 fuel pumps in each state they operate, assuming full financial responsibility for the costs. Major oil companies earn production credits for exceeding E-85 fuel pump installation requirements, which can be applied over three consecutive calendar years. Trading credits are also allowed. Major oil companies can sell earned credits to meet requirements, but cannot use purchased credits for geographic distribution requirements. SEC. 103 amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to require a minimum federal fleet of 100 percent in fiscal year 2007 and beyond. SEC. 104 applies the Gasohol Competition Act of 1980. SEC. 104 of the Gasohol Competition Act of 1980 prohibits restrictions on franchisees installing renewable fuel pumps like E-85, defining gasohol as any blend of ethanol and gasoline such as E-85. Title II of the Gasohol Competition Act of 1980 mandates the manufacturing of dual-fueled automobiles capable of running on gasoline or diesel fuel, with a required percentage of such vehicles to be produced and sold in the United States after 2006. The Gasohol Competition Act of 1980 mandates the production of dual-fueled automobiles with specific percentage requirements for each model year from 2007 to 2015: 10% in 2007, 20% in 2008, 30% in 2009, 40% in 2010, 50% in 2011, 60% in 2012, 70% in 2013, 80% in 2014, and 90% in 2015. The Gasohol Competition Act of 1980 mandates production of dual-fueled automobiles with specific percentage requirements for each model year from 2007 to 2015. If a manufacturer exceeds the required number of dual-fueled automobiles, they earn credits that can be applied to the following 3 model years or sold to another manufacturer. Technical amendment made to the table of sections for chapter 329 of title 49, US Code. The Secretary of Transportation is required to promote the use of fuel mixtures containing gasoline or diesel fuel and alternative fuels to power automobiles in the United States. Manufacturing incentives are provided for dual-fueled automobiles. Section 32905(b) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to update fuel economy measurement requirements for dual-fueled automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer. The Biofuels Security Act of 2006 updates fuel economy measurement requirements for dual-fueled automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer, with specific calculations for gasoline/diesel fuel and alternative fuel. The Administrator is responsible for measuring fuel economy for each model in the first year after enactment. The Biofuels Security Act of 2006 requires the Administrator to measure fuel economy for dual-fueled automobiles using specific calculations for gasoline/diesel fuel and alternative fuel. Fuel economy must be measured for each model beginning not less than 54 months after the enactment of the Act. The Biofuels Security Act of 2006 mandates measuring fuel economy for dual-fueled automobiles according to specific calculations. This includes vehicles complying with requirements under section 32902A(a) and using dual fueled automobile credits under section 32902A(b), with measurement done in accordance with section 32904(c) of the Act."
