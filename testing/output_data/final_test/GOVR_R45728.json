    "content": "This report highlights current major trade issues for U.S. agriculture of interest to the 116th Congress. It covers U.S. agricultural trade importance, Trump Administration's trade policy impact, actions to mitigate economic effects, and implications of U.S. withdrawal from TPP. It also discusses ongoing trade disputes and negotiations. The report examines ongoing trade disputes and negotiations, focusing on key agricultural trade issues. U.S. agricultural exports have declined from the record level in FY2014, with the USDA forecasting exports at $141.5 billion in FY2019, a decrease from $143 billion in FY2018. The decline in U.S. agricultural exports since FY2014 is attributed to lower market prices for bulk commodities like soybeans and corn. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by China, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey in response to U.S. tariffs have further impacted agricultural prices. Despite a forecasted increase in agricultural imports to $128 billion in FY2019, the agricultural trade surplus is expected to decrease to $13.5 billion, below the record high of $43.1 billion in FY2014. In 2017 and 2018, U.S. agricultural exports accounted for 8% and 9% of total U.S. exports, respectively, and 5% of total U.S. imports. Each dollar of U.S. agricultural exports in 2017 stimulated an additional $1.30 in business activity and generated 1,161,000 full-time civilian jobs. Export markets are crucial for sustaining prices and revenue in the agricultural sector, accounting for around 20% of total farm activity. Export markets play a crucial role in the agricultural sector, accounting for around 20% of total farm production by value. They are a major outlet for various farm commodities, with soybeans, corn, feed crops, and wheat ranking at the top of the list of exports. High-value products like live animals, meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables make up the largest share of agricultural exports in terms of value. In FY2018, these products represented 66% of the total value of U.S. agricultural exports. In 2017, the top 10 agricultural exporting states accounted for 57% of total U.S. agricultural exports. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized key export promotion programs through FY2023, focusing on export credit guarantees, market development, and international exchange programs. The Trump Administration emphasizes trade deficits in shaping U.S. trade policy. The Trump Administration's trade policy focuses on reducing trade deficits by withdrawing from or renegotiating trade agreements deemed unfair, imposing punitive tariffs on imports, and engaging in trade disputes with various countries. This includes actions such as imposing Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and Section 301 tariffs on products from China. The Trump Administration's trade policy involves withdrawing from or renegotiating trade agreements seen as unfair, imposing tariffs on imports, and engaging in trade disputes. This has led to market share losses for certain U.S. agricultural exports. The Administration questions the benefits of multi-party agreements and has threatened to withdraw from the World Trade Organization if reforms are not made. In January 2017, the Administration withdrew from the TPP. In January 2017, the Trump Administration withdrew from the TPP, which was later concluded by remaining signatories as the CPTPP in March 2018. The USMCA, a renegotiation of NAFTA, was signed in November 2018 but requires legislative ratification. The Administration prefers bilateral negotiations over multilateral ones and has sought to update existing agreements and open new negotiations. The Administration has negotiated modifications to the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement and intends to begin negotiations with Japan, the EU, and the UK under Trade Promotion Authority. Bilateral trade negotiations with China are ongoing to resolve the trade dispute resulting in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. However, new agreements with important agricultural trading partners like Canada and Mexico are uncertain, and U.S. agricultural exports are still facing retaliatory tariffs due to Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. The signed USMCA is pending approval by Congress and ratification by Canada and Mexico. Concerns have been raised about U.S. agriculture losing export market shares due to withdrawal from TPP and absence from CPTPP. USTR may pursue negotiations with Japan in stages, prioritizing the automobiles sector. President Trump and the Secretary of Agriculture aim for a quick deal on agriculture with Japan, but the Japanese economy minister stated that agreements would not be reached in any one sector before others. The EU aims for a trade agreement with the US limited to industrial goods, excluding agriculture. The UK cannot negotiate a new trade deal with the US until it leaves the EU. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports citing national security concerns. Tariff increases were also implemented on Chinese goods due to objections on intellectual property policies. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as well as three rounds of tariff increases on $250 billion worth of Chinese products under Section 301. In response, Canada, China, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey retaliated with tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products. India has also proposed retaliatory tariffs, targeting over 800 U.S. agricultural products. China's retaliatory tariffs affect 99% of U.S. agricultural products exported to China. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs ranging from 5% to 50% on over 800 U.S. food and agricultural products worth $20.6 billion in 2017. The affected products include grains, meat, fruits, seafood, and processed foods. The most impacted U.S. agricultural imports into China are soybeans, cotton, sorghum, and hides and skins. Canada has also imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products, affecting items like roasted coffee, ketchup, beverage waters, licorice, and orange juice. The U.S. faces retaliatory tariffs from various countries on products like roasted coffee, ketchup, beverages, licorice, toffee, orange juice, cheese, pork, prepared vegetables, legumes, grains, fruit juice, peanut butter, whiskey, tree nuts, rice, and tobacco. These tariffs have impacted exports to Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey, with significant reductions in sales in 2018 compared to 2017. The retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports to Turkey could lead to a significant reduction in sales, potentially resulting in a loss of $8 billion annually. The impact would affect agricultural land prices and lead to the reallocation of 45,000 farm workers. Soybean producers would be the most affected, with exports possibly falling by 21% and land prices declining by 18%. The extended imposition of retaliatory tariffs may erode U.S. market share in favor of export competitors. The imposition of retaliatory tariffs is expected to erode U.S. market share in favor of export competitors in the longer term. U.S. agricultural exports continue to face retaliatory tariffs, with forecasts showing a decline in exports to China by over $7 billion. The USMCA trade agreement does not address the Section 232 tariffs, leading to retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico. Discussions between the United States and China are ongoing to resolve the trade dispute. Before the USMCA trade agreement can enter into force, the Section 232 tariff issues must be resolved, as stated by various U.S. business and agriculture representatives, congressional leaders, and Canadian and Mexican officials. In response to trade-related consequences, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced temporary actions to assist farmers, including a $12 billion trade aid package for certain agricultural commodities. Initially, it was stated that no further financial assistance would be provided, but on May 10, the situation changed. Secretary Perdue announced a $12 billion trade aid package for affected agricultural commodities. The package includes direct payments, a food purchase program, and an agricultural trade promotion program. The largest component, the Market Facilitation Program, provides financial assistance to producers impacted by foreign government actions. USDA is working on a new aid package following White House direction. The USDA announced the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) per-unit payment rates for eligible commodities in 2018. Participants had to meet criteria such as being actively engaged in farming and certifying their 2018 production with USDA by May 1, 2019. The MFP payment rate was determined based on the estimated direct trade damage caused by retaliatory tariffs. The USDA announced the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) per-unit payment rates for eligible commodities in 2018, based on estimated direct trade damage from retaliatory tariffs. Approximately $9.6 billion would be distributed in MFP payments, with soybean producers receiving over three-fourths of the payments. Some commodity groups argued that the payment formula favored commodities relying more on export markets, leading to inadequate compensation for industries like corn, wheat, milk, and specialty crops. The 2018 trade disputes led to significant losses for various agricultural sectors. The National Corn Growers Association reported a $6.3 billion potential total loss due to a $0.44 per bushel decrease in corn prices. The National Association of Wheat Growers estimated a $2.5 billion loss from a $0.75 per bushel decrease in wheat prices. The National Milk Producers Federation calculated over $1.2 billion in losses from a $1.10 per hundredweight decline in milk prices. Specialty crop groups also suffered losses, with a 2018 study from the University of California-Davis projecting over $3.3 billion in trade-related losses for California alone. In March 2019, USDA estimated $8.7 billion in outlays under the MFP program, with $5.2 billion in 2018 and $3.5 billion in 2019. The large payments may raise concerns about WTO rules. Questions arise about the need for additional trade aid in 2019 and beyond if no agreement is reached with China. There is also a discussion on revising payment formulation for a broader distribution across the U.S. agricultural sector. The CPTPP, a revised agreement involving 11 countries, entered into force after the US withdrew from the TPP. The TPP would have been a significant trade agreement covering 40% of the global economy, providing market access through tariff reductions. The CPTPP now offers preferential access to overseas markets for US farm and food products. The CPTPP provisions aim to liberalize trade for U.S. farm and food products through lower tariffs and expanded TRQs. The USITC projected that TPP ratification would increase U.S. agricultural exports by $7.2 billion by 2032, with Japan and Vietnam being key markets. CPTPP countries accounted for 42% of U.S. farm exports and 52% of agricultural imports between 2015 and 2018. The absence of the US from CPTPP could result in a decline of $1.8 billion in agricultural exports annually. This, combined with retaliatory tariffs and the threat of withdrawing from NAFTA, may lead to a potential annual drop of $21.8 billion in U.S. agricultural exports. Concerns are raised by various agricultural groups about losing potential export markets under CPTPP. Under CPTPP, Japanese tariffs on wheat imports will decrease by 50% by 2025, putting U.S. wheat exports at a disadvantage. The U.S. dairy industry predicts that almost half of its exports to Japan will be replaced by CPTPP countries by 2027. Japan is a significant market for U.S. beef and pork, but competitors under CPTPP have better access, leading to potential losses of $550 million in beef exports by 2023 and $1.2 billion by 2028, and over $600 million in pork exports by 2023, reaching $1 billion by 2028. The USDA officials and representatives of the U.S. wheat and barley industries are concerned about the declining market share of U.S. wheat and barley exports in Japan to CPTPP member countries and the EU. U.S. agricultural exports are facing challenges in CPTPP member country markets due to expanding market access and reduced tariffs. The Trump Administration has notified Congress of its intent to enter into trade negotiations with Japan, a CPTPP member country, but stakeholders are uncertain about the prospects of a quick deal. President Trump and the Secretary of Agriculture aim to achieve fairer trade, including in auto trade. The Trump Administration aims to negotiate with Japan in stages for a quick deal on agriculture, while the Japanese economy minister insists on reaching agreements across all sectors simultaneously. Canada has been the top agricultural export market for the US since 2002, with Mexico following as the third-largest market. The USMCA agreement with Canada and Mexico was announced on September 30, 2018. The Trump Administration announced the USMCA agreement with Canada and Mexico as a replacement for NAFTA. Under NAFTA, agricultural tariffs were phased out to zero except for specific products traded between the US and Canada. The proposed USMCA would expand on the agricultural provisions of NAFTA. USMCA expands on NAFTA's agricultural provisions, maintaining zero tariffs for existing products. Market access is increased for agricultural goods between Canada and the US. New TRQs are created for US dairy and poultry products. Both countries improve access for certain agricultural imports. Wheat varieties are graded equally. Under USMCA, provisions are made for textiles and apparel to promote North American origin products, support domestic U.S. cotton production, and ensure equal treatment for alcoholic beverages. The agreement also includes transparency in SPS rules, recognition of new geographic indications, and addresses agricultural biotechnology. The USITC released a report in April 2019 assessing the likely effects of USMCA on the U.S. economy and its sectors. The report includes provisions such as intellectual property rights, data flow commitments, and labor standards, which may reduce uncertainty in future trading regimes. The report predicts a 1.1% increase in U.S. agricultural exports in year 6 of USMCA implementation. In year 6 of USMCA implementation, U.S. agricultural exports are projected to increase by 1.1%. Dairy exports to NAFTA countries would rise by $314.5 million (7.1%), and poultry exports by $183.5 million (1%) compared to 2017 levels. A 2018 study commissioned by the Farm Foundation analyzes the impact of changes in agricultural tariffs and TRQs under USMCA on the economy after full implementation. This study estimates a net increase in annual U.S. agricultural exports of $450 million under USMCA in 2014 dollars, offset by $1.8 billion in export losses from retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada and Mexico in response to U.S. Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The losses include changes in production decisions and volumes due to higher production costs. The study does not consider changes in other sectors of the economy or potential impacts over time from policy shocks, technological changes, and population changes. Under a scenario of complete NAFTA withdrawal without USMCA ratification, U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico would face higher WTO MFN tariffs, leading to a $12 billion annual decline in agricultural and food exports. The IMF study evaluates USMCA's impact on North America, focusing on provisions like increased regional value content requirements for vehicles, new labor value content rules, stricter rules for textile trade, and agricultural trade liberalization. The IMF study evaluates the impact of USMCA on North America, focusing on provisions like increased regional value content requirements for vehicles, new labor value content rules, stricter rules for textile trade, and agricultural trade liberalization. The study describes a medium-term adjustment five to seven years after full implementation of USMCA, highlighting potential economic losses for all three countries due to higher regional vehicle and labor requirements. The report highlights that Canada would gain more than the United States from USMCA, with trade facilitation provisions offering the largest benefit. New domestic content rules in USMCA could increase input costs for U.S. farmers. Stakeholder groups have mixed responses, with a coalition of 200 U.S. companies supporting USMCA's approval. The proposed USMCA builds on existing trade relationships but faces concerns from some groups about fair trade benefits for family farmers. Approval requires U.S. Congress and Canada/Mexico ratification. A report assessing USMCA's impact on the U.S. economy was submitted to Congress. Ratification timeline likely follows TPA procedures under the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015. The draft implementing bill for USMCA faces uncertainty in Congress due to unresolved disputes over tariffs. Senator Chuck Grassley calls for lifting tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seeks stronger enforcement language and reopening of USMCA talks for labor and environmental protections. The Canadian dairy sector limits production, sets prices, and restricts imports. The Canadian dairy sector restricts imports through TRQs with high tariffs. US dairy exports to Canada would be higher without import restrictions. US milk producers started exporting UF milk to Canada, a high-protein product used in dairy products like cheese and yogurt. This market opportunity arose after Canada changed its cheese standards, reducing the use of certain milk products supplied by US processors. In 2017, Canada introduced the Class 7 milk price classification, leading to increased production of butterfat and surplus skim milk supplies. This classification included skim milk components like milk protein concentrates and skim milk powder, resulting in lower prices for Canadian skim milk products. As a result, Canada expanded global exports of skim milk powder, causing a decline in U.S. exports of high-protein UF milk to Canadian cheese and yogurt processors. The value of U.S. UF milk exports to Canada dropped from nearly $107 million in 2015 to $49 million in 2017 after the implementation of the Class 7 regime. In 2017, Canada introduced the Class 7 milk price classification, leading to increased production of butterfat and surplus skim milk supplies. The value of U.S. UF milk exports to Canada dropped from nearly $107 million in 2015 to $49 million in 2017 after the implementation of the Class 7 regime. Under USMCA, Canada agreed to eliminate the Class 7 pricing regime six months after USMCA enters into force. Canada also agreed to reclassify Class 7 products according to their end use and base its selling price on a formula that takes into consideration the USDA reported nonfat dry milk price. Under USMCA, Canada will maintain its milk supply management system and expand TRQs for U.S. dairy exports duty-free. The U.S. will establish TRQs for Canadian dairy imports. Canada will grant the U.S. duty-free access to nearly 17,000 MT of dairy products in the first year, increasing to 109,000 MT by year 19. This quota is in addition to the WTO global quota available under NAFTA. In Canada, provincial governments have authority over alcohol import and distribution. British Columbia implemented policies giving exclusive access to BC wine in retail and grocery stores. Imported wine is sold in a separate section. Canada is the top export market for California wine, with $444 million in sales in 2017. The Obama Administration initiated trade enforcement action against Canada at the WTO in January 2017 regarding BC wine measures. The Trump Administration's actions in September 2017 led to the US requesting consultations with Canada over BC wine measures. USTR claims BC's regulations unfairly keep US wine out of grocery stores, violating WTO commitments. The Canadian wine industry relies heavily on imports, with BC Vintners Quality Alliance issuing store licenses since the 1980s. The US reiterated concerns in a second complaint in July 2018, with Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and the EU seeking to join. The proposed USMCA includes addressing US concerns about BC wine measures in a side letter. Canada has agreed to modify measures providing preferential shelf space to provincial wines by November 1, 2019, as outlined in a side letter to the proposed USMCA. However, the agreement does not address all issues restricting U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada, including changes sought by U.S. produce growers. Mexico's greenhouse production of fruits and vegetables has increased in recent years, impacting imports of seasonal produce. Mexico is the largest foreign supplier of U.S. imports of vegetables and fruits, with a significant increase in produce grown under protection. The Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association (FFVA) is concerned about Mexico's government subsidies for produce production, advocating for countervailing duties and higher antidumping duties on U.S. imports. They also highlight Mexico's labor cost advantage in fruit and vegetable production as a competitive edge. Trade concerns mainly focus on tomatoes, peppers, and berries. The Trump Administration aims to address these issues in the renegotiation of NAFTA. The Trump Administration proposed new rules for seasonal and perishable products in NAFTA renegotiation, aiming to make it easier for regional producers to initiate injury cases and impose duties on imported products causing harm. Some Members of Congress supported these seasonal protections, while others opposed them. The Trump Administration proposed new rules for seasonal and perishable products in NAFTA renegotiation, aiming to make it easier for regional producers to initiate injury cases and impose duties on imported products causing harm. Some Members of Congress supported these seasonal protections, while others opposed them, citing concerns about potential negative impacts on the U.S. produce industry and consumers. The Fruits and Vegetables (F&V ATAC) group did not support including provisions in the NAFTA renegotiation for seasonal produce trade remedies due to opposition from Mexican and Canadian negotiators and concerns from the U.S. agricultural community. The proposed USMCA does not address this issue, leading to bills introduced in Congress to address seasonal produce trade remedies. The bills introduced in Congress aim to provide for CVD and AD procedures for seasonal producers and redefine core seasonal industry in U.S. trade remedy laws. These bills, renamed \"Defending Domestic Produce Production Act of 2019,\" would allow regional groups representing less than 50% of nationwide seasonal growers to initiate injury investigations, potentially making it easier for regional producers to start trade remedy cases. The U.S.-Mexico Tomato Suspension Agreement suspends the U.S. AD investigation into Mexican fresh tomatoes sold at less than fair value. The U.S.-Mexico Tomato Suspension Agreement, in effect since 1996, requires Mexican growers to sell tomatoes above a reference price to prevent harm to the U.S. market. Terminating the agreement could reduce tomato supply and raise prices for consumers in the U.S. The U.S.-Mexico Tomato Suspension Agreement, in effect since 1996, sets floor prices for Mexican fresh tomatoes during different seasons and production types. It covers various types of fresh tomatoes but not those for processing. In early 2018, the Department of Commerce (DOC) initiated consultations with Mexican tomato growers to negotiate revisions to the agreement. DOC also conducted a five-year sunset review of the suspended anti-dumping investigation, indicating potential dumping of fresh tomatoes with weighted-average dumping margins calculated. In November 2018, the Florida Tomato Exchange requested the US to withdraw from the suspension agreement on fresh tomatoes from Mexico. Members of Congress support withdrawal, while groups opposing it include the FPAA and Mexican growers. The US terminated the 2013 Suspension Agreement in May 2019 but plans to negotiate a revised agreement. In February 2019, the US conducted a review of the agreement on Mexican fresh tomatoes, finding they were sold below fair value. The Department of Commerce and Mexico have not reached a new agreement despite negotiations since 2018. In April 2019, Mexico's tomato growers proposed changes to pricing. The US decision has disappointed the Mexican government. In December 2014, suspension agreements were signed to prevent duties on Mexican sugar imports. The US imposed a suspension on Mexican sugar imports due to alleged subsidies and selling below fair value. The agreements limit Mexico's sugar exports to the US based on domestic needs, set minimum prices, and restrict refined sugar imports. Despite criticism that the agreements did not fully eliminate the harm caused by Mexican sugar dumping, they remain in effect. In November 2016, the American Sugar Coalition called for the withdrawal from agreements due to concerns about Mexican sugar imports not adhering to limits and minimum prices. Imperial Sugar Company also supported withdrawal, while the Sweetener Users Association recommended renegotiation to address shortcomings. Terminating the agreements could lead to the imposition of duties on Mexican sugar. In June 2017, the United States and Mexico agreed to amendments to the suspension agreements regarding sugar imports. The price of imported Mexican raw sugar was increased to $0.23 per pound, and refined sugar to $0.28 per pound. The maximum share of refined sugar imports was limited to 30%, with raw sugar imports constituting at least 70% of the total. Under the 2014 agreement, imported raw sugar must be bulk and free flowing, not packaged. If additional sugar imports are needed, Mexico has the first opportunity to fill the need. U.S. trade negotiations aim to establish a common framework for agricultural biotechnology products. Geographical indications and market expansion opportunities in Cuba are also key trade issues. Interested exporters see a prohibition on private U.S. financing as a major obstacle to market expansion opportunities in Cuba. The United States is reviewing the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) for duty-free tariff treatment. Agricultural biotechnology involves genetically modifying plants and animals for desired traits. U.S. producers have adopted genetically engineered varieties of soybean, corn, cotton, and sugar beet. The United States leads in cultivating genetically engineered (GE) crops, with over 40% of global GE crop acres. In the EU, GE crop production is limited to about 1% of crop acreage, mainly pest-resistant GE corn. Eighteen EU member states ban GE crop cultivation, with cautious approval from EU officials for GE products. The EU has strict regulations on genetically engineered (GE) products, allowing only approved varieties to be imported with labeling requirements. The approval process for GE products has been a contentious issue in US-EU agricultural trade negotiations, with public opposition to GE food and crops in most EU member states. This opposition has also influenced acceptance of GE crops in lesser developed countries. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture stated that the United States will not regulate plants created through genomic editing as long as they are developed without using a plant pest as the donor or vector. In contrast, the EU Court of Justice ruled that organisms obtained by mutagenesis are genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and fall under the GMO Directive. China's reluctance to approve GE crops or imports is a source of frustration for U.S. agriculture. China's reluctance to approve GE crops or imports is frustrating for U.S. agriculture. U.S.-developed GMOs are grown in China without authorization, despite laws banning their cultivation. In 2016, China agreed to improve its biotechnology approval process without specific details. In 2019, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture approved five new biotech traits in imported crops for processing. The ministry also amended regulations on safety assessment, import approval, and labeling of agricultural GMOs without notifying the WTO or stakeholders. The USMCA includes provisions to improve transparency in approving agricultural biotechnology products, covering crops produced with all biotechnology methods. Trade negotiations also address labeling issues and unintended presence of GE products in non-GE shipments. The new \"bioengineered food disclosure\" standard in the US may raise concerns among trading partners like the EU, as it excludes labeling for highly refined ingredients from GE crops if no modified genetic material is detectable. The USMCA includes provisions to improve transparency in approving agricultural biotechnology products, covering crops produced with all biotechnology methods. U.S. trade negotiations aim to establish a common framework for GE approvals and harmonized regulatory procedures. The proposed USMCA specifically includes provisions to improve transparency in bringing agricultural biotechnology products to market. The United States believes that U.S. export opportunities are being impaired due to EU pressure on lesser developed countries to adopt EU SPS measures that ban GE products. GIs protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, such as wines, spirits, and agricultural products, giving them recognition and commercial value. GIs can also provide relief from infringement or unfair competition, but may hinder trade by protecting names considered common or generic in one market. Examples of registered or established Geographical Indications (GIs) include Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, Prosciutto di Parma ham, Toscano olive oil, Roquefort cheese, Champagne, Irish whiskey, Darjeeling tea, Florida oranges, Idaho potatoes, Vidalia onions, Washington State apples, and Napa Valley wines. GIs protect products from specific regions, giving them recognition and commercial value. The use of GIs has become a contentious international trade issue, particularly for U.S. wine, cheese, and sausage makers. Some consider GIs to be protected intellectual property, while others view them as generic terms. In the United States, feta is considered a generic name for a type of cheese, but it is protected as a Geographical Indication (GI) in Europe. This means that feta cheese produced in the US cannot be sold in the EU. Laws and regulations regarding GIs differ between the US and EU, creating complications for exporters. Recently, trade agreements between the EU and other countries have led to recognition of EU GIs in Canada and Japan. The EU has 143 GIs recognized in Canada, and Japan acknowledges 71 EU GIs. Over 4,500 product names are protected in the EU for foods, wine, and spirits. The EU's GI program is a concern for some in the U.S. Congress, especially those in the dairy industry. There are worries about EU GI protections creating trade barriers. A study predicts a decline in U.S. cheese exports due to restrictions on generic terms like parmesan and feta. Some U.S. agricultural groups are working on a similar system to promote American agricultural products. The American Origin Products Association represents U.S. producers of various products and aims to create a list of qualified U.S. distinctive product names corresponding to Geographical Indications (GIs). GIs are included in the current U.S. trade agenda, with the proposed USMCA protecting common names and limiting new GI registrations. There is a side letter in USMCA between the U.S. and Mexico regarding 33 cheese names. GIs have been a contentious issue in U.S.-EU trade negotiations, and the U.S. is working to advance its market access interests and address GI-related trade initiatives. The American Origin Products Association aims to protect U.S. producers' interests in foreign markets by addressing the EU's Geographical Indications (GIs) agenda, which they believe undermines U.S. trademarks and market access for American-made goods. The U.S. has expressed concerns about the EU's GI protections and is negotiating on GIs in trade agreements with the EU and Japan. Additionally, the U.S. embargo on trade with Cuba dates back to 1962, with some easing of sanctions in 2000 for agricultural exports. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 partially eased restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. Export licenses are allowed for one year, but without U.S. government assistance or financing. Transactions must be on a cash-in-advance basis or with financing from third countries. Cuba received nearly $5.7 billion in U.S. agricultural products from FY2001 to FY2018, with exports peaking at $658 million in FY2008. Since FY2008, U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba have declined, with shipments amounting to $230 million in FY2018. The decline is attributed to a decrease in bulk commodity exports and favorable credit terms offered by competitors. Lifting U.S. restrictions on travel and capital flow to Cuba, along with enabling USDA market development and credit guarantee programs, could help the U.S. recapture its market share in Cuba. The 2016 USITC report highlighted that Cuba imports 70%-80% of its food needs, totaling around $2 billion annually. Removing remaining U.S. trade restrictions could boost U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba by up to $800 million within five years. Key products like corn, wheat, rice, and dairy items could see significant export growth. Prohibitions on credit for food sales and travel restrictions are seen as barriers to increasing U.S. farm exports to Cuba. President Obama announced a shift towards engagement with Cuba in December 2014, moving away from a sanctions-based policy. While he acknowledged that he couldn't lift the embargo due to legal constraints, negotiations would be needed for Cuba to export sugar to the U.S. market. Agricultural interests in Florida are concerned about potential competition and invasive pests from Cuba, which could develop advantages in citrus, tropical fruit, vegetables, plants, and cut flowers. The embargo on Cuba cannot be lifted due to legal constraints outlined in various statutes, including the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The Trump Administration imposed new sanctions in 2017, restricting transactions with Cuban military-controlled companies and limiting individual travel. Lawsuits were permitted against Cuban entities linked to the military for trafficking confiscated property in 2019. The 2018 farm bill allows funding for U.S. agricultural export promotion programs in Cuba. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free tariff treatment for certain products from developing countries, with U.S. agricultural imports under GSP totaling $2.4 billion in 2018. Leading agricultural imports include processed foods and beverages. For more information on U.S. agricultural trade with Cuba and U.S. policy toward Cuba, refer to CRS reports R44119 and R44822, respectively. In 2018, the six leading GSP countries accounted for nearly 70% of all GSP-eligible U.S. agricultural imports, including processed foods, beverages, fruits, vegetables, sugar, and olive oil. The GSP program has been extended through short-term extensions, with the latest one making technical modifications and requiring annual reports on eligibility criteria. Members of Congress have differing views on the limits of GSP eligibility. In 2018, the GSP program faced scrutiny over country eligibility criteria. Some countries like Russia, Seychelles, Uruguay, and Venezuela were graduated out due to becoming \"high income\" countries. Argentina's eligibility was suspended but later reinstated. USTR initiated actions to review specific country practices and compliance under the program. Some countries under review are actively exporting to the United States. Some countries subject to USTR's review, like India, Indonesia, and Turkey, are actively exporting to the United States under GSP, accounting for $800 million in 2018. The Trade Policy Staff Committee annually reviews and revises eligible products based on petitions. Opinions within the U.S. agricultural industry on the program are mixed. USTR initiated its annual GSP product and country review in March 2019, intending to terminate GSP designations for Turkey and India due to non-compliance with eligibility criteria. This could escalate trade tensions and impact future trade relations and U.S. agricultural exports. Some in Congress oppose the termination of India's GSP beneficiary status. Terminating India's and Turkey's GSP status could have adverse effects, according to a survey by the Coalition for GSP. The potential termination of India's and Turkey's GSP beneficiary status could harm U.S. businesses, including food and agricultural companies, by leading to higher tariffs on imported products. The EU is a significant market for U.S. agricultural exports, with tree nuts, soybeans, and alcoholic beverages being top exports. The EU also supplies the U.S. with agricultural products, with processed goods like wine, beer, essential oils, and cheese being top imports. The U.S. agricultural trade deficit with the EU was $11 billion in FY2018 and is projected to be $10.6 billion in FY2019. The EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. products in response to Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. These tariffs affect about $1 billion in U.S. agricultural exports to the EU. The Trump Administration and the EC formed a working group to reduce transatlantic trade barriers, including tariffs. The U.S. has lower agricultural tariffs than the EU, but faces issues with restrictive TRQs on EU imports. Obama Administration also engaged in trade negotiations with the EU. The Obama Administration negotiated with the EU under the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) to reach a comprehensive agreement within two years. Negotiations were paused in October 2016 to evaluate progress, with disputes over food safety, public health, and IPR for agricultural products. Contentious issues included delays in biotech product reviews, growth hormone bans in beef production, and restrictions on certain treatments affecting U.S. exports. The U.S. faces challenges in exporting meat, poultry, processed foods, animal products, and dairy to the EU due to regulations on antimicrobial treatments, certification requirements, and labeling standards. USTR announced negotiating objectives for a U.S.-EU trade agreement in January 2019, focusing on agricultural policies and non-tariff measures. The U.S. faces challenges in exporting agricultural products to the EU due to regulatory barriers. Key U.S. objectives in trade negotiations with the EU include harmonizing regulatory processes, addressing SPS standards, protecting generic terms, and including agriculture in the negotiating mandate. Members of Congress support including agriculture in the negotiations and oppose the EU's exclusion of agricultural policies in their mandate. The EU is planning a limited negotiation that excludes agricultural products, which has been objected to by bipartisan members of Congress. The EU's negotiating mandate aims for a trade agreement focused on eliminating tariffs for industrial goods only. Additionally, the EU has taken steps to prevent escalating agricultural trade tensions with the U.S. The EU is planning a limited negotiation excluding agricultural products, objected by bipartisan members of Congress. The EU aims for a trade agreement focused on eliminating tariffs for industrial goods. The EU has taken steps to prevent escalating agricultural trade tensions with the U.S. The U.S. increased imports of soybeans for biofuels and proposed lifting a ban on certain American grapes in EU wine production. The EU announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. food products due to \"unlawful subsidies given\" to Boeing. In 2018, the U.S. concluded an injury investigation on ripe olives imported from Spain, imposing dumping margins on Spanish ripe olives. In July, USITC found U.S. producers were harmed by Spanish ripe olive imports, leading to AD and CVD duty orders effective from August 1, 2018. The EU challenged these duties at the WTO, with the U.S. planning a strong defense. Spanish olive industry suffered $27 million in lost exports due to these duties. The United States and the EU are in a trade dispute over the EU's ban on hormone-treated meat. The EU restricts livestock production by limiting natural hormones to therapeutic use, banning synthetic hormones, and prohibiting imports of hormone-treated animals. The US imposed retaliatory tariffs in 1999, leading to ongoing disagreements on legal, procedural, and scientific issues regarding the safety of hormone-treated beef. Many in the US view the EU's actions as protectionism through SPS measures and non-tariff barriers. In January 2009, USTR announced changes to EU products subject to increased tariffs, leading to an \"escalation\" of the dispute. In May 2009, the US and EU signed a memorandum of understanding, phasing in changes and suspending retaliatory tariffs. The EU granted market access to US beef without growth promotants as part of its HQB TRQ. The EU's HQB quota is currently set at 45,000 MT annually. The EU's HQB quota is 45,000 MT annually with a 20% customs tariff. U.S. beef producers face limitations as other countries fill most of the quota. USTR proposed retaliatory tariffs in 2016 but has not imposed them yet. The EU maintains bans on meat with hormones and growth promotants. The United States seeks a U.S.-specific allocation of the EU's HQB import quota, which could provide additional market access for U.S. beef produced without hormones. In late 2018, the EU agreed to review and renegotiate the quota with the U.S., with an expected implementation in early 2019. In March 2019, reports indicated an \"agreement in principle\" between the U.S. and EU for reallocating the HQB quota, potentially granting the U.S. a share of the EU's annual quota. In January 2009, the U.S. escalated a dispute with the EU over imports of U.S. poultry treated with pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs). The EU prohibits PRTs and the importation of poultry treated with them, citing stricter production rules for reducing contamination. EU consumer groups argue that PRTs compensate for poor hygiene in the supply chain. The United States requested WTO consultations with the EU regarding the use of pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs) on poultry. A WTO panel was established in 2009, but the case has not progressed. In 2013, the USDA applied for approval of peroxyacetic acid as a PRT for poultry, which the EU initially considered but later withdrew due to concerns about its effectiveness. Meanwhile, lactic acid was approved for reducing pathogens on beef in 2011, and the EU lifted its ban on lactic acid in beef PRTs in 2013. In 2017, the National Pork Producers Council applied for approval of organic lactic and acetic acid for use on pork carcasses. EFSA's panel report in October 2018 stated that the treatments are safe if they comply with EU specifications and are effective compared to untreated meat. The US considers PRTs crucial for meat safety but has not reached an agreement with the EU on veterinary equivalency issues. The EU and the US have disagreements on veterinary equivalency issues, particularly regarding substances used to remove contamination from animal products. In response to a new EU regulation, the USDA's APHIS raised concerns about requirements for gelatin and collagen exports to the EU for human consumption. The US exported over $199 million worth of raw materials for gelatin and collagen production to the EU in FY2018. APHIS and industry groups objected to the new EU requirement, set to be enforceable from December 14, 2019. U.S. animal byproduct exports to the EU adhere to regulations established in 2011, allowing APHIS to make changes to the list of eligible U.S. animal products. The new EU regulation requires all U.S. animal byproduct exporters to register their establishments in the EU Trade Control Expert System (TRACES), which APHIS finds cumbersome and potentially trade-impeding. Currently, only U.S. meat overseen by FSIS is recognized by the EU, leading to delays in adding non-FSIS overseen facilities to TRACES. The new EU regulation requires U.S. animal byproduct exporters to register on TRACES. Some raw materials may come from FSIS-inspected establishments, but processed products and animal feeds may be overseen by other federal agencies. The proposed EU regulation would allow more facilities to be listed on TRACES. U.S. trade associations argue that the EU's certificate requirements are not in line with Codex Alimentarius guidelines. APHIS submitted comments to the WTO regarding the EU's restrictive requirements on U.S. hides and skins exports for gelatin and collagen production. They request a delay in implementation to allow for preparation and clarification. U.S. livestock and product exports totaled $29.6 billion in 2018, supporting domestic prices, while imports help meet consumer demand. In 2019, the USDA forecasts that exports of meat and poultry products will represent about 17% of U.S. domestic production. Foreign countries periodically impose export bans on U.S. meat products in response to animal disease outbreaks, causing disruptions for livestock producers and exporters. These bans vary in terms of duration and scope, impacting the industry. In 2003, exports were affected by the discovery of mad cow disease. An outbreak of avian influenza in 2014-2015 led to export bans on poultry products by over 30 countries. The World Organization for Animal Health has trade protocols for disease outbreaks in exporting countries. The US is considered at \"negligible risk\" for BSE, and total export bans are not usually recommended for disease outbreaks. The U.S. has strong surveillance and safeguard systems in place for HPAI outbreaks. Foreign markets have imposed various restrictions on U.S. beef and poultry exports in response to disease outbreaks, with some countries implementing total bans while others restrict imports from affected regions. China lifted its ban on U.S. beef exports in 2017 with an age restriction requirement. China lifted the ban on U.S. beef in 2017 but restricts imports to cattle under 30 months of age. U.S. exporters must participate in the USDA export verification program. China continues to ban U.S. poultry meat due to the HPAI outbreak and does not accept regionalization. In 2018, the United States and South Korea agreed to apply export bans only to areas affected by animal disease outbreaks, rather than nationwide. Currently, 33 countries can export meat and poultry to the U.S. Before authorizing imports, APHIS assesses foreign animal diseases' risk, while FSIS ensures equivalent sanitation levels in foreign inspection systems. Foreign governments provide documentation on their inspection systems, and FSIS conducts onsite audits. FSIS also verifies equivalency and audits approved countries periodically. In 2013, China's poultry processing inspection system was deemed equivalent to the U.S. system, allowing China to export cooked poultry sourced from the U.S. or eligible countries. In 2016, FSIS recommended verifying equivalency for China's poultry slaughter inspection system. In 2017, an audit confirmed China's poultry processing system remained equivalent. USDA has yet to issue a final rule on China's poultry slaughter system, following a process that began in 2005 when China requested evaluation. In response to concerns about China's food safety record, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 prohibits USDA from using funds to purchase Chinese poultry products for feeding programs. The FY2019 appropriations act prohibits USDA from finalizing the proposed rule to allow the importation of slaughtered Chinese poultry due to concerns about food safety. China would only be allowed to send cooked/processed products to the US because of animal disease restrictions. The US restricts imports from countries with highly infectious animal diseases to protect its herds, such as prohibiting fresh beef imports from Brazil and Argentina due to foot-and-mouth disease. Brazil and Argentina have faced restrictions due to foot-and-mouth disease. U.S. beef imports from these countries have been limited to fully cooked/processed products. Argentina was allowed to export fresh beef to the U.S. from 1997 to 2001, but exports were halted after an FMD outbreak. In 2013 and 2014, rules were proposed to allow fresh beef imports from certain regions in Brazil and Argentina. In 2015, final rules were released to permit fresh beef imports from these regions. USDA risk assessments determined that fresh beef could be safely imported without jeopardizing the U.S.'s FMD-free status. Some stakeholders in the livestock industry oppose allowing fresh beef from Brazil and Argentina due to concerns about foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). FMD was eradicated in the United States in 1929, and reintroducing the disease could be economically devastating. In 2015, Brazil was approved to ship fresh beef to the U.S., but imports were suspended in 2017 due to issues with Brazilian beef inspection. The United States continues to suspend fresh beef imports from Brazil due to inspection problems. Argentina was approved to export fresh beef to the U.S. again in November 2018. President Trump and President Bolsonaro are working to resume U.S. beef imports from Brazil. President Trump and President Bolsonaro issued a joint statement during President Bolsonaro's March 2019 visit, agreeing to resume U.S. beef imports from Brazil pending an audit of Brazil's beef inspection system. The United States imported fresh beef from Argentina in December 2018, utilizing Argentina's duty-free TRQ allotment. Ractopamine, an animal drug approved in the U.S. and other countries, is used to increase animal weight gain and meat yield. The Codex standards organization sets guidelines for ractopamine residue levels in beef and pork, but major markets like the EU, China, Taiwan, and Thailand restrict U.S. meat exports with ractopamine. To overcome these restrictions, U.S. meat can be exported if raised without ractopamine and certified through the USDA's Never Fed Beta Agonists Program, but this incurs additional certification and testing costs, impacting competitiveness. In 2009, USDA implemented country-of-origin labeling (COOL) for various food products. Canada and Mexico challenged U.S. COOL in the WTO in 2009, arguing that it violated WTO trade commitments. The WTO found that COOL treated imported livestock less favorably than U.S. livestock. The WTO ruled that U.S. COOL regulations discriminated against imported livestock, leading to a trade dispute with Canada and Mexico. In response, Congress repealed COOL requirements for beef and pork, settling the dispute. Following the repeal of COOL for beef and pork, some state legislatures have considered bills for COOL on meat sold within the state. Lawsuits were filed to restore COOL for beef and pork, but a district court ruled in favor of USDA due to missed statute of limitations and regulations aligning with Congress's intent. The American Grassfed Association and Competitive Markets petitioned FSIS to change the \"Product of USA\" label due to foreign meat being sold as domestic. The WTO oversees trade rules and the United States, as a member, must abide by its regulations. The United States faces uncertainty in complying with WTO rules and spending limits for domestic support programs due to farm program changes in the 2018 farm bill and the implementation of the MFP direct payment program in response to trade retaliation. Non-compliance could occur if market prices for major commodity crops weaken, leading to higher farm program payments than projected by USDA. The 2018 farm bill shifts farm safety net outlays away from decoupled programs. The 2018 farm bill shifted farm safety net outlays towards coupled programs, including the addition of the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) and raising support levels for existing programs. Direct farm support payments can occur under various revenue-support programs and disaster assistance programs. The 2018 farm bill introduced new programs like the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) and increased support levels for existing programs. Direct farm support payments can be received through revenue-support programs like the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program and disaster assistance programs such as Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), Tree Assistance Program (TAP), and Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP). MAL, LIP, TAP, and ELAP payments are now excluded from individual payment limits, allowing for potentially unlimited USDA farm support outlays. The 2018 farm bill increased support levels for dairy producers through the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program and for various program crops. Coupled payments like DMC payments are tied to historical production bases and can influence producer production choices towards activities with higher support payments. Higher support levels can lead to increased payments during market downturns, but these payments count against spending limits and may result in surplus production moving into international markets. The ARC and PLC direct payment programs in the 2018 farm bill are partially decoupled from producer behavior, with payments made to historical base acres. These programs are considered non-product specific and do not count against WTO spending limits. Other direct support programs like MAL, DMC, LFP, LIP, TAP, and ELAP count against the United States' annual market-distorting payment limit. CGCS and MFP are special cases that have not been notified for spending yet. The United States has not notified spending under CGCS and MFP to the WTO, so their exact classification is unknown. Payments under these programs could be considered market-distorting and subject to potential WTO challenge. MFP was stated to be a one-time assistance by Secretary Perdue. Actual outlays for CGCS were $326 million in 2016 and $216 million in 2018, while MFP outlays were estimated at $5.2 billion in 2018 and $3.5 billion in 2019. The U.S. sugar program provides indirect price support via MAL loans to processors. USDA provides indirect price support to processors through MAL loans at fixed prices, with the sugar program's implicit cost at $1.5 billion in 2015. The federally subsidized crop insurance program remains unchanged, with annual premium subsidies averaging $6.4 billion. Conservation program payments are considered non-market distorting \"green box\" payments. Studies suggest U.S. program spending may exceed the $19.1 billion limit. The United States has a significant role in international agricultural markets, making any distortion from U.S. policy visible and vulnerable to challenge under WTO rules. The U.S. has blocked the appointment of new DSU Appellate Body jurists since 2017, limiting the system's ability to hear dispute cases. The United States has brought 46 cases on agriculture to the WTO since 1995, with 34 cases decided in its favor. The most recent ruling favored the U.S. against China. However, pending U.S. cases may be stalled if new members are not appointed to the WTO Appellate Body. The USTR filed a settlement case at the WTO against China's domestic support policies for agriculture, alleging violations of WTO rules. USTR claimed China's policies distorted international trade in wheat, rice, and corn, with support payments exceeding WTO limits. A dispute settlement panel was established in January 2017 to examine China's support levels for these crops, with USTR arguing that China's support for rice, wheat, and corn exceeded its WTO commitments by nearly $100 million from 2012 to 2015. China's domestic support policies for agriculture, including market price support and producer payments, exceeded WTO limits, leading to a dispute settlement panel examining China's support levels for wheat, rice, and corn. USTR argued that China underreported subsidies on domestic production, creating an unfair advantage for Chinese farmers. The USTR argued that China's domestic support policies for agriculture exceeded WTO limits, with discrepancies in subsidy reporting and reference price calculations for wheat, rice, and corn. The WTO dispute settlement body found China non-compliant with its commitments due to exceeding support limits for wheat and rice between 2012 and 2015. The WTO panel disagreed with China's methodology for calculating domestic support, recommending changes for compliance with WTO commitments. China made adjustments to its corn price calculations in 2015, leading to less market distortion. China decided not to appeal the WTO ruling, and the USTR filed another dispute against China for its administration of TRQs for wheat, rice, and corn. The USTR filed a dispute against China for unclear administration of TRQs for wheat, rice, and corn, undermining U.S. exports. China's TRQ application criteria and procedures were unclear, and it did not provide meaningful information on TRQ administration despite WTO commitments. China agreed to create TRQs for wheat, rice, and corn upon joining the WTO in 2001, with lower within-quota tariff rates and higher over-quota rates. China's TRQs for wheat, rice, and corn have low within-quota tariffs at 1%, with over-quota tariffs set at 65%. Despite lower import prices, China's TRQ administration restricts imports and lacks transparency. WTO ruled in favor of the U.S., stating that China's TRQ administration was inconsistent with WTO obligations. The WTO recommends that China align its TRQ administration with its obligations, while the United States challenges India's domestic support for rice, wheat, cotton, and sugar at the WTO for exceeding allowable levels. The United States challenged India for violating its WTO commitments by underreporting market price support for various pulses. The challenge was raised at WTO meetings in May 2018, November 2018, and February 2019 to alert India and other members of the concerns. The United States has raised concerns at the WTO about India's underreporting of domestic agricultural subsidies, intending to challenge this at future meetings and potentially through the dispute settlement mechanism."
