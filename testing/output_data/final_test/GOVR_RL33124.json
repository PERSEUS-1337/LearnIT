The hurricanes led to the closure of refining capacity in Louisiana and Alabama. Despite the challenges, most production and refining capacity have been restored, with some units still ramping up. Heroic recovery efforts at refineries and increased imports of refined products met a warm heating season's needs and kept gasoline supplies flowing without isolated run-outs. About 400,000 bd of crude oil from the outer continental shelf (OCS) and Louisiana state lands is currently shut in, equivalent to 5% of total U.S. petroleum demand. Imported crude has kept stocks at adequate levels, with refined product supplies initially made up from the release of 30 million barrels of gasoline, middle distillate, and other products from strategic reserves of OECD member nations. Supply appears to have matched demand, as prices fell through late 2005 and early 2006. Supply appears to have matched demand, as prices fell through late 2005 and early 2006. Factors affecting fuel demand include prices and winter weather conditions. The U.S. refining rate and availability of commercial refined products impact the supply side. The EPA granted waivers for gasoline specifications to ease supply. Natural gas supply is mostly domestic, with limited import opportunities. Production issues in the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana have led to shutdowns, affecting nearly 10% of nationwide consumption. Gas production from Louisiana state lands is reduced, with 3% shut-in. Despite this, gas is still being stored, with 75 bcf added in the week ending October 14. Wellhead prices have doubled since last summer, and concerns for cold weather impact demand. Gulf of Mexico production issues may lead to no import safety-valve. In the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Gulf of Mexico oil production was severely impacted, with 111 production platforms destroyed and 52 seriously damaged. Nearly 1.6 mbd of crude oil production was halted, equivalent to 7.6% of U.S. oil consumption. Despite efforts to restore power in Texas, Louisiana still faces widespread outages, limiting oil production recovery. The destruction of drilling rigs will further constrain future production from new wells. Oil production has begun to resume in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Katrina, with output reaching 600,000 bd on October 11. However, 60% of Gulf oil remains shut in, and over 50 million barrels of oil output have been lost since the shutdowns began on August 26. The amount of lost output continues to mount, with about 1 mbd of capacity still shut in. While there has been a 300,000 bd increase in oil output between October 1 and October 7, a full assessment of damage to facilities has not been completed. It is uncertain if production is steadily coming back, as currently shut-in output presents significant challenges at production platforms, transport infrastructure, and coastal processing facilities. Oil production is gradually resuming in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Katrina, with output reaching 600,000 bd on October 11. However, 60% of Gulf oil remains shut in, and over 50 million barrels of oil output have been lost since the shutdowns began on August 26. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates show that shut-in production will be restored, with amounts likely averaging 930,000 bd in October, 724,000 bd in November, and 517,000 bd in December. Additionally, the operation of important crude oil pipelines like CAPLINE and Sun Pipeline were impeded, affecting crude supply to refiners in the central part of the nation. Some pipelines transporting refined products also experienced service outages or throughput reductions. The Colonial Pipeline, a key source of fuel supply, experienced service disruptions due to hurricanes, leading to high prices in areas like Maryland and Washington, D.C. However, full capacity has been restored, and gasoline prices are returning to normal. Storm-damaged ports in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are affecting over 12% of petroleum consumption, with the Louisiana Offshore Port (LOOP) operating at full capacity before being shut down as a precaution. The LOOP was operating at full capacity before being shut down as a precautionary measure in anticipation of Hurricane Rita. It is now reportedly operating at 100% capacity, having escaped more damage from the storm. Other Gulf Coast ports have resumed operations, except for Port Arthur which can only accept barge traffic during daylight hours. Refining capacity was significantly impacted by the hurricanes, but most facilities are now operating or in the start-up process. Louisiana plants with substantial damage are expected to be down for an extended period, with a combined capacity of 554,000 bd. An additional 722,000 bd of capacity shuttered in the wake of Hurricane Rita remains offline, totaling 1.3 mbd down due to both hurricanes. This represents nearly 8% of national capacity, potentially causing supply problems. Secretary of Energy Bodman announced the authorization of Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) crude oil releases, with seven refiners requesting loans totaling over 13 million barrels. The release of SPR oil and the coordinated drawdown of 30 million barrels of crude and refined products calmed markets by early September. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) released 30 million barrels of crude and refined products to calm markets by early September. The International Energy Agency (IEA) member countries are required to hold 90 days of net imports, met with a combination of crude and refined products. IEA released 2 million barrels daily, with nearly all 30 million barrels of products already released. Gasoline and heating oil imports are still in transit to the United States. IEA Executive Director Claude Mandil mentioned the need to monitor the situation due to potential oil and product shortages. The recent import statistics show a continued flow of refined products, with loans of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve totaling 13.2 million barrels. The United States offered 30 million barrels of SPR crude for sale as part of a coordinated stock drawdown by the International Energy Agency. DOE announced the sale of 10.8 million barrels of sweet crude and 200,000 barrels of sour at prices ranging from $59.76 to $66.46. Bids for an additional 8.2 million barrels were rejected. Some companies awarded loans may not borrow the full volume of crude they asked for. Demand for refined products is stronger than crude due to hurricane-related refinery shutdowns. Despite obstacles, crude and refined product inventories remain stable. Stock changes for total petroleum, crude oil, gasoline, and distillate fuel oil are shown in Table 1. Table 1 shows declines in major petroleum inventories since Hurricane Katrina, except for gasoline. Total stocks have decreased by about 750,000 barrels. The industry debates the interpretation of these figures and the minimum operational inventory levels. The Weekly Petroleum Status Report no longer references MOI due to differing views within the industry. Industry improvements in inventory management and logistics have led to recommendations for lower inventory levels. The industry recommended lower inventory levels than previously used by the DOE. A DOE-industry dialogue in 2004 failed to agree on minimum operational inventory (MOI) levels. Gasoline and distillates inventory levels were 185 million barrels and 85 million barrels respectively. Despite tight inventory levels, gasoline prices have fallen from a peak of $3.06 to $2.70 in mid-October. Gasoline and distillates prices have steadily declined, with wholesale prices falling to $2.70 in mid-October. Demand for gasoline and distillates is lower than the year-ago period, with distillate stocks well above the old MOI level. Wholesale trading on the NYMEX shows distillates declining to $1.85 per gallon in mid-October, indicating few concerns for the upcoming heating season. Residential heating oil price is $2.65 per gallon, down 4.4 cents from the previous update. The residential heating oil price for October 10 is $2.65 per gallon, down 4.4 cents from the previous week. EIA forecasts higher heating costs this winter, with heating oil expected to cost $2.54 per gallon. Demand for the fourth quarter of 2005 in the United States has been reduced by 900,000 bd, with uncertainties on how this will impact fuel supply as refineries recover from hurricanes. On August 31, 2005, EPA temporarily waived gasoline and diesel fuel standards nationwide to increase fuel supplies. The waiver allowed for the sale of gasoline produced for northern states in the South and \"winter\" gasoline in summer months. EPA also waived national sulfur standards for diesel fuel, allowing non-road fuel to be used in highway vehicles until September 15. Since August 31, 2005, EPA has issued waivers for fuel standards to increase supplies, allowing non-road fuel to be used in highway vehicles. Waivers have been issued on a case-by-case basis for specific standards and fuel supply issues, with most expiring by the end of October. Natural gas production in the federal offshore Gulf of Mexico has been significantly impacted since Katrina, with 52% of output shut in as of October 12, reducing the nation's total gas supply by about 10%. Louisiana state lands also experienced interruptions in natural gas production. Natural gas production in Louisiana state lands was interrupted by hurricanes, with 31% of production restored. 1.5 bcfpd of gas remains offline in the coastal region. The total lost gas output from state and federal lands is 6.7 bcfpd, equivalent to 11% of the country's daily consumption. Recovery of gas production depends on the return of transport facilities, but repairs to damaged infrastructure could cause delays. Pipeline companies have not provided much information on the status of their facilities. The status of pipelines and major facilities in Louisiana remains uncertain, with 15 gas processing plants offline. These plants have a combined capacity of 9.5 billion cubic feet and play a crucial role in treating gas for transport. However, updates from DOE and Louisiana Department of Natural Resources do not provide a comprehensive picture of gas flow and capacity. Henry Hub, a key nodal point on the Sabine Pipeline, is also affected, reducing its capacity to move 1.8 bcfpd. The Sabine Pipeline, a crucial point for NYMEX contracts, went out of service after Rita, causing a delay in trades and physical deliveries. Uncertainty remains about the impact of limited pipeline compression on gas transportation and trading. Spot gas prices reflect the lack of information on gas delivery infrastructure conditions. Spot gas prices have been on the rise since the beginning of 2005, with wellhead prices for natural gas increasing significantly. Prices averaged $6.00 per million Btu's in the first months of the year, but rose to $9.50 in September. Trading on the NYMEX for Henry Hub has been between $13 and $14 per million Btu's. EIA forecasts that wellhead prices will average $11.40 this heating season under normal weather conditions. Residential consumers' rates also include additional charges from long-distance pipeline tariffs and local distribution utilities. The delivered residential natural gas cost during the winter of 2004-2005 was $11.13 per million Btu's. EIA projects a range of $15.32 to $16.68 for this winter, with prices expected to be about 48% higher than last winter. Natural gas demand is highest in winter, with gas stored during non-peak months to meet peak demand. Current inventory is around 3.0 trillion cubic feet, close to the average stock level of the past five years. 75 bcf were added to storage recently, indicating gas availability in the pipeline system. After recent additions to storage, gas availability in the pipeline system is suggested. Despite power outages in Louisiana and Texas, progress has been made in restoring electricity to customers. In Texas, only 12,500 customers were without power in mid-October, while 129,300 lacked electric service in Louisiana."
