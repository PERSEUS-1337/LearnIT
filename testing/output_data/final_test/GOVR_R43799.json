The two principal Senate rules related to committees' activities are Rule XXV, which contains committees' jurisdictions, and Rule XXVI, which details committee procedures. Some committees specifically acknowledged the primacy of Senate rules in their own rules, including the Committees on Armed Services, Energy and Natural Resources, Foreign Relations, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Veterans' Affairs, and Indian Affairs. The primary legislative function of Senate committees is to evaluate bills and resolutions introduced by Senators and measures passed by the House.

Both Senate and House bills and joint resolutions follow this procedure. Rule XIV outlines the process for referring bills and joint resolutions to committee, requiring them to be read twice by title on different legislative days before referral. Senators can use this rule to prevent referral of a bill or joint resolution to committee by objecting after each of the two readings, placing it directly on the Senate Calendar for floor action. The majority leader or his designee can bypass committee referral of a bill by placing it on the calendar for Senate consideration. Committees may also hold legislation at the desk or place it on the calendar by unanimous consent. The Armed Services Committee directs the committee clerk to send referred measures to the appropriate executive department for a report, while the Intelligence Committee allows the chair or vice chair discretion in handling referrals. The Intelligence Committee's rule allows the chair or vice chair discretion in seeking executive comment and handling referrals for markups. Committees have specific procedures for marking up legislation, including notice of markup sessions and pre-markup submission of amendments. The chair's prerogatives in structuring the amendment process and obtaining agreements influence the conduct of markups. Committees follow practices and traditions for member or staff sessions, opening statements, and offering amendments unless unanimous consent or another agreement is reached for a variation. The Appropriations Committee's rules require subcommittees' bills and reports to be given to full committee members 36 hours before consideration. The Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee requires motions to proceed to be filed 48 hours in advance.

Senators can abstain from voting if there is a conflict of interest. Rules in various committees allow for different voting procedures, such as demanding a roll-call vote, reporting a measure without a recorded vote, and holding open a vote until midnight following consultation with the ranking minority member. The Environment and Public Works Committee allows members to record votes on the same day if not done by proxy, with results announced. The Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee disallows roll-call votes without a majority present.

The Intelligence Committee's rule states that committee decisions are by majority vote, while the Finance Committee chair can determine when a motion has been adequately debated. The committee rules allow the chair to determine the order of voting and entertain non-debatable motions to end debate.

Some committees required written requests for proxy votes, specifying the subject matter and desired vote. Budget Committee disallowed proxy votes during budget resolution deliberations. Many Senate committees allowed proxy votes by informed absent members, with written requests specifying the subject matter and desired vote. Proxies were kept in committee files along with the roll-call vote record. Committees had varying rules on proxy voting requirements in the 114th Congress. The Senate committees had different rules on proxy voting requirements in the 114th Congress, with some allowing proxy votes by informed absent members through written requests specifying the subject matter and desired vote.

In the 114th Congress, Senate committees had varying rules on proxy voting, with some allowing proxy requests to be conveyed orally or through personal instruction. Polling members for their votes was also a common practice, but the Senate does not accept committee reports based on polling results.

Polls required every member to be polled with two questions: agreement to poll the proposal and favor or oppose the proposal. The Budget Committee permitted polling on internal matters and steps in an investigation designated at a meeting. Polling required the chair to circulate polling sheets specifying the matter and time limit. The Budget Committee's rule allowed polling on internal matters and steps in an investigation designated at a meeting. Polling required the chair to circulate polling sheets to each committee member specifying the matter being polled and the time limit for completion. If a committee member requested, a matter would be held for a meeting rather than polled. The record of a poll would be kept confidential if the committee subsequently by majority vote in open session determined that the matter polled was one of the enumerated bases for closing a meeting. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee allows polling on internal matters, steps in an investigation, and other committee business. The chair or designated member can poll committee members, and if requested, a matter can be held for a meeting instead of being polled.

A report is an advocacy document for a measure or legislation reported by a committee, including explanatory information and analysis. Senate rules limit a single committee's authority to propose amendments outside its jurisdiction for bills referred to multiple committees. The Senate rule prohibits committees from considering proposed amendments outside their jurisdiction, with a point of order possible against such amendments.

If a measure's predominant subject matter is within another committee's jurisdiction, a point of order may result in its referral to the appropriate committee. The Appropriations Committee is also subject to related rules. The Appropriations Committee is prohibited from including new legislation or unauthorized restrictions in appropriations bills. If a point of order is sustained, the bill is sent back to the committee. The committee report must disclose any appropriations not in line with existing law or treaties.

This evaluation should include estimates on the number of individuals and businesses affected, economic impact, personal privacy implications, additional paperwork requirements, and reasons for impracticability if an evaluation is not provided. In the 112th Congress, the Senate added a new requirement for committee reports on public bills and joint resolutions. Reports must now include an evaluation and justification for any new presidentially appointed positions created by the legislation. Additionally, reports on bills proposing to amend or repeal a statute must contain an analysis of the changes, known as the Cordon Rule. The Cordon Rule requires committee reports on bills proposing to amend or repeal a statute to show text changes and comparisons. Committees can bypass this rule with a statement for expediting Senate business. Adhering to this rule during a committee vote prevents potential points of order against the measure. The clean-up rule allows committees to rectify voting errors that do not comply with Senate rules. Another rule prevents points of order against a measure if reporting conforms with specific requirements. Members can submit additional views within three days of a committee's approval of a measure. The Appropriations Committee is exempt from the rule of including supplemental, minority, and additional views in the committee report.

Committees are responsible for identifying these items in reported bills or joint resolutions. If a violation is found, the motion to proceed is suspended until compliance is met. The Senate rule requires Senators to provide written statements for congressionally directed spending items, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits in bills or joint resolutions. The statements must include details such as the Senator's name, intended beneficiaries, purpose of the item, and a certification of no pecuniary interest. Committees must make these certifications publicly available for inspection. The Senate rule requires committee chairs to promptly report approved measures and bring them to a vote.
