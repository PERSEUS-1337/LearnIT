    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act\". It includes findings related to the act. Congress finds that the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, authorized in 1978, contains diverse natural and cultural resources. Expanding the area would benefit urban communities, including those underrepresented in the National Park System. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is located within the Rim of the Valley Corridor. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory, located within the Rim of the Valley Corridor, has conducted activities such as rocket engine testing and research on fuels, propellants, nuclear power, and lasers, leading to releases of radioactive and hazardous substances into the environment that require cleanup. In 2010, cleanup orders were issued for contamination in soil at the laboratory, with expectations for a comparable cleanup to occur. Congress expects a cleanup on the remaining portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory to be protective of all allowable uses under Ventura County zoning and general plan designations as of December 7, 2016. SEC. 3. Boundary adjustment, land acquisition, and administration. Boundary Adjustment: The National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 is amended to change the boundary map of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to the Rim of the Valley Unit. This new unit is defined within the boundaries of the recreation area in California. The curr_chunk describes the definitions of utility facility and water resource facility within the recreation area. Utility facility includes electric substations, communication facilities, and related infrastructure. Water resource facility includes irrigation facilities, dams, flood control works, and water conservation structures. The curr_chunk lists various water conservation works and facilities such as debris protection, sediment sites, rain gauges, pumping facilities, conveyance systems, treatment facilities, aqueducts, canals, pipelines, wells, hydropower projects, transmission facilities, and ancillary facilities. The curr_chunk discusses the boundary revision and administration of the Rim of the Valley Unit within the recreation area, under the management of the Secretary. The Secretary may acquire non-Federal land within the Unit through exchange, donation, or purchase from a willing seller, without using eminent domain. Activities or land uses outside the Unit's boundaries do not affect those within. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory will not be considered for inclusion in the Unit until soil cleanup is completed in compliance with specified standards. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory must have all soil contamination cleaned up to background levels and comparable cleanup for areas not covered by previous orders. This must meet Ventura County's zoning and general plan standards as of December 7, 2016. The provision modifies laws regarding public access to non-Federal land, liability of private property owners, creation of protective perimeters, ownership rights of non-Federal land, and participation of local governments in programs administered by the Secretary. The provision in the current text chunk addresses the alteration or diminishment of rights, responsibilities, and authorities of states and local agencies under existing laws. It also prohibits the use or trespass on non-Federal land without the owner's consent, particularly affecting water resource and utility facilities. The text chunk discusses the regulations for utility and water resource facilities to avoid interference with land rights and access to water facilities. The regulations require activities to avoid or reduce impact on Unit resources."
