    "content": "Legislative interest in patent reform was evident in previous sessions of Congress, with bills proposing changes to various aspects of patent law. The 111th Congress considered amendments related to compensatory damages, enhanced damages for willful infringement, venue selection for patent suits, and appeals of patent interpretations. Previous Congresses also discussed modifications to inequitable conduct doctrine. While Congress has scrutinized the patent system, courts have also been active in altering key patent law principles. The judiciary has made significant changes to patent law principles, with some overlapping topics being considered by Congress. For instance, the Supreme Court's decision in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange regarding injunctive relief led experts to believe that legislative reform in this area was unnecessary. Recent judicial opinions on patent law topics are relevant for understanding current legislative proposals and addressing concerns raised by observers. This report reviews the relationship between Congress and the courts in patent reform, comparing their institutional capabilities. It discusses topics considered by both branches, contrasts current law with past reform proposals, and highlights the interaction between legislative, administrative, and judicial actors in the patent system. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to promote innovation by granting inventors exclusive rights to their discoveries through the patent system. The Patent Act of 1952 allows inventors to apply for patents through the USPTO, where examiners determine if the invention meets patent standards. Inventions must be novel and different from existing knowledge to be patentable. An invention must be nonobvious, useful, and fully disclosed in a patent application to be considered for a patent by the USPTO. The invention must provide a tangible benefit, be operable, and not obvious to a person with ordinary skill in the relevant field. The application must enable others to make and use the invention without undue experimentation. The USPTO requires a patent application to disclose the best mode of practicing the invention. If a patent is granted, the owner has the right to exclude others from using the invention for up to 20 years. Infringers may be liable for damages and may be enjoined from further infringement. Patent rights require enforcement through litigation in federal courts. Accused infringers can challenge a patent's validity. The Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review. Various \"Patent Reform Act\" bills have been proposed since 2005, each suggesting different changes to the patent system. Proposed patent reform legislation has not been enacted yet, with various suggested reforms including a shift to a first-inventor-to-file system, changes to patent damages law, and venue modifications for patent cases. While Congress considers these reforms, courts have also made significant changes to patent law through their decisions, leading to their own form of patent reform. The courts have reviewed various patent doctrines under legislative scrutiny, including injunction availability, venue selection, damages assessment, willful infringement standards, extraterritorial enforcement, and patents for tax planning methods. Section 283 of the Patent Act allows courts to grant injunctions to prevent patent violations. The Federal Circuit historically granted injunctions to patent owners post-infringement litigation, except in cases of public necessity. Injunctions bar infringers from using patented inventions until expiration. Critics viewed this practice as favoring patent trolls who acquire patents for enforcement rather than innovation. Manufacturers feared this gave non-manufacturing entities excessive power in patent licensing. The 109th Congress considered amending the Patent Act to address concerns about non-manufacturing entities having too much leverage in patent licensing negotiations. A proposal in the Patent Reform Act of 2005 aimed to require courts to consider fairness in remedies. Despite legislative discussions, the judiciary made rulings on injunctions, including one in the BlackBerry patent litigation case. The BlackBerry patent litigation case resulted in a settlement to prevent service interruption. The discussion over injunctions in patent cases increased, especially since NTP did not commercialize the patented invention. The Supreme Court's decision in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C. addressed injunctive relief for patents involving a system for selling goods through an electronic network. MercExchange, the patent proprietor, only licenses its patented technology. The Federal Circuit ruled that MercExchange was entitled to an injunction against eBay for patent infringement, despite MercExchange only licensing its patented technology to others. The court emphasized that the right to exclude in a patent is a fundamental property concept, and generally, a permanent injunction should be issued once infringement and validity are proven. The court acknowledged rare cases where an injunction may not be appropriate, such as when the patentee's failure to practice the invention hinders an important public need. The Federal Circuit ruled that MercExchange was entitled to an injunction against eBay for patent infringement, emphasizing the right to exclude in a patent as a fundamental property concept. The court acknowledged rare cases where an injunction may not be appropriate, such as when the patentee's failure to practice the invention hinders an important public need. However, the Supreme Court found that lower courts had not followed the correct rules in deciding on injunctions for patent infringement cases. The Supreme Court directed lower courts to consider four traditional factors for deciding on injunctions in patent infringement cases: irreparable injury to the patent owner, availability of legal remedies, public interest, and balance of hardships. The Court remanded the case to the district court without expressing an opinion on the specific dispute. Some courts have since been hesitant to issue injunctions against infringers following the eBay decision. Some courts have been hesitant to issue injunctions against adjudicated infringers of valid patents following the eBay ruling. Opinions on the impact of the ruling on legislative reform of patent injunctions vary, with some believing that the need for legislation is renewed. However, others view eBay as a solution to the injunction problem in a favorable manner. Despite this, proposed reforms to injunction practice have not been incorporated into subsequent versions of the Patent Reform Act. Rooklidge and Barker believe that legislative efforts to reform injunctions are finished for now. Patent reform legislation includes proposed changes to venue rules in patent litigation, where venue is determined by the defendant's residence or where acts of infringement occur. The definition of \"reside\" for corporations changed in 1988. In 1988, Congress adopted a new definition of \"reside\" for corporate defendants in venue determination. The amendment has had significant consequences for corporate defendants in patent litigation, impacting how venue is determined under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(b). The venue statute for corporate defendants in patent litigation has essentially become superfluous, as the same standards governing personal jurisdiction now dictate appropriate venue. Some believe this liberal venue statute promotes forum shopping, with a notable \"magnet jurisdiction\" being the rural Eastern District of Texas. Justice John Marshall\u2014oversized share of intellectual property disputes. Local lawyers shifting to intellectual property law. Single appellate court for patent cases, Federal Circuit, minimizes forum shopping concerns. Certain district courts attract patent cases for expertise and timeliness. Federal Circuit addressed venue laws in In re TS Tech USA Corp. decision. Observers divided on need for legislative intervention. TS Tech decision resolved venue issues in patent infringement case, transferring litigation to Ohio from Eastern District of Texas. Federal Circuit emphasized factors over plaintiff's choice of venue. Some suggest legislative intervention may be needed to codify the ruling. The Federal Circuit found that the district court had not properly considered the cost of attendance for witnesses and inconvenience of evidence location in the venue decision. It noted that the alleged infringing products were sold nationwide, making the Eastern District of Texas no more connected to the case than any other venue. This ruling may lead to more frequent grants of venue transfer motions in patent cases. In the 111th Congress, various versions of the Patent Reform Act proposed changes to venue provisions for patent cases, including bills like H.R. 1260, S. 515, and S. 610. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted on S. 515 but none of the legislation was enacted. H.R. 1260 and S. 610 suggested venue based on defendant's principal place of business or acts of infringement. H.R. 1260 proposed venue based on defendant's principal place of business or acts of infringement, while S. 515 did not introduce new rules but allowed for transfer of cases to a more convenient venue. The introduction of the Patent Reform Act of 2005 proposed amendments to the damages provisions of the Patent Act, with differing views on the fairness of damages awards for patent infringement. Some believe current standards result in overcompensation, hindering technological innovation, while others argue that current case law appropriately assesses damages. Some believe that current case law adequately assesses damages for patent infringement, while others fear that proposed reforms may limit damages excessively, discouraging voluntary licensing and promoting infringement. Limited damage awards could hinder innovators from realizing the value of their inventions, a key goal of the patent system. The difficulty in determining appropriate damages in patent litigation is exacerbated by complex marketplace circumstances, where infringing products may contain additional elements beyond the patented invention. In patent litigation, courts may apply the \"entire market value rule\" to calculate damages based on the entire product if the patent-related feature drives consumer demand. Alternatively, damages can be based solely on the value of the patented feature through apportionment. Lucent Technologies' case against Gateway over the \"Day patent\" highlighted these principles. Lucent Technologies filed a lawsuit against Gateway, Inc. for infringing the Day patent with software from Microsoft Corporation pre-installed in Gateway computers. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, awarding Lucent $357,693,056.18 in damages for all three Microsoft products. Microsoft appealed the decision. The litigation in Lucent Technologies, Inc. v. Gateway, Inc. involved a lawsuit over patent infringement with Microsoft products. Senator Arlen Specter requested a delay in Senate action on the Patent Reform Act of 2009 until the Federal Circuit heard oral argument in the case. The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court's decision that the Day patent was valid and infringed. The Federal Circuit in Lucent Technologies, Inc. v. Gateway, Inc. upheld the lower court's determination that the Day patent was not invalid and infringed. The appellate court also overturned the jury's damages award as lacking substantial evidence, emphasizing the need for reliable evidence in patent trials. Lucent Technologies, Inc. v. Gateway, Inc. upheld the Day patent's validity and infringement. The damages award was overturned due to lack of substantial evidence in patent trials. Patent attorney Johnathan Tropp emphasized the responsibility of district courts to ensure appropriate damages verdicts based on substantial evidence. The Federal Circuit ruled that the entire market value rule did not apply, as the infringing use of the datepicker tool in Outlook was a small component of a larger software program. Lucent failed to prove that anyone bought Outlook because of the patented method. The Federal Circuit clarified that a reasonable royalty can be based on the entire commercial product's value, even if the patented invention is a small component. There is some disagreement on how damages should be calculated based on the infringing product's market value. In the 111th Congress, patent reform bills were introduced before the Lucent opinion, with H.R. 1260, S. 515, and S. 610 addressing monetary remedies in patent cases. Some believe that the Lucent decision showed Congress that damage reform is unnecessary. H.R. 1260 and S. 515 proposed methods for determining a \"reasonable royalty\" as the measure of damages. The patent reform bills introduced in the 111th Congress addressed monetary remedies in patent cases, with H.R. 1260 and S. 515 proposing methods for determining a \"reasonable royalty\" as the measure of damages. S. 610 allowed courts to consider relevant factors in determining a reasonable royalty, but did not expressly address apportionment and the entire market value rule. The patent statute allows for enhanced damages up to three times the amount found or assessed by the court, with the discretion of the trial judge. Enhanced damages are typically awarded in cases of willful infringement, where the infringer acted in wanton disregard of the patentee's rights. The willful infringement doctrine, as explained in Read Corp. v. Portec, Inc., involves determining the infringer's state of mind and their duty to respect patent rights. Critics argue that the possibility of trebled damages discourages individuals from reviewing patents. In 2007, the Federal Circuit made significant changes to the law of willful infringement, overturning two decades of precedent by removing the duty of due care for accused infringers. This decision came after critiques that fear of increased liability for willful infringement discouraged the dissemination of technical knowledge and challenged patents of dubious validity. Congress had considered legislative amendments to the law as early as 2005. The Seagate opinion changed the law of willful infringement by stating that accused infringers do not need to obtain an opinion of counsel. Willful infringement now requires a showing of objective recklessness, making the state of mind of the infringer irrelevant. Some believe this limits when courts will find infringement to be willful, while others think it will not change much in practice. Congressional reform may not be necessary according to some commentators. H.R. 1260 and S. 515 propose changes to the law of willful infringement, specifying conditions for finding willful infringement and stating that it cannot be determined before the patent is deemed valid, enforceable, and infringed. This language is not present in S. 610. U.S. patents typically only protect against acts within the United States. Section 271(f) of the Patent Act provides limited extraterritorial protection for U.S. patent owners by prohibiting the supply of components of a patented invention abroad for assembly in a way that would infringe the patent in the United States. There were concerns about the broad interpretation of this provision, especially regarding software designed in the U.S. and copied abroad falling under it. Some commentators believed that the interpretation of \u00a7 271(f) would disadvantage American software developers compared to foreign counterparts. Proposals in Congress, like the Patent Reform Act of 2006, aimed to address this issue. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled on whether \u00a7 271(f) applied to software copied abroad, in the case of Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp. The Supreme Court ruled that sending master disks abroad did not constitute \"supplying\" components of foreign computers under \u00a7 271(f), limiting liability for software firms in patent infringement cases. The Patent Reform Act of 2007 did not include proposals to eliminate \u00a7 271(f) after the Microsoft v. AT&T case. Senator Patrick Leahy noted that the Act did not involve Congress in ongoing litigation over the provision. The lack of legislative interest in amending or eliminating \u00a7 271(f) may suggest that concerned actors believe the Supreme Court addressed perceived problems with that statute. Controversy over patents on tax planning methods resulted in proposals to limit or prohibit them, such as the Patent Reform Act of 2007 stipulating that a patent may not be obtained on a tax planning method. Recent court decisions have explored patentable subject matter, notably the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Bilski v. Kappos which narrowed the range of patentable subject matter by introducing the \"machine-or-transformation\" standard. The Supreme Court ruled that a risk hedging method was unpatentable. The Supreme Court in Bilski v. Kappos ruled that the risk hedging method was unpatentable but rejected the \"machine-or-transformation\" test as the sole factor for patentability. They also rejected the argument that business methods were categorically unpatentable and suggested a case-by-case analysis based on existing case law. This ruling may impact legislative involvement in tax planning method patents. Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in Bilski v. Kappos, there were concerns about the patent eligibility of tax planning method patents. The possibility of legislative action in response to the ruling remains uncertain. The courts have made modifications to various patent law doctrines, which were previously considered by Congress for reform. The recent patent reform process has seen significant changes influenced by judicial opinions, with Congress reacting to earlier court developments. The Supreme Court and Federal Circuit have not embraced every proposal in the Patent Reform Acts, such as interlocutory appeals of claim construction rulings. Judicial opinions, like the 2007 KSR v. Teleflex case, have also impacted patent principles not directly targeted by legislative reforms. The judicial changes to the law of nonobviousness have had an impact on other patent doctrines, including those under congressional scrutiny. The Federal Circuit's concentration of appellate jurisdiction allows for quick changes to patent doctrine, affecting patent precedent nationwide. The Federal Circuit's location in Washington, DC, and the background of several judges as former congressional staff members suggest a strong connection between Congress and the courts in the patent reform process. This raises questions about institutional competence and the debate over whether legislatures or courts are better suited for legal reforms. Law professors Dan Burk and Mark Lemley support the courts in this debate. The debate over whether legislatures or courts are better suited for legal reforms in the patent system has been ongoing. Law professors Dan Burk and Mark Lemley argue that while Congress has struggled to reform the patent system, courts have been successful in addressing many of the same issues. They believe that courts are more capable of implementing necessary reforms, while acknowledging that Congress has greater research capabilities and access to information from third parties. The judiciary lacks oversight over key components of the patent system, such as the USPTO's budget and operations. Congress has the authority to determine USPTO rule-making, fee levels, and budget. Previous Congresses have considered a Patent Reform Act, prompting significant changes. The interaction between branches of government during the patent reform process highlights the importance of legislative involvement. The interaction between branches of government during the patent reform process emphasizes the importance of legislative awareness of judicial developments. Courts have options in interpreting statutory language, but the authority to alter the Patent Act lies with Congress."
