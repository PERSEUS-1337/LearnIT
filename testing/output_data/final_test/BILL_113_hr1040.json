Business taxable income is defined for tax purposes. The term 'business taxable income' is defined as gross active income minus specified deductions. Gross active income includes receipts from sales or exchanges of property or services in the US and exports from the US in connection with a business activity. The fair market value is used for exchanges of property or services. The fair market value of property or services received, plus any money received, is used to determine business taxable income.

The deductions specified in this subsection include the cost of business inputs, wages paid in cash for services in the US, and retirement contributions for employees. The term 'cost of business inputs' refers to the expenses incurred for the business activity. The term 'cost of business inputs' includes amounts paid for property or services used in connection with a business activity, as well as any taxes imposed on the purchase of property or services for business use, excluding certain specified taxes. The taxable income from financial intermediation services is based on the value of the services provided. Exchanges of property or services are valued at fair market value plus any money paid. The credit-equivalent of excess deductions can be carried over to the following taxable year if deductions exceed gross active income. This does not apply to services performed by an employee for their employer. The excess credit from deductions can be carried over to the following taxable year, with the excess amount multiplied by the 3-month Treasury rate for the last month of the year. This credit can be used against the tax imposed in the next taxable year. The 3-month Treasury rate is determined by the Secretary based on the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity of 3 months or less.
