    "content": "Australia has become a more active global actor in recent years, strengthening its alliance with the United States under the Obama Administration. This was demonstrated by sending military support to the United Arab Emirates to combat Islamic State militants in Iraq. Hillary Clinton emphasized the strong ties between the two nations. The United States and Australia share close ties, with a strong alliance in the Indo-Pacific region. Despite initial difficulties under President Trump, the relationship has traditionally been supported by bipartisan defense cooperation. The relationship between the United States and Australia faced challenges under President Trump due to disagreements over various issues. However, Vice President Pence's visit in April 2017 helped to improve ties, reaffirming the alliance and honoring a refugee deal made by Turnbull and former President Obama. The refugee deal made by Turnbull and former President Obama was honored by the United States, despite initial opposition from Trump. The relationship between Trump and Turnbull improved during their meeting aboard the Intrepid, with Trump expressing admiration for Australia. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop emphasized the strong alliance, partnership, and friendship between the two countries, highlighting shared values and a natural affinity. Australia reaffirms commitment to longstanding partnership with the US despite concerns over President Trump's departure from past policies. President Trump's actions, including displeasure over a refugee deal and potential changes in military cost-sharing, have raised apprehensions in Australia. President Trump's actions raised concerns in Australia about the U.S.-Australia relationship and America's commitment. The ANZUS alliance, centered around the AUSMIN process, guides the alliance relationship through annual meetings. In June 2017, Secretary of State Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Mattis traveled to Sydney for an AUSMIN meeting. During the Trump Administration's first AUSMIN meeting in Sydney, Secretary of State Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Mattis reaffirmed commitment to the alliance with Australia. They agreed to expand defense and security cooperation, strengthen interoperability of armed forces, collaborate on capability development, and implement the U.S.-Australia Force Posture Initiatives. The two nations also pledged to increase collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region and enhance trilateral cooperation with Japan and regional allies. During the 2015 AUSMIN consultations, Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter met with Australian officials to discuss military cooperation, regional stability, counterterrorism, economic integration, and climate change. They reaffirmed strong bilateral defense and security cooperation, including joint operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State. The two sides signed a Joint Statement on Defense Cooperation outlining principles for collaboration. During the 2015 AUSMIN consultations, the US and Australia expressed concerns over Chinese activities in the South China Sea, emphasizing the importance of international law and calling for a Code of Conduct. They also highlighted the need for a constructive relationship with China through dialogue and economic engagement. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott met with former President Barack Obama in 2014, where Obama emphasized the importance of a few countries in the region. In 2014, Obama praised Australia for sharing values and capacity, highlighting their role in promoting liberal democracies and human rights. There is renewed interest in forming a quadrilateral group with the US, Australia, Japan, and India to advance shared interests in the Indo-Pacific region. This idea was prominent under the Bush Administration but lost momentum in the late 2000s, with a resurgence of interest in 2017. In 2017, interest in forming a quadrilateral group with the US, Australia, Japan, and India was renewed. The Quad aims to increase prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific region, uphold the rules-based order, and address shared challenges like countering terrorism and maritime security. The idea was first promoted by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2007. President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have rearticulated the United States' strategic conceptualization of Asia, emphasizing the Indo-Pacific region and promoting a Free and Open Indo-Pacific. This includes increased engagement with countries like India, Japan, and Australia to secure maritime routes and strengthen cooperation among Indo-Pacific democracies. The United States is focusing on the Indo-Pacific region and promoting cooperation with countries like India, Japan, and potentially Australia. There are discussions about expanding strategic dialogues and military exercises among these nations. The United States is looking to deepen cooperation with countries like Japan, Australia, and India in the Indo-Pacific region. They are exploring ways to reinforce values such as freedom of navigation, maritime security, and disaster response through initiatives like the Quad. This includes providing alternatives to predatory financing and unsustainable debt for countries in the region. Senior official consultations on the Indo-Pacific were held in Manila, focusing on multilateral security approaches including the Quad concept. In Manila, multilateral security approaches like the Quad concept are gaining traction in Australia due to China's expanding interests. Japan, India, and the United States advocate for a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" to counter Beijing's maritime influence. Strategic dialogues involving the US, India, and Japan are being considered, exemplified by the Malabar naval exercises. The Malabar naval exercises, initially bilateral between the US and India and later including Japan, demonstrate multilateral naval cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Australia expressed interest in joining but was reportedly declined in 2017. US Congress members have shown support for the US-Australia alliance through resolutions like H.Con.Res. 21 and S.Res. 50. Senator John McCain expressed strong support for the US-Australia alliance, highlighting increased military cooperation between the two countries. The relationship is crucial for security in the Asia-Pacific region and combating terrorism. Both the House and Senate have bipartisan Friends of Australia Caucuses. The House and Senate bipartisan Friends of Australia Caucuses were launched in May 2017 by Representatives Joe Courtney and Mike Gallagher and Senators Roy Blunt and Dick Durbin. The U.S. and Australia signed the U.S.-Australia Force Posture Agreement in August 2014, focusing on cooperation in cyber defense, cybersecurity, and ballistic missile defense in the Asia-Pacific region. The HMAS Hobart is the first of three Australian air warfare destroyers with the Aegis missile defense system. Upgrades to a base near Geraldton, West Australia, will improve military satellite communications for U.S. and Australian troops. The Force Posture Agreement between the U.S. and Australia allows for increased presence of U.S. forces in Australia, including marines, Navy vessels, and military aircraft. Cost-sharing negotiations were concluded in October 2016, with initiatives focusing on expanding cooperation, training, and interoperability between the two countries' armed forces in the Indo-Pacific region. The 2014 AUSMIN Joint Communiqu\u00e9 highlighted the broader collaboration between Australia, the United States, and partners in the Indo-Pacific. It emphasized the 25-year Force Posture Agreement as a demonstration of the U.S.'s commitment to the region. The communiqu\u00e9 welcomed the increased U.S. Marine Corps presence in Northern Australia and discussed enhanced aircraft and naval cooperation. Both nations committed to working together on regional security challenges, including BMD, and emphasized the importance of defense cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. They also called for upholding freedom of navigation in the East China and South China Seas and opposed unilateral attempts to change the status quo. Australia was first inhabited 40,000 to 60,000 years ago by Aboriginal people, the world's oldest continuous culture. Today, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders make up 2.5% of the population. Captain James Cook claimed Australia for Britain in 1770, leading to the first European settlement in 1788. Australia evolved into a pastoral settler society based on sheep and wool, with minerals becoming important after the gold rush of 1851. Australia's immigrants have diverse backgrounds, with a significant portion coming from Asia. The country is urbanized, with a small rural population. Australia is smaller than the contiguous United States and has a population of approximately 23 million. There is an ongoing national identity debate regarding Australia's relationships with Asia, Britain, the United States, and Europe. Australia is an independent nation within the British Commonwealth. Australia is an independent nation within the British Commonwealth, with the Head of State represented by the Governor General. Power is held by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, with parliamentary elections held at least once every three years. The main political forces are the Liberal-National Party Coalition and the Labor Party. There is a growing republican movement supporting breaking with the British Crown. Australia is divided into six states and two territories. Australia has a bicameral parliament with the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House has 150 Representatives elected through a preferential ballot, while the Senate has 76 seats with 12 senators from each state and two from each territory. Elections are held every three years, with the possibility of early elections or a double dissolution if legislation is blocked. The Liberal-National Party Coalition returned to power in 2013. In 2013, the Liberal-National Party Coalition regained power under Tony Abbott's leadership, who focused on eliminating the carbon tax and reducing government spending. Abbott was later replaced by Malcolm Turnbull in 2015, known for his progressive stance on issues like climate change and same-sex marriage. Turnbull faced opposition for budget cuts in healthcare and education. In November 2015, Turnbull abolished knighthoods and damehoods in Australia, which had been reintroduced by Abbott in 2014. The 2016 election saw Turnbull's government narrowly re-elected, leading to the need for cooperation with small parties and independents in parliament. Turnbull faces opposition from conservatives within his Liberal Party, while Labor Party Leader Bill Shorten has strengthened his position. Labor Party holds a lead over Turnbull's Coalition in polls. In May 2017, Party led Prime Minister Turnbull's Coalition in a poll. High Court ruled MPs with foreign citizenship can't sit in Parliament, causing Turnbull to lose majority. Coalition holds 74 seats, Labor 69, with upcoming by-elections. In November 2017, Australia held a survey on same-sex marriage, with 61.6% in favor. In a survey on same-sex marriage in Australia, 61.6% were in favor, with 12.7 million respondents. Prime Minister Turnbull, a moderate in the Liberal Party, hopes for marriage equality by Christmas 2017. This result is a setback for the right wing of the party opposed to same-sex marriage. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a leader against same-sex marriage, saw his electorate vote \"Yes\". The US-Australia defense relationship has remained strong over the past century, with both countries committing troops to the Boxer Rebellion in China. President Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet was welcomed in Australia in 1908. The US-Australia defense relationship was forged during World War I and strengthened in World War II and the Korean War. The Battle of the Coral Sea was a significant event that helped turn the tide of war in the Pacific. Former Australian Minister of Defence Kim Beazley highlighted its importance in Australian strategic consciousness. The joint action by U.S. and Australian naval forces halted the Japanese naval advance on Papua and New Guinea. The 1951 ANZUS Treaty was signed during the Cold War, leading to joint military actions in Vietnam and efforts to promote stability post-Cold War. The alliance was invoked by Australia to support the US in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a strong intelligence relationship between the two nations. The U.S. and Australia have a strong intelligence relationship through joint defense facilities. Australia also maintains close defense ties with New Zealand, with the U.S. reestablishing relations with New Zealand after differences over nuclear policy were resolved in 2010 and 2012. This renewed partnership allows for enhanced military cooperation between the U.S. and New Zealand. Australia, the world's sixth largest arms importer, has traditionally bought most of its major weapons systems from the United States. In 2015, approximately 68% of arms imports were sourced from the United States. Australia was the fifth-largest purchaser of U.S. weapons in 2016. The State Department approved a $1.3 billion sale of a Gulfstream G550 Aircraft with Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Electronic Warfare (AISREW) Mission Systems in June 2017. Additionally, a $815 million sale of GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment II for Australia's future F-35A Joint Strike Fighter purchase was approved in October 2017. Australia announced in April 2014 that it would buy 58 F-35A Joint Strike Fighter aircraft at a cost of $11.5 billion, in addition to a previously announced decision to buy 14 F-35As. Australia's purchase of F-35A planes, EA-18G Growler, P-8A Poseidon, and E-7A Wedgetail aircraft from the US enhances bilateral interoperability. The country also acquired Boeing C-17 transport aircraft in 2015. The rise of China prompts Australia to explore new security relationships beyond traditional approaches. Middle powers in Asia, including Japan, are expanding security cooperation beyond traditional approaches in response to China's rise and uncertainty over America's future role in the region. This shift aims to build regional resilience and reinforce the multipolar Indo-Pacific order without unduly provoking China. It marks a departure from the post-war U.S. alliance system towards increased reliance on each other, complementing ties with the United States. The search for new security mechanisms in Asia reflects a declining faith in economic stability. The search for new security mechanisms in Asia reflects a declining faith in economic stability and a regional arms race. Australia sees the 21st Century as an Asian Century, presenting opportunities with the global center of gravity shifting to the Indo-Pacific region. This new perspective offers Australia the \"prospect of proximity\" and reshapes perceptions of the strategic geography in the region. The 2013 Australian Defence White Paper and the United States' rebalance to Asia strategy have shifted focus towards the Indo-Pacific region, including the Indian Ocean. Australia's strategic gaze is now directed towards the Indian Ocean due to mineral and hydrocarbon reserves in West Australia. The United States recognizes India's strategic importance and the trade routes in the Indian Ocean. The United States and Australia are increasingly focusing on the strategic importance of India and the Indian Ocean region. They aim to expand trilateral cooperation with India on maritime security, energy security, and economic growth. Australia's 2017 Strategy Framework highlights the growing partnership with India, aligning with the US rebalance to Asia strategy. The Australian Strategy Framework 2017 emphasizes three strategic defense interests: a secure Australia with secure northern approaches, a secure nearer region encompassing maritime Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, and a stable Indo-Pacific region. Australia maintains traditional security relationships with the United States, New Zealand, and the nations of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA). The ANZAC legend, stemming from the Australia New Zealand Army Corps' experience in World War I, plays a significant role in defining Australia's national identity. The ANZAC experience at Gallipoli helped Australia define its national identity. Australia-New Zealand defense relations were formalized through the Canberra Pact and ANZUS Treaty. The Closer Defence Relations Agreement serves as a framework for bilateral defense ties. Australian and New Zealand military forces have worked together to promote regional stability in various places. The Five Power Defence Arrangements link Australia and New Zealand with Great Britain, Malaysia, and Singapore. The 40th anniversary of the Arrangements was marked with large-scale exercises by member states. Australian defense policy debates have focused on forward defense and continental defense within an alliance context. The 2014 Defence Issues Paper highlighted the need to prevent and deter attacks on Australia while also acknowledging Australia's broad interests in a globalized world. Former Prime Minister Howard emphasized that Australia can engage with Asia without compromising its Western roots. Former Prime Ministers in Australia have had differing approaches to engaging with Asia, with some emphasizing ties with Anglosphere nations. The debate over Australian identity and its relationship with Asia continues, with a population of 23 million located close to key Asian countries. Australia's isolation from Western cultural partners and allies is a significant factor in these discussions. Australia's evolving relationship with Asia is driven by a shift from fear to interest, demonstrated by the Rudd government's apology to the Aboriginal population. Increasing Asian immigration is reshaping Australia's identity and trade patterns, drawing it closer to Asia. Tensions with Indonesia date back to historical military deployments, highlighting the complexities of Australia's position in the region. In November 2015, Prime Minister Turnbull visited Indonesia to mend relations strained by issues like the executions of Australian drug smugglers and asylum seekers. During meetings with President Widodo, they discussed trade, tourism, and Australian investment in Indonesia. Indonesian concerns over Australia's role in East Timor's independence have lessened over time, with Australia playing a key role in assisting Timor-Leste to become independent. The United Nations played a key role in assisting Timor-Leste to become independent. Australia's military intervention in Timor-Leste was viewed negatively by many in Indonesia. Post-2004 tsunami assistance from Australia to Indonesia improved relations between the two countries. Tensions arose in 2009 when Australian intelligence listened to the cell phone conversations of President Yudhoyono and his inner circle. Cooperation on security matters between Australia and Indonesia is supported by the Lombok Treaty of 2006 and a Defence Cooperation Arrangement signed in 2012. President Yudhoyono expressed interest in increased defense cooperation in 2014. Calls have been made for enhanced bilateral maritime cooperation between the two nations. President Joko Widodo emphasizes Indonesia's identity as a maritime nation, presenting positive opportunities for Australia to engage. Tensions may arise due to Australia's policy on turning back boats of illegal immigrants. Both countries have collaborated on investigating terrorist attacks, with concerns over Indonesians joining IS forces. Australia is particularly concerned about terrorism in Indonesia following past attacks on the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in 2004. Australia's relationship with China is complex, with tensions arising from issues such as Chinese political donations, land and infrastructure deals, and disputes over the South China Sea. Concerns over China's influence in Australia have been raised, particularly regarding corporate donations to political parties. Senator Sam Dastyari of the Labor Party has been involved in controversies related to Chinese donations. Senator Sam Dastyari resigned from the opposition frontbench due to scrutiny over Chinese funds. Critics question the 99-year lease of Darwin port to China's Landbridge Group, citing strategic concerns. China's growing investment in Australia's agricultural sector raised national security worries, leading to blocked sales of Kidman and Company and Ausgrid. Former President Obama expressed displeasure over the Darwin port lease to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Australia's security concerns led to the blocking of the A$10 billion sale of Ausgrid to China, which supplies power to New South Wales. Chinese buyers are also affecting real estate prices. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop urged China to abide by a ruling against their behavior in the South China Sea. Polls show divided opinions on the importance of relationships with China and the United States. Australians expressed reluctance to support military action with the U.S. under Donald Trump. Following President Trump's electoral victory, key Australian political figures have called for a shift towards an independent foreign policy, urging the country to reduce its strategic dependence on the United States. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and former Ambassador to China Stephen FitzGerald have criticized Australia's close relationship with the U.S. and advocated for closer ties with China. These views are in contrast to the prevailing sentiment among Australians, who expressed warmer feelings towards the U.S. but had concerns about China's military activities in the region. Key Australian political figures are calling for a shift towards an independent foreign policy, urging reduced strategic dependence on the United States. Leading strategist Hugh White believes Australians can no longer trust America and will move closer to China. Bilateral relations with China are based on a strong trade relationship that has benefited both countries, contributing to Australia's economic success. There is broad support for a strong economic relationship with China in Australia, despite unease in some policy circles about China's assertive posture in the region. Australia and China signed a free trade agreement in June 2015. In June 2015, Australia and China signed a free trade agreement (FTA). Australian supporters believed it would boost exports of agricultural goods, wine, and services to China. Critics feared it would increase Chinese products and investment, potentially impacting local jobs and economic interests. Australia's membership in China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) with a $718 million contribution raised concerns about China's growing influence and the bank's governance standards. Australia's ties with China have been strained over various issues, including the imprisonment of an Australian national on espionage charges and China's displeasure over a visit by an activist from China's Uighur minority. Despite these challenges, Australia has become increasingly close to China. Australia has strengthened its security partnership with Japan, as promoted by former Prime Minister Abbott and elevated during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to Canberra in 2014. Abe emphasized the potential for collaboration between Japan, Australia, and the United States in his speech to the Australian Parliament, signaling Japan's efforts to change its defense policies and expand strategic relationships. Japan is working to enhance its network of strategic relationships, aiming to act jointly with other countries in various ways. Prime Minister Abe's address highlighted Japan and Australia leading a regional coalition to counter China. Abe also offered condolences to Australian troops who suffered during WWII, including at Kakoda and Sandakan. Australia and Japan have been strengthening bilateral security ties. Australia and Japan have been developing bilateral security relations under the Australia-Japan Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation (JDSC) signed in 2007. The JDSC offers potential for security cooperation in various areas. There was speculation of Australian purchase of Japanese submarines to replace the Collins-class fleet. Purchasing submarines from Japan would be less costly. In 2015, the Australian government opened bidding for submarines from Japan, France, and Germany. A deal was made in 2016 to build French Barracuda Block 1A submarines in Australia. An independent report in 2017 suggested revisiting the submarine purchase decision. Australia-India relations have historically been limited due to various factors, including past racist attacks on Indian students in Australia. Relations between Australia and India have improved in recent years, with high-level visits and commitments to mutual respect, cooperation, and shared values. The signing of a uranium export deal in 2014 has paved the way for expanding bilateral relations, as both countries' strategic and economic interests align. The strategic and economic interests of India and Australia are converging, creating opportunities for collaboration in a changing region. Both countries share common interests in maritime security and sea line safety. High-level visits and commitments have strengthened bilateral relations, including a uranium export deal in 2014. Annual Foreign Ministers Framework Dialogue further enhances their agenda. Australia and India are forging a closer relationship with new excitement and energy about India's future. The bilateral relationship is dynamic, diverse, and deep, with increasing cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. The Indian Ocean region is crucial for Australia's economic and strategic security, with both countries working together through the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). Australia and India are strengthening their relationship through various economic initiatives. The Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) is a key focus for cooperation, with Australia seeking to enhance bilateral trade with India through agreements like the Australia-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. Additionally, both countries are involved in Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations. Prime Minister Turnbull announced the commissioning of an independent India Economic Strategy during his visit to India in April 2017. Former Secretary of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs Peter Varghese AO, the Chancellor of the University of Queensland, is leading efforts to strengthen economic collaboration between Australia and India. The Australia-India Joint Ministerial Commission facilitates trade development, while strategic and defense cooperation is enhanced through mechanisms like the Framework for Security Cooperation. Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Turnbull are committed to deepening their defense and security partnership, ensuring the Indian Ocean architecture addresses regional issues and emerging threats. The architecture in the Indian Ocean region addresses emerging threats and challenges. Bilateral defense relations between Australia and India have been strengthened through various agreements and dialogues. Defense cooperation includes research, development, industry engagement, annual summits, and maritime exercises like AUSINDEX. Australia and India have strengthened their defense relations through various agreements and dialogues, including bilateral naval exercises like AUSINDEX. Both countries are members of the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium, aiming to increase maritime cooperation in the region. Australia views the Southwest Pacific as its \"Near Abroad\" and considers it strategically important, facing challenges such as natural disasters, ethnic conflicts, and climate change. Australia has played a key role in peace-keeping efforts in the South Pacific, particularly in Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands. In 1999, after a U.N.-supervised election, Timor-Leste voted to separate from Indonesia, leading to violence and the authorization of the International Force East Timor (INTERFET) by the U.N. Security Council to restore peace and security. Australia's involvement in peacekeeping efforts in the South Pacific includes leading a multinational force in East Timor and the Solomon Islands. Timor-Leste gained independence in 2002, and Australia has collaborated with them on energy resource exploitation. Australia also led a mission in the Solomon Islands in 2003 and sent additional troops in 2006 to address post-election violence. Additionally, Australia and New Zealand supported Papua New Guinea with troops for their elections in 2012. Australia and New Zealand sent troops to assist PNG with its 2012 elections, providing support by transporting personnel and election materials to remote locations. Analysts note a decrease in Australian influence in the South Pacific as China becomes more active. Fiji faced sanctions after a 2006 coup, leading to closer relations with China and other regional groups. The 2014 election in Fiji may prompt a reevaluation of Western approaches. The Commonwealth reinstated Fiji. The Commonwealth reinstated Fiji as a member following a \"credible\" election in September 2014. Australia supported the International Coalition Against Terrorism (ICAT) by sending special forces troops to Iraq and Afghanistan due to shared views on Islamist extremist violence. Terrorist attacks in Indonesia, such as the 2002 Bali bombings, shaped Australia's perceptions of Islamist threats post-9/11. Jemaah Islamiya (JI), linked to Al Qaeda, was responsible for the Bali bombings. The Jemaah Islamiya (JI) network, linked to Al Qaeda, carried out attacks in Indonesia, including the 2002 Bali bombings. Some members aimed to establish an Islamic state in the region. Cooperation between Australia and Indonesia improved after the Bali blasts. JI leader Abu Bakar Bashir pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, raising concerns about potential future threats from militants returning from Syria and Iraq. Australia has around half a million Muslims out of a total population of approximately 23 million. Australia has enacted new security laws and increased funding for intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Approximately two-thirds of Australians who returned from fighting in Afghanistan are involved in terrorist activities in Australia. There are about 150 individuals in Australia with connections to Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State, and concerns about IS fighters from Southeast Asia. Australia faces security challenges due to individuals radicalized through fighting in Afghanistan, with about 150 Southeast Asians supporting IS. The country's diverse environment includes rainforests, deserts, and the Great Barrier Reef, with environmental issues like drought, wildfire, and coral bleaching. Urbanization is prevalent, with 80% living near the coast, and introduced species pose threats to ecosystems. The Australian government's Land Care Program aims to address environmental issues such as loss of vegetation, soil degradation, and the introduction of pest weeds and animals. A study projected that Australia will warm faster than the rest of the world, with temperature rises of up to 5.1 degrees C by 2090, leading to more extreme droughts and rising temperatures. Australia aims to reduce emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. CO2 emissions declined 12% from 2005 to 2015 but have been increasing since March 2015, with a 1.1% increase in the year preceding March 2017. Reports suggest a trend of rising emissions since the repeal of the carbon tax in 2014, contradicting Australia's international commitments. Australia's emissions are projected to grow further from 2015 to 2020, driven by increasing electricity demand, transport activity, population growth, LNG industry growth, and livestock numbers. In 2016, 63% of electricity generation was from coal and 14% from renewables, with energy productivity and consumption rising by 1%. Energy exports increased by 5%, with net energy exports equaling two-thirds of domestic production. A 2017 report noted close to 50% coral loss in the Great Barrier Reef over two summers, emphasizing the need to limit global temperature rise to 1.2 degrees. Under the Australian Labor Party's Climate Change Action Plan, a Labor Government would aim to limit global temperature rise to 1.2 degrees to protect reef biodiversity. The plan includes building an emissions trading scheme, setting a net zero emissions target by 2050, and achieving 45% emissions reductions by 2030. Key components of the plan involve transitioning to renewable energy, creating a Strategic Industries Reserve Fund for job creation, implementing an Emissions Trading Scheme, and promoting carbon capture through initiatives like the Carbon Farming Initiative. The Labor Party criticizes the Liberal Government's policies on renewable energy, stating they have harmed Australia's position in the global market. Despite Australia's long economic growth streak, the Labor Party emphasizes the need to focus on renewable energy investments in the Asia-Pacific region for job creation and economic opportunities. Australia's economy, despite a 26-year recession-free streak, is slowing with year-on-year growth at 1.7%, the slowest since 2009. The economy is undergoing structural change as the mining investment boom unwinds. Key sectors like mining, construction, and finance have driven growth, while manufacturing has declined. Australia's wealth is largely derived from its mineral resources, with efforts to diversify into education, tourism, and health services. The economy is heavily reliant on world prices for natural resources, with the Australian dollar seen as a proxy for China. Australia's economy is slowing with year-on-year growth at 1.7%, the slowest since 2009. China became Australia's largest trade partner in 2009, taking over 30% of Australian exports. In November 2017, Australia agreed to \"core elements\" with the TPP-11 group for a new free trade agreement. President Trump withdrew from the TPP agreement in January 2017."
