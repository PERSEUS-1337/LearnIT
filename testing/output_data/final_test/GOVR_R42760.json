    "content": "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, purchase mortgages, guarantee payments, and create mortgage-backed securities. They have a special relationship with the federal government and aim to promote homeownership. In 2008, concerns over their financial condition led to the government taking control in conservatorship. The government took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008 through conservatorship to restore their financial strength. Congressional interest has grown due to doubts about their future and potential costs. Various public policy options are being discussed to address the major issues surrounding their financial conditions. The secondary mortgage market was created to combine regional mortgage markets into a single national market, allowing financing from around the world. This addressed the geographic barrier that prevented the law of supply and demand from operating on a national level in the home loan market. The National Housing Act of 1934 established national mortgage associations, leading to the creation of Fannie Mae. Initially a federal government agency, Fannie Mae was later re-chartered in 1954 as a mixed government and private-sector entity. In 1968, Congress split Fannie Mae into two distinct organizations. In 1968, Congress split Fannie Mae into two organizations - Fannie Mae for the secondary market and Ginnie Mae for government functions. Fannie Mae became privately owned with no federal funding in 1970. The Emergency Home Finance Act in 1970 allowed Fannie Mae to buy conventional mortgages. Freddie Mac was created in 1970 to facilitate secondary market trading for savings and loan associations. In 1989, Congress re-chartered Freddie Mac to trade on the NYSE like Fannie Mae. Both entities purchase conforming mortgages from lenders, guarantee them, and sell them as MBSs. Fannie Mae reported record profits of $59 billion in 2013, while Freddie Mac reported near record profits of $5 billion. Table 1 shows the losses and profits of both GSEs since 2006. The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, experienced losses starting in late 2006 after being consistently profitable. The losses were attributed to loans to borrowers with subprime and Alt-A credit. Fannie Mae held $15.1 billion in subprime MBSs and $17.1 billion in Alt-A MBSs, while Freddie Mac held $44.4 billion in subprime MBSs and $14.8 billion in Alt-A MBSs by the end of 2012. Loan loss reserves were increased in anticipation of further losses. Since 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have tightened lending standards by increasing loan loss reserves. If losses on foreclosed mortgages are less than predicted, reserves could be reduced, improving financial condition. If losses are greater, financial condition would worsen. FICO scores for mortgages purchased by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have increased over time. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has requested $116.1 billion from Treasury to offset liabilities. Since 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have tightened lending standards by increasing loan loss reserves. The Federal Housing Finance Agency requested $116.1 billion from Treasury to offset liabilities. Treasury support for the GSEs comes through purchases of senior preferred stock. The Fed and Treasury purchased $1,135.9 billion in MBSs from September 2008 to March 2010. As of July 31, 2013, the Fed held $1.0 trillion in MBSs. The Fed holds $1.0 trillion of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's MBSs as of July 31, 2013. Treasury, FHFA, and the GSEs amended support contracts to expedite reducing GSEs' assets. Homeowners unaffected by GSEs' financial problems, continue to pay mortgages. Treasury's lending and Fed's MBS purchases stabilize the secondary mortgage market. Under conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been active in loan modifications and refinancing existing mortgages they own. They have tightened credit and documentation standards, similar to other lenders during economic slowdowns. FHA guarantees mortgages up to $271,050, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a $417,000 limit. In high-cost areas, FHA guarantees up to $729,750 compared to $625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The GSEs face various risks like other companies, purchasing and packaging mortgages into MBSs for investment portfolios. The GSEs finance their portfolios of long-term mortgages with short-term borrowing, increasing profits but creating interest rate risk. To mitigate this risk, they use financial derivatives. The Federal Reserve plans to keep interest rates low, which could benefit the GSEs in the short term. In the long run, GSEs may face challenges with profitability as interest rates increase, affecting their ability to refinance short-term borrowing at higher rates than what they receive on mortgages. There is a risk of substantial losses if short-term loan interest rates rise significantly, potentially leading to investors ceasing derivative contracts with GSEs. This could leave GSEs unable to refinance their debt, especially as mortgage foreclosure rates have increased since 2006, impacting the value of their mortgage-backed securities. The value of mortgages and MBSs held by the GSEs has fallen, leading to uncertainty about their riskiness. The Treasury's support has reduced this risk, but it is unclear if the GSEs will return to stockholder control. Operational risk due to internal control failures and model risk are also concerns. FHFA has directed the GSEs to improve their IT, data quality, internal controls, and update financial models. Estimates of the total cost to the government of supporting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac vary widely. The Treasury's support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac involves purchasing senior preferred stock to keep the GSEs solvent. Estimates suggest Treasury may have purchased between $191 billion and $209 billion of senior preferred stock by the end of 2015. Initially, a maximum of $100 billion in senior preferred stock was agreed upon for each GSE, later increased to $200 billion. As of the first quarter of 2013, Fannie Mae had $117.6 billion available from Treasury, and Freddie Mac had $140.5 billion. Upon entering conservatorship in 2008, each GSE issued Treasury $1 billion of senior preferred stock and warrants. If exercised, Treasury would own 79.9% of each company. The agreements set maximum portfolio sizes for each GSE, with a goal of reaching $250 billion by 2018. Treasury terminated its program to purchase MBSs of GSEs in 2009. Treasury terminated its program to purchase MBSs of GSEs on December 31, 2009, holding approximately $220 billion in MBSs. The New York Federal Reserve had its own program to purchase $1.25 trillion of GSE and Ginnie Mae MBSs. The Fed's QE3 program is now purchasing GSE and Ginnie Mae MBSs, with the GSEs guaranteeing payment. Treasury created a GSECF to provide liquidity to the GSEs, secured by MBSs pledged as collateral, which terminated on December 31, 2009. In the event of receivership for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the usual priority of claims on remaining assets includes administrative expenses, senior, and general debt. In the event of receivership for a GSE, the value of MBSs with guarantees could decline, affecting the payment of underlying mortgages. The eventual value of bonds would depend on the cause of receivership, liquidation process, and government support. Mortgage defaults could decrease assets available for creditors. The SEC filed a lawsuit against former Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac CEOs for securities fraud. The FHFA has the authority to set housing goals for the GSEs. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can meet housing goals by purchasing qualifying mortgages. Special programs are available for mortgage borrowers, but only for loans held by each GSE. Special programs are available for mortgage borrowers with loans held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including options for refinancing, repayment plans, forbearance, mortgage modifications, and deed-for-lease plans to avoid foreclosure. Homeowners facing foreclosure can surrender the deed in lieu of foreclosure and lease back the home through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac programs. Additional government programs can be found at http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have separate management teams overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. CEOs Daniel H. Mudd and Richard F. Syron resigned in 2008 when the companies were placed in conservatorship. Herbert M. Allison Jr. and David Moffett were appointed as CEOs, with Moffett resigning in 2009. Allison resigned in 2009 to become assistant treasury secretary. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act strengthened FHFA's regulation over executive compensation for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Current CEOs have base salaries of $500,000, with some executives receiving higher compensation rates from previous FHFA-approved agreements. The Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008, part of P.L. 110-289, may allow GSEs to return to stockholder control, but government support and reduced dividends have lowered the value of their preferred and common stock. The GSEs' ability to raise capital is uncertain, impacting stockholders. Bondholders may find lending to GSEs more attractive, with continued payments to bond and MBS holders. Government actions could reduce bondholders' perceived risk, allowing GSEs to borrow at competitive rates. As the housing market recovers, GSEs could excel in mortgage purchases and MBS creation, offering potential for stockholders despite stock price declines and government profit claims. The government's claim on GSE profits could offset stock price declines. The government's decision on warrants for GSE ownership is uncertain. Common stockholders' powers are suspended, with FHFA assuming authority. Previously owning 100%, they now only own 20% due to Treasury warrants. In the long run, 20% of a healthy enterprise could be more valuable. In the short run, GSEs' common stock price has declined as their liabilities exceed assets. Stockholders may benefit if GSEs recover. Employees with stock investments have seen a decline in value. GSEs cannot issue new stock until emerging from conservatorship. Treasury purchased senior preferred stock to keep Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac solvent. FHFA urges GSE employees to continue working as usual. On August 17, 2012, Treasury signed new agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to change the quarterly dividend to be all profits earned in the quarter, with no dividend paid if no profits are earned. Congress has options for reorganizing or winding down the GSEs to benefit taxpayers and the housing market. Options for reorganizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac include making them part of the government, turning them into Federal Home Loan Banks, or splitting them into smaller entities to prevent them from being \"too big to fail.\" The government could reorganize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by converting them into \"utilities\" that issue MBSs guaranteed by the federal government. Additional new GSEs could be created through the sale of charters to the highest bidders. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. proposed using bonds backed by the issuing entities. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. proposed using bonds backed by specific collateral to allow banks to supplement or replace GSEs in mortgage markets. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could exit conservatorship by becoming financially viable or entering receivership. There is no legal barrier for one GSE to go into receivership while the other returns to stockholder control. The GSEs are facing obstacles to financial viability while in conservatorship, balancing support for home mortgage markets with profitability goals. The federal government and FHFA prioritize mortgage market stability over profitability, hindering the GSEs' ability to redeem senior preferred stock. However, if profits are paid to the government at the end of each quarter, the GSEs could potentially regain stockholder control over time. FHFA could prevent redemption of senior preferred stock in conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Conservatorship transfers powers to FHFA, authorized by HERA to preserve assets and return to financial health. Leadership changes occurred with Director resigning and new nominations made. The Senate Committee approved the nomination for director of a GSE on July 18, 2013, but the full Senate has not voted on it yet. This is the first time a GSE has been placed under conservatorship, with the federal government making a continuing commitment. FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship due to their financial positions and importance to the residential financial markets. The government has intervened to support other companies like General Motors, Chrysler, AIG, and banks. FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship due to their weak financial positions and importance to the residential financial markets. The approach followed by FHFA is similar to the FDIC's process for placing a bank in conservatorship, involving requests for changes and capital increases before a sudden takeover. Providing a deadline could incentivize risky behavior to avoid government seizure, similar to how the FDIC seizes a bank by closing it suddenly. Some large foreign investors reduced their holdings of GSE debt, MBSs, and stock, making it harder for the GSEs to borrow money. Treasury officials reassured foreign central banks of the creditworthiness of GSE debt. FHFA placed the GSEs under conservatorship, citing the need for assistance due to economic changes and slow recovery from financial problems. The GSEs' financial strength was impacted by the slow recovery from accounting and financial issues. OFHEO stated that the GSEs had enough capital to survive. However, conflicting assessments of their financial position arose due to confidential portfolio details. In 2006-2007, the GSEs bought $169 billion of subprime MBSs and $58 billion of Alt-A MBSs, totaling $1.677 trillion in mortgage purchases. Subprime and Alt-A MBSs made up 13.5% of the GSEs' assets by the end of 2007. At the end of 2007, subprime and Alt-A MBSs accounted for 13.5% of the GSEs' total assets. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as GSEs, are limited to buying home mortgages, making them more vulnerable to housing market issues. Their special relationship with the government allows them to borrow at low interest rates. The GSEs operate similarly to highly leveraged banks, maximizing profits by keeping minimal capital reserves. The GSEs, like banks, must maintain a certain loan-to-reserve ratio to protect against losses. Shareholders' equity is a key part of reserves. Using funds for capital is safer but less profitable than buying mortgages. Changes in risk perception led to a drop in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's stock value. Fannie's stock fell by 72% and Freddie's by 77% between 2007 and 2008. Fannie Mae's market capitalization dropped from $38.8 billion by September 2008. As part of Treasury's financial aid package in September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's market capitalization significantly declined. The GSEs agreed to issue warrants to the Treasury worth 79.9% of their outstanding stock, reducing current stockholders' ownership to 20%. This led to further decline in the GSEs' stock prices. Congress had previously assisted GSEs in financial difficulty through various acts, such as the Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1982 for Fannie Mae and the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 for the Farm Credit System. Section 1117 of HERA also authorizes support for GSEs. The Treasury issued $4 billion in bonds to support system members under Section 1117 of HERA, allowing the government to purchase GSE securities to stabilize financial markets. This intervention signaled the government's readiness to prevent GSE failure. Additionally, the SEC issued an emergency order in July 2008 to restrict short selling in the stock of 19 financial institutions, including Fannie and Freddie, to prevent market manipulation. The government took steps to prevent false rumors from affecting share prices and market confidence, renewing the order restricting short sales of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock. The Federal Reserve granted authority to lend directly to the GSEs, ensuring financial market stability. The Fed's ability to purchase GSEs' bonds on the secondary market could indirectly support the GSEs. The Fed conducted special programs to purchase GSE debt and MBSs, totaling over $1 trillion. They also reinvested MBS principal repayments and held $1.0 trillion of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's MBSs as of July 31, 2013. Non-U.S. investors held $1.1 trillion of $7.6 trillion agency and GSE debt and MBSs by the end of the first quarter of 2013. Non-U.S. investors held $1.1 trillion of $7.6 trillion agency and GSE securities in the first quarter of 2013. Central bank ownership of certain types of debt declined for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Legislation since the 110th Congress has impacted Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac significantly."
