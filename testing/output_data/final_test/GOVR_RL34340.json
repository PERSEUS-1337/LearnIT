    "content": "The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program, funded by federal and state taxes, provides income support to unemployed workers. The program is outlined in the Social Security Act, with federal funding for administration and state funding for regular benefits. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides income support to unemployed workers, funded by federal and state taxes. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily provided 100% federal funding for Extended Benefits (EB) from 2009 to 2013. Workers who lose their jobs face long-term economic challenges, with reduced chances of full-time employment and lower earnings if they find new jobs. The UC program pays benefits to involuntarily unemployed workers in covered employment who meet eligibility rules. Unemployment insurance benefits are provided to workers who are unable to work or have no recent earnings history. States disqualify claimants for various reasons such as inability to work, voluntary quitting without good cause, job-related misconduct, or refusal of suitable work. Benefits are based on wages for covered work over a 12-month period, typically replacing up to 50% of workers' wages. The maximum benefit amount is capped, lowering the national replacement rate to 33% of the average weekly wage in 2014. In January 2014, maximum weekly unemployment benefit amounts ranged from $133 to $1,019, with an average weekly benefit of $314 in June 2014. Benefits are available for up to 26 weeks in most states, with an average duration of 16.6 weeks. Approximately 2.4 million unemployed workers received benefits in June 2014, with a recipiency rate of 26% in 2013. The recipiency rate of unemployment benefits fluctuates during economic cycles, impacting job search behavior. While benefits may create disincentives to find work quickly, the balance lies in the low replacement rate of wages and the need for adequate job search time. Changes in benefit timing, generosity, and duration can influence the unemployed's job search behavior. The availability of unemployment benefits may create a disincentive to search for and accept reemployment, but research suggests this effect is relatively small. The limited duration of benefits (generally 26 weeks) can result in some individuals exhausting their benefits before finding work. Workers who exhaust benefits tend to search at similar or higher levels of intensity as those who find employment before benefit exhaustion. State programs use profiling systems to identify potential benefit exhaustees and offer intensive employment services. The proportion of UC recipients exhausting benefits varies based on economic conditions, state benefit duration formulas, and labor force composition. Evidence suggests an aging workforce may increase long-term unemployment rates. The NBER, not the federal government, declares the start of recessions. The NBER, not the federal government, determines the start of recessions based on a significant decline in economic activity. They track peaks and troughs in the business cycle, with the last recession lasting from December 2007 to June 2009. The NBER has identified five recessions since 1980. The UC program aims to provide wage replacement for unemployed workers and stabilize the economy during recessions. During economic growth, program revenue increases while spending decreases, creating a surplus for use during recessions when tax revenue falls and spending rises. During economic recessions, spending rises as more workers lose jobs and receive UC benefits, which injects additional funds into the economy. The federal government augments regular UC benefits with permanent (Extended Benefit program) and temporary extensions (Emergency Unemployment Compensation of 2008 program) to help unemployed workers. The Extended Benefit program was established by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, allowing for the extension of unemployment benefits based on certain economic situations within the state. The Extended Benefit (EB) program requires claimants to have worked at least 20 weeks of full-time insured employment. States must pay up to 13 weeks of EB if the insured unemployment rate (IUR) reaches certain levels. Optional thresholds allow for additional weeks of benefits based on IUR and total unemployment rate (TUR) criteria. The Extended Benefit (EB) program requires claimants to have worked at least 20 weeks of full-time insured employment. States must pay up to 13 weeks of EB if the insured unemployment rate (IUR) reaches certain levels. Additional 20 weeks of benefits are provided if the TUR is at least 8% and at least 110% of the state's average TUR for the same 13 weeks in either of the previous two years. Claimants must be actively searching for work and available, not refuse suitable work offers, and have recorded 20 weeks of full-time insured employment or equivalent in insured wages during their base period. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contained provisions affecting EB, including a temporary change increasing the federal share to 100%. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included provisions for the Extended Benefit (EB) program, such as temporarily increasing federal funding to 100% and providing a $25 weekly benefit. States were also allowed to adjust eligibility requirements to expand EB coverage. Additionally, P.L. 111-312 made temporary changes to certain triggers in the EB program, allowing states to use lookback calculations based on three years of unemployment rate data. States implemented changes to their unemployment compensation laws by adjusting the lookback period for Extended Benefit (EB) triggers from two years to three years. This adjustment allowed states to avoid triggering off EB periods despite high, sustained unemployment rates. The temporary option to use a three-year lookback expired in December 2013. Congress has historically created federal temporary programs for extended unemployment compensation during economic recessions. Congress has established federal temporary programs of extended unemployment compensation eight times in history, with benefits ranging from 6 to 63 weeks. These programs consider state economic conditions and typically start after a recession has officially ended due to delays in recognizing recession start dates. The federal temporary programs of extended unemployment compensation have been established by Congress eight times in history, with benefits lasting from 6 to 63 weeks. These programs are usually implemented after a recession has officially ended, as there is often a delay in recognizing recession start dates. The response time to enact these programs is influenced by the severity of the recession and its impact on unemployment levels, with some programs being enacted before the unemployment rate peaked. In the Appendix, temporary unemployment programs like FSC and EUC had complex benefit triggers. The effectiveness of expanding UC benefits for economic stimulus was debated in the 110th Congress. Job loss leads to increased spending of benefits, making temporary unemployment benefits a potentially effective stimulus. Increasing the value or duration of unemployment benefits is seen as an effective economic stimulus, with estimates showing high multiplier effects. However, there are concerns that extending benefits may discourage recipients from seeking work. Making any extension temporary could help mitigate disincentives to work. The debate on extending unemployment benefits revolves around using measures like the insured unemployment rate or total unemployment rate as triggers for intervention. There is also discussion on whether the intervention should be at a national or state level, with consideration for other labor market measures like the increase in the number of unemployed from the previous year. A proposal to extend nationwide unemployment benefits based on the increase in the number of unemployed from the previous year has emerged. The President's 2010 budget suggested changes to the UC system, aligning with recommendations from the Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation. The Council highlighted declining UC recipients due to changing workforce demographics and state funding issues, affecting the reliability of the Insured Unemployment Rate (IUR) as an economic indicator. The Advisory Council recommended using a state TUR of 6.5% as an indicator for the EB program, criticizing the inefficiency of temporary federal extensions of unemployment benefits. They suggested avoiding historical comparisons or thresholds for indicators and proposed raising the FUTA tax base to $8,500 for additional funds. The President's budget proposals from 2012 to 2015 aimed to increase the federal unemployment tax base to $15,000 while lowering the tax rate. The Federal-State Extended Benefit Program, created by P.L. 91-373, assessed the labor market through IURs and TURs, with national and state triggers for extended UC benefits. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 eliminated the EB's federal trigger and changed the IUR measure to exclude those who had exhausted benefits or were receiving EB, making it a less generous measure of unemployment. Debate has centered on the IUR versus TUR as an EB trigger since the adoption of the permanent EB program in 1970. The IUR is calculated based on UC claims and state factors, not reflecting the state's economy accurately. In contrast, the TUR includes all actively seeking work, providing a broader measure of unemployment. The debate continues on using IUR or TUR as an EB trigger. The debate on EB triggers during recessions includes whether to base them on national, regional, state, or sub-state data. Congress has considered creating a nationwide extension of UC benefits or targeting only states with current economic difficulties. The debate on Extended Benefits (EB) triggers during recessions includes whether to base them on national, regional, state, or sub-state data. Congress has considered expanding benefits to states with higher unemployment rates, but there are arguments for national, regional, or sub-state triggers to better target benefits based on labor market conditions. Extended Benefits (EB) triggers during recessions are debated to determine whether they should be based on national, regional, state, or sub-state data. Arguments against regional and sub-state triggers include difficulties in defining appropriate boundaries and concerns about financing and administration obstacles. The state has traditionally been the operational unit for Unemployment Compensation (UC), raising concerns about accuracy and availability of benefits. In the 110th Congress, debate shifted away from using IUR or TUR as triggers for a national program, with consideration of other labor market measures. H.R. 4934, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008, proposed extending UC benefits for up to 26 weeks based on a significant increase in the number of unemployed individuals compared to the previous year. During the 110th Congress, the debate shifted to using other labor market measures as triggers for a national program, moving away from using IUR or TUR. H.R. 4934, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008, proposed extending UC benefits for up to 26 weeks based on a significant increase in the number of unemployed individuals compared to the previous year. Table A-5 in the Appendix provides information on the timing of recessions, changes in unemployment of at least 1 million compared with the previous year, and federal enactment of temporary extensions of benefits. The extensions of unemployment benefits typically take effect between 4 to 14 months after the onset of a recession, with changes in unemployment levels of at least 1 million occurring between 3 to 5 months after the recession begins. If the \"1 million\" trigger had been in place in the past, the extension of UC benefits would have been triggered 8 to 12 months earlier than it actually occurred. Figure 2 illustrates the changing levels of unemployment since 1979 and the corresponding unemployment rates for each year. Figure 2 illustrates changing levels of unemployment since 1979, using different scales for changes in unemployment levels and the unemployment rate. The scale for changes in unemployment levels is on the left y-axis, while the scale for the unemployment rate is on the right y-axis. Other measures of unemployment severity, such as workers exhausting UC benefits and long-term unemployed, are also considered. Figure 3 displays the change in the number of workers exhausting UC benefits. Figure 3 shows the change in the number of workers who exhaust UC benefits, while Figure 4 displays the change in the number of long-term unemployed individuals. There is a debate in Congress regarding benefit extension legislation and whether it should be subject to PAYGO requirements. Historical comparisons with previous extensions of temporary unemployment benefits are challenging due to differing internal House and Senate PAYGO rules that have evolved over time. The Congressional Research Service identified 11 laws that included reduced expenditures or increased revenues related to temporary unemployment benefits. Five laws increased the federal unemployment tax. Five laws increased the federal unemployment tax on employers, one law increased income tax on unemployment benefits received by individuals, and two laws increased withholding requirements for certain corporate income taxes. Another law required interest payments from states for federal loans to allow states to continue providing regular UC benefits. Additionally, new fees were required for certain federally guaranteed mortgages, and the EUC08 program was expanded from two to four tiers. Some laws increased federal unemployment taxes on employers and income taxes on unemployment benefits. Debate in Congress has focused on the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits compared to previous recessions. The EUC08 program was expanded from two to four tiers. During the EUC08 program, the maximum potential duration of unemployment benefits reached 99 weeks from December 2009 to August 2012. This was the highest compared to previous programs like TEUC in 2002 and 2003, which offered up to 72 weeks of benefits in some states from March 2002 to December 2003."
