    "content": "Title V of the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 is amended to include a section on the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at historically black colleges and universities. The section aims to identify and provide grants for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at historically black colleges and universities. Definitions for \"historically black college or university\" and \"historic building or structure\" are provided. The Secretary, through the National Trust for Historic Preservation, shall assess historic buildings at historically black colleges and universities and obtain cost estimates for their restoration. The Secretary awards grants to historically black colleges and universities for restoring historic buildings on their campuses. The grants cover the Federal share of restoration costs. The grants awarded to historically black colleges and universities cover the difference in restoration costs for historic buildings, with a limitation on the maximum grant amount. The Secretary considers the severity of threat to historic value and status of a building for grants, based on physical deterioration and demand for use. The grant recipient must agree to not alter the historic building without Secretary's approval for a specified period. The grant recipient must allow public access to the historic building for interpretive and educational purposes. They cannot receive additional funds under the National Historic Preservation Act and must provide the non-Federal share of project costs unless waived. The non-Federal share required for a project to restore a historic building is 30 percent, but can be waived for historically black colleges or universities with limited endowments. $60,000,000 from the Historic Preservation Fund will be allocated for this purpose. $60,000,000 from the Historic Preservation Fund will be allocated to the Secretary for historically black colleges or universities based on priority assessments."
