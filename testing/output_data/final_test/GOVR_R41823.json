    "content": "The report focuses on federal outlays for major \"need-tested\" programs, providing cash, food, housing, and educational and medical assistance to those with limited income. These programs had $606 billion in federal outlays in FY2013, representing 17.6% of all federal spending and 3.7% of GDP. The report also examines historical trends and the Congressional Budget Office's baseline budget projections for FY2014 through FY2024. The report focuses on federal outlays for major \"need-tested\" programs, providing cash, food, housing, and educational and medical assistance to those with limited income. These programs had $606 billion in federal outlays in FY2013, representing 17.6% of all federal spending and 3.7% of GDP. Need-tested programs provide benefits based on low financial resources, targeting different populations and purposes. They include basic needs like food, housing, and medical care, as well as student financial assistance. Additionally, other social programs benefit low-income individuals and families. The report focuses on nine major need-tested programs, including Medicaid/CHIP, which provide medical assistance to low-income families and individuals. These programs, along with subsidies for health care, aim to support those with limited income. Medicaid also covers nursing home care and has the option to expand coverage for able-bodied individuals. The federal poverty guidelines dictate Medicaid expenditures, including nursing home care for the elderly and disabled. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) covers low-income children without insurance. Medicaid/CHIP outlays in FY2013 accounted for 8.0% of federal outlays and 1.7% of GDP. The health insurance tax credit from the 2010 reform law helps individuals and families purchase insurance through state-based exchanges. Premium payments are capped for families below 400% of the poverty line. Low-income families below the poverty line have their premium payments capped at a percentage of their incomes, with the remainder covered by a refundable tax credit. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides income supplements for low-income families to purchase nutritious food. SNAP benefits are available to all low-income households, with some exceptions. In FY2013, SNAP outlays accounted for 2.4% of federal spending. Student Financial Assistance, including Pell Grants, provides funds to low-income students for post-secondary education. Awards are based on financial need analysis. In FY2013, outlays for student financial assistance totaled $34 billion, accounting for 1.0% of federal outlays and 0.2% of GDP. Compensatory Education (Title I-A) aids school districts with economically disadvantaged children to ensure quality education and academic proficiency. In FY2013, compensatory education grants totaled $16.8 billion, accounting for 0.5% of federal outlays and 0.1% of GDP. In FY2013, housing assistance outlays totaled $36 billion, accounting for 1.1% of federal outlays and 0.2% of GDP. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) provides an earnings supplement for low-wage earners, with the size of the credit dependent on family type and earnings. In FY2013, EITC outlays totaled $57 billion. In FY2013, EITC outlays of $57 billion accounted for 1.7% of all federal outlays and 0.4% of GDP. The Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) provides a refundable portion of the child tax credit to eligible parents with earned income above a certain threshold. In FY2013, ACTC outlays of $22 billion accounted for 0.6% of federal outlays and 0.1% of GDP. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) offers cash income for low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals. SSI outlays in FY2013 totaled $57 billion, representing 1.6% of federal outlays. In FY2013, family support outlays of $26 billion accounted for 0.8% of all federal outlays and 0.2% of GDP. This report focuses on federal outlays, while programs like Medicaid, SNAP, housing assistance, and family support are administered at the state or local level. States also contribute financially to these programs. Federal outlays for low-income assistance have generally increased over the past five decades, with spending in inflation-adjusted terms higher at the end of each decade. Excluding certain historically significant programs may understate historical spending levels and overstate growth since then. Training and employment programs, particularly public service employment in the late 1970s, were once a larger part of low-income aid. Federal outlays for low-income assistance have shown a long-term trend of increasing spending during economic downturns and periods of growth. Figure 1 displays federal outlays for major low-income assistance programs from FY1962 to FY2013, with projected outlays for FY2014 to FY2024. There were periods of significant growth, notably from FY2007 to FY2011 in response to the 2007-2009 recession. Spending declined from FY2011 to FY2012 as temporary funding increases expired. Total federal outlays for low-income health programs have historically increased at a rate of 12.7% per year, outpacing growth in other low-income assistance programs. However, during the recent recessionary period, non-health programs saw more rapid growth than health programs. Funding for these programs under ARRA expired during this period. In FY2013, federal outlays for health and non-health programs were below FY2011 levels. The temporary increase in the Medicaid matching rate expired, reducing federal Medicaid spending. CBO projects health outlays to grow at 6.9% annually, while low-income assistance spending will decline by 1.2% annually. Factors affecting low-income health care spending include healthcare cost increases and Medicaid enrollment growth. Medicaid enrollment growth was influenced by expansions in coverage for children and pregnant women with low incomes. Health care spending has been increasing at a faster rate compared to other need-tested aid programs, leading to a larger share of federal outlays. In FY1962, most need-tested aid was in the form of cash public assistance, but this has changed over the years. In FY2013, federal outlays for Medicaid and CHIP alone accounted for almost half (48%) of all federal outlays for major low-income assistance programs. By FY2024, health is projected to account for two-thirds of all dollars spent on major low-income assistance programs, including costs from the 2010 health reform law. The growth in health spending has overshadowed trends in non-health aid to low-income families. Inflation-adjusted outlays for non-health assistance programs have also increased over the past five decades, albeit at a slower rate. CBO projects a decline in real terms for these programs, except for SSI, in the next few years as the economy recovers from the 2007-2009 recession. Cash benefits dominated spending in the early years, with the largest growth in noncash benefits and services like Elementary and Secondary Education Aid and Higher Education Aid. The predecessor to Pell Grants, BEOG, was created in 1972. SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, began as a pilot program in 1961 and became permanent in 1964. Federal housing aid dates back to the Great Depression, with the Section 8 program established in 1974. The 1990s saw welfare reform and restructuring of low-income assistance programs. In the 1990s, welfare policies shifted towards supporting work among low-income parents through programs like TANF, EITC, and child tax credits. Aid to noncitizens was curtailed, but funding for child care subsidies for working parents was expanded. In the 2000s, aid expansions included the EITC and child tax credit, with increases in the child tax credit amount and refundable eligibility. Pell Grants were also modified in 2007 and 2010. Significant spending increases for low-income aid occurred in response to the 2007-2009 recession, with changes from automatic factors and legislation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 boosted the EITC for families with three or more children and expanded the refundable portion of the child tax credit. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased the child tax credit, SNAP benefits, Pell Grants, compensatory education funding, and TANF. Many ARRA provisions have expired, but changes to EITC and child credit have been extended. CBO projects a gradual decline in SNAP enrollment over the next decade. Federal outlays for low-income assistance programs are expected to decrease in real terms over the coming decade. Federal outlays for major low-income assistance programs have generally increased as a share of GDP over the past five decades, with fluctuations due to economic cycles. The longest period of decline as a percentage of GDP was in the late 1990s, with four consecutive years of decrease. Outlay growth for these programs increased slower than overall economic growth in FY2011. In FY2011, federal outlays for low-income assistance programs as a percentage of GDP reached 4.1%, falling back to 3.7% but rising again to 4.1% in FY2017. Health care spending drives this increase, while non-health program outlays drop below pre-recession levels by FY2020. Total federal spending on need-tested programs has increased, with a trend towards a greater share of total federal spending. The major need-tested programs have seen an increase in federal spending, with a peak at 17.6% of total outlays in FY2013. By FY2017, federal outlays for these programs would peak at 19.6% before declining. Federal aid for low income initially focused on grants to states for public assistance in FY1962. The Social Security Act of 1935 established grant-in-aid programs for the low-income aged, blind, and families with dependent children. Additional programs for low-income disabled persons were added in 1950. Since the 1960s, there have been significant expansions in noncash medical, food, and housing assistance for low-income families. The Great Society era also saw increased educational aid for low-income children and grants to help students from low-income families attend college. Medicaid and State Children's Health programs have become dominant in spending for low-income families. In the 1970s, federal government took on costs for cash income floor for aged, blind, and disabled. Food stamp program and housing aid became 100% federally funded. Expansion of aid in 1990s and 2000s was through refundable tax credits for families with children. Medicaid and CHIP costs are shared with states. The Medicaid and CHIP expansions in the 1980s and 1990s targeted families with children who were not on cash assistance and had earnings. Low-income aid is increasingly focused on health care, with Medicaid, CHIP, and health care tax credits accounting for two-thirds of spending by 2024. The curr_chunk discusses various CRS reports on federal benefits and services for people with low income, including Medicaid, health insurance exchanges, Pell Grant Program, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and federal housing assistance programs. The curr_chunk provides an overview of CRS reports on federal programs for low-income assistance, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block Grant, and welfare status of female-headed families with children. The spending trends are based on 9 out of the 10 largest programs catalogued in a CRS report on federal benefits for people with low income. The curr_chunk provides information on federal need-based programs with $100 million or more in obligations in FY2008 or FY2009, complementing a previous CRS report on long-term spending trends. The 10 largest need-tested programs discussed include Medicaid, SNAP, SSI, EITC, Pell Grants, ACTC, Title I-A Education for the Disadvantaged, Medicare Part D, TANF, and Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. The report uses federal obligations as a measure of spending, acknowledging challenges in tracking obligations consistently over time. The report discusses federal spending trends on major need-based programs with obligations of $100 million or more in FY2008 or FY2009. It highlights challenges in tracking obligations consistently over time and emphasizes the use of outlays as a measure of federal spending. The Office of Management and Budget and Congressional Budget Office provide historical outlay data for budget accounts, but outlays may not always reflect program-level activity accurately. Combining multiple accounts is sometimes necessary to ensure consistent measures of spending over time. The federal outlays for major income assistance programs are shown in Table A-1, with Medicaid and CHIP combined due to some CHIP programs being expansions of Medicaid. Housing assistance combines various accounts and represents more spending than Section 8 vouchers. The composition of housing aid has changed over the years, requiring a combination of rent vouchers and support for families in public housing. The \"Family Support\" account includes more than TANF, incorporating Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the Child Support Enforcement program, and child care for families. The \"Family Support\" category includes TANF, CSE, and child care programs for families receiving or at risk of receiving cash assistance. TANF consolidated funding for employment services and education, including the JOBS program. Pell Grants, SEOGs, and college work study programs are part of the \"Student Financial Assistance\" account. Title I-A grants to school districts are the main component of the \"Compensatory Education\" account. The Title I-A grants provide funding to school districts with low-income children, along with School Improvement Grants, Even Start, and the High School Graduation initiative. The Medicare Part D low-income subsidy is not included in this report, as it is part of the larger budget account for the Medicare prescription drug program. The CRS Report did not use federal budget information for this program, instead relying on the annual report of the Medicare trustees."
