    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Trade Adjustment Assistance Accountability Act of 2011\" and includes amendments to the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Accountability Act of 2011 amends the Trade Act of 1974 by extending the Assistance Program for Workers until September 30, 2014. It also includes provisions for notifying petitioners of investigations and procedural matters related to the Secretary's determinations. The Secretary must gather necessary information from the workers' firm, customers, or petitioner to certify a group of workers under section 223. Additional information may be obtained by contacting officials or employees of the workers' firm, customers, or recognized unions. The Secretary gathers information from various sources to certify a group of workers under section 223, including unions, one-stop operators, and other available sources. Verification of information is required through certification by the firm or customer. The Secretary collects information from different sources to certify workers under section 223, including questionnaires from firms or customers. The Secretary must have a reasonable basis for relying on this information unless it is deemed accurate and complete without certification. Confidential business information obtained under this paragraph cannot be released without consent. The Secretary can only release confidential business information if the firm or customer consents or if the information is provided to a court under a protective order. If a petition for certification is denied and the petitioner appeals, the Secretary must notify the petitioner. The Secretary must notify the petitioner of any adverse information submitted during an investigation and allow the petitioner to review relevant documents. The petitioner can submit a rebuttal before the Secretary reviews the appeal. Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 specify the timeline for initial determinations. Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 require the Secretary to provide timely notifications to petitioners regarding the status of their petition, including the current stage of the investigation, outstanding requests for information, reasons for any delays, and the expected date of the final determination. The effective date for these changes is September 30, 2014. The amendments made to the Trade Act of 1974 require timely notifications to petitioners about their petition status. The effective date for these changes is September 30, 2014, with specific provisions for petitions filed before or after the enactment of the Act."
