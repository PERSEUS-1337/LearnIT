    "content": "Priority review for breakthrough devices is being introduced in Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This includes amending section 515(d) by removing paragraph (5) and redesignating paragraph (6) as paragraph (5). Additionally, a new section 515B is being inserted after section 515A to establish priority review for breakthrough devices. The Secretary will establish a program for priority review of devices that are breakthrough technologies, have no approved alternatives, offer significant advantages over existing alternatives, or are in the best interest of patients. The Secretary may designate a device for priority review if it meets certain criteria, such as being a breakthrough technology, having no approved alternatives, offering significant advantages over existing alternatives, or being in the best interest of patients. Requests for designation can be made before submitting an application, petition, or notification. Within 60 days of receiving a request, the Secretary will determine if the device qualifies for priority review. The review of a request for priority review by the FDA is conducted by an experienced team chaired by a senior manager. The determination of approval or denial is considered significant, and a written summary of the decision basis is provided. Reconsideration of a denial can be requested within 30 days, following specific procedures outlined in section 517A. The FDA may reconsider a designation determination based on document submission or a meeting. Withdrawal of a priority review designation is not allowed if criteria are no longer met due to clearance or approval of another designated device. Priority Review for designated devices involves assigning a team of staff, providing oversight by senior agency personnel, and adopting an efficient dispute resolution process. The FDA's priority review process for designated devices includes interactive communication with the sponsor, expediting manufacturing compliance review, disclosing consultation topics in advance, providing advisory committee input, and involving external experts as recommended by the sponsor. The FDA collaborates with device sponsors to expedite the development and review of designated devices by coordinating on data development plans and ensuring design compliance. The FDA works with device sponsors to speed up the development and review process by implementing efficient clinical trial designs, utilizing timely postmarket data collection, and agreeing to binding clinical protocols. The FDA collaborates with device sponsors to expedite the review process by making agreed changes, addressing public health risks, and identifying essential scientific issues. Priority Review Guidance includes the process for seeking designation and a template for requests. The FDA provides guidance on priority review for medical devices, including criteria for evaluation, standards for review team assignment, and public comment before finalization. The purpose is to expedite development and review processes efficiently. The FDA prioritizes the review of devices representing breakthrough technologies, maintaining existing evaluation criteria and standards. The agency retains the authority to act on applications before completion of inspections as deemed necessary. The FDA updates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include a new designation request under section 515B."
