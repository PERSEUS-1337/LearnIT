    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new part called the Educational Opportunity Demonstration Program. This new part includes a section with a short title, findings, and purposes. The Educational Opportunity Demonstration Act, also known as the EODA, aims to address educational disparities for low-income students. The Act emphasizes the importance of providing high-quality education for all children and explores innovative methods to improve academic and behavioral outcomes, such as same-gender classes and schools. The need for extensive data on same-gender classes and schools to determine their effectiveness, despite legal challenges hindering recent experimentation efforts. The purpose of allowing same-gender classes for low-income, educationally disadvantaged students is to experiment and determine their impact on educational achievement and opportunities. This initiative aims to collect data on the effectiveness of such classes in educating children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The purpose of allowing same-gender classes for low-income, educationally disadvantaged individuals is to involve parents in the educational options and choices of their children. \"SEC. 1702. DEFINITIONS.\" The term 'educational opportunity school' refers to a public school that offers voluntary same-gender classes for boys and girls, as well as a coeducational option. Parents can choose to send their child to a same-gender or coeducational class, and students are admitted based on a lottery system if there are more applicants. The term 'educational opportunity school' offers same-gender classes for boys and girls, with a coeducational option. The school has a program where community members volunteer in same-gender classes. The school aims to improve achievement for all children based on specific educational objectives. An 'educational opportunity advisory board' is established to oversee these objectives. \"SEC. 1703. WAIVER AUTHORITY.\" The Secretary has the authority to waive certain requirements of laws prohibiting sex discrimination for approved local educational agencies and educational opportunity schools to establish single-gender classes, with waivers lasting up to 5 years. Each local educational agency receiving a waiver under this part must establish an educational opportunity advisory board composed of school administrators, parents, teachers, local government officials, and volunteers. The advisory board assists in developing the application and provides guidance for the functioning of the educational opportunity school. \"SEC. 1704. APPLICATIONS.\" Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary within 180 days of the enactment of the Educational Opportunity Demonstration Act to request a waiver. The application can be for a single educational opportunity school or a consortium of schools and must include details about the educational program, grade levels, curriculum, and instructional practices. The application for a waiver under the Educational Opportunity Demonstration Act must include details on curriculum, instructional practices, objectives, monitoring progress, involvement of school personnel and private sector, and justification for any waivers of federal requirements. The application for a waiver under the Educational Opportunity Demonstration Act must include details on necessary Federal, State, and local requirements that will be waived for the educational opportunity school, how students will be informed about the school and voluntary same gender classes, and an assurance of providing necessary information for progress evaluation. The educational opportunity school must provide assurances of cooperation with the Secretary in evaluating waivers, resources used equally for same gender classes, and ensuring activities do not adversely affect either sex. The educational opportunity school must provide assurances of compliance with research protocols, along with other required information by the Secretary. The Secretary selects grantees based on the quality of applications, including curriculum, school management, progress assessment plans, community support, likelihood of meeting objectives, and assurances. A study and report are also required. The Secretary will conduct a study comparing educational outcomes of students in same gender classes and coeducational settings, with a report due to Congress within a year. The text discusses amendments to various sections of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, changing references from section numbers 1603 to 1703.
