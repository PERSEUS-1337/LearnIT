    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Puget Sound Recovery Act of 2008\". It includes findings related to the Puget Sound region. The Congress acknowledges the importance of Puget Sound as a vital ecosystem facing declining water quality and endangered species. Efforts by the State of Washington to address these issues are recognized, and the Federal Government is urged to match these efforts. The Environmental Protection Agency should lead the creation of a recovery package for Puget Sound, in coordination with a conservation plan. Other Federal agencies involved should include Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Geological Survey, Forest Service, and others. The Puget Sound recovery plan should be included in the President's annual budget as a model of science-based coordination. Canada should participate in the coordinated efforts for Puget Sound and the Georgia Straits, emphasizing monitoring, assessment, and achieving goals. Title I of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include a new section, SEC. 123, focusing on Puget Sound. The Administrator shall establish a Puget Sound Program Office in the Environmental Protection Agency, headed by a Director with expertise in Puget Sound issues. The Director will be located in Washington and delegated necessary authority and staff to carry out duties related to Puget Sound. The Director will assist the Puget Sound management conference in implementing the comprehensive conservation and management plan, promoting innovative methodologies, and coordinating efforts related to watershed general permits. The Director will coordinate federal functions related to the Comprehensive Plan, conduct necessary studies and research, manage environmental data, and coordinate authorized programs for Puget Sound. The Director will coordinate federal functions related to the Comprehensive Plan, conduct studies, manage environmental data, and coordinate authorized programs for Puget Sound. This includes coordinating activities with Canadian authorities, implementing responsibilities with other Federal agencies, collecting and sharing relevant information, and issuing biennial reports to Congress on the progress of the Comprehensive Plan. The Director will coordinate federal functions related to the Comprehensive Plan, conduct studies, manage environmental data, and coordinate authorized programs for Puget Sound. This includes specific recommendations concerning the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan, studies on population growth, wastewater treatment facilities, nutrient removal methods in sewage treatment plants, and contaminated sediments and dredging activities. The Director will coordinate federal functions related to the Comprehensive Plan for Puget Sound, including recommendations on population growth, wastewater treatment facilities, nutrient removal in sewage plants, and various environmental concerns such as contaminated sediments, nonpoint source pollution, wetland protection, flood abatement, forest and agricultural impacts, atmospheric deposition, and water quality requirements for fish and wildlife populations. The Director will assess environmental quality using indicator species, evaluate state water quality programs, explore long-term financing for wastewater projects, address water usage efficiency, toxic pollutants, and other relevant areas. Implementation methods may include interagency agreements and grants for the Comprehensive Plan. The Administrator may provide grants for projects and studies to implement the Comprehensive Plan, including planning, research, construction, and citizen involvement. The Federal share of the project cost should not exceed 50 percent, and eligible recipients are defined as water pollution control agencies at various levels of government. The Administrator may make grants for projects addressing sewage and stormwater discharges into the Puget Sound watershed. Eligible projects include those providing treatment or minimizing discharges using various approaches like decentralized stormwater controls, wastewater treatment, and wetlands restoration. The Administrator awards grants on a competitive basis, with priority given to projects in distressed communities. The Federal share of project costs shall not exceed 75% or 100% for projects in distressed communities. In distressed communities, the subsection limits project funding to 100% of the cost. Definitions for eligible recipient and distressed community are provided. The President must include an annual budget plan. The President must include information on each Federal agency involved in Puget Sound protection and restoration in the annual budget, including interagency crosscut budgets displaying past, current, and proposed funding for these activities. The President must include information on Federal agencies involved in Puget Sound protection and restoration in the annual budget, including interagency crosscut budgets displaying funding for these activities. Coordination with the Conference is required, and authorizations are provided for necessary appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2013."
