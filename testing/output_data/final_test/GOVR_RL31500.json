    "content": "Title VIII, Subtitle E, \u00c2\u00a7841 of P.L. 107-296 introduces a new HRM system for the Department of Homeland Security, which must adhere to public employment principles and cannot waive merit-based hiring or other key protections for employees. The curr_chunk discusses various provisions of law related to prohibited personnel practices, equal employment opportunity, employee rights, and specific chapters within Title 5 United States Code. The use of a category rating system for evaluating applicants in the competitive service is permitted under the new system. Limitations on pay include not modifying pay for employees in certain positions or exceeding maximum cash compensation limits. Employees of the Department of Homeland Security are entitled to fair treatment in appellate procedures. Employees of the Department of Homeland Security are entitled to fair treatment in appeals procedures, ensuring due process and consultation with the Merit Systems Protection Board for regulations related to chapter 77. Regulations must provide expeditious handling of matters involving the Department of Homeland Security. Regulations under chapter 77 must ensure fair, efficient, and expeditious resolution of Department of Homeland Security matters. Authority to issue regulations must cease five years after the transition period. Personnel transfers should not result in separation or reduction in grade or compensation for one year. Any person transferred to the Department of Homeland Security from a position on the Executive Schedule must maintain their previous compensation for one year. The establishment of an HRM system for the new department must comply with this requirement. Employees at the Department should be involved in creating the human resources management system as they have direct knowledge of their jobs and a vested interest in its success. Collaboration with employees is crucial for the 21st-century HR system envisioned for the Department. Title XIII of P.L. 107-296 authorizes Chief Human Capital Officer positions in federal agencies and reforms in human capital management. Subtitle A, \u00c2\u00a71301 of P.L. 107-296, known as the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002, mandates the appointment of Agency Chief Human Capital Officers in specified government departments to oversee workforce management in accordance with merit system principles and relevant laws. The Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 mandates the appointment of Agency Chief Human Capital Officers in various government departments to oversee workforce management. These departments include Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, and others. The Act outlines six functions for CHCOs, such as setting the agency's workforce development strategy and aligning human resources policies with organizational goals. The Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 mandates the appointment of Agency Chief Human Capital Officers in government departments to oversee workforce management. CHCOs are responsible for continuous learning, best practices, measuring intellectual capital, and accessing necessary information for their duties. The CHCO Council, comprised of Agency Chief Human Capital Officers, meets periodically to advise on modernizing human resources systems, improving information quality, and addressing legislation. Representatives of federal employee labor organizations must attend at least one meeting annually. The Council submits an annual report to Congress and OPM is required to design systems for assessing human capital management in federal agencies. The CHCO Council, made up of Agency Chief Human Capital Officers, advises on modernizing HR systems, improving information quality, and addressing legislation. Federal agencies must define systems aligning human capital strategies with missions, closing skill gaps, ensuring leadership continuity, cultivating a high-performing workforce, implementing knowledge management, and holding managers accountable. The CHCO provisions took effect 180 days after the act's enactment on May 24, 2003. The CHCO Council, consisting of Agency Chief Human Capital Officers, advises on modernizing HR systems, improving information quality, and addressing legislation. Federal agencies are encouraged to use personnel flexibilities, focus on career development, recruitment, retention, and continuity of operations during emergencies. Subtitle B of Title XIII of P.L. 107-296 includes reforms related to federal human capital management, such as Agency Human Capital Strategic Planning in Performance Plans and Program Performance Reports. The CHCO Council advises on modernizing HR systems and improving information quality. Federal agencies are encouraged to focus on career development, recruitment, retention, and continuity of operations during emergencies. Reforms related to federal human capital management include Agency Human Capital Strategic Planning in Performance Plans and Program Performance Reports. CHCOs must prepare the annual performance plan and agencies are required to review performance goals and evaluation in program performance reports. The law also allows agencies to appoint candidates directly to positions without public notice. Section 1312 introduces alternative ranking and selection procedures for evaluating applicants for positions in the competitive service. OPM may establish category rating systems based on merit, where applicants are evaluated under quality categories rather than individual numerical ratings. Veterans' preference eligible applicants are prioritized within each quality category. Each agency with a category rating system must prioritize disabled veterans with a compensable service-connected disability of 10% or more in the highest quality category. The appointing official can select from the highest quality category or a merged category if fewer than three candidates are in the highest category. Preference eligibles cannot be passed over unless specific requirements are met. The report to Congress includes information on the impact of the hiring system on veterans and minorities, as well as manager training. OPM could create regulations to implement the provisions. The law also allows student volunteers to be eligible for a transit subsidy and amends provisions on academic training. The agency can provide academic degree training and cover costs from available funds to meet training needs, resolve staffing issues, or achieve strategic goals. The training must be part of a structured employee development program, accredited by a recognized body, and promote workforce diversity. The agency must provide effective education and training to improve organizational and individual performance, ensuring it is not solely for academic degree attainment or specific job qualifications. Online degree training should be facilitated, and provisions for voluntary separation incentives are included in P.L. 107-296. Subtitle H, \u00c2\u00a7881 of P.L. 107-296 mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to review pay and benefit plans of agencies transferred to the new department, aiming to eliminate disparities in pay within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Congress is ensuring the elimination of disparities in pay and benefits within the Department of Homeland Security, especially among law enforcement personnel. A report was submitted to Congress on March 5, 2003, focusing on identifying differences in pay and benefits among employees transferring to DHS. Secretary Tom Ridge stated that DHS plans to address pay disparities within the new human resources system design. Specific conclusions and recommendations on eliminating these differences will be included in a future HRM systems proposal. The Bush Administration published a Reorganization Plan for the Department of Homeland Security on November 25, 2002. Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge addressed disparities in pay and benefits among law enforcement personnel during a hearing on federal law enforcement personnel in July 2003. Kay Frances Dolan, director of human resources policy at DHS, highlighted challenges in integrating various agencies into DHS, including differences in policies on pay and benefits. In 2002, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge was nominated by President Bush to head the department. He conducted a town hall meeting with future employees on December 17, 2002. The Senate confirmed him as the Secretary of Homeland Security on January 22, 2003, and he was sworn into office on January 24, 2003. The department had 183,000 employees in 2004 according to the Budget of the United States for FY2005. The Department of Homeland Security, with 183,000 employees in 2004, established working groups in December 2002 to develop a new personnel system. OPM aimed to have a draft proposal by June 1, 2003, but missed the deadline due to delays in decision-making. Homeland Security officials and federal union leaders are working on setting up a new personnel system. The process for designing the system was launched by Secretary Tom Ridge and OPM Director Kay Coles James in April 2003. The goal is to create a modern personnel system while preserving civil service principles. A Senior Review Committee will develop options for consideration by the Secretary and Director. A committee including key officials, union leaders, and experts will develop personnel system options for consideration. A Design Team will conduct research and outreach to provide a range of options, with input from DHS program managers, union representatives, and private sector consultants. The process aims to be inclusive and seek input from DHS stakeholders. The design team, led by Hale, conducted field meetings in various cities to gather input from over 2,000 DHS employees on issues like pay and performance management. The team reported to the Senior Review Committee in July 2003. The design team, led by Hale, gathered input from over 2,000 DHS employees on pay and performance management issues. Steven Cohen, senior adviser for homeland security at OPM, mentioned the design process being open with 52 options presented to the Senior Review Committee. None of the options had consensus and did not cover the Senior Executive Service. Options were grouped into categories like Pay, Performance Management, and Classification, and Labor Relations. The options presented for Labor Relations, Adverse Actions, and Appeals included choices like continuing or amending the current pay system, establishing a compensation system based on pay bands, and creating procedures for alternative dispute resolution. These options were developed assuming that DHS employees covered by title 5, United States Code, will remain covered by those provisions unless DHS and OPM jointly decide otherwise. The Senior Review Committee examined options for Labor Relations, Adverse Actions, and Appeals for DHS employees covered by title 5. A summary of the meeting posted on OPM's website outlined six core design principles for the new HRM system. The Senior Review Committee presented design principles for the new HRM system to the Secretary and Director in late 2003. Proposed regulations for job evaluation, pay, performance management, and more were issued by DHS and OPM in February 2004, open for public comment until March 22, 2004. The proposed regulations for the new personnel system at DHS will cover 110,000 employees, excluding certain groups like military personnel and screeners. Blue-collar workers and Senior Executive Service members will keep their current pay systems but be subject to other provisions of the new system. Implementation will occur in phases, starting with 8,000 employees primarily from DHS headquarters and nonmilitary Coast Guard members. The proposed regulations for the new personnel system at DHS will cover 110,000 employees, excluding certain groups like military personnel and screeners. Implementation will occur in phases, starting with 8,000 employees primarily from DHS headquarters and nonmilitary Coast Guard members in fall 2004 and the remainder in fall 2005. The regulations do not change the Civil Service merit system principles, retirement, health or life insurance policies, or leave entitlements. Jobs will not be eliminated, but job evaluation will organize jobs into clusters by major occupational groups. The current General Schedule pay system will be abolished, and within-grade pay increases based on time in a pay grade will no longer be provided. The new personnel system at DHS will establish open pay bands within each occupational cluster, with four levels - entry level, full performance, senior expert, and first level supervisor. Salaries will be based on local labor market rates, and progression through pay bands will be based on performance or enhanced skill level. Pay adjustments will be annual and based on labor market conditions, department mission, availability of funds, and pay adjustments in other agencies. Additionally, there will be a locality pay adjustment based on private sector job pay rates in the same area. The new personnel system at DHS will establish open pay bands within each occupational cluster, with four levels - entry level, full performance, senior expert, and first level supervisor. Salaries will be based on local labor market rates, and progression through pay bands will be based on performance or enhanced skill level. Pay adjustments will be annual and tied to performance ratings, with additional performance-based pay increases for outstanding performers. Various types of performance bonuses may also be awarded based on funding availability. Performance appraisals will be linked to the DHS mission and specific job standards. The proposed HRM system at DHS will have three or four rating levels based on job assignments, with no quotas or forced distribution of ratings. Managers will be trained to appraise employee performance, overseen by a Performance Review Board. Performance ratings can be grieved and appealed. Congressional subcommittees have scheduled a joint hearing on the system, with a proposed funding of $133.5 million for implementation. The proposed HRM system at DHS includes funding for performance-based pay, training, and IT framework development. Websites have been established for public and internal use. Memoranda of Agreements with other federal departments ensure support functions until DHS infrastructure is ready. President Bush appointed Ronald James as the Chief Human Capital Officer for DHS. The CHCO position was created under P.L. 107-296 as a presidential appointment reporting to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Responsibilities include ensuring employee rights under relevant laws, achieving certification of compliance, and informing Congress within 24 months of enactment. Laura Callahan, appointed as deputy CIO at DHS, was placed on administrative leave due to academic credential issues. Laura Callahan was placed on paid administrative leave by the department on June 5, 2003, after questions arose about her academic credentials from Hamilton University in Evanston, Wyoming. The university was not accredited by the U.S. Department of Education. Several Members of Congress raised concerns about the establishment of the new human resources management system at the Department of Homeland Security during hearings in April and May 2003. A hearing on human capital management at DHS was conducted on October 29, 2003 by the House Civil Service and Agency Organization Subcommittee. Testimonies from the Chief Human Capital Officer at DHS, the co-chair of the Senior Review Committee and OPM Senior Advisor for Homeland Security, and union representatives were heard. Recommendations were made for the Department of Homeland Security to adopt pay banding, critical pay authorities, category ranking systems for hiring, and voluntary separation incentive payments. The Brookings Institution highlighted the challenge of integrating numerous incompatible management systems within the agencies being transferred to the new department. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse report examined staffing at DHS, finding 160,201 employees on the payroll as of March 2003. Various agencies transferred to DHS included Transportation Security Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Customs Service, FEMA, U.S. Coast Guard, Secret Service, and others. The report examined staffing at DHS, finding 160,201 employees on the payroll as of March 2003. Employees were transferred from various agencies to DHS, including TSA, INS, Customs, FEMA, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. Within DHS, employees are classified under different occupational specialties, with the majority being safety technicians, plant protection and quarantine, investigators, and border patrol agents. Airport screeners make up a significant portion of full-time employees. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employs a diverse range of full-time and part-time staff, including criminal investigators, intelligence officers, funeral directors, pharmacists, anthropologists, fingerprint specialists, and chaplains. Administrative law judges earn the highest salary, followed by criminal investigators and airport screeners. Research by Peter Frumpkin from Harvard University highlights key steps for successful public sector mergers, emphasizing the importance of understanding cultural issues and open communication with stakeholders. Peter Frumpkin from Harvard University emphasizes the importance of communication, quick implementation, creating a new culture, and adjusting over time in implementing mergers in the public sector. Changing an organization's culture involves breaking free from existing routines and traditions while selectively adopting positive cultural artifacts. The General Accounting Office (GAO) evaluated the process of designing the new human resources management system at DHS, recommending that the options selected support the department's strategic goals. The DHS Secretary is advised to ensure consistent communication and employee involvement throughout the design process and implementation. The design process for the new human resources management system at DHS emphasized feedback and buy-in from front-line employees. An issue to consider is how to merge the automated HR and payroll systems from various agencies if a consolidation of services were to occur. Prior to the transfer of employees to DHS, HRM offices at six agencies provided services, with some agencies like TSA receiving services from the Transportation Administration Service Center. The Federal Protective Services had personnel representatives in Washington, DC and 11 regional offices. Various HRM offices had different numbers of employees, including APHIS with 180 employees, FEMA with 93 employees, TSA with 15 employees (expected to increase to 45-50), Coast Guard with 400 employees at headquarters and 2,600-2,700 in the field, Customs Service with 268 employees, INS with approximately 552 employees in DC and other locations, and Secret Service with 407 employees. All HRM offices, except TSA, reported providing services. The HRM offices provided various personnel services including staffing, position classification, payroll preparation, employee relations, labor relations, processing of personnel actions, benefits counseling, and policy development. Governor Ridge emphasized the need for the Secretary of Homeland Security to have re-deployment and reorganizational authority for operational effectiveness. A consolidated human resources management office could serve agencies transferred to a new department. The potential redeployment of HRM employees to serve agencies transferred to a new department may not require all current employees. Details on retraining or reassignments have not been provided."
