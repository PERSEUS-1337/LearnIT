They control the flow of heroin across the Southwest border, mainly through privately owned vehicles at legal ports of entry. This marks a shift from Colombian criminal organizations that historically dominated the U.S. heroin market. The DEA reports that Mexican traffickers now supply most of the heroin in the U.S., with a 35% increase in poppy cultivation from 2016 to 2017. Mexican traffickers have expanded their role in the U.S. heroin market, producing white powder heroin in addition to black tar and brown powder heroin. Mexican drug traffickers produce white powder heroin and distribute it in both eastern and western U.S. markets. They collaborate with U.S. gangs to facilitate drug distribution. Heroin seizures in the U.S., mostly originating from Mexico, have increased over the past decade. Gangs are involved in selling various types of drugs besides heroin. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has outlined how seizure data can be used as a drug market indicator. Heroin seizures in the United States have been increasing, with an average purity of retail-level heroin between 31% and 39% from 2012 to 2016. The UNODC's model can help assess the scope of the heroin market in the U.S. The purity of heroin in the United States has remained elevated compared to the 1980s, while the retail price per gram has stayed lower. This suggests an increased heroin supply for the U.S. market, with experts noting a rise in Mexican heroin production destined for the U.S. The increase in seizures may be due to enhanced law enforcement efforts or less stringent concealment by traffickers and buyers. DEA data shows a significant number of heroin-related arrests in 2017, mostly for trafficking offenses. In 2017, the DEA made 5,408 heroin-related arrests, with the majority for conspiracy, distribution, possession with intent, and simple possession. Other offense categories included importation, manufacture, RICO, and CCE. Heroin arrests increased through 2015 before declining in 2017. The U.S. Sentencing Commission reported 2,658 individuals sentenced for heroin trafficking offenses in FY2017, a decrease from the previous year. In FY2017, 2,658 individuals were sentenced for heroin trafficking, accounting for 13.8% of drug trafficking cases in U.S. District Courts. Prescription opioid abuse may be a gateway to heroin use, with a higher incidence rate among those who previously used nonmedical pain relievers. The 2016 National Heroin Threat Assessment Summary states that about 4% of prescription drug abusers may transition to heroin use due to cost factors. Drug trafficking organizations have responded to the demand for cheaper opioids by shifting heroin operations to areas with high nonmedical prescription drug use. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is much stronger than heroin and morphine, with legal and illegal forms available. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is more potent than morphine and heroin. It is available in legal forms for medical use and illegal forms sold on the black market. Non-pharmaceutical fentanyl is often mixed with heroin, leading to overdose cases. Most fentanyl-related overdoses in the US are linked to non-pharmaceutical fentanyl, which is manufactured in China. Non-pharmaceutical fentanyl, manufactured in China and Mexico, is trafficked into the US through various means. Fentanyl-related substances, similar to fentanyl but with minor chemical variations, are attractive to traffickers as they can be sold as heroin or pressed into counterfeit pills. Law enforcement is concerned about the risks of fentanyl being pressed into counterfeit pills due to the larger population of prescription pain pill abusers. The United States addresses the drug problem through law enforcement initiatives, prevention, and treatment efforts. Specifically targeting trafficking, the DEA has a 360 Strategy to combat the cycle of violence and addiction linked to drug cartels and gangs. The strategy, launched in Pittsburgh in 2015, aims to curb heroin trafficking and has expanded to other cities. The DEA's 360 Strategy, launched in Pittsburgh in 2015, aims to combat heroin trafficking by leveraging law enforcement, diversion control, and community outreach organizations. The program includes the heroin signature program (HSP) and heroin domestic monitor program (HDMP) to identify the geographic source of heroin in the United States through chemical analysis of seized samples. The HDMP assesses the geographic source of retail-level heroin seized in the United States by sampling heroin from 27 cities. The program started in 1979 and tests 600-900 samples annually. In 2016, 86% of the heroin analyzed was from Mexico, 4% from South America, and less than 1% from Southwest Asia. Mexican white powder heroin had an average purity of 82%. The DEA analyzes heroin and fentanyl samples to track trafficking networks. Mexican white powder heroin has 39.7% purity, while fentanyl from China is over 90% pure. HIDTA program aids law enforcement at all levels. The HIDTA program aids law enforcement agencies at federal, state, local, and tribal levels in critical drug trafficking areas. Administered by ONDCP, it aims to reduce drug production and trafficking through coordination, intelligence sharing, and promoting effective enforcement operations and strategies. The HIDTA program, administered by ONDCP, supports regional initiatives targeting the most pressing drug threats in each area. In 2015, ONDCP launched the Heroin Response Strategy (HRS) to reduce drug overdose fatalities and disrupt trafficking in illicit opioids through a multi-HIDTA, cross-disciplinary approach. The HRS coordinates teams of drug intelligence officers and public health analysts to provide information on drug trafficking and use, as well as prevention activities. The OCDETF program targets major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations with the intent to disrupt and dismantle them. Federal agencies participating in the program include DEA, FBI, ATF, U.S. Marshals, IRS, ICE, USCG, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, and DOJ's Criminal Division. They collaborate with state and local law enforcement on task forces, with 14 strike forces nationwide and an OCDETF Fusion Center for intelligence gathering and analysis. During FY2017, 20% of active OCDETF investigations were linked to CPOTs, with 50% involving heroin trafficking. The COPS Office's AHTF Program provides funding to investigate heroin and diverted prescription opioids trafficking, focusing solely on enforcement efforts. The AHTF Program focuses on trafficking and distribution, funding state law enforcement agencies with multi-jurisdictional reach. Data on heroin trafficking flows are incomplete but can provide insight into production, price, purity, and seizures. Understanding trafficking flows to the US relies on data from source countries like Mexico. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime notes limited information on opium poppy cultivation in the Americas. Mexico's opium poppy cultivation increased by 38% in 2017, potentially yielding 111 metric tons of pure heroin. U.S. officials state that heroin production in Mexico has risen, with much of it destined for the United States. Data on seizures reflect an unknown portion of total drugs entering the U.S. Officials in the United States have limited data on drug seizures, which do not fully capture the extent of drugs entering the country. The accuracy of heroin trafficking data is imprecise, making it challenging for policymakers to counter the flow of heroin. Despite the health risks posed by heroin, federal law enforcement seizures of the drug have been increasing in recent years. Federal law enforcement seizures of heroin have generally increased in recent years, with changes in trafficking patterns along the Southwest border. Seizures have risen both nationally and along the border, but it is unclear if enforcement efforts are effectively targeting heroin trafficking networks. Policymakers may question the nimbleness of enforcement efforts in responding to these changes. Policymakers may question if heroin enforcement efforts are nimble enough to respond to shifts in trafficking patterns and maximize seizures in areas where heroin flows are increasing. The responsibility for curbing heroin production and trafficking primarily lies with source countries. Evaluating the balance of resources targeted toward domestic efforts versus international strategies is crucial in effectively combating heroin trafficking in the United States. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is responsible for coordinating federal drug control policy and producing the annual National Drug Control Strategy. The 2016 strategy prioritizes seven approaches to reduce illicit drug use and its consequences, including preventing drug use in communities, early intervention in healthcare, and increasing access to treatment. The 2016 National Drug Control Strategy focuses on various approaches to address drug issues, including early intervention in healthcare, increasing access to treatment, reforming the criminal justice system, disrupting drug trafficking, and improving information systems. These approaches aim to counter the top drug threats, particularly the opioid epidemic caused by overprescribing and increased supply of opioids. The opioid epidemic was worsened by the increase in heroin supply from Mexico and Colombia, as well as illicitly produced fentanyl trafficking. The Trump Administration's strategy on countering heroin trafficking remains uncertain. The National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy, launched in 2009, aims to reduce the flow of illegal drugs across the Southwest border through various strategic objectives. The 2016 National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy (NSBCS) focuses on combating drug trafficking and criminal activity along the Southwest border, with a particular emphasis on the serious threat posed by heroin in the United States. It aims to disrupt and dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs), stem the flow of illicit proceeds, and enhance cooperation with Mexico and Central America on counterdrug efforts. The Trump Administration's approach to addressing these threats, including heroin trafficking, remains uncertain. The Obama Administration released the Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime, highlighting it as a national security concern. The strategy outlines 10 primary categories of threats posed by transnational organized crime, including drug trafficking. It also details six key priority actions to counter these threats, such as enhancing intelligence sharing and disrupting drug trafficking. The Trump Administration's strategy addresses drug trafficking and its links to other transnational threats, emphasizing international cooperation and partnerships. The strategy acknowledges the role of drug trafficking in facilitating crimes like weapons and human trafficking. Executive orders issued by the Trump Administration may impact federal efforts to combat heroin trafficking, although not exclusively focused on it. The Trump Administration's executive orders focus on combating transnational criminal organizations and preventing international trafficking. One order established the Threat Mitigation Working Group to support U.S. efforts against criminal organizations. Another order created the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, recommending actions like enhanced penalties for fentanyl trafficking and improved detection technologies. The National Heroin Task Force, convened by DOJ and ONDCP, developed recommendations to address the heroin epidemic, focusing on criminal enforcement, prevention, and treatment services. Recommendations include prioritizing prosecutions of heroin distributors and enhancing investigation techniques to target the heroin supply chain. The report from the National Heroin Task Force emphasizes the importance of cutting off the flow of potent heroin to save lives. It suggests prosecuting distributors and traffickers to deter others, using real-time data sharing to disrupt drug supply, and focusing resources on prevention and treatment in high-need areas. The HIDTA and OCDETF programs are cited as examples of task forces for information sharing, but the speed of information sharing remains uncertain."
