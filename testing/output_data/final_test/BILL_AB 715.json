    "title": "AB 715",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 65995 of the Government Code is amended to restrict the imposition of fees for school facility construction or reconstruction in connection with legislative or adjudicative acts by state or local agencies. The fees authorized under certain Education Code sections shall not exceed specified limits. In residential construction, a fee of $1.93 per square foot of assessable space is imposed, excluding certain areas like carports and patios. The square footage is determined by the building department issuing the permit. The terms \"manufactured home\" and \"mobilehome\" are defined as per Education Code Section 17625. Manufactured homes and mobilehomes are subject to Section 17625 of the Education Code, which prohibits any fee or charge related to their location, installation, or occupancy. In commercial or industrial construction, a fee of $0.31 per square foot is charged for covered and enclosed space. This excludes certain areas like storage spaces, garages, and walkways. The determination of this fee is made by the building department of the city or county issuing the permit. The architect of record determines the chargeable covered and enclosed space in commercial or industrial construction under the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development jurisdiction. The limits for inflation adjustments in construction costs are increased every two years based on the statewide cost index. Contracts entered into before January 1, 1987, for school facility construction fees are exempt from certain regulations. Construction contracts entered into after January 1, 1987, are not affected by new regulations requiring fees for school facility construction. Until January 1, 2000, any construction on real property subject to a condition related to school facilities imposed by a state or local agency in connection with residential development after January 1, 1987, must comply with that condition. On and after January 1, 2000, construction on real property with a condition related to school facilities imposed by a state or local agency in connection with residential development after January 1, 1987, may not be subject to excessive fees or charges. Any construction not subject to a contract or specific requirements may not be subject to increased fees if a tentative map or permit was approved before a certain date and a building permit is issued before January 1, 2000. For construction purposes, \"construction\" refers to new construction and reconstruction of residential, commercial, or industrial buildings. Exemptions include religious facilities, private full-time day schools, and government-owned facilities. Commercial or industrial construction includes hotels, inns, motels, and lodging with a maximum 30-day occupancy, excluding residential hotels. The Legislature declares that school facility financing and mitigating the impacts of land use approvals on school facility needs are statewide concerns. They exclusively regulate requirements related to school facilities in connection with land use approvals, excluding all other measures. \"School facilities\" refer to any considerations related to a school district's enrollment capacity. The use of Chapter 2.5 of Division 2 of Title 5 can finance school facilities but cannot be mandated for approval of legislative or adjudicative acts if the purpose is to fund school facilities. The refusal to participate in activities related to Chapter 2.5 of Division 2 of Title 5, such as forming a community facilities district or voting on a special tax, cannot be considered when approving legislative or adjudicative acts concerning real property or governmental organization, if the purpose is to finance school facilities. When establishing or annexing into a community facilities district to finance school facilities through a special tax, the present value of the tax per square foot is credited against any fees for school construction. \"School facilities\" refer to considerations related to accommodating school district enrollment. The payment of fees under Section 17620 of the Education Code is considered full mitigation for impacts on school facilities from legislative or adjudicative acts related to real property planning or governmental organization changes. A state or local agency cannot deny approval for legislative or adjudicative acts related to real property planning or governmental organization changes based on a person's refusal to provide excessive school facilities mitigation."
