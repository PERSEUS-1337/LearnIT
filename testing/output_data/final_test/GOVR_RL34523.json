The House recommended $44.27 billion, and the Senate recommended $44.75 billion. The appropriations cover funding for federal branches, city government, and independent agencies. Controversial issues include funding for the Department of the Treasury and the Executive Office of the President. The Executive Office of the President's budget proposals include consolidating accounts, expanding fund transfer authority, and centralizing administrative services funding. Congress is also considering funding levels for judicial security enhancements, pay increases for judges, hiring additional staff, and creating more judgeships. The Treasury Department's FY2009 appropriations, including the IRS, are being examined with comparisons to FY2008 and budget requests. The Treasury Department performs various governmental functions such as protecting the financial system, collecting tax revenue, enforcing tax laws, managing federal debt, regulating financial institutions, and producing currency. It consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with bureaus accounting for over 95% of funding and workforce. The Treasury Department's bureaus handle financial management, regulation, and law enforcement tasks. Bureaus like the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, and Bureau of Engraving and Printing manage finances, while agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms focus on law enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security was established in 2002, leading to a decrease in Treasury's involvement in law enforcement. The IRS is an exception, as it handles tax collection and enforcement. Many bureaus are funded through annual appropriations, while others finance their operations through fees. In FY2008, Treasury received $12.263 billion in appropriated funds.

The Administration requested legislative proposals to improve taxpayer compliance and reduce the tax gap, aiming to raise $36 billion in revenue over 10 years. Proposals included expanding information reporting, targeting tax compliance by firms of all sizes, and penalizing failure to comply with electronic filing requirements. Lawmakers need to assess if proposed funding for IRS enforcement and taxpayer service is adequate given the challenges of improving compliance rates without sacrificing service quality. The House Appropriations Committee recommended that the IRS receive $11.398 billion in appropriated funds for FY2009, with allocations for taxpayer services, enforcement, and other agency needs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $11.398 billion in appropriated funds for the IRS for FY2009.

The committee disagreed with the Administration's decision to decrease funding for taxpayer assistance centers and pre-filing taxpayer assistance and education, and directed the IRS to fund pre-filing assistance and education at a minimum of $645 million. The committee also supported the IRS's efforts to address taxpayer non-compliance through the National Research Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for the IRS in FY2009, including support for taxpayer services such as tax counseling for the elderly and low-income taxpayer clinics.

The IRS was directed to collect information on non-compliance causes and hire 3,500 individuals for taxpayer compliance issues in FY2009. Funds for the BSM program require approval from the Government Accountability Office and Appropriations Committees before expenditure. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved expenditure plans for the IRS program, but a controversial amendment prohibited funds for the private tax debt collection program in FY2009. The IRS terminated contracts with private debt collectors before President Obama signed the spending bill. The program faced opposition for being unlawful and less cost-effective than hiring IRS staff. Most offices in the Executive Office of the President are funded in the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill. The Administration's FY2009 budget requested $695.5 million for the Executive Office of the President, a 2.3% increase from FY2008. Funding for \"White House\" accounts would have increased by 9.2%, with proposed increases for federal drug control programs and reduced funding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The President's FY2009 budget proposed consolidating and realigning salaries and expenses accounts into a single annual appropriation called \"The White House.\" This consolidation would include accounts such as Compensation of the President, White House Office, Executive Residence, and others, totaling $190.5 million, an increase of 9.2% from the previous year.

The proposed expansion of the Enterprise Services Initiative also contributed to the increased funding for the Office of Administration. The budget submission proposed consolidating and realigning resources in the Executive Office of the President to better respond to changing needs. Separate appropriations for EOP accounts were continued for FY2008 and FY2009 to facilitate congressional oversight. The FY2009 budget requested expanded authority for the EOP to transfer funds among accounts. The FY2009 budget proposed giving the EOP authority to transfer 10% of funds among various accounts, subject to approval. The OMB Director could transfer funds with notification to Congress, merging them with existing appropriations. The EOP budget submission proposed giving the authority to transfer funds among accounts, not exceeding 50% of an appropriation. This transfer authority aimed to enhance flexibility and efficiency within the EOP, addressing emerging priorities and administrative efficiencies. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 authorized transfers of up to 10% of appropriated funds among specific accounts. The EOP budget submission proposed transferring funds among accounts, not exceeding 50% of an appropriation, to enhance flexibility and efficiency. Previous acts authorized transfers of up to 10% among specific accounts for the White House, Vice President, and Official Residence. This practice was recommended to continue for FY2009, along with a proposal to expand enterprise services initiative. The Enterprise Services initiative was designed to efficiently manage common services throughout the EOP and ensure consistent administration of GSA space rent. Funding for rent paid by OMB and ONDCP to GSA would be moved to the Enterprise Services fund. Approximately $10.3 million would be transferred, with $7.2 million from OMB and $3.1 million from ONDCP. The Office of Administration's Enterprise Services fund will assume services in FY2009 such as transit subsidies, Flexible Savings Account fees, health unit operations, and FPS rent-based fees. The FY2009 budget included $8 million for an orderly presidential transition, covering record processing and other transition expenses. No FTEs are associated with this account.

An appropriation of $8 million was provided for the transition, with the possibility of transferring funds to other EOP offices. Additionally, funding requests for the Special Assistance to the President and Official Residence of the Vice President accounts were slightly increased for FY2009. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended the same funding as the President requested for OMB in FY2009, with an appropriation of $72.8 million, a decrease from the previous year. The funding decrease was due to moving OMB's space rent to the Office of Administration. The House committee recommended almost $80 million for OMB, above the President's request. The report accompanying H.R. 7323 included directives for OMB, urging a refocus on oversight. OMB and agencies were directed to coordinate with appropriations subcommittees before transferring funds for E-Government or Lines of Business. OMB was required to report on implementing GAO's recommendations within 60 days. The Senate committee recommended an appropriation of $80.2 million for OMB, including $200,000 for printing the President's budget.

The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended almost $88 million for OMB for FY2009, exceeding the President's request by more than $15 million. P.L. 111-8 provides funding at the levels requested by the President for each of the EOP accounts, with exceptions including $53.9 million for the WHO, $1.4 million above the President's request, allocated for a White House Office on National AIDS Policy. The House Committee on Appropriations calls for the development and implementation of a National AIDS Strategy engaging multiple sectors. The Senate committee recommended an appropriation of $5.2 million for the Office of National AIDS Policy (OPD) to develop and implement a domestic AIDS strategy. This funding included $1.4 million for coordination efforts and $300,000 for international symposiums on faith and science. OPD was directed to report on progress within 180 days. The Senate committee recommended an appropriation of $5.2 million for the Office of National AIDS Policy (OPD) to develop and implement a domestic AIDS strategy, including funding for international symposiums on faith and science. The symposiums would have involved 30 internationally-renowned scientists and theologians, equally divided, and would have produced a written record available on the Internet. The House committee recommended an appropriation of $3.5 million, while both committees recommended $95.6 million for the OA, below the President's request. The committees also recommended that funding for rent for OMB and ONDCP continue under their respective accounts. The committee strongly urges the incoming Administration to establish comprehensive policies for preserving all Presidential records in accordance with relevant laws. They directed the new Administration to report on actions taken by June 30, 2009, and estimated costs for preserving electronic Presidential records. The Senate report supported NARA's efforts to make electronic records public and expressed concern about the lack of information from the White House on record format and volume. The OA was directed to work closely with NARA to transfer records for the current administration. Funding appropriations were provided for electronic mail restoration activities and information technology infrastructure modernization. The House committee recommended increased funding for ONDCP and HIDTA, and decreased funding for CTAC and Other Federal Drug Control Programs. The House committee recommended increased funding for ONDCP and HIDTA, with $500,000 allocated for policy research and evaluation in ONDCP and almost $12 million in discretionary funding for HIDTA.

Additionally, $204.2 million, $14.6 million above the President's request, was recommended for the Other Federal Drug Control Programs, with allocations for specific programs like training for drug court professionals and the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The Senate committee recommended increased appropriations for the ONDCP, HIDTA, and Other Federal Drug Control Programs. The Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center (CTAC) received $3 million in appropriations, with hopes for reinvigoration through additional funds and new leadership in the FY2010 budget. The judiciary presents its budget to the President, who transmits it to Congress unaltered. The judiciary's budget is presented to the President and then to Congress. Appropriations for the judiciary are divided into budget groups and accounts, with two accounts funding the Supreme Court. The rest of the budget provides funding for the \"lower\" federal courts and related judicial services. The largest account, about 75% of the total budget, is for the Salaries and Expenses account for the U.S. Courts of Appeals and District Courts. The Salaries and Expenses account for the U.S. Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services covers the salaries of various judges and employees of the federal judiciary, as well as necessary court expenses. It does not fund certain \"special courts\" or federal courthouse construction. The judiciary also uses non-appropriated funds to offset its appropriations requirement. The judiciary uses non-appropriated funds, primarily from court filing fees, to offset expenses within the Salaries and Expenses account. These funds can be unencumbered or encumbered, with the former resulting from savings in the judiciary's financial plan and the latter used for specific purposes when planned expenses are delayed. Judge Julia S. Gibbons, United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, stated in her testimony that the Judiciary has reduced appropriations requirements through cost-containment efforts and technology innovations without affecting justice administration. The Judicial Conference aims to decrease costs and increase productivity in the federal judiciary through cost containment policies. For instance, efforts have been made to limit the growth of court rental fees paid to the General Services. The judiciary has been working with the General Services Administration to reduce court rental fees, resulting in a $200 million decrease in projected costs for FY2009. Overcharges totaling $30 million and $22.5 million were identified, leading to a cap of 4.9% on annual rent growth through FY2016. Circuit judicial councils are responsible for managing space needs to stay within the caps. The Judicial Conference approved cost-saving measures to slow personnel cost growth in the judiciary, aiming for up to $300 million in savings from FY2009 to FY2017. Initiatives include restricting salary step increases, limiting law clerks, and using IT for efficiency. Judge Gibbons expects $55.4 million in savings by consolidating services for the judiciary's national accounting system. Judicial security remains a concern for court proceedings and judge safety. Judicial security remains a critical concern, with efforts to enhance security following high-profile incidents. The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 was signed into law to strengthen security measures. Concerns about perimeter security led to some functions at courthouses being transferred to the U.S. Marshals. The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) took over security functions at six courthouses from the Federal Protective Service (FPS) under a pilot program authorized by Congress. The pilot program began in January 2009 and is expected to last 18 months, with an estimated cost of $5 million offset by reductions in FPS billings. Judge Gibbons highlighted the need for additional judgeships and courthouses, especially on the southwest border, due to the increased workload from immigration-related cases. She emphasized the importance of supporting the President's request for more border patrol agents to address the growing demands. Despite requests for new judgeships since 2002, no additional district judges have been appointed, with a total of 32 judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference in 2003, 2005, and 2007. Gibbons urged Congress to allocate the $110 million in the President's FY2009 budget to fully fund a new federal initiative. The President's FY2009 budget includes $110 million for a new federal courthouse in San Diego, California. Judge Gibbons projected workload increases in probation, pretrial services, and bankruptcy filings, with declines in appellate, criminal, and civil filings. The Judicial Conference requested 67 new federal judgeships, emphasizing the need for additional judges and courthouses, especially on the southwest border. Since the 1990 omnibus judgeship bill, the number of courts of appeals judges has remained the same, while federal appellate court case filings increased by 55% over 17 years. The number of district court judgeships increased by 4%, while case filings increased by 29%. Representative James F. Sensenbrenner, Jr. introduced H.R. 3520, the Federal Judgeship and Administrative Efficiency Act of 2007, which would authorize additional federal circuit and district judgeships, establish a judicial district in the Virgin Islands, and amend the federal judicial code. The bill aims to divide the Ninth Judicial Circuit into the Ninth Circuit (California, Guam, Hawaii, Northern Mariana Islands) and the Twelfth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington). Senate Judiciary Committee introduced S. 2774 for additional federal judgeships. The bill introduced by the Senate Judiciary Committee aims to create new district court judgeships and convert temporary judgeships into permanent positions. It also includes extensions for various temporary judgeships. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has advocated for a significant increase in judicial pay due to inflation affecting judges' salaries. The Chief Justice has raised concerns about judicial salaries not keeping up with inflation, leading to judges leaving the bench. He has called for increased pay to retain and attract top talent, stating it is a constitutional crisis. Bills introduced in 2007 and 2008 aimed to provide significant pay adjustments for justices and judges. In 2007, bills were introduced to increase salaries for justices and judges by 28.7% to 28.8%. Senator Durbin also proposed a 16.5% increase in salaries for various judicial positions. However, no further action was taken on these pay bills before the end of the 110th Congress. In FY2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a salary adjustment for justices and judges. In FY2009, salary adjustments for justices and judges were authorized under Section 310 of the act. Hearings were held by House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on the federal judiciary budget request, addressing issues such as judicial security, rent payments, and workload. Testimony was given by Judge Julia S. Gibbons and James C. Duff, Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Judge Gibbons emphasized the need for funding to maintain staffing levels and support program enhancements in the courts for fiscal year 2009. The Judiciary's funding requirements primarily cover personnel and space costs, with limited flexibility to cut programs for budget savings unlike the Executive Branch. The House subcommittee heard testimony from Supreme Court Justices Kennedy and Thomas on the Supreme Court budget request for FY2009, including issues like building modernization, caseload, minority clerk hiring, and televising proceedings.

The FY2009 budget proposed a 2.9% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, with the House bill including a 3.9% pay adjustment. Division A, Section 142(a) of P.L. 110-329 also provided a 3.9% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. Blue-collar workers receive pay adjustment based on white-collar GS employees. The pay raise for FY2009 is allocated between a 2.9% basic adjustment and a 1.0% locality pay adjustment. SES individuals do not receive locality pay. The new SL and ST pay schedule authorized by P.L. 110-372 will affect SES, SL, and ST positions regarding locality pay. Provisions in P.L. 111-8 prohibit changes to competitive areas in reductions-in-force and the implementation of Regulatory Policy Officers in Executive Order 13422. The federal government is expected to conduct its business in an environmentally, economically, fiscally sound, and scientifically defensible manner according to Executive Order 13423. Federal employees called up to active duty in the National Guard and Reserve will maintain their federal salary, with agencies covering the difference. Each executive branch department and agency must submit a report to the OMB Director on their workforce composition within 120 days of the act's enactment. Section 753 of the Senate bill and Section 752 of P.L. 111-8 require the OMB Director to submit a comprehensive statement on workforce data within 180 days of the act's enactment. Section 735 of P.L. 111-8 expands the applicability of certain requirements for public-private competitions. Section 736 of P.L. 111-8 elaborates on guidelines for insourcing new functions and agency functions performed by the private sector. Section 736 of P.L. 111-8 provides guidelines for insourcing new functions and agency functions performed by the private sector. Agency heads must implement these guidelines within 120 days of enactment. GAO must submit a report on insourcing implementation to congressional committees within 210 days. Insourcing involves using federal employees for functions performed by contractors. Public-private competitions are rare and mostly involve agency employees. Critics question the feasibility and implications of Section 735. The feasibility and implications of Section 735 are unclear, especially regarding the requirement to consider using federal employees for new functions or those currently performed by contractors. Critics argue that agencies may lack resources to staff new functions or conduct public-private competitions. Section 737 of P.L. 111-8 prohibits using funds for public-private competitions involving activities performed by federal employees. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed a one-year moratorium on new A-76 studies to allow the new Administration to review Federal workforce policies. The moratorium could provide an opportunity to gather data on outsourced federal employees and study the savings and costs of public-private competitions. Opponents argue that the moratorium may impact savings from completed competitions. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards communist Cuba has focused on isolating the nation through economic sanctions, including restrictions on financial transactions administered by OFAC. Travel restrictions have been a contentious part of this policy, with changes over the years, such as easing regulations in 2003 for family visits within three degrees of relationship, but tightening them in 2004. In June 2004, family travel restrictions to Cuba were tightened to once every three years for up to 14 days, requiring permission from OFAC. U.S. sanctions allow some agricultural exports to Cuba since 2001 under TSRA, but with restrictions like no access to U.S. financing. Sanctions were further tightened in February 2005 for U.S. agricultural exporters. In February 2005, OFAC amended the CACR to clarify that U.S. agricultural exporters must be paid in advance before shipment to Cuba, causing objections from exporters and Congress. Cuba has purchased nearly $2.7 billion in agricultural products from the U.S. since 2001. Since 2001, Cuba has purchased almost $2.7 billion in agricultural products from the United States. U.S. exports to Cuba increased from $7 million in 2001 to $404 million in 2004, declined in 2005 and 2006, but rose to $447 million in 2007. In 2008, U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba reached $718 million due to higher food prices and increased Cuban needs after hurricanes. Congress attempted to ease U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba, but none of the provisions were enacted. In 2007 and 2008, Congress considered provisions to ease Cuba sanctions, but they were ultimately dropped. The House Appropriations Committee version of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill for FY2009 contained provisions to ease restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports and family travel. Cuban embargo regulations added in 2005 required U.S. agricultural exports to be paid for before leaving U.S. ports. Provisions in the FY2009 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill aimed to ease restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports and family travel to Cuba. The Senate version included provisions to prohibit restrictions on payment terms for agricultural goods sold to Cuba. The FY2009 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill aimed to ease restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports and family travel to Cuba. The bill included provisions to prohibit restrictions on payment terms for agricultural goods sold to Cuba. However, the Cuba provisions in S. 3260 or H.R. 7323 were not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2009. Instead, the 111th Congress included three provisions easing Cuba sanctions in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. The provisions in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 aimed to ease restrictions on family travel and U.S. agricultural and medical exports to Cuba. The Treasury Department was directed to report on OFAC's allocation of resources for investigating violations of the Cuba embargo. The Treasury Department is required to provide detailed information on OFAC's Cuba-related licensing enforcement, specifically for travel related to the marketing and sale of agricultural and medical goods. Regulations were amended to allow for travel to Cuba under a general license for these purposes, previously requiring a specific license on a case by case basis. Secretary Geithner stated that only a narrow class of businesses would be eligible for this new general license. On March 11, 2009, OFAC announced plans to implement regulations authorizing travel under a general license for the marketing and sale of agricultural and medical goods. Businesses using the general license must provide advance notice and a report on their activities in Cuba. Additionally, family travel restrictions imposed in 2004 were prohibited from being enforced. On March 11, 2009, OFAC reinstated the authorization for family travel to Cuba, allowing family members to visit once every 12 months for an unlimited stay. The daily expenditure limit for family travelers was increased to $179 a day, with an expanded definition of \"close relatives\" to include individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption within three generations. Specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis for additional visits during the 12-month period or for travel to visit a close relative who is not a national of Cuba. Payment of Cash in Advance is required for U.S. agricultural exporters selling goods to Cuba, ensuring payment before goods leave U.S. ports. The definition of cash in advance is not provided in the regulations. Prior to the February 2005 amendment to the Cuban embargo regulations, U.S. exporters could be paid for goods before unloading in Cuba. OFAC guidance states that agricultural exports to Cuba must be paid for by \"cash in advance\" or financed through a third-country bank. Secretary Geithner clarified that exporters must still receive payment before shipment, continuing the Bush Administration policy. This interpretation suggests the omnibus provision will have minimal impact, addressing concerns from some Senators but raising new ones from others. Several Senators raised concerns about the provision, triggering worries that the Secretary's action goes against the legislative intent of easing restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba."
