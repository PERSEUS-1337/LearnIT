    "content": "The U.S. Constitution gives the House of Representatives and the Senate the authority to establish rules, punish, and expel Members of Congress. In the past, the Senate used its authority sparingly, relying on prevailing norms of decency to guide legislative conduct and addressing ethics issues on a case-by-case basis. Events in the early 1960s, such as charges of corruption against Secretary to the Majority Robert G. \"Bobby\" Baker, led to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration holding hearings on financial activities of Senate members. This report explores the history and jurisdiction of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, focusing on its investigative procedures. It does not cover criminal law changes, prosecutions of Congress members, or specific disciplinary cases in the Senate. Prior to the 88th Congress, there was no standard mechanism for addressing obvious acts of wrongdoing by members. During the 88th Congress, the Senate established the first ethics committee, later renamed the Committee on Ethics. The focus on ethics reform increased after Secretary to the Majority Robert G. \"Bobby\" Baker resigned amidst allegations of misuse of his position for personal gain. A resolution was passed to investigate the financial and business interests of Senate officers and employees. The Senate established the Committee on Ethics during the 88th Congress following allegations of misconduct by Secretary to the Majority Robert G. \"Bobby\" Baker. A resolution authorized the Committee on Rules and Administration to investigate financial and business interests of Senate officers and employees for conflicts of interest or impropriety. The Committee conducted hearings to study and report on the matter. The Committee on Ethics investigated the business interests of Senate officials and employees, particularly focusing on former employee Mr. Baker. Recommendations were made for public financial disclosure rules and controls on staff involvement with Senate campaign funds. Consideration was given to creating a separate ethics committee. Senator John Sherman Cooper proposed the creation of a select committee on standards and conduct in a committee report on Senate rules amendments. His resolution, which was rejected, aimed to establish a committee to address unethical, improper, and illegal conduct within the Senate. Senator John Sherman Cooper proposed the creation of a select committee on standards and conduct in a committee report on Senate rules amendments. On July 1, 1964, Senator B. Everett Jordan filed a resolution (S.Res. 338) to amend the jurisdiction of the Committee on Rules and Administration to investigate alleged violations of Senate rules and make appropriate findings after giving individuals due notice and opportunity for a hearing. The Committee on Rules and Administration investigates violations of Senate rules and recommends disciplinary action. Senator Cooper proposed creating a bipartisan Select Committee on Standards and Conduct to handle ethical issues instead. The Senate adopted Senator Cooper's amendment to create a Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, ensuring thorough and fair investigations into members and employees. This marked the establishment of a continuing internal disciplinary body in July 1965. The Select Committee on Standards and Conduct was established in July 1965 to oversee investigations into Senate members and employees. In 1975, a temporary select committee was formed to study the Senate committee system, considering merging the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct with the Committee on Rules and Administration, which was opposed by the ethics committee. The Select Committee on Standards and Conduct opposes the consolidation with the Committee on Rules and Administration, believing it would damage the ethics committee's bipartisan nature, independence in investigations, nonpartisan staff, and prudent judgment. Consolidation may compromise the ethics committee's identity and effectiveness. The Senate Committee on Standards and Conduct is mandated to assist the Senate in fulfilling its Constitutional responsibility. The issue of combining the Committee on Standards with the Committee on Rules and Administration was discussed during the 94th and 95th Congresses. The Committee on Rules and Administration rejected the idea and recommended the establishment of a new bipartisan ethics committee to demonstrate the seriousness with which the Senate views congressional conduct. In February 1977, the Senate agreed to this resolution. In 1977, the Senate created the permanent Select Committee on Ethics to replace the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct. Membership on the new committee was initially limited to six years but this limitation was removed in the 96th Congress. Public criticism in the 1940s led to concerns over conflicts of interest by Members of Congress supplementing their income from outside activities. Senator Wayne Morse introduced legislation in 1946 to require annual public financial disclosure reports by Senators, defending their right to earn outside income while emphasizing the public's right to know about alternate income sources. In 1946, Senator Wayne Morse proposed legislation for annual public financial disclosure reports by Senators to reveal alternate income sources. In 1958, Congress established the first Code of Ethics for Government Service. The Code of Ethics for Government Service was proposed in 1951 by Representative Charles Bennett following an investigation into Sherman Adams. It is recognized as ethical guidance in the House and Senate, although not legally binding. In 1965, the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct recommended rules for Members, officers, and employees of the Senate, leading to the adoption of a new code of conduct in 1968. The new code of conduct introduced in 1977 by Senate leaders covered areas such as outside employment, campaign funds, political fundraising, and financial disclosures. This initiative followed reforms in the executive branch post-Watergate scandal, with a temporary Select Committee on Official Conduct established to address these issues. Senator Baker believes that a formal code of conduct is crucial for increasing government salaries. An ad hoc committee will be formed to study Senate ethical conduct and financial disclosure, with a report due by March 1. The Senate adopted S.Res. 36 by unanimous consent, following hearings by the Select Committee on Official Conduct in February 1977. The committee's final report on March 10 recommended amendments to the Code of Conduct, including public financial disclosure requirements, limits on gifts and outside earnings, and a provision against discrimination in staff employment. S.Res. 110 was agreed to on April 1, incorporating these recommendations into the Code of Official Conduct. In 2007, amendments were made to the Senate Code of Official Conduct, including restrictions on former Senators becoming lobbyists, disclosure of post-employment job negotiations, protections against political influence in hiring decisions, and amending gift rules. The current Senate Code of Official Conduct can be found in Rules 34 through 43 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, with additional prohibitions and restrictions outlined in federal statutes and the Senate Ethics Manual. The Senate Ethics Manual includes Standing Rules of the Senate related to the Code of Official Conduct. The Select Committee on Standards and Conduct investigates improper conduct, violations of Senate rules, and recommends disciplinary action. The jurisdiction was transferred to the Select Committee on Ethics in 1973, responsible for enforcing the Senate Code of Official Conduct. The Select Committee on Ethics' jurisdiction has expanded since 1973 to include the franking privilege, disclosure of intelligence material, acceptance of foreign gifts, public financial disclosure forms, and fair employment practices enforcement. The Ethics Committee was given specific jurisdiction to investigate unauthorized disclosure of intelligence information by a Senator, officer, or employee of the Senate. The Select Committee on Ethics was designated as the \"employing agency\" for the Senate in 1977, responsible for regulating acceptance of gifts from foreign governments. In 1979, it also took on administering public financial disclosure requirements. The Ethics Committee became the \"supervising ethics office\" for gift laws in 1989, and in 1991, the Senate Office of Fair Employment Practices was established under the Civil Rights Act. The Senate Office of Fair Employment Practices was established in 1991 to handle discrimination complaints, with the Select Committee on Ethics having jurisdiction to review its decisions. In 1995, the Office of Compliance took over discrimination case reviews with the Congressional Accountability Act. The STOCK Act of 2012 clarified insider trading laws for Members of Congress, requiring the Ethics Committee to issue guidance on conflicts of interest and gifts. The STOCK Act of 2012 clarified rules on conflicts of interest and insider trading for Members of Congress and employees. The Select Committee on Ethics issued guidance on implementing the law, including reminders on financial disclosure requirements and insider trading restrictions. The Select Committee on Ethics has jurisdiction over investigating improper conduct, violations of law, Senate rules, and regulations, recommending disciplinary action, regulating the franking privilege, investigating unauthorized disclosures of intelligence information, and implementing public financial disclosure requirements. The Select Committee on Ethics oversees various responsibilities including implementing public financial disclosure requirements, regulating gifts from foreign governments, rendering advisory opinions, reviewing complaints under the Government Employee Rights Act, conducting ethics training programs, and issuing annual reports on alleged violations of Senate rules. The Select Committee on Ethics oversees implementing public financial disclosure requirements, regulating gifts from foreign governments, rendering advisory opinions, reviewing complaints under the Government Employee Rights Act, conducting ethics training programs, and issuing annual reports on alleged violations of Senate rules. The Ethics Committee may initiate an inquiry or investigate allegations brought by various sources, and has procedures established for its operations. Upon completion of its investigative process, the Committee may issue public statements or maintain confidentiality regarding the matter. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics investigates violations of the Senate Code of Official Conduct and may recommend sanctions such as censure, expulsion, or termination of employment. The committee was established in 1977 under S.Res. 110 to oversee complaints, publish regulations, and provide advisory opinions. Membership on the committee is specified in the Congressional Record. The Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, established in the 89th Congress, had 14 Senators serving before being replaced by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics in the 95th Congress. The latter committee, created in 1977, has had 57 different members. Majority party members are listed first in both committees."
