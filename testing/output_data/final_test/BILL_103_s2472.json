    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Sound Science in Risk Assessment Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that approximately $140 billion per year, over 2% of the annual gross national product of the United States, is being spent on environmental compliance. Unfunded Federal environmental mandates are straining State and local government budgets, potentially reducing resources for other public programs. The Environmental Protection Agency's environmental risk assessment lacks scientific objectivity, clarity, and consistency for protecting public health and safety. Executive Order No. 12866 requires Federal agencies to base decisions on the best scientific and technical information available, promoting openness in government. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must develop rules ensuring consistent, high-quality, scientifically objective, and unbiased risk assessments. Significant uncertainties must be clearly disclosed to the public. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must develop rules for uniform general procedures and distinctive approaches for risk assessments within specified timeframes after the enactment of the Act. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must develop rules for risk assessment approaches, techniques, or methodologies, including those utilizing epidemiological data, based on the scale of the problem, scientific understanding, and available data. Rules must be established for new approaches before implementation. Before conducting a risk assessment, it is essential to understand the approach, technique, or methodology being used. SEC. 5. RISK ASSESSMENT REVIEW. The Administrator must issue procedures for reviewing and revising risk assessments within 180 days of this Act. The review criteria include inconsistency with set principles, rules, or failure to consider new scientific data. The Administrator must respond to petitions regarding risk assessment within 60 days, stating the basis for their decision. Denial of a petition can be reviewed judicially under chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 6. FINAL RULES. The Administrator must publish a list of risk assessment approaches within 270 days and issue final rules within 1 year after the enactment of the Act, considering input from various stakeholders. The Administrator must consider input from municipalities, experts, and other relevant persons when issuing final rules within 1 year after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 7. PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION PRECLUDED. This Act does not allow for private lawsuits seeking damages against the United States or its agencies."
