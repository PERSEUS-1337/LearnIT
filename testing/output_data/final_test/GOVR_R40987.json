Participants must be socially disadvantaged, with specific racial and ethnic groups presumed to be socially disadvantaged. The Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program, also known as the 8(a) Program, is available for small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Specific racial and ethnic groups are presumed to be socially disadvantaged, including members of certain minority groups. Other individuals must establish individual social disadvantage by providing evidence of factors such as race, ethnic origin, gender, or physical characteristics. The 8(a) Program is for small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Owners must demonstrate personal experiences of disadvantage and economic hardship to qualify. Financial information must be provided to show economic disadvantage. The 8(a) Program requires small business owners to demonstrate personal experiences of disadvantage and economic hardship to qualify. Financial information such as income, net worth, and asset value must be provided. The SBA amended regulations in 2011 to exclude retirement account value in certain circumstances. The SBA no longer compares the financial condition of 8(a) Program applicants to other small businesses in the same industry classification. The SBA removed a provision regarding economic disadvantage in the 8(a) Program in 2011, citing confusion. Applicants must submit various materials including financial statements and tax returns. Once accepted, firms must report any adverse changes and undergo an annual review to maintain eligibility. The 8(a) Program requires firms to submit certifications, personal financial information for disadvantaged owners, and financial statements for annual review. Financial statements may need to be audited based on annual gross receipts. Firms can participate in the program for up to nine years and are generally ineligible for further participation after exiting. Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals can confer eligibility for the program upon only one firm in their lifetime. Alaska Native Corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and Community Development Corporations can confer eligibility upon multiple 8(a) firms to participate in the program concurrently or at different times. Federal agencies set aside contracts for 8(a) firms and can award contracts on a sole-source basis. In FY2014, federal agencies spent $16.3 billion on contracts with 8(a) participants. However, only 44% of 8(a) firms not owned by Alaska Native Corporations received contracts in one recent fiscal year. In one recent fiscal year, 8(a) firms are eligible for loans, technology transfer, surplus property, and management assistance from the SBA. The SBA also sponsors a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program for eligible 8(a) participants, where mentors provide technical or management assistance, financial aid, and joint venture opportunities for government procurements. Small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) include 8(a) participants and other small businesses owned by socially or economically disadvantaged individuals. Non-8(a) SDBs do not need to demonstrate potential for success and owners can have a net worth of up to $750,000. SDBs must meet eligibility requirements similar to 8(a) firms but do not require certification by the SBA. Federal programs for SDB prime contractors have mostly been discontinued. Most federal programs for SDB prime contractors have been discontinued, with only government-wide and agency-specific goals remaining for the percentage of federal contract and/or subcontract dollars awarded to SDBs each year. SBA stopped certifying SDBs in October 2008, and firms can be certified by 8(a) participation or other certifying entities. Certification generally lasts for three years, and firms can be certified repeatedly if they meet the requirements. Firms do not need to be certified as SDBs to qualify for federal subcontracting programs. Prime contractors can rely on subcontractors' written representation of their SDB status, but the SBA can review uncertified firms if there is credible information that they are not disadvantaged. The government promotes contracting with SDBs. The government promotes contracting and subcontracting with Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) by setting goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to SDBs each fiscal year. The government-wide goal is at least 5% of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards, which was met in FY2014 with $34.7 billion awarded to SDBs. Agency-specific goals range from 2.3% to 47.8%. Authorities allowing for less than full and open competitive procedures and partial set-asides for SDB contractors have expired or been subject to statutory changes. Federal agencies must negotiate subcontracting plans with successful bidders on prime contracts to set goals for awarding subcontract dollars to Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs). Failure to comply with the plan can result in contract termination and liquidated damages. Subcontracting with SDBs is also considered in award decisions. Agencies may consider subcontracting with SDBs when awarding contracts, offering incentives for prime contractors to work with SDBs. DBEs are small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including Black Americans and Hispanic Americans. The curr_chunk discusses various ethnic groups including Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, and Subcontinent Asian Americans, as well as women, who are designated as socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The curr_chunk explains the eligibility criteria for socially and economically disadvantaged groups seeking certification as Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs) by the Department of Transportation (DOT) funding recipients. Applicants must provide proof of group membership and economic condition, with a net worth limit of $1.32 million. Non-designated individuals must prove their disadvantaged status. Evaluation includes on-site visits, interviews, and analysis of the firm's structure. The eligibility criteria for certification as Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs) by DOT funding recipients include proof of group membership, economic condition, and a net worth limit of $1.32 million. Evaluation involves on-site visits, analysis of the firm's structure, work history, equipment, licenses, and federal income tax returns for the past three years. Certified DBEs must notify of any changes affecting their eligibility. Firms certified as DBEs must provide a sworn affidavit annually affirming no changes in eligibility. Certifications are state-specific, with no limit on recertification. DBEs are eligible for various contracting programs with a goal of 10% of funds awarded to DBEs, although this is aspirational and not mandatory. Funding recipients set DBE participation goals without quotas or set-asides, using race-neutral means to meet these goals. This includes adjusting solicitations, bid presentation times, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules to facilitate DBE participation. The funding recipients set DBE participation goals without quotas or set-asides, using race-neutral means to meet these goals. This includes adjusting solicitations, bid presentation times, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules to facilitate DBE participation. Additionally, they provide assistance to DBEs in overcoming limitations in obtaining bonding or financing, offer technical assistance, publicize contract opportunities, assist in business management improvement, distribute DBE directories, and help DBEs utilize emerging technology for business operations. The federal programs for disadvantaged small businesses define \"disadvantage\" based on race and gender. Racial presumptions are subject to strict scrutiny if challenged for violating equal rights. The government must show that a challenged program is necessary to meet a compelling government interest to survive strict scrutiny. Presumptions based on gender are subject to heightened scrutiny, requiring an \"exceedingly persuasive justification.\" Classifications not based on suspect categories will generally be upheld if rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The structure of programs can impact their ability to withstand scrutiny. The U.S. District Court found the 8(a) Program not unconstitutional on its face but unconstitutional as-applied in the military simulation and training industry. The court emphasized the program's history and requirements, stating that breaking down barriers to minority business development is a compelling government interest. The program allows non-minority individuals to qualify, and all applicants must demonstrate economic need. The 8(a) Program allows individuals to qualify based on economic disadvantage. The program is narrowly tailored with goals for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses. There are limits on program participation and the SBA must consider adverse effects on other small businesses. The court emphasized that race-conscious remedies should not last longer than discriminatory effects and should minimize harm to innocent competitors. In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit struck down a Department of Defense program for SDBs, ruling it unconstitutional due to lack of evidence for race-conscious contracting as necessary to remedy discrimination in the defense industry. The Federal Circuit disagreed with the strong basis in evidence for re-enactment based on state and local disparity studies. The lack of evidence of discrimination led to the U.S. District Court finding the 8(a) Program unconstitutional in the military training and simulation industry. DOD admitted to having no evidence of discrimination in the industry."
