    "content": "Human rights conditions in China are a key issue in U.S.-China relations, leading to misunderstandings and mistrust. Frictions over human rights impact economic and security issues, as well as U.S. companies operating in China. Restrictions on freedoms hinder people-to-people exchanges and collaboration between U.S. and Chinese NGOs. Some U.S. policymakers view human rights in China as a test of overall U.S. policy towards China. Some experts argue that U.S. policy towards China has failed to promote political reform and human rights improvements, leading to potential aggressive foreign policy from China. They believe that economic engagement with China has strengthened the communist regime and hindered political reform efforts. Some experts argue that U.S. policy towards China has failed to promote political reform and human rights improvements. They believe economic engagement has strengthened the communist regime and hindered reform efforts. U.S. administrations have employed strategies for promoting human rights in China, seeking \"peaceful evolution\" without directly challenging Communist Party rule. Washington has little direct leverage over human rights developments in China, which are expected to come mostly from within. The U.S. has employed strategies for promoting human rights in China without directly challenging Communist Party rule. Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama favored engagement with China to advance U.S. interests and values, emphasizing the importance of China's respect for international human rights norms. The Obama Administration aimed to cooperate with China while managing differences on various issues. The Obama Administration aimed to cooperate with China while managing differences on various issues, including human rights. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the Administration's human rights policy as one of \"principled pragmatism,\" focusing on quiet diplomacy for more effective change. However, the Administration publicly criticized China's human rights policies. Critics have raised concerns about the Trump Administration's focus on security and economic interests over human rights, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson criticized for downplaying human rights issues. The Department of State's annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices were released in March 2017. The Trump Administration did not sign a joint letter denouncing China for alleged torture of human rights lawyers and activists. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson emphasized the importance of fundamental values in foreign policy but also warned against imposing these values on others. Senator John McCain criticized Tillerson's approach in a published opinion piece. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson emphasized the importance of values in foreign policy, warning against solely transactional approaches. He highlighted the risk of losing our reputation and influence by neglecting universal values like human rights and religious freedom. Tillerson aimed to build a constructive relationship with China while advocating for these values. Senators Ben Cardin and Marco Rubio urged Secretary of State Tillerson to prioritize human rights in discussions with Chinese officials. Despite Trump mentioning the importance of human rights during his meeting with President Xi, it was not a focus in the new U.S.-China Comprehensive Dialogue. During Tillerson's visit to Beijing in March 2017, he raised concerns about U.S. citizen Sandy Phan-Gillis, detained in China since 2015. Phan-Gillis was later sentenced to prison and deported to the U.S. Observers suggest a shift in U.S. human rights policy towards focusing on detained U.S. citizens in China. In February 2017, U.S. officials assisted the family of Chinese human rights attorney Xie Yang, whose wife and daughters were trying to leave. The U.S. government employs various efforts to promote human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in China. These efforts include policy tools like open letters, hearings, funding for assistance programs, meetings with dissidents, and sanctions. The executive branch also uses diplomatic negotiations, public diplomacy programs, international broadcasting, and coordination of international pressure. The U.S. government employs various efforts to promote human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in China, including policy tools like open letters, hearings, funding for assistance programs, meetings with dissidents, and sanctions. China's leaders have become less responsive to international pressure on human rights, but some prominent Chinese dissidents have received less severe treatment due to international attention and pressure. The PRC Constitution provides for civil and political rights, including freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and demonstration. China's constitution and laws provide for civil and political rights, but the state restricts these freedoms in practice. China's leaders prioritize state security, social stability, and economic development over individual rights, dismissing foreign criticisms as interference in internal affairs. Despite improvements in living standards, education, and global integration, China's Communist Party maintains power through coercive measures and restricts political freedom and civil liberties to prevent any challenges to its authority. The government enforces strict controls on religious, ethnic, and labor activities to maintain its monopoly on power. The Chinese government imposes severe restrictions on unsanctioned activities and groups, including political dissidents, human rights lawyers, Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Falun Gong practitioners. Despite initial optimism for political reform under Xi Jinping, there has been a crackdown on dissent and civil society, reversing a trend towards increased tolerance. Many citizens who openly discussed political issues have faced consequences. Many citizens punished for engaging in political activism, defending dissidents, or exposing corruption. Xi Jinping's focus on national security driven by political challenges including corruption, economic slowdown, environmental pollution, and unrest in Tibet and Xinjiang. PRC central government shows some responsiveness to popular and expert opinion, reflecting a style of rule known as \"responsive authoritarianism.\" The CCP in China has implemented legal and institutional reforms to prevent rights abuses and increase transparency. Repressive measures are targeted at specific individuals and groups, with public protests mainly focused on local issues rather than national politics. Many citizens support the regime despite limited freedoms. Some experts believe that economic development in China may eventually lead to democratization, similar to other East Asian societies like South Korea and Taiwan. The growing urban middle class is seen as a potential agent of political change, although China's middle class has not yet sparked democracy despite increasing awareness of their interests. Public opinion polls suggest a weak correlation between economic development and democracy in China, with Chinese defining democracy differently from Americans. According to a survey, a significant percentage of Chinese respondents view democracy as government \"governed by and for the people,\" but do not necessarily associate it with competitive elections, rights, freedoms, or equality and justice. China's middle class, reliant on the state for material well-being, values social and political stability provided by the Communist Party. Many Chinese are content with the current level of democracy and optimistic about future improvements, leading to resentment towards foreign criticism of human rights and democracy activists. Debates on U.S. policies to promote human rights in China focus on questions regarding the extent of resources to be used, the relationship between human rights efforts and U.S. interests, prioritization of human rights issues, effectiveness of different approaches, changes in U.S. approaches over time, and policy tools for promoting human rights in China. Policy tools for promoting human rights in China are being debated, including the effectiveness of different approaches, the importance of multilateral efforts, and the constraints posed by other U.S. policies and interests related to China. The United States may need to consider negotiating with China on human rights issues and matching improvements in human rights conditions with actions valued by China. Pressuring China to abide by international human rights standards is also a consideration. Some human rights advocates argue that promoting human rights in China should be a top priority in U.S. policy towards China, suggesting a \"whole-of-government\" approach and imposing sanctions when necessary. Other specialists believe in negotiating with China on human rights issues and matching improvements with actions valued by China. Some specialists advocate for a cooperative and flexible approach to promoting human rights in China, emphasizing the importance of seeking common ground with Chinese counterparts and appealing to China's own interests on human rights issues. This approach is seen as less confrontational and more compatible with existing forms of engagement and cooperation between the U.S. and China. Possible steps to promote human rights in China include supporting congressional hearings, legislation, and statements expressing concerns about human rights developments, increasing support for rule of law and civil society programs, and providing funding to the National Endowment for. Provide funding to the National Endowment for Democracy to support human rights and democracy groups in the United States and Hong Kong. Support nongovernmental actors coordinating efforts on human rights in China, formulate a code of conduct for U.S. civil society organizations interacting with Chinese officials, provide financial assistance to dissidents and victims of persecution, support research on human rights abuses in China, and link U.S. economic policies with human rights conditions. Link PNTR status and low import tariffs with improvements in human rights conditions in China. Challenge Chinese security regulations and Internet restrictions as trade barriers under the WTO. Tighten U.S. export controls in response to human rights violations. Encourage U.S. companies in China to speak out against policies affecting business interests and human rights. Impose sanctions on China and PRC officials for human rights abuses. Apply provisions of the Global Magnitsky Act to deny U.S. visas or freeze U.S. bank accounts of Chinese officials responsible for severe human rights violations. Apply provisions of the Global Magnitsky Act to deny U.S. visas or freeze U.S. bank accounts of Chinese officials responsible for severe human rights violations, including imposing penalties on PRC officials for human rights violations. Suspend U.S. engagement and exchanges with China's Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Public Security until all human rights lawyers are released from detention or prison. Some advocacy groups urge the State Department to issue a travel advisory warning U.S. citizens and green card holders of the risk of arbitrary detention in China. Demand reciprocal treatment for U.S. journalists, academics, and media outlets in China. Call for mutual visa issuance for journalists and oppose denial of visas to critics of CCP leaders. Propose an additional consulate for China in the U.S. if a U.S. consulate is allowed in Lhasa, Tibet. Emphasize human rights in bilateral interactions and support a separate U.S.-China human rights dialogue. Support a transparent U.S.-China human rights dialogue involving civil society representatives. Strengthen international efforts by backing critical statements in the United Nations and increasing U.S. delegation at the UNHRC. Coordinate with other democracies to pressure China on human rights issues. Increase funding for internet freedom initiatives. Support efforts to enable Chinese Internet users to bypass censorship and access Voice of America and Radio Free Asia online programs. Oppose China's \"Internet sovereignty\" concept and advocate for greater funding for VOA and RFA broadcasts in various languages. Strengthen the International Visitor Leadership Program for Chinese leaders to visit the U.S. for short-term study tours. Since Xi Jinping came to power, the Chinese government has cracked down on political dissent, free expression, and civil society. Recent security measures have been severe, with detentions and arrests of human rights attorneys, journalists, bloggers, and ethnic minorities. China's push for party supremacy has undermined rule of law reforms and restricted civil and political rights. The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has targeted political dissent and free expression, cracking down on civil society. In 2016, a liberal journal, Yanhuang Chunqiu, ceased publication due to pressure from conservative forces within the Communist Party. Beijing authorities shut down two websites run by a liberal Chinese think tank in 2017. Since July 2015, over 250 human rights lawyers and activists have been detained in China in what is known as the \"7-09 Crackdown.\" The campaign against these individuals, including staff of the Fengrui Law Firm in Beijing, has been unprecedented in scale. Most detainees have been released, but some have been sentenced to prison terms or given suspended sentences. Several rights lawyers and activists in China have faced harsh treatment, including lengthy prison terms, disappearances, torture, and restrictions on movement. Spouses of detained lawyers have also been subjected to surveillance and restrictions. Guo Feixiong, also known as Yang Maodong, was arrested in 2013 for protesting against censorship. Several rights lawyers and activists in China, including Guo Feixiong, have faced harsh treatment such as lengthy prison terms, disappearances, and restrictions on movement. Guo was sentenced to six years in prison for disrupting social order. Other activists like Guo Hongguo and Hu Shigen were also convicted of subversion and received suspended or lengthy prison sentences. Jiang Tianyong, a human rights advocate, faced similar challenges. Jiang Tianyong, a human rights lawyer who defended Falun Gong practitioners, Tibetans, and other activists, was detained in November 2016 and charged with subversion of state power in May 2017. Li Heping, an attorney who represented various groups, was held incommunicado and sentenced to a three-year suspended jail term for subverting state power. Pu Zhiqiang, a human rights lawyer and government critic, was detained in 2014. In 2014, Pu Zhiqiang was detained for attending a gathering marking the 25th anniversary of the 1989 military crackdown. He received a suspended sentence in 2015 for \"inciting ethnic hatred\" and \"disturbing public order.\" Wang Quanzhang, a member of Fengrui Law firm, defended various rights cases and was detained for refusing a judge's command. Wang Yu, also from Fengrui Law Firm, was detained in 2015 and charged with subversion in 2016. In 2016, Wang was released on bail after a coerced confession denouncing colleagues. Xia Lin, an attorney, was sentenced to 12 years in jail for fraud. Xie Yang, another attorney, described torture endured while detained in 2015. Xie pleaded guilty to charges of inciting subversion of state power during a court hearing in May 2017. He denied being tortured and was released on bail before a verdict was announced. Other activists like Zhai Yanmin and Zhou Shifeng from the Fengrui Law Firm were also convicted of similar charges in previous years. The role of nongovernmental organizations in China has been growing, with the government increasingly relying on them for social services and advocacy. Nonstate entities, including environmental groups, have been increasingly involved in social advocacy and policy input in China. There are over 650,000 registered NGOs in the country, with an additional number of unregistered NGOs ranging from 1 million to 7 million. In 2016, thousands of foreign NGOs operated in China, with about 1,000 having an established presence. The government announced in 2013 a simplified process for domestic NGOs to register and operate legally. The Chinese government has allowed NGOs to apply directly for legal status without an official sponsor. Civil society, including NGOs, is seen as crucial for defending human rights and democracy. However, under Xi Jinping, the government has increased restrictions on civil society, viewing it as a potential security threat. Many international NGOs in China have faced growing limitations. Many international NGOs in China, especially those involved in rule of law programs and social advocacy, are facing increased scrutiny and constraints. State security officers detained and deported Peter Dahlin, a Swedish national co-founder of a Beijing-based NGO providing legal aid, stating that the era for effecting change in China through NGOs seems to be over. The space for civil society to operate is shrinking according to experts. The PRC government under Xi Jinping has advanced the law-based governance of the country, emphasizing the importance of upholding the Party's leadership. While some progress has been made in areas like human rights and civil society, laws have mainly been developed to strengthen CCP rule, with new legislation expanding state control over social activities, defense lawyers, the Internet, and ethnic minority groups. Under Xi Jinping, the Chinese government is tightening controls over the Internet and ethnic minority groups. In response to new laws, several countries' ambassadors expressed concerns about potential negative impacts on commerce, innovation, and human rights. The National Security Law passed in 2015 grants greater state scrutiny and control over social, ethnic, and cultural activities, raising criticism for its vague wording. The Cybersecurity Law passed in 2016 in China aims to safeguard national security by preventing illegal activities on the Internet. Critics argue that the law's vague wording could potentially violate human rights in various aspects of public life. The law also targets negative cultural influences, activities dividing ethnicities, and foreign interference in domestic religious affairs. The cybersecurity law in China centralizes control over the Internet, granting the government broad powers to regulate online activities. Critics argue that the law's vague language could be used for political purposes, potentially infringing on freedom of speech. Prohibited activities include those that threaten national security and sovereignty. The cybersecurity law in China grants the government broad powers to regulate online activities, including monitoring content and obtaining real identity information from Internet service providers. Critics argue that the law could stifle free speech, particularly among Uyghur Muslims, by restricting media coverage of terrorist incidents and defining terrorism to include \"propositions.\" The new law in China tightens regulations on foreign NGOs, reflecting the government's suspicion of foreign influences on civil society. It grants the state discretionary powers in counterterrorism efforts, raising concerns about potential human rights violations. The new law in China imposes stricter registration requirements on foreign NGOs, requiring them to find a government agency to sponsor them. It also increases supervision and controls on their activities, funding, and staffing. Experts believe that Chinese leaders fear political uprisings supported by foreign NGOs, similar to those in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East. The law's vague provisions have created uncertainty, and non-compliance may result in civil or criminal penalties for foreign NGOs, especially those working in politically sensitive areas. The new law in China imposes stricter registration requirements on foreign NGOs, increasing supervision and controls on their activities. NGOs may face civil or criminal penalties for activities deemed to endanger national security or harm national interests. Human rights groups warn of the law's potential impact on foreign and domestic NGOs, leading to suspensions of operations and a drop in funding. Concerns exist that the law may be too burdensome for smaller NGOs or those involved in human rights activities. The new law in China imposes stricter registration requirements on foreign NGOs, increasing supervision and controls on their activities. Some worry about hindering people-to-people exchanges and partnerships with official PRC entities due to political risks. An NPC official stated that while China welcomes overseas NGOs, those engaging in activities that threaten social stability and state security will be subject to the rule of law. The new law in China eases registration requirements for charitable organizations but strengthens government oversight. It aims to improve transparency, protect donors, and enhance public trust. Critics fear it may restrict informal fundraising methods like online crowdsourcing. China's first national law on domestic violence, effective since March 2016, covers physical and mental abuse. The Anti-Domestic Violence Law in China, effective since March 2016, covers physical and mental abuse between family members and cohabitating couples. It provides stronger legal mechanisms to protect women from domestic abuse. However, the government has imposed restrictions on women's rights advocates, leading to the closure of the Beijing Zhongze Women's Legal Counseling and Service Center. This center had been providing services related to anti-domestic violence litigation and rural women's land rights for over two decades. The ongoing human rights issues in China are discussed in various reports, highlighting the government's attempts to reduce violations in some areas. However, the lack of checks on state power and the CCP's prioritization of maintaining authority lead to continued human rights abuses. Jerome Cohen notes that while progress has been made in some legal aspects, fundamental human rights problems persist. The lack of guarantees for civil and political rights in China despite economic and social progress. Activists and journalists face harassment, detention, and censorship for politically sensitive issues. Arbitrary use of state security laws against dissidents, with strict controls on speech. The Chinese government enforces heavy censorship on politically sensitive speech and online communication. Lawyers who take on politically sensitive cases face closure of offices, suspension of licenses, and harassment. There are reports of physical and mental abuse leading to forced confessions and death. Harsh religious and ethnic policies are enforced against Tibetans and Uyghurs, with Christians and Falun Gong adherents also facing persecution. North Korean nationals in China are repatriated and may face severe punishment upon return. The Chinese government enforces heavy censorship on politically sensitive speech and online communication, with lawyers facing closure of offices and harassment for taking on such cases. There are reports of physical and mental abuse leading to forced confessions and death. Harsh religious and ethnic policies are enforced against Tibetans, Uyghurs, Christians, and Falun Gong adherents. North Korean nationals residing in China may face severe punishment upon return to North Korea in violation of U.N. conventions. Government harassment, intimidation, and obstruction of independent candidates in local elections, alleged manipulation of ballots to exclude independent candidates, violations of international labor rights, constraints on foreign journalists, and trafficking in persons, including forced labor in Xinjiang and detention centers. In 2017, China was downgraded to Tier 3 by the Department of State for not meeting minimum standards in human trafficking. Strengthening the rule of law is crucial for protecting human rights in China, as the lack of judicial independence and legal protections undermines progress. Calling on PRC leaders to abide by China's constitution and laws is seen as an effective strategy. The Chinese government has taken measures to reduce human rights abuses and increase transparency, but the Communist Party remains above the law in politically sensitive areas. Reforms have been made to limit government influence over courts, including transferring power to provincial governments and directing judges to record instances of interference. China's Supreme People's Court has made efforts to retry wrongful conviction cases and reduce pretrial detention rates. However, experts believe that China's leaders aim to combat corruption in the local judicial branch without subjecting the national government to judicial oversight. President Zhou Qiang publicly criticized the idea of judicial independence in 2017, possibly under pressure from Xi Jinping. Despite improvements in legal aid funding and access to counsel, China's criminal justice system still faces issues such as low legal representation, constrained lawyer roles, and reliance on forced confessions, especially in human rights cases. The rate of legal representation in criminal cases in China has dropped to around 20%, with a conviction rate of over 99%. Judges have significant discretion over witness appearances, weakening defenses. New regulations aim to protect lawyers' rights, but revisions limit defense lawyers in sensitive cases. Lawyers may face penalties for various actions under the new laws and regulations. The PRC government practices various forms of detention in violation of international law and its own laws, including residential surveillance for up to six months without notifying the family. Despite abolishing the RETL system, public security bureaus continue to detain citizens for minor political offenses without trial. China's detention practices include quasilegal and extralegal forms like \"Legal Education Centers\" and psychiatric facilities. The U.N. criticized China for violating international norms in the detention of U.S. citizen Sandy Phan-Gillis. The criminal justice system in China still uses torture to extract confessions, despite amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law in 2013. The United Nations Committee against Torture found that China has not eliminated torture and ill treatment, especially during pretrial and extralegal detention. Despite legal reforms, there are concerns about the lack of immediate access to a lawyer for detained persons. China's Ministry of Public Security issued regulations to prevent police misconduct, including obtaining confessions through torture. The Communist Party's internal disciplinary system, shuan g gui, has seen an increase in cases due to Xi Jinping's anticorruption campaign, with allegations of torture to extract confessions. Thousands of political prisoners in China are detained for exercising freedoms of speech, assembly, religious activities, or promoting ethnic minority rights. The Dui Hua Foundation estimates the number of detainees, highlighting ongoing human rights concerns. The Dui Hua Foundation estimated that there were 6,700 political and religious prisoners in China as of June 2016, including Falun Gong practitioners, Tibetans, and Uyghurs. The Congressional\u2013Executive Commission on China maintains a database with over 1,400 cases of political and religious prisoners. The Department of State reports tens of thousands held for political and religious reasons in China. Notable cases include Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and political dissident. Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and political dissident, died in prison while serving an 11-year term. He helped draft Charter 08, calling for civil and political rights in China. Liu was detained by Beijing police before the publication of Charter 08 and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese dissident, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for \"inciting subversion of state power\" for his writings and involvement in Charter 08. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his non-violent advocacy for human rights. Liu was critical of the Chinese Communist Party and supported gradual political reform through raising public awareness. Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese dissident, advocated for democracy and political reform, facing periods of incarceration for his activism. He was diagnosed with advanced-stage liver cancer in 2017 and his family requested permission for him and his wife, Liu Xia, to seek medical treatment abroad. Despite Chinese authorities inviting foreign medical experts to join his treatment, they did not reduce his sentence or allow him to travel abroad for treatment. Following Liu Xiaobo's death, foreign medical experts believed he could be safely transported abroad for treatment, but Chinese authorities deemed him too ill. US officials urged Beijing to allow Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, to travel abroad for medical care and to release her from house arrest. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on China to free Liu Xia and allow her to depart according to her wishes. Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in a Chinese prison for promoting democratic reform, was deeply mourned by members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. They called for human rights and democratic change in China, urging the government to allow Liu Xia to leave the country. Some Members of Congress introduced resolutions honoring Liu's legacy and advocating for medical treatment abroad. Gao Zhisheng, a prominent rights lawyer, was also mentioned. In Washington, DC, \"Liu Xiaobo Plaza\" was established. Gao Zhisheng, a prominent rights lawyer in China, faced multiple detentions and torture by prison officials. Despite being released in August 2014, he remains under house arrest and surveillance. Xu Zhiyong, a constitutional rights advocate, was convicted of disturbing public order and sentenced to four years in prison in January 2014. Xu Zhiyong, a lawyer and rights activist, was sentenced to four years in prison for \"gathering a crowd to disturb public order.\" He co-founded the New Citizen's Movement, a network advocating for government transparency, citizens' rights, and social justice. Xu also helped organize the Open Constitution Initiative, a legal research organization shut down by the government in 2009. Despite the commercialization of the media and the growth of the Internet and social media, the Chinese government severely restricts press freedom. China ranks 176th out of 180 countries in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index, with journalists and \"netizens\" facing incarceration and various forms of harassment for covering politically sensitive issues. Publications discussing political reform also face increasing pressure from state authorities. The Chinese government restricts press freedom, with journalists facing harassment for covering sensitive issues. Journalists can be held criminally liable for false reports under the PRC Criminal Law. The commercialization of the press is reversing, with increased reliance on government support. China has extensive Internet censorship, but it serves as an outlet for citizens to express opinions. Under Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has tightened control over the Internet, blocking access to numerous websites, including some of the most popular globally. This crackdown has limited the ability of citizens to express dissenting opinions and access uncensored information online. Under Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has tightened control over the Internet, blocking access to numerous websites, including 8 of the 25 most trafficked global sites. This includes Radio Free Asia, Voice of America (Chinese language), international human rights websites related to Tibet and Falun Gong, many Taiwanese news sites, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube. English language news sites like the Washington Post and Yahoo homepage are generally accessible, while The Wall Street Journal and Wikipedia are blocked. Google services, including Gmail, have been intermittently blocked since 2014. The Chinese government has tightened control over the Internet, blocking access to sensitive topics and major events. They have shut down the Internet in some places and blocked nearly all Internet traffic in Xinjiang for 10 months in 2009. Commonly filtered keywords include references to Tibetan policies, the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989, Falun Gong, PRC leaders, dissidents, and discussions of democracy. Other areas targeted for censorship include controversial government policies, public health and safety, sensitive foreign affairs issues, and media and censorship policies. Students and the public have been enlisted to enforce censorship. The Chinese government enlists students, public employees, and volunteers to post progovernment comments online and divert public discussion from sensitive topics. Chinese Internet users access filtered sites beyond the Great Firewall using VPNs. The government has tried to disrupt VPN services but many circumvention efforts continue. In 2015, a cyberattack disrupted access to countercensorship sites. In January 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that domestic VPN services would require government approval. According to experts, the Chinese government's censorship of the Internet may be implemented flexibly, with VPNs being used by foreigners and Chinese citizens for accessing the global Internet. Chinese leaders value limited online discussion for monitoring public opinion and providing a \"safety valve\" for expressing views. They are concerned about the Internet's potential for collective action but less worried about sensitive words. VPNs allow users to bypass censorship but come with inconveniences like slower browsing speeds. The use of VPNs in China has grown rapidly, with around 29% of Chinese netizens utilizing them. However, many Chinese Internet users do not go online for political reasons and accept the government's justifications for Internet regulation. Microblogging services and social networking sites in China became important sources of news and public opinion until the government imposed restrictions on them. Between 2009 and 2012, Sina Corporation's weibo was a prominent platform for free speech and public discourse in China. However, due to government restrictions and harassment of bloggers, weibo's popularity declined, and Tencent Holdings' WeChat emerged as a popular alternative. WeChat, launched in 2011, offers various features like messaging, e-commerce, and gaming, but focuses on connecting users with private circles rather than a public audience, reducing its political impact. In 2013, China enacted new laws requiring real names for Internet and social networking accounts. Bloggers could face prison for defamatory content reposted or viewed multiple times. These policies had a chilling effect on online discourse, leading to the shutdown of WeChat public accounts and harassment of political commentators. New regulations in 2014 restricted the reporting of news on current events by microblogging and messaging services, requiring a permit from the State Internet Information Office. WeChat groups were also limited in size. Religious freedom in China varies depending on party interests and local officials' discretion, with the Constitution guaranteeing \"religious belief\" but not all religious practices. President Xi Jinping emphasized the protection of legitimate rights of religious peoples while guarding against overseas infiltrations and ideological infringement by extremists. Despite government restrictions, religious life in China continues to grow, with an estimated 350 million PRC citizens openly practicing one of five officially recognized religions. Xi has shown support for Chinese Buddhism, folk religions, Daoism, and Confucian philosophy, perceived to be more compatible with CCP rule. Since Xi came to power, the Chinese government has intensified restrictions on religious practices, including preventing children from participating in religious activities. Despite this, believers have shown resistance. Unregistered Christian churches, Tibetan Buddhists, Uyghur Muslims, and Falun Gong practitioners face harsh policies due to fears of independence. Chinese authorities have persecuted Tibetan Buddhists and Uyghur Muslims for religious and cultural activities deemed \"extremist,\" \"separatist,\" and \"terrorist.\" The U.S. government restricts exports to China due to severe violations of religious freedom. In April 2017, the USCIRF recommended that China be designated as a CPC for 2016. The U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom called for an end to cross removals and church demolitions in Zhejiang province, urged reassessment of restrictive policies on Tibetan Buddhists and Uyghur Muslims, and expressed concern over detentions of religious leaders and human rights defenders. Positive developments were noted in the growth of religious adherents and activities, as well as faith-based charitable services in China. Christianity is the second-largest religion in China after Buddhism, with between 70 million and 90 million Chinese Christians worshiping in registered and unregistered churches. Many Chinese Protestants reject the official Three Self Patriotic Movement church for political or theological reasons, with some claiming they have been rejected for official status by local government. Many house churches in China have faced harassment by government authorities, with leaders being detained or imprisoned, and properties confiscated. The U.S.-based China Aid Association reported increased persecution in 2016, including 303 Christians sentenced to prison. New religious regulations in 2016 impose restrictions on Chinese contacts with overseas religious organizations and require government approval for religious schools and websites. Authorities in Zhejiang province have been targeting the growing Christian population since 2014. In Zhejiang province, efforts against \"excessive religious sites\" and \"illegal\" structures have been carried out, with crosses removed from over 1,200 churches and 20 church structures destroyed. Tensions exist between Catholics in China who express allegiance to the Pope and those affiliated with the government's Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. Tensions between the Vatican and Beijing stem from disagreements over bishops' appointments, religious freedom, and diplomatic ties with Taiwan. While most Chinese bishops have dual approval, the CCPA has ordained bishops without Rome's consent since 2010, causing friction. Dialogue to improve relations began in 2014, with some bishops receiving joint approval since 2015. A draft agreement in 2016 proposed PRC selecting bishop candidates for the Pope to choose from, but issues remain unresolved regarding Vatican-approved bishops in unregistered churches and those ordained by the Chinese government without Vatican permission. In 2012, Thaddeus Ma Daqin, a bishop approved by both the Vatican and Beijing, renounced ties to the CCPA. The government stripped Ma of his title and confined him to a seminary outside Shanghai. Tibetan grievances over Beijing's rule persist, with some Tibetans viewing PRC government policies as hostile to their religion, culture, language, and identity. The TAR, established in 1965, is home to about 2.7 million ethnic Tibetans out of China's total of 6 million. Tensions between the PRC government and Tibetans have been high since 2008 unrest. Talks between the Dalai Lama's envoys and Beijing have stalled, with the envoys pushing for Tibetan autonomy. The Chinese government has emphasized social and economic development in Tibet while condemning the Dalai Lama's separatist activities. There is a heightened police presence in the TAR and increased controls on Tibetan religious life, exacerbating grievances in Tibetan areas. The Department of State reported severe repression of Tibet's unique heritage, including restrictions on civil rights and limitations on the Tibetan language in schools. Despite the Regional Ethnic Minority Law in China that promotes the use of minority languages in schools, Tibetan areas have faced increased surveillance and persecution. Tibetan individuals involved in various activities have been targeted, leading to arbitrary arrests, detentions, and even killings by state agents. Many Tibetans have been detained for minor offenses like participating in protests or sharing information online. The CECC has documented 650 Tibetan political prisoners and detainees, mostly arrested after the 2008 protests. Tibetans face economic domination by Han Chinese, forced resettlement, and environmental impacts of Beijing's projects. Hans form a minority in the TAR, but observers believe Han people make up over half of Lhasa's population. In Sichuan Province, efforts to demolish Larung Gar Buddhist Academy structures continue, with the government aiming to reduce the number of residents from 20,000 to 5,000. The center, founded in 1980, is a significant Tibetan Buddhism study hub. U.N. special rapporteurs expressed concern over expulsions of monks in November 2016. The joint statement expressed deep concern about expulsions of monks and nuns and demolitions of monastic dwellings at Larung Gar and Yachen Gar in Sichuan Province. Since 2009, about 150 Tibetans in China have self-immolated, with 119 known deaths. The PRC government has implemented policies punishing associates of self-immolators. Dr. Lobsang Sangay, head of the Central Tibetan Administration, stated their consistent stance on the issue. The Tibetan exile community leader urged against drastic actions like self-immolations, blaming PRC repression. Self-immolations have not been limited to Tibetans, with other PRC citizens also protesting through self-immolation. The U.S. government supports Tibetan rights and traditions while acknowledging Tibet as part of China. Past U.S. presidents, including Clinton, Bush, and Obama, have met with the Dalai Lama to show support for Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has met with President Obama four times during his presidency, with China expressing opposition to the meetings due to U.S. interference in internal affairs. The Dalai Lama is seen as a political figure conducting secessionist activities internationally. Members of Congress have shown support for Tibetan aspirations, with the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission urging China to repeal policies related to Tibetan rights violations. In 2016, Representative Jim McGovern sponsored a letter signed by 72 Members of Congress urging the U.S. government to support the Tibetan people. In 2015, a congressional delegation led by Nancy Pelosi raised human rights issues and autonomy for Tibetan areas in China. Pelosi also led a delegation to Dharamsala, India in 2017 to meet with the Dalai Lama and advocate for human rights and autonomy in Tibetan areas. Senator Steve Daines led a delegation to China in 2017. In April 2017, Senator Steve Daines led a congressional delegation to China and Japan, visiting Lhasa, Tibet. Chinese authorities have implemented harsh policies against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, leading to tensions. Uyghurs face harassment, restrictions on religious practices, erosion of ethnic identity, economic discrimination, and lack of consultation on policies. Han migration encouraged by the government has further strained relations with Uyghurs. Uyghurs now make up around 45% of the population in Xinjiang. The XUAR's population of 24 million includes around 45% Uyghurs, with Han Chinese migration to Urumqi. Economic development in Xinjiang has favored Hans over Uyghurs. Uyghurs face severe repression of freedoms, with the government justifying measures on security grounds. The XUAR has the highest number of \"endangering state security\" trials in China, with Uyghurs deprived of procedural protections. Human rights groups criticize excessive government restrictions on Uyghur religious and ethnic practices, including limitations on Muslim clerics, Ramadan observance, and Uyghur language use. Restrictions also extend to Uyghur children, minors, and CCP members, who are prohibited from practicing Islam openly or participating in religious customs like fasting during Ramadan. Uyghurs often face obstacles in traveling abroad and are subject to laws banning veils and long beards in public. Experts attribute current tensions to events in July 2009. The current tensions stem from events in July 2009, where police attacked Uyghur demonstrators in Urumqi, leading to rioting and Uyghur attacks on Han people. Subsequent clashes and attacks resulted in hundreds of deaths, with Uyghurs and Hans being the majority of casualties. Since 2015, reported violent incidents, including security raids and Uyghur attacks, have led to over 100 deaths in the XUAR. Authorities claim these actions were in response to separatist activities and terrorist threats. Human rights groups claim Uyghur protests turned violent due to repressive state policies. Uyghurs have fled China to escape persecution. Chinese government blames Islamic fundamentalism for violence in Xinjiang. ETIM is accused of terrorist attacks in China. Some Uyghur Muslims have joined ISIS in the Middle East. New PRC counterterrorism legislation expands police authority. The PRC government has implemented new counterterrorism legislation expanding police authority in response to jihadist groups in Syria. The XUAR government has passed regional measures with harsher punishments for spreading extremist content online. Additionally, the government has implemented a three-pronged strategy to address Uyghur grievances, including economic development, a crackdown on religious extremism, and assimilation policies. In 2016, new police stations with high-tech surveillance equipment were set up in the XUAR to assimilate Uyghurs into Han society. Assimilation policies include promoting Chinese language instruction, incentivizing mixed Uyghur-Han marriages, and encouraging Uyghur workers to migrate to other provinces. Some experts believe these policies may erode Uyghur identity and fuel resentment. Attempts to discourage Uyghur religious and cultural traditions have backfired, leading to a rise in conservative Islam and popularization of Muslim practices like wearing veils. Beijing court sentenced Uyghur economics professor Ilham Tohti to life in prison for separatism. Tohti, known for advocating Uyghur rights through dialogue, was arrested in 2014 due to his website, interviews, and critical articles. Falun Gong combines exercise and meditation to attain virtues. Falun Gong is a spiritual practice involving traditional Chinese qigong movements to stimulate qi flow. It combines Buddhist and Daoist concepts and gained millions of followers in China. Adherents believe in attaining true health and spiritual development. In 1999, thousands protested government restrictions, leading to the establishment of the \"610\" office by the CCP. The CCP established the \"610\" office in 1999 to eradicate Falun Gong, with activities punishable under Article 300 of the PRC Criminal Law. An amendment in 2015 increased the maximum sentence for cult crimes to life in prison. Hundreds of thousands of practitioners were sent to RETL centers for refusing to renounce Falun Gong, where abuse and force-feeding were reported. Since the formal dismantling of the RETL system in 2014, Falun Gong detainees have been sent to Legal Education Centers or mental health facilities for indoctrination. Roughly 900 practitioners have been sentenced to prison terms under Xi Jinping's rule. Falun Gong overseas organizations claim over 3,800 adherents died in custody between 1999 and 2015, with 80 deaths in 2016. Enforcement of the CCP's objective to eliminate Falun Gong has reportedly loosened, with fewer government restrictions and some practitioners allowed to practice while in detention. The Dui Hua Foundation suggests that recent legal interpretations may lead to lighter penalties for Falun Gong practitioners, with some reports alleging illegal organ harvesting from detainees. Tibetan and Uyghur prisoners have also been victims, but to a lesser extent. Advocates argue that thousands of organs have been transplanted in China in recent years. Advocates argue that the high number of transplanted organs in China, estimated at roughly 10,000 annually, cannot be fully explained by executed prisoners or volunteer donors. They believe Falun Gong detainees are the primary source due to the large number of people in need of organs and the declining number of executions. Claims of organ harvesting from Falun Gong detainees are based on circumstantial evidence and interviews. The authors allege that organ harvesting in China involves a much higher number of transplants than officially reported, estimating between 60,000 to 100,000 per year since 2000. They suggest a significant number of Falun Gong practitioners have been killed for their organs, citing a surge in transplantation facilities and surgeries in the country. In 2017, Freedom House reported credible evidence of organ harvesting from Falun Gong detainees in China. The Department of State's 2006 investigation cast doubt on allegations of a Falun Gong concentration camp for organ harvesting. Chinese officials admitted issues in organ donation practices but denied harvesting from Falun Gong. Measures were announced to reform China's organ transplantation system in response to international pressure. In response to international pressure, China announced measures to reform its organ transplantation system, including banning transplant tourism and declaring organ trafficking a crime. Regulations enacted in 2007 created national oversight mechanisms, and in 2012, the government announced the phase-out of organs from executed prisoners. Despite pledges to end this practice, doubts remain as some reports suggest prisoners are still a source of organs labeled as \"citizen donations.\" International human rights and medical groups have raised concerns about the consent of death-row prisoners for organ donation. Experts have raised concerns about the transparency of China's organ donation and transplantation systems, urging the government to allow independent verification. Despite a decrease in organs from inmates, there is a growing number of voluntary donors in China. However, cultural beliefs and distrust of the medical system hinder efforts to promote organ donation. China's \"One-Child Policy\" has also impacted organ donation practices. The \"One-Child Policy\" in China, implemented in 1980 to control population growth, led to human rights abuses and demographic issues such as a skewed gender ratio and trafficking in women. Reforms to the policy began in 2013, allowing all married couples to have two children. However, concerns remain about coercive family planning measures. China's Population and Family Planning Law does not explicitly condone abortion, focusing on contraception. The One-Child Policy led to abuses by officials, including forced sterilizations and coercive late-term abortions. The amended law now allows married couples to have two children and prohibits government officials from infringing on citizens' rights. Punishable actions for violating the policy include fines and job-related sanctions. The amended Population and Family Planning Law in China prohibits state personnel from infringing on citizens' personal rights, abusing power, demanding bribes, or misappropriating fees. Social compensation fees remain for couples with more than two children, raising concerns about coercive measures for violators. The previous One-Child Policy led to sex-selective abortions due to a preference for boys, resulting in a gender imbalance that has since improved with stricter enforcement and policy relaxations. The gender imbalance in China has declined to 115 boys for every 100 girls born, compared to the global ratio of 103 to 100. Many Chinese couples limit their families to one child due to high costs, career commitments, and childcare difficulties. Various means are used by Congress and Administrations to promote human rights and democracy in China, including criticism, diplomacy, foreign assistance, sanctions, and international pressure. Human rights advocates praised U.S. efforts to promote human rights globally. Human rights advocates praised U.S. efforts to promote human rights globally and in China, including legislation imposing penalties on foreign individuals for human rights violations and a critical international statement on China's human rights record. Congress plays a significant role in U.S. human rights policy towards China through various activities such as sponsoring legislation, holding hearings, and raising human rights issues during official travel to China. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs and other congressional bodies have held hearings on human rights issues in China, including detained rights lawyers, organ harvesting, and academic freedom. Various organizations investigated and reported on human rights conditions in China, leading to the passage of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act in December 2016. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, allows the President to impose sanctions on foreign individuals responsible for human rights violations, such as extrajudicial killings and torture. Named after Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, the act grants the President authority to revoke U.S. entry visas and freeze U.S. property transactions of those deemed guilty of targeting whistle-blowers. The U.S. government provides assistance to individuals in foreign countries who expose illegal activities by government officials or promote human rights. Assistance is not given to Chinese government entities or NGOs directly. State Department and USAID grants mainly go to U.S.-based NGOs and universities. U.S. foreign assistance in China focuses on sustainable development, environmental conservation, Tibetan culture preservation, and support for human rights, democracy, and rule of law. Approximately $78 million was provided for Tibetan programs and $77 million for rule of law and environmental efforts in China between 2001 and 2016. The U.S. government provides assistance for Tibetan programs, rule of law, and environmental efforts in China, administered by the Department of State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Some policymakers argue against foreign assistance programs in China due to the country's financial resources. Critics question the effectiveness of U.S. democracy and governance programs in China, while human rights activists raise concerns about stakeholders refraining from supporting tougher U.S. approaches towards China's human rights abuses to protect their own interests. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is a private foundation dedicated to promoting democratic institutions worldwide, including in China. It has been active in supporting human rights and democracy in China since the mid-1980s, funded primarily by congressional appropriations. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has been actively promoting human rights and democracy in China since the mid-1980s. NED has provided grants to Chinese, Tibetan, and Uyghur human rights and democracy groups, as well as NGOs in mainland China, with an average of $6.7 million per year in funding. Program areas include rule of law, civil society, freedom of expression, Internet freedom, and promoting understanding of ethnic concerns in China. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has been actively promoting human rights and democracy in China since the mid-1980s. NED has provided grants to Chinese, Tibetan, and Uyghur human rights and democracy groups, as well as NGOs in mainland China. Program areas include rule of law, civil society, freedom of expression, Internet freedom, labor rights, public policy analysis, rural land rights, and promoting understanding of ethnic concerns in China. U.S. economic sanctions on China in response to human rights conditions have been limited and largely symbolic. Sanctions imposed after the 1989 Tiananmen military crackdown have been lifted, but restrictions on exports of crime control equipment remain due to China's designation as a \"country of particular concern\" for religious freedom. Legislation may impose restrictions on U.S. support for projects in Tibet to prevent erosion of Tibetan culture. Countries designated as \"Tier 3\" in the Trafficking in Persons Report may face restrictions on U.S. assistance. The U.S. limits support for international financial institution lending to China for human rights reasons. Other laws like Sections 116 and 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 can be used to deny foreign assistance on human rights grounds. The Trump Administration has invoked the Kemp-Kasten. The Trump Administration has ceased U.S. contributions to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) under the Kemp-Kasten amendment, citing support for coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization in China. Congress enacted legislation restricting U.S. funding for UNFPA programs in China and prohibiting funding for abortions. The U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue was suspended by Beijing in 2016, possibly in response to U.S. criticism of China's human rights record. China's human rights record is not a focus in the new U.S.-China Comprehensive Dialogue established in 2017. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson emphasized that human rights are integral to all discussions with China. The U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue, initiated in 1990, has not been fully embraced by Beijing. The dialogue was suspended by the Chinese government in 2014. The PRC government suspended the human rights dialogue in 2014, possibly in response to former President Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama. Beijing had previously suspended the dialogue in 2004 after a U.N. resolution criticizing China's human rights record. Chinese officials have been less willing to engage on human rights issues through diplomacy since 2013. The 19th dialogue included meetings with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and human rights groups, marking the first time a Chinese delegation engaged with civil society critics. During the 19th dialogue, the U.S. delegation raised concerns about human rights issues in China, including crackdowns on lawyers, religious freedom violations, and restrictions on journalists. The Chinese delegation, led by Li Junhua, also highlighted human rights problems in the United States, such as racial discrimination and police use of force. Critics have questioned the effectiveness of the human rights dialogue during the Obama Administration. Some experts criticized the human rights dialogue during the Obama Administration for lacking benchmarks, incentives, and penalties for progress on human rights in China. Critics argued for more transparency, involvement of nongovernmental stakeholders, and integration of human rights into the broader U.S.-China relationship. Obama officials defended the dialogue as a platform to express U.S. positions on human rights, not for negotiation. The U.S.-China human rights dialogue is seen as a platform to focus on human rights issues, with some critics suggesting it can be used to press the Chinese government on human rights before bilateral summits. U.S.-based human rights groups believe it is the best forum for raising cases of imprisoned activists, while Chinese activists see it as raising awareness in China. The Legal Experts Dialogue (LED) was launched in 2003 to bring together legal experts from both countries. The Legal Experts Dialogue (LED) was established in 2003 to facilitate discussions on the rule of law between legal experts from the United States and China. The seventh LED took place in Beijing in October 2015, covering topics such as Chinese lawyers' access to clients, police interrogation techniques, and administrative law reforms. The U.S. government has made efforts to promote global Internet freedom through initiatives like the Global Internet Freedom Task Force and congressional hearings on Internet issues in China. The State Department administers Global Internet Freedom programs focusing on countercensorship, secure communications, training, advocacy, and policy research. China and Iran are primary target countries for these efforts. Congress allocated $13 million for Internet freedom in FY2016. The Broadcasting Board of Governors invests in international broadcasting, with China being a critical area. Voice of America and Radio Free Asia provide independent news to Chinese audiences. Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Asia (RFA) play key roles in providing U.S.-style broadcasting, journalism, and public debate in China. VOA offers mainly U.S. and international news, while RFA serves as an uncensored source of domestic Chinese news. The Chinese government regularly blocks VOA and RFA broadcasts in various languages, but their English services face less interference. Both VOA and RFA have enhanced their Internet services and provide access to their programs on social media platforms. The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was established in 2006 to replace the U.N. Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR). The U.S. sponsored resolutions at the UNCHR criticizing China's human rights record, but China blocked voting on them. China uses its soft power to reduce international pressure on its human rights issues. UNHRC members are elected for three-year terms and the U.S. was elected in 2009. The United States and China have been elected multiple times to the UN Human Rights Council. The UPR process assesses the human rights records of all UN members every four years. Critics argue that the UPR allows countries with poor records to criticize those with good records. During China's second UPR in 2013, many countries urged China to ratify the ICCPR and protect the rights of ethnic minorities like Tibetans and Uyghurs. Some nations recommended a visit by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. The U.S. was the only participant in the process. During China's second UPR in 2013, many countries urged China to ratify the ICCPR and protect the rights of ethnic minorities like Tibetans and Uyghurs. The United States was the only participant to provide names of Chinese citizens when raising human rights abuses against dissidents and activists. China adopted 204 recommendations and rejected 48, including those related to human rights activists, extrajudicial detention, freedom of belief, expression, and ethnic minority rights. PRC officials claimed fair treatment of ethnic minorities and prioritized poverty reduction. They expressed willingness to collaborate on human rights with mutual respect but declined to set a timetable for ratifying the ICCPR. China's National Human Rights Action Plan for 2016-2020 pledges to implement recommendations of its first and second UPRs and to \"conduct exchanges and cooperation\" with the OHCHR. The Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders found discrepancies in China's implementation of UPR recommendations, with only 3 recommendations fully implemented out of 43. Human Rights in China submitted a mid-term assessment noting a deterioration of rights in China and provided recommendations for the government to meet its UPR commitments and comply with international human rights standards. In March 2016, a group of 12 countries, led by the United States, expressed serious concerns about human rights abuses in China at the United Nations Human Rights Council. The declaration highlighted China's deteriorating human rights record, including arrests of rights activists and lawyers for peacefully exercising their freedom of expression. Congressional resolutions have been introduced to honor Liu Xiaobo and urge China to release him and his wife for medical treatment. S.Con.Res. 21 and H.R. 2537 urge China to release Liu Xiaobo and his wife for medical treatment and designate an area in Washington, D.C. as \"Liu Xiaobo Plaza.\" H.R. 1872 and S. 821, known as the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2017, were introduced by McGovern and Rubio on April 4, 2017. H.Res. 65 urges an independent investigation into the death of Tibetan leader Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and calls for an end to China's repressive policies in Tibet. H.Res. 343 (Passed on June 13, 2016): Expressing concern regarding reports of organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience in China, including Falun Gong practitioners. Several bills and resolutions have been introduced regarding human rights issues in China, including organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience and the protection of religious minority rights. Notable mentions include H.Res. 337 calling for dialogue to address Tibetan grievances, H.R. 2621 China Human Rights Protection Act, and H.R. 2242 World Press Freedom Act. Additionally, H.R. 1112 Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, H.Res. 105 for religious minority rights protection, and S.Res. 69 for global religious minority rights protection were also proposed. Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (S. 284 and H.R. 624) was passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. Other related bills and resolutions include H.R. 5379 China Human Rights Protection Act, S.Res. 482 for \"Liu Xiaobo Plaza\" designation, H.R. 4851 Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, and H.Res. 599 urging action on human rights issues. H.Res. 599 (Passed on 5/28/2014) urges China to respect human rights and stop censoring discussion of Tiananmen Square. S.Res. 451 (Passed on 6/4/2014) recalls China's violent suppression of peaceful assembly in Tiananmen Square. S.Res. 361 (Passed on 4/8/2014) recognizes threats to freedom of press in China and urges improvement in freedom of expression. H.Res. 327 (Not passed): Concerns about China's membership in the UNHRC. H.Res. 281 (Not passed): Concern over organ harvesting in China. H.Res. 245 (Not passed): Recognizing Tiananmen Square massacre anniversary."
