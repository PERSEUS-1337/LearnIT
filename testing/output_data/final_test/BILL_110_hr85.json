    "content": "The Energy Technology Transfer Act, also known as the \"Energy Policy Act of 2005,\" amends Section 917 to establish Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers. The Energy Technology Transfer Act establishes grants for Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers to be located in areas with the greatest need. Priority is given to applicants with existing outreach programs for transferring knowledge about advanced energy efficiency methods and technologies. The program aims to transfer knowledge about a variety of technologies. The Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers prioritize applicants expanding on existing programs in specific regions and focus on energy efficiency for housing. Each center operates programs to promote advanced energy methods through education and outreach. Activities include developing and distributing informational materials. The Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers focus on promoting energy efficiency through various activities such as developing informational materials, conducting demonstrations, organizing seminars and workshops, providing onsite energy evaluations, and hiring experts in energy efficient technologies. The Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers promote energy efficiency by conducting activities described in paragraphs (1) through (5) and require applicants to submit an application outlining their outreach program, technologies to be transferred, and collaborating organizations. The Secretary will award grants based on the applicant's ability to carry out proposed activities, coordination with other entities, and specific energy needs of the region to be served. The applicant must also estimate the number of energy end-users reached and describe how program success will be assessed. The Secretary will award grants based on the applicant's ability to carry out proposed activities, coordination with other entities, and specific energy needs of the region to be served. Grants will be for a 5-year period with cost-sharing requirements for commercial application activities. Grant recipients will be evaluated in the third year to assess program success. The Secretary may terminate grants that do not receive positive evaluations. Positive evaluations may result in a 3-year extension of the grant. Grantees may receive a final 3-year extension after a second evaluation. No grantee can receive more than 11 years of support without reapplying. The section prohibits the use of funds for facility construction. Definitions include advanced energy methods, technologies, and distributed generation. A Center refers to an Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Center. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of 'generation' in the context of electric power generation technologies serving consumers on-site. It also defines terms like Cooperative Extension and land-grant colleges and universities. The curr_chunk authorizes appropriations for the program under this section for 1994 Institutions."
