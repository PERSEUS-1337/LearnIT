    "title": "SB 155",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Independent System Operator is required to obtain approval from its governing board for entry into multistate or regional organizations. The Legislature aims to develop regional electricity transmission markets in western states through the evolution of the Independent System Operator and the Power Exchange into a regional organization. The preferred means for the voluntary evolution of the Independent System Operator and the Power Exchange into a regional organization is through a regional compact or agreement among cooperating party states. This agreement should outline the appointment process for governing board members and specify the size, structure, representation, and terms of service for the boards of both entities. The curr_chunk discusses the mechanisms for overseeing the actions of the Independent System Operator and the Power Exchange to ensure electricity system reliability and protect the interests of electricity consumers. It also emphasizes the adherence to standards by utilities to maintain the reliability of transmission systems. The curr_chunk defines \"pour-over will\" and \"recipient trust\" for legal purposes. A pour-over will devises property to the trustee of a recipient trust established by the decedent. Court Order Determining Passage of Property to Trustee or Trustees of Recipient Trust: If a decedent dies testate and devises property to a recipient trust, the trustee can file a petition in court to receive the property without administration, under certain conditions. The pour-over will devises the entire remainder of the property to the trustee of the recipient trust, with specific gifts eligible for disposition without administration under certain provisions. The court may rely on the petitioner's determinations in this regard. The petition for property distribution under this chapter does not require an inventory or appraisal. The petition must be verified, request the court to pass specific items to the petitioner as trustee of the recipient trust, and include necessary facts about the county and the time elapsed since the decedent's death. The petition for property distribution under this chapter requires that at least 40 days have passed since the decedent's death and no estate administration is ongoing. The petitioner must provide details from the pour-over will regarding property passing to the trustee of the recipient trust. The pour-over will must include specific gifts eligible for disposition without administration, determined by the petitioner. The petitioner must also provide a description of the decedent's property and details of heirs and devisees. The pour-over will must include specific gifts eligible for disposition without administration, determined by the petitioner. The petitioner must also provide a description of the decedent's property and details of heirs, devisees, executors, beneficiaries, trustees, and guardians. Notice of hearing must be given to all relevant parties. Upon satisfaction of the requirements, the court will issue an order for specific property to pass without administration to the trustee of the recipient trust. The order is conclusive on all except for allowing a petition under Section 17200. The attorney's fees for services related to filing a petition and obtaining a court order are determined by a private agreement between the attorney and client, not requiring court approval. Disputes over fees can be brought to court for resolution. If there is a dispute over the meaning of a court order under this chapter, a petition can be filed with the court to resolve the issue. Property transferred to the trustee of a recipient trust under Section 13755 is liable for payment of claims, debts, and expenses as outlined in Division 9."
