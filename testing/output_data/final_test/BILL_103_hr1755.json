    "content": "The \"Fair Elections Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings and purposes are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that voting participation in the United States is lower than in other democracies, emphasizing the fundamental rights of eligible citizens to seek election, vote, and associate for political purposes. These rights, protected by the Constitution, include the right to cast an effective vote and to create new political parties. Certain restrictions on access to the ballot, such as excessive petition requirements and early filing deadlines, hinder citizens' ability to exercise their constitutional right to create new political parties. Many states impose high barriers for political parties to remain on the ballot, including excessive petition requirements and early filing deadlines. The Supreme Court's 1983 ruling in Anderson v. Celebrezze deemed unconstitutional Ohio's law favoring major party candidates, setting a precedent for challenges to early petition deadlines by nonmajor parties and candidates. In 1992, 26 states required nonmajor party candidates for President to qualify for the ballot before the second major party national convention. In 1992, nonmajor party candidates for President had to obtain a significantly higher number of petition signatures compared to major party candidates to be listed on the ballots of all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In 1992, presidential primaries in various states had different requirements for candidates to obtain signatures for ballot listing. Some states required no signatures for major party candidates, while others required a range of signatures. Only two states required no signatures for nonmajor party candidates, with Louisiana having a $500 filing fee. Signatures required to list a nonmajor party candidate for Senate varied from zero to 180,935 in different states. Thirty-one states did not require signatures for major party candidates, while only Louisiana did not require signatures for nonmajor party candidates if they ran without a party label. Louisiana also had a $600 filing fee for candidates running with a party label. In 1992, the number of petition signatures required to list a major party candidate for Congress ranged from zero to 2,000, while for nonmajor party candidates it ranged from zero to 12,252. Thirty-one states did not require signatures for major party candidates, and only one state did not require signatures for nonmajor party candidates. In 1992, various states had different requirements for listing nonmajor party candidates on the ballot, including additional signatures for President, Senate, and Congress. Some states required 5,000 signatures for President or Senate candidates, while others required as few as 25 signatures. In 1992, different states had varying requirements for nonmajor party candidates to be listed on the ballot. For example, California required 78,992 registrants for a nonmajor party candidate for President to be listed with a party label. Arizona required nonmajor party candidates to obtain 10,555 signatures in 10 days for President or Senate, while major party candidates had more time and fewer signature requirements. California also required nonmajor party candidates to obtain 134,781 signatures in 105 days for President or Senate. In 105 days, major party candidates for Senate needed only 65 signatures, while nonmajor party candidates in Texas had to obtain 38,900 signatures in 75 days for President or Senate. Some states required nonmajor party candidates to pay fees per petition signature, while major party candidates faced no such requirements. Seven states mandated nonmajor party candidates for President or Senate to collect a certain number of petition signatures in specific congressional districts. Twenty States restrict petition circulation for nonmajor party candidates to residents of those States, while three States limit it to the county or congressional district where the circulator lives. Four States prohibit people who voted in a primary. (16) Four States (Nebraska, New York, Texas, West Virginia) prohibit primary election voters from signing petitions for nonmajor party candidates. Twelve States (California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Utah) restrict petition signing to those indicating support for the candidate or party. Five of these States require no petitions for major party candidates. Only New Jersey restricts petition signing for major party candidates based on support indication. The rights in this subsection aim to address barriers to electoral participation, especially for racial minorities. Establishing national standards for ballot access can enhance citizen participation. Congress has the authority to protect and promote these rights under various provisions of the US Constitution. The purposes of this Act are to establish fair and uniform standards for ballot access and to maximize citizen participation in Federal elections. SEC. 3. BALLOT ACCESS RIGHTS. An individual has the right to be a candidate in a Federal election by presenting a petition with a required number of signatures from qualified voters. In a Federal election, a candidate must present a petition with a specific number of signatures from eligible voters. The petition must have a certain number of signatures based on the previous election turnout, be circulated within a specific timeframe before the election date, and meet other requirements depending on the type of office being sought. In a Federal election, a candidate's petition must be circulated within a specific timeframe before the election date. The required number of signatures is reduced for each day less than 270 in that period. An individual has the right to be placed as a candidate on the ballot without needing to fulfill petition requirements. To be a candidate of a political party, body, or group in a Federal election, one must have received one percent of the votes in the most recent general election for President or Senator in that State, without needing to fulfill petition requirements. The Attorney General will create rules to implement the Act. Definitions include \"Federal election\" for President, Vice President, Senator, or Representative; \"State\" as a US state, DC, Puerto Rico, or other territories; and \"individual\" meeting qualifications for office candidacy."
