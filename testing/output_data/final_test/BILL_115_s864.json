    "content": "The \"Balkan Economic Partnership Act\" is the short title of this legislation, with the purpose and findings outlined in the following section. The \"Balkan Economic Partnership Act\" aims to support economic opportunity and political progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina through an enterprise fund for small and medium-sized enterprises. Congress recognizes the importance of preventing economic challenges from overshadowing stability and reconciliation efforts since the Bosnian War. Unemployment rates exceeding 40% have led to widespread frustration and protests in the country. Economic growth among small and medium-sized enterprises is crucial for progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bank lending and private sector credit-to-GDP ratio in Bosnia and Herzegovina have stagnated since 2008, hindering growth for small and medium-sized enterprises. International financial institutions and foreign-owned investment funds have focused on larger companies and infrastructure projects, neglecting SMEs. Bosnia and Herzegovina's demographic, income, and geographic characteristics are conducive for SME growth, with a market of almost 4 million people and a growing per capita income. The country imports nearly $10 billion worth of goods annually, presenting opportunities for domestic SME production. Congressional acts like the SEED Act of 1989 have aimed to support the private sector in Central and Eastern Europe post-Berlin Wall. The FREEDOM Support Act authorized $1.2 billion for USAID to establish 10 Enterprise Funds, which channeled $10 billion into 500 enterprises, leveraged $6.9 billion in private investment, created/sustained 300,000 jobs, and provided development capital in 19 countries. Establishing an enterprise fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina would help sustain and expand economic reform efforts, improve financial institutions, and empower entrepreneurs to create employment opportunities. This initiative has proven beneficial in other European countries like Poland, Hungary, and Albania, with a recoup rate of 177 percent of the original USAID funding. Establishing an enterprise fund for Herzegovina would improve financial institutions, provide investment opportunities for SMEs, and attract both domestic and international investors. The Bosnia and Herzegovina-American Enterprise Fund is established to improve financial institutions, provide investment opportunities for SMEs, and attract domestic and international investors. The Bosnia and Herzegovina-American Enterprise Fund aims to promote shared prosperity through private sector development in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including providing loans, investments, grants, and technical assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises. It also focuses on promoting sound corporate governance and Western business practices.
