The study addresses uncovering the lowest layer in a deep neural network under specific assumptions. The goal is to understand the landscape of learning neural networks, especially in the context of parameter recovery guarantees for deeper networks. The study focuses on learning deep neural networks with multiple non-linear layers, specifically uncovering the lowest layer in a deep neural network. It aims to understand the landscape of learning neural networks and provide parameter recovery guarantees for deeper networks. The function computed by the neural network involves multiple non-linear layers and unknown polynomials, with the input generated from a standard Gaussian distribution. Strengthening previous results for one hidden layer networks, the study explores the transform made by upper layer functions when the lowest layer uses a high threshold before activation. The study explores learning deep neural networks with multiple non-linear layers, focusing on uncovering the lowest layer. It discusses the impact of using a high threshold before activation, showing that increasing the threshold is equivalent to amplifying linear components in the network. By diminishing non-linear terms, linear terms become more prominent, leading to parameter recovery guarantees for deeper networks. The study demonstrates that exceeding a certain threshold causes non-linear terms to decrease, allowing for simpler learning of directions w i. By applying a variant of PCA, it is possible to approximate the w i closely. If t > c \u221a log d for a large enough constant c > 0, and P has linear terms with coefficients at least 1/poly(d) and at most O(1), the weight vector w i can be recovered within error 1/poly(d) in polynomial time. These approximations of w i can be further refined by examining directions with high gradients in f for monotone functions. The study shows that by examining directions with high gradients in f for monotone functions, it is possible to recover the weight vector w i precisely. When P is monotone and u is the sign function, learning W is equivalent to learning a union of half spaces. This algorithm can be seen as a polynomial time method for learning a union of half spaces far from the origin. The study demonstrates that linear components in P may be present, even with deep networks using sigmoid or logloss functions. The coefficients drop exponentially with network depth and threshold values. Sample complexity remains polynomial even with low thresholds and no explicit linear terms, allowing for learning of W with polynomial sample complexity. The study shows that linear components in P may exist in deep networks with sigmoid or logloss functions, with coefficients decreasing exponentially with network depth and thresholds. Sample complexity remains polynomial even without explicit linear terms, enabling learning of W with polynomial sample complexity. The study demonstrates that high thresholds in deeper layers of neural networks can aid in learning at any depth, not just the lowest layer. By applying a specific transform to the network, linear components can be gathered from different monomials in P and penalize higher degree monomials. Additionally, it is shown that sparse binary matrices can be recovered under certain assumptions about the structure of P with positive coefficients, extending to binary low l1-norm vectors without a threshold. Furthermore, weights can be recovered with no threshold under orthogonal weights and even activations. The curr_chunk discusses the learnability of neural networks, focusing on modular learning of lower and upper parts separately. Various works have analyzed the dynamics of gradient descent on one hidden layer neural networks for parameter recovery under gaussian input distribution. The curr_chunk discusses learning neural networks using kernel methods and tensor decomposition. It addresses the challenge of optimizing the non-convex loss function and extends previous work by designing a loss function for easier optimization. However, extending these results to deeper networks remains unclear. In isotonic regression, networks with sigmoids in the first hidden layer and a single unit in the second hidden layer can be learned in polynomial time. The above layer is modeled as a multivariate polynomial for larger representation. Another work deals with learning a deep generative network in an unsupervised setting by recovering the network layer by layer using correlations between input coordinates. Ideas from this work are used in section 4 when W is a sparse binary matrix. Notation: vectors and matrices are denoted in bold face, || \u00b7 || p denotes the l p -norm of a vector, || \u00b7 || denotes the l 2 -norm, || \u00b7 || denotes the spectral norm for matrices, || \u00b7 || F denotes the forbenius norm, N (0, \u03a3) denotes the multivariate gaussian distribution with mean 0 and covariance \u03a3, and \u03c6(x) denotes the p.d.f. of the univariate standard normal. In this section, the algorithm considers the case when P has a positive linear component and aims to recover the parameters of true parameters W*. The algorithm consists of two steps. The algorithm has two steps: 1) uses existing one-hidden layer learning algorithm to recover an approximate solution, 2) refine the solution by performing local search. The first step aims to approximate P as a one-hidden-layer network for algorithm transfer. The second step evaluates the closeness of weight vector estimates to true weights using correlations, refining the estimate to small error. The algorithm aims to approximate P as a one-hidden-layer network for transfer by recovering an approximate solution and refining it through local search. The structure of the network assumes P to be the linear part of f. The activation function u is a positive high threshold activation with a threshold t, where t is large enough for certain conditions to hold. The algorithm approximates P as a one-hidden-layer network by using a high-threshold activation function. The activation function ensures that the network is close to the linear part of f in expectation, allowing for recovery with labels from f approximately. The algorithm by BID5 uses labels from f lin to recover labels from f approximately by designing a well-behaved loss function based on correlations. They optimize a local minima using a Lagrangian formulation, showing that it can be used to recover weight vectors one at a time. The algorithm by BID5 uses labels from f lin to recover labels from f approximately by designing a well-behaved loss function based on correlations. They optimize a local minima using a Lagrangian formulation, showing that it can be used to recover weight vectors one at a time. The closeness between f and f lin in expectation implies that their gradients and hessians are also close, allowing for transfer of landscape properties between the two functions. Theorem 4 states that if certain conditions are met, a local minimum of function A can be transformed into a local minimum of function B and vice versa. Additionally, an alternate optimization method in paper BID5 can recover the entire matrix W* simultaneously instead of learning columns of (TW*)^-1 separately. The algorithm by BID5 uses correlations to recover labels from f approximately. They optimize a local minima using a Lagrangian formulation to recover weight vectors. The method can also be applied to optimize a single objective to recover W* by refining the approximate solution. The idea is to correlate with \u03b4(zTx\u2212t) where \u03b4 is the Dirac delta function, maximizing the correlation when z is equal to one of the wi. The correlation between weight vectors w and z is crucial, depending on the angle \u03b1 between them. The method aims to estimate how quickly the correlation changes with \u03b4(zTx\u2212t) as t varies, providing an approximation for cot(\u03b1). Local search is used due to the inability to perform smooth optimization over z. The method uses local search with random perturbations to estimate the correlation between weight vectors w and z by refining the weights one by one. The algorithm estimates the angle between the current estimate and the true vector using a perturbed estimate. The algorithm estimates the angle between the current estimate and the true vector by perturbing the vector after each iteration. The correctness of the algorithm is proven by showing that EstimateTanAlpha gives a multiplicative approximation to tan(\u03b1). The algorithm perturbs the vector to estimate the angle, providing a multiplicative approximation to tan(\u03b1). Lemmas are used to bound the range of values and show that random perturbations reduce the angle, leading to the algorithm halting. The algorithm perturbs the vector to estimate the angle, providing a multiplicative approximation to tan(\u03b1). Lemmas are used to bound the range of values and show that random perturbations reduce the angle, leading to the algorithm halting after DISPLAYFORM10 Lemma 7. By applying a random Gaussian perturbation along the d \u2212 1 dimensional hyperplane normal to z with the distribution n(0, \u0398(\u03b1/d)) d\u22121 and scaling back to the unit sphere, with constant probability, the angle \u03b1 (< \u03c0/2) with the fixed vector decreases by at least \u2126(\u03b1/d). The main idea is to correlate with \u03b4 (z T x\u2212t) and find arg max ||z||2=1 E[f (x)\u03b4 (z T x\u2212t)]. The correlation goes to infinity when z is one of w * i and bounded if it is far from all of them. In this section, correlations with \u03b4(z T x \u2212 s) are assumed to be measured exactly. The polynomial P has degree at most 1 in each Xi, and \u2202P \u2202Xi denotes the symbolic partial derivative of P with respect to Xi. By separating dependence on Xi in P, it is shown that with simple correlations, the w * i 's can be determined within error 2 using samples. If all the w * i 's are orthogonal, Xi are independent, and E Qi [x] (w * i ) T x = t can be evaluated accordingly. The proof of Theorem 6 shows that high correlation occurs when z aligns with w * i, otherwise it is negligible. Using correlations with \u03b4(z T x \u2212 s), the expected value along the corresponding plane can be interpreted. The correlation of P with \u03b4(z T x \u2212 s) is computed to show that correlation is bounded when angles are lower bounded. This is used to prove main Lemma 8, with details in Appendix C. Theorem 6's proof determines w * i within an accuracy angle of 2, ensuring correlation is o(\u03c6(t) 3 ) if all \u03b1 i > 2, otherwise it is \u03c6(t) 3 (1\u00b1o(1)). With structural assumptions on W * like binary weights, sparsity, or activation restrictions, directions can be tested for accuracy within 2 of a w * i. Theorem 7 discusses recovery guarantees for binary weights and activation functions. The weight vectors select coordinates of x, and the proof involves constructing a correlation graph to recover the weight vectors. The optimization landscape for maximizing correlations has local maximas being the weight vectors. Theorem 8 is also mentioned for a different activation function. Theorem 8 discusses learning weight vectors with disjoint binary values and activation function e^a. It is possible to recover weight vectors with positive coefficients and degree at most 1 in each variable. For even activations, weight vectors can be recovered even with threshold at 0. The technique involves PCA-like optimization using hermite polynomials. Theorem 9 states that with even activation and certain conditions, weight vectors can be recovered. High threshold activations in deep networks make learning the lowest layer easier, even with low thresholds. Sample complexity is polynomial. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Hermite polynomials as a basis for the gaussian distribution and their application in expanding variables. It also mentions the correlation between variables and the definition of weighted hermite for gaussians with specific parameters. The information complements the previous discussion on learning weight vectors with activation functions and thresholds in deep networks. The curr_chunk discusses the application of Hermite polynomials for gaussians with specific parameters and their correlation with variables. It also includes proofs and analysis related to singular values of matrices and threshold activation functions in deep networks. The curr_chunk discusses the optimization problem involving Hermite polynomials and threshold activation functions in deep networks. It includes proofs related to the maximization of the problem and optimality conditions for constraints. The optimization problem involving Hermite polynomials and threshold activation functions in deep networks is discussed, with proofs related to maximization and optimality conditions for constraints. The conditions for global minima are analyzed, showing that only z = \u00b1e i are the local minimas of the problem. Additionally, a lemma is presented, providing bounds for the maximum value of z in terms of its entries. The lemma provides bounds for the maximum value of z based on its entries, using an orthonormal basis and matrix operations. Proof of Claim 1 involves considering the SVD of matrix M, defining y i as \u221a c i W T w * i, and showing that y i are orthogonal. By assuming y i = e i for analysis, the formulation simplifies to max z |\u00fb 4 | i 1 ci (z i ) 4 \u2212 \u03bb ||z|| 2 \u2212 1 2 up to scaling of \u03bb = \u03bb\u00fb 2 2. This is similar to Lemma 13, leading to approximate local minimas of F (z) being close to y i. Proof of Theorem 4 states that for an ( , \u03c4 )-local minimum of A, ||\u2207A(Z)|| \u2264 and |\u03bb min (M)| \u2264 ||M|| for any symmetric matrix. Lemma 15 states that for a symmetric matrix M, the norm of the matrix is less than or equal to the maximum value of Mx for eigenvectors x. The proof involves showing that local minima of G cannot have large norm vectors. This is demonstrated by analyzing G lin (z) and G, showing that the gradient of G lin (z) is large when z is large. Proof of Claim 2 involves bounding the norm of gradient and hessian of polynomials H2 and H4. Using Lemmas 14 and 15, it is shown that ||z|| is bounded by a constant. The minimization of the loss function Glin is proven to be robust, considering the function G with additional non-linear terms. The function G with additional non-linear terms is shown to be close to Glin. The norm of the gradient and hessian of polynomials is bounded by a constant degree polynomial. The weight matrix W has a strictly negative curvature, leading to an approximate local minimum. The weight matrix W has negative curvature, allowing for an approximate local minimum. Using optimization techniques, a local minima can be found. Lemma 16 states that for the sign function u, E[u(w T x)\u03b4 (z T x)] = c| cot(\u03b1)| where w, z are unit vectors and \u03b1 is the angle between them. Lemma 5 states that for a monotone function P with a positive linear term, the sign of the function is determined by the sign of the dot product of the input vector x and weight vector w. The proof involves showing that the parameter \u03b7 is not large, as the angle \u03b1 between vectors is bounded. Lemma 6 discusses the assumption that \u03b2 = max i =1 cos(\u03b1 i ) under a certain setting, leading to a proof involving small constants and probabilities. Lemma 7 introduces a plane spanned by vectors w * 1 and z, with a Gaussian perturbation applied along the tangential hyperplane normal to z. The perturbation of a vector \u03c1 can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to a given vector V. The angle \u03b1 of the vector z after perturbation can be determined with high probability. A theorem states that non-noisy labels from halfspaces at a certain distance and angle apart can be recovered in polynomial time. The perturbation of a vector \u03c1 can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to a given vector V. The angle \u03b1 of the vector z after perturbation can be determined with high probability. Applying Theorem 11 for t = \u2126( \u221a log d) allows recovery of vectors w * i approximately. Refining to arbitrary closeness using Theorem 5 is possible due to monotonicity, enabling recovery of vectors in polynomial time. Assumption 2 is satisfied for sigmoid activation with \u03c1(t, \u03c3) = e \u2212t+\u03c3 2 /2. To satisfy Assumption 3, t = \u2126(\u03b7 log d) is needed, with a small probability of the threshold being crossed. Assuming f is non-negative and access to an oracle biases samples towards larger values of f, correlations can be computed even if E x\u00d1 (0,I [f (x)] is small. The approximate theorem states that columns of (TW*)\u22121 can be recovered within error 1/poly(d) using the algorithm in polynomial time, even with variables allowed a large degree. The structure of P changes with higher degrees in X i, leading to a more complex condition. The last assumption holds for constant degrees and coefficients bounded by a constant. The case when the degree is a constant and each coefficient is upper bounded by a constant can hold for decaying coefficients. Univariate terms are collected to get f uni, corresponding to f lin. Different activation for each weight vector is now present. Using correlation, we find that hermite coefficients are positive. Even with higher degree, the difference between f(x) and f uni(x) is small. The proof relies on the number of non-zero entries rather than the norm. The proof relies on the number of non-zero entries to bound the deviation in expectation. By choosing appropriate parameters, the required results can be obtained. The correlation can be computed using the components of x along different vectors. The sign function can be used to focus on specific summands. The text discusses the sign function and its application in focusing on specific summands in a sum. It also explores the correlation between different vectors in the context of a polynomial function. The proof presented is independent of the specific polynomial used as long as certain conditions are met. The text discusses using correlation with the second derivative of the Dirac delta function instead of the delta function for the RELU activation. This approach works for any activation with a non-zero derivative at 0. The proof is independent of the specific polynomial used, as long as certain conditions are met. The text discusses the assumptions for a polynomial P with constant degree and bounded sum of coefficients. The proof of these assumptions will be provided in the following section. The text discusses the assumptions for a polynomial P with constant degree and bounded sum of coefficients. Let us compute E[f(x)xi xj]. At the local maxima, z is such that for all i in [n], zj = zk. Proof by contradiction shows that there is a direction of improvement, indicating it cannot be a local maxima. Additionally, at the local maxima, ||z||1 \u2265 \u03b1 for certain conditions. The text discusses the conditions for a local maxima of a polynomial P with bounded coefficients. It shows that there is a contradiction in the assumption of a local maxima, indicating a direction of improvement. Additionally, it highlights the conditions for z at a local maxima, where ||z||1 \u2265 \u03b1. The text discusses conditions for a local maxima of a polynomial P with bounded coefficients, showing a contradiction in the assumption of a local maxima. It mentions that terms are 0 for |S| \u2265 3, leading to the computation of correlations."
