    "content": "World leaders agreed in 2009 to review the capital adequacy of multilateral development banks (MDBs) following increased lending since the 2008 financial crisis. Shareholder nations, including the United States, agreed to increase the capital stock of various MDBs. This presented an opportunity for the Obama Administration and Congress to evaluate U.S. participation and leadership in the MDBs. Key issues regarding the MDBs include the effectiveness of bilateral and multilateral aid, the scope of MDB activity serving U.S. interests, lending to emerging economic powers, the role of emerging economic powers at the MDBs, MDB-funded procurement for U.S. export opportunities, and anti-corruption efforts in poor countries. The Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) aim to promote development in poor countries prone to corruption while ensuring fair procurement processes. MDBs include the World Bank Group, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Inter-American Development Bank. These institutions finance development projects and economic reforms in developing countries. The Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) provide two types of loans: market-based loans to middle-income countries and concessional-rate loans to the poorest countries. MDBs borrow money from capital markets at favorable rates due to their AAA ratings and strong capital positions. The concessional-rate loans are funded by member country governments and are lent at lower interest rates to the poorest countries. MDBs' non-concessional lending windows are self-financing and generate net income for the institutions, subsidizing concessional lending to the poorest countries. MDBs leverage their capital by borrowing to finance lending, allowing them to lend more than their capital amount. Shareholders contribute paid-in and callable capital, with only a small portion paid in cash. Callable capital serves as ultimate backing for MDBs. The MDBs' callable capital serves as ultimate backing for borrowing in capital markets, ensuring bondholder payment in case of insolvency. MDBs offer loans at lower rates than private banks due to their strong capital position and AAA rating. Private capital flows to emerging economies have not fully recovered since the 2008 financial crisis. Since 2008, lending has increased across all MDBs, with the World Bank committing the largest annual amount ever in 2009 at $32.9 billion. This exceeds the $22 billion lent during the Asian financial crisis in 1999. MDBs' capital from other governments and development finance has become crucial for many countries, leveraging private capital through various means like political risk insurance and bond guarantees. Net private-sector inflows to emerging markets remain below pre-crisis levels, now representing around 4% of world GDP compared to almost 7% in 2006. MDB commitments involve an increase in all members' shares of MDB capital through a general capital increase (GCI). This funding is used to boost the non-concessional window's capital base, allowing the MDB to borrow more on international markets and expand lending to market-eligible countries. U.S. participation in MDB capital increases is crucial, as it encourages contributions from other member countries. The Center for Global Development estimates that every $1 the United States contributes to the World Bank as part of a GCI enables at least $30 in new World Bank lending and $70 in new AfDB lending. The process for proposing and implementing a GCI is similar for all institutions, requiring a supermajority vote of the membership to approve capital increases. U.S. law mandates Congress's assent before voting on new MDB funding plans, with substantial capital increases totaling around $348 billion agreed upon after the financial crisis. The MDBs are seeking capital increases totaling $348 billion, with the U.S. share amounting to $57 billion. Congressional authorization is needed for the full amount, while appropriations for paid-in capital would be $2.17 billion. Congress influences U.S. participation in MDBs by setting contribution levels and enacting conditions on funding agreements. The United States evaluates participation in MDBs, considering capital increases and reforms. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee emphasizes the need for reforms before committing additional funds. The report includes recommendations to strengthen anti-corruption efforts, improve evaluation frameworks, and enhance oversight of budget support lending. The Obama Administration gained support for these reforms during GCI negotiations with other MDB shareholder governments. Secretary Geithner emphasized the importance of MDBs to the Administration, stating that U.S. investments are crucial for global economic leadership. Compared to other advanced economies, the United States provides a smaller percentage of its development assistance through multilateral channels. The United States provides a smaller percentage of its development assistance through multilateral organizations, such as the MDBs, than other countries. In 2009, 12% of U.S. official development assistance was disbursed through multilateral institutions, compared to 21% for Japan, 37% for Germany, and 33% for the United Kingdom. Despite some research showing the effectiveness of multilateral aid, public support for it in the U.S. is low. Supporters argue that MDBs can secure politically difficult economic reforms in recipient countries due to their charters forbidding lending for political purposes. The United States leverages funds from other donors through multilateral contributions to address certain issues/sectors. Critics argue that a multilateral approach may cede control over aid programs and make it difficult for donors to specify uses of funds. Some analysts suggest that providing bilateral aid could help the United States achieve its foreign policy objectives more directly. The United States can achieve foreign policy objectives more directly by providing bilateral aid. Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) sometimes provide assistance despite U.S. opposition. A purely bilateral approach may ensure U.S. funds support programs aligned with national interests but could eliminate U.S. influence on MDB assistance. For example, the U.S. influenced negotiations on an MDB-financed coal-fired power plant in South Africa by abstaining from a vote, resulting in a better environmental outcome. The contemporary international development assistance landscape is characterized by a proliferation of agencies providing finance, including MDBs and targeted funds like the Global Environment Facility and the Global Fund. With over 200 international development agencies existing, there are concerns about the federal budget and the potential dilution of expertise by enlarging MDBs. The MDBs are increasingly providing more policy loans compared to project loans, with policy-based lending accounting for a significant portion of their disbursements. This shift may raise oversight concerns as measuring effectiveness is more challenging. The IMF's resources have not kept pace with global capital flows, impacting its ability to meet the demand for balance of payments support. Increasing the resources of MDBs could allow them to disburse more money without expanding staff. Congress may consider temporary financing facilities instead of permanent capital increases. Critics argue that official credit availability may not be necessary with viable private credit options. Critics argue that official credit availability may crowd out private investment and divert capital from needy countries. Emerging economies borrow from MDBs for financing and technical expertise. Interest earned supports funding for grants and concessional lending to the poorest countries. The MDBs provide opportunities for U.S. firms by funding projects in developing countries in various sectors through international competitive bidding processes. MDB lending and grants between 2011 and 2015 could exceed $500 billion, with contracts primarily awarded through competitive processes. However, borrowing countries can give preference to domestic firms for MDB-financed projects to stimulate development. At current funding levels, procurement results at the World Bank amount to about $20 billion in contracts annually. The World Bank awards about $20 billion in contracts annually, with 7,000 contracts reviewed by staff before awarding. Emerging economies like Brazil, China, and India are claiming a larger share of MDB contracts. U.S. firms received $93.1 million in contracts in 2010, down from $225.2 million in 2000. This decline in U.S. contract share prompts exploration of the reasons behind it. U.S. firms are experiencing a decline in MDB-supported procurement opportunities, prompting exploration of reasons and potential solutions. Other countries are strategically increasing their share of MDB contracts. The 1988 Trade Act and the Jobs Through Exports Act require the assignment of procurement officers at MDBs to assist U.S. businesses in bidding on projects. The President aims to double exports by 2015 and is directing the Secretary of Commerce to assign additional procurement officers at MDBs to create more export opportunities for U.S. firms. Efforts to improve anti-corruption policies across MDBs have been discussed, with measures being relatively recent due to scandals in the late 1990s. The MDBs have recognized the importance of combating corruption for economic development and have started providing technical assistance in corruption prevention and governance to member countries. They believe that improving their own anti-corruption mechanisms will enhance governance activities in developing countries and increase development effectiveness. However, some analysts are concerned that recent MDB policies, such as country-based procurement standards, may hinder anti-corruption efforts. The MDBs argue that country systems will strengthen national institutions for public expenditures in developing countries. The Obama Administration authorized $13.3 billion for U.S. participation in the AsDB GCI in the FY2011 budget. The act also allocated $106.59 million for the first payment towards the U.S. paid-in capital. Authorization and appropriations for other GCI requests were included in the FY 2012 budget. The Obama Administration authorized $13.3 billion for U.S. participation in the AsDB GCI in the FY2011 budget, including allocations for the initial contribution. Congress required Treasury to report on reforms before funds were disbursed, such as sound finances, effective management, transparency, and accountability. Other requirements included annual transfers for Haiti, protection of whistleblowers, and assessment of reforms for budget support from MDBs. The Obama Administration authorized $13.3 billion for U.S. participation in the AsDB GCI in the FY2011 budget, with requirements for reforms in transparency, accountability, and financial audits. This included assessments of reforms needed for budget support from MDBs and adoption of policies for the World Bank's proposed Program for Results (P4R)."
