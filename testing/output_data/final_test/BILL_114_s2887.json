    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missile Defense Defend and Deter Act of 2016\". Congress finds it strategically important to have a fully operational missile defense system to protect against threats from rogue nations like North Korea and Iran. North Korea has tested nuclear weapons and ICBMs, claiming to have the ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead. The ground-based midcourse defense (GMD) element of the ballistic missile defense system is crucial for defending the US against various missile threats. The Missile Defense Agency's test program demonstrates the effectiveness of the ballistic missile defense system, contributing to US nonproliferation goals by showcasing the ability to defeat ballistic missiles in flight. The Missile Defense Agency is required to test the ground-based midcourse defense element of the ballistic missile defense system. The Director of the Missile Defense Agency must conduct an intercept flight test of the ground-based midcourse defense element of the ballistic missile defense system at least once a year. The test should validate operational effectiveness, use assets in operational configuration against targets, and incorporate real-world constraints and doctrine. The Director of the Missile Defense Agency must conduct an intercept flight test of the ground-based midcourse defense element of the ballistic missile defense system annually. The test evaluates new concepts of operations, tactics, techniques, and procedures, ensuring confidence in the system's hit-to-kill effectiveness and operational capability. Exceptions may be made if conducting the test jeopardizes national security or if specific components require a nonintercept test. The Director may forgo a test under subsection (a) in a fiscal year if the Secretary of Defense determines it is not sufficiently funded or if national security waiver is granted after consultation with relevant authorities. The provision of testing described in the subsection is detrimental to national security interests. The Secretary must notify congressional defense committees within 30 days of forgoing a test, providing the rationale and national security reasons for not conducting the test. The Secretary must notify congressional defense committees within 30 days of forgoing a test, providing the rationale and national security reasons for not conducting the test in an unclassified form with a possible classified annex. Congressional defense committees are defined as per section 101(a)(16) of title 10, United States Code."
