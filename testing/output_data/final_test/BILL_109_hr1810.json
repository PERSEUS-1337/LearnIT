The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act established new conservation units in Alaska to protect habitat, wildlife, and cultural sites. These units are important for local communities, especially Alaska Natives and rural residents. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act prioritizes Alaska Native lands for conservation unit facilities, Alaska Native corporations for visitor services, and local residents for employment. The Act aims to promote innovative management strategies, expand contracting opportunities for Alaska Natives, increase local native employment, and further the unique purposes of conservation units. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act prioritizes Alaska Native lands for conservation unit facilities, Alaska Native corporations for visitor services, and local residents for employment to further the unique purposes of conservation units related to subsistence practices, Alaska Native culture, and the conservation of fish and wildlife habitat and populations. The Alaska Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project is established under SEC. 3. The Alaska Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project allows 12 Indian tribes or tribal organizations in Alaska to contract for various conservation-related tasks. The Secretary will select 6 eligible tribes per year for participation over 2 fiscal years. Tribes must formally request to join the project to be eligible. To participate in the Alaska Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project, Indian tribes or tribal organizations must request participation through official action, demonstrate financial stability with no unresolved audit exceptions for the past 3 years, and show significant reliance on the conservation system unit. If multiple tribes meet the criteria, priority will be given to those requesting specific programs or services. The Secretary will apply priority selection criteria for contracting to eligible Indian tribes or tribal organizations participating in the demonstration project. If multiple tribes have overlapping requests, they must agree on who will have the ability to contract or submit a joint request. Each selected tribe must go through a planning phase. Prior to negotiating a conservation system unit management contract, selected Indian tribes or tribal organizations must complete a planning phase, including legal and budgetary research, and internal tribal planning and organizational preparation. Upon completion of the planning phase, the Secretary will negotiate and enter into a contract with the tribe or organization for them to plan, conduct, and administer programs and services. The Indian tribe or tribal organization must complete a planning phase before negotiating a conservation system unit management contract. Within 90 days of completing the planning phase, the Secretary will initiate and conclude negotiations, unless an alternative schedule is agreed upon. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act provisions apply to contracts and appeals. Contract administration under this Act allows for the inclusion of terms from agreements made under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. These terms will have the same legal effect and can be supplemented with mutually agreed upon conditions. Contracts under this Act must comply with mutually agreed terms and conditions and include a single-agency audit report. Career Federal employees transferred to an Indian tribe or tribal organization will not be separated from Federal service and may be supervised by the contracting tribe. Transferred employees have priority placement for available positions within their agency. Under the Act, contracts must comply with agreed terms, include audit reports, and allow Federal employees to transfer to tribes without losing their jobs. Tribes receive funding for programs, with advance payments, and must complete planning within a year of selection for the project. Contracts under the Act must be implemented within 1 year of selection, with the option for an alternate schedule. They can last for 5 consecutive fiscal years. The Secretary must report to Congress on the costs and benefits of the project, including any barriers to contracting with Alaska Native entities. The Act authorizes contracts for conservation management in Alaska Native entities, with joint reports from participating tribes. Limitations include excluding revenue-producing visitor services without agreement from affected corporations and no authority to modify specific sections of the Alaska National Interests Lands Conservation Act. The Act does not grant authority for managing permits related to hunting and fishing activities in Denali National Park. It also does not affect the State of Alaska's management authority for fish and wildlife. Planning grants of $100,000 are available for Indian tribes participating in a demonstration project.
