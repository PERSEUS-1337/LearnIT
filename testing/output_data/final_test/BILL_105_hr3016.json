    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. The Congress finds that states and localities should have control over tower construction through zoning for environmental and public health protection. Placing towers near homes can devalue properties and reduce desirability. Alternatives like collocating transmitters and using satellites can provide wireless services without additional tower construction. The Federal Communications Commission does not consider these alternatives. The Federal Communications Commission relies on external health experts for guidance on radio frequency exposure. The FDA and EPA agree that current research is insufficient to determine health risks from cell phone use. Congress should authorize a study on the health effects of prolonged nonionizing radiation exposure due to the increasing number of wireless transmitters. The increasing number of wireless transmitters will lead to a rise in nonionizing radiation sources. Caution is advised until conclusive studies are completed. States and local governments should have full authority to protect the public. The FCC has proposed rules on personal wireless transmitter towers, which may need modification for public safety. The FCC proposed rules to modify regulations for the placement of telecommunication towers, allowing state and local governments to regulate based on public health and safety concerns. Licensees must exhaust all local remedies before seeking relief from adverse actions at the federal level. The FCC proposed rules to allow state and local governments to regulate the placement of telecommunication towers based on environmental effects. The Act aims to repeal limitations on state and local authorities and prevent the FCC from preempting such regulation. The FCC proposed rules to allow state and local governments to regulate the placement of telecommunication towers based on environmental effects, aiming to repeal limitations on their authority and prevent FCC preemption of such regulation. The FCC proposed rules to allow state and local governments to regulate the placement of telecommunication towers based on environmental effects, aiming to repeal limitations on their authority and prevent FCC preemption of such regulation. SEC. 2 grants state and local authority over placement, construction, and modification of certain telecommunications facilities. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to remove limitations on state and local governments' authority to regulate telecommunication towers based on environmental effects. This change aims to prevent FCC preemption of such regulation and grants state and local authority over the placement, construction, and modification of certain telecommunications facilities. The FCC may not adopt a final rule on preempting state and local zoning laws related to broadcast station transmission facilities. The burden of proof lies with individuals seeking to place, construct, or modify tower facilities."
