    "title": "SB 639",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that California's vision for individuals with developmental disabilities, as outlined in the Lanterman Act, is at risk due to neglect of community services and excessive spending on state institutions. Developmental centers receive a large portion of state funding, with each resident costing $504,000 annually, compared to $17,000 for those receiving services in the community. The Sonoma Developmental Center lost federal certification in 2012 due to health and safety violations, leading to the loss of millions in federal funds. Other centers are also at risk of decertification. The Legislature proposes transferring residents to community-based residences with appropriate services instead of restoring decertified units. The closure process for Agnews Developmental Center began in 2003 and Lanterman Developmental Center took over four years to close. The State Department of Developmental Services conducted a stakeholder process in 2014 to plan the future of the developmental center system. California aims to enhance community services for disabled individuals by closing developmental centers and reallocating funds. A plan to close Sonoma and Fairview Developmental Centers by April 1, 2016, is required, including specific components. The closure plan for Sonoma and Fairview Developmental Centers aims to close them by December 31, 2018, with a revised deadline of December 31, 2019 if necessary. The plan also includes reducing staff to shift funds to community services for the transitioning population. The Department of Developmental Services plans to use the properties of the developmental centers to benefit the developmentally disabled community. They will estimate potential revenues from different options, including providing ongoing revenues through lease agreements and developing integrated housing resources for individuals with developmental disabilities. The Department of Developmental Services aims to minimize state funds spent on decertified developmental center residential units. Instead, residents of these units will be given priority for moving to community-based residences. The plan must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code."
