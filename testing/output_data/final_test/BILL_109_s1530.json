    "content": "The \"Community Forestry Conservation Act of 2005\" may be cited as the Act. Forest Conservation Bonds are addressed in the Act. Tax-Exempt Bond Financing under the \"Community Forestry Conservation Act of 2005\" treats qualified forest conservation bonds as exempt facility bonds under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualified forest conservation bonds must meet specific criteria, including using 95% of net proceeds for qualified project costs, being issued for a qualified organization, and being issued within 36 months of the Act's enactment. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds under this subsection is $10,000,000,000 for all projects, with allocations for qualified organizations in the Pacific Northwest region. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds under this subsection is $10,000,000,000 for all projects, with allocations for qualified organizations in different regions on a first-come, first-served basis. The terms \"Pacific Northwest region,\" \"Western region,\" \"Southeast region,\" and \"Northeast region\" are defined by the United States Forest Service. Qualified project costs refer to specific expenses for projects. In the context of forest conservation bonds, qualified project costs include acquisition of forests with conservation restrictions, capitalized interest on bonds, and credit enhancement fees. Special rules apply when applying the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to these bonds. The modifications to the Internal Revenue Code for forest conservation bonds include exemptions from certain sections, such as volume cap restrictions, limitations on land acquisition, and tax-exempt interest on qualified bonds. Treatment of current refunding bonds: Exemptions apply to bonds issued to refund qualified forest conservation bonds within 36 months of this Act, with conditions on maturity date, amount, and use of proceeds. The subsection applies to obligations issued 180 days after the Act, exempting income from qualified harvesting activities from tax under the Internal Revenue Code. The exclusion amount for any year is limited to debt service payments made by the organization. The subsection exempts income from qualified harvesting activities from tax under the Internal Revenue Code, limited to debt service payments for qualified forest conservation bonds. Qualified harvesting activities include the sale, lease, or harvesting of standing timber on land owned by a qualified organization with proceeds of qualified forest conservation bonds, following a qualified conservation plan. The term \"qualified harvesting activity\" excludes any sale, lease, or harvesting of standing timber on land acquired with proceeds of qualified forest conservation bonds if the annual timber harvested exceeds 2.5% of the total land area or if the quantity of timber removed exceeds certain limits. The limitations on timber removal from land do not apply to post-fire restoration, rehabilitation, or sanitation harvesting of damaged stands. This subsection does not apply to qualified harvesting activities of qualified organizations. Qualified harvesting activities by qualified organizations are subject to certain limitations. If the average annual timber harvested exceeds the specified requirement, a tax penalty will be imposed by the IRS. The IRS imposes a tax penalty for exceeding the annual timber harvest limit set for qualified conservation plans. These plans focus on protecting wildlife, fish, timber, scenery, recreation, and soil and water quality of forest land. Timber harvesting must align with restoring and maintaining regional ecotypes. The conservation restriction described in this paragraph involves maintaining forest age classes, ecological health, wildlife habitat, and research opportunities. It is granted in perpetuity to a qualified entity under IRS section 170(h)(3). The conservation restriction, as outlined in IRS section 170(h)(3), requires a qualified organization to pay for monitoring compliance and provide increasing conservation benefits when possible. The qualified organization must have more than half of its property value in forests and forest land. The qualified organization, funded by forest conservation bonds, conducts educational programs on forestry management and conservation. It must have a board of directors with specific representation requirements. The qualified organization's board of directors must meet specific criteria, including not having any conflicts of interest with commercial forest products enterprises and requiring a two-thirds majority vote for conservation plan approval. Upon dissolution, its assets must be dedicated to a specified organization. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"unrelated person\" and \"related person\" in relation to tax codes for organizations involved in conservation purposes or governmental units. It outlines the criteria for determining related persons and their relationships as per specific sections of the tax code. The curr_chunk defines a non-profit organization as an unrelated person if they control more than 25% of the governing body."
