The Congress finds that the Russian HEU Agreement is crucial for US national security and foreign policy interests. The agreement will import 500 metric tons of weapons-grade uranium into the US, with 30 metric tons per year starting in 1999, which will help meet a significant portion of the country's nuclear fuel demand for electricity generation. The United States Enrichment Corporation, upon privatization, must comply with statutory requirements, including those related to the Russian HEU Agreement. This agreement will increase the supply of LEU fuel in the US market, potentially leading to actions that may impact long-term viability and domestic uranium services. The Department of Energy is responsible for implementing the US obligations under the Russian HEU Agreement, acquiring Russian HEU converted to LEU and withholding it from the private market to achieve national security goals. The Act aims to achieve national security objectives of the Russian HEU Agreement and meet privatization requirements for the United States Enrichment Corporation. It ensures privatization results in a return to the US equal to the Corporation's value and prevents foreign ownership or control. The privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation must not be detrimental to public health and safety, ensure adequate enrichment capacity for the domestic electric utility industry, guarantee long-term viability of the Corporation, continue operation of Department of Energy's gaseous diffusion plants, and protect the public interest. To ensure the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation maximizes proceeds to the United States, monitors the impact of LEU delivery under the Russian HEU Agreement on domestic uranium industries, and prevents adverse effects on employment at gaseous diffusion plants. SEC. 4. STANDBY AUTHORIZATION. Section 3112(b) of the United States Enrichment Corporation Privatization Act is amended to authorize the Secretary to purchase and hold contract obligations to acquire Russian HEU converted to LEU under the Russian HEU Agreement. The material can be resold under certain conditions, including certification of uranium enrichment levels. The United States Enrichment Corporation must certify the effects of purchasing and reselling Russian HEU under the Russian HEU Agreement on its long-term viability, including operations, costs, sales, and profitability. They must also certify actions taken to mitigate any negative effects on enrichment services and employment at gaseous diffusion plants. The Secretary will review the certification by the United States Enrichment Corporation regarding the purchase and resale of Russian HEU. A report with recommendations for direct purchase to meet national security objectives and ensure the Corporation's long-term viability will be made to the President. The Secretary will deliver a report on maintaining a reliable domestic source of uranium services to relevant committees and publish it in the Federal Register. Essential proprietary information will not be disclosed, as determined by regulations. The President directs the Secretary to acquire converted Russian HEU under the Russian HEU Agreement for national security purposes. An investigation will be requested on the impact of the agreement on gaseous diffusion plants and uranium mining operations. The President has directed the Secretary to acquire converted Russian HEU under the Russian HEU Agreement for national security purposes. The Secretary will acquire the HEU in accordance with the agreement and withhold it from resale until the United States Enrichment Corporation meets production requirements at gaseous diffusion plants. The Secretary may auction for resale converted Russian HEU acquired under the Russian HEU Agreement if it exceeds 110 percent of the average annual enrichment in SWU for the period 1992 through 1997. The auctioned HEU should not have a material adverse impact on the domestic uranium industry and cannot be sold directly to end-users in competition with the United States Enrichment Corporation. Prices should not be lower than a certain threshold. The Secretary may auction converted Russian HEU acquired under the Russian HEU Agreement, ensuring prices do not fall below a certain threshold to avoid impacting the domestic uranium industry. Purchasers are prohibited from selling to end-users at prices lower than those paid at auction. The term 'material adverse impact' is defined in relation to 'material injury' under the Tariff Act of 1930, with the Secretary considering relevant factors affecting the domestic industry. The Secretary must establish regulations for the sale of converted Russian HEU, including determining maximum allowable amounts and market prices, following administrative procedures and allowing for public comment. The Secretary's regulations for the sale of converted Russian HEU must include qualifications for buyers, a minimum price calculation for each lot, and a 45-day notice period for sales. Buyers must be authorized to handle nuclear materials and not end-users. The regulations for the sale of converted Russian HEU must include provisions to avoid adverse impacts on domestic uranium industries, allow for determination of sale amounts, and ensure resale prices to eligible end-users are in compliance with the Act. Any violations can be addressed in district courts. The Act allows for lawsuits to be filed in any U.S. district court with jurisdiction over the parties, regardless of the amount in dispute or parties' citizenship."
