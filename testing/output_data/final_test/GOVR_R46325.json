The act includes $321.3 billion for the PPP and $162.1 billion for discretionary spending. H.R. 266, initially unrelated to COVID-19, was passed by the House in January 2019 and is now on the Senate Legislative Calendar. The Senate passed the bill on April 21, 2020, with an amendment replacing the original text. The House of Representatives approved the amended bill on April 23, 2020, and it was signed into law on April 24, 2020 as P.L. 116-139. This legislation established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with $349 billion in funding. The PPP authorized loans with a two-year term at a 1% interest rate to small businesses affected by COVID-19. Loan payments are deferred for six months, with potential loan forgiveness based on employee retention and wages. The SBA began accepting PPP loan applications on April 3, 2020, but stopped on April 15, 2020, after reaching the $349 billion limit. Over 1.66 million loans were approved, with most being under $150,000. The CARES Act also expanded SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans and established Emergency EIDL grants up to $10,000 to support small businesses. The SBA received additional funding to support EIDL and Emergency EIDL grants through the CARES Act. New COVID-19-related EIDL loan applications were stopped on April 15, 2020, but existing applications are still being processed. Nearly $5.7 billion in COVID-19-related EIDLs and $3.3 billion in Emergency EIDL grants were approved. The PPP authorization limit was increased to $659 billion to support small businesses affected by COVID-19. The CARES Act increased the PPP authorization limit from $349 billion to over $670 billion. It also allocated funds for loans issued by different financial institutions and made agricultural enterprises with up to 500 employees eligible for EIDL and Emergency EIDL grants. Division B of P.L. 116-139 provides $100 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services and $62 billion for the Small Business Administration for coronavirus response. All appropriations are designated as emergency requirements and do not count against discretionary spending limits for FY2020. Each appropriation is explicitly for coronavirus prevention, preparation, and response. Title I of Division B in P.L. 116-139 allocates $100 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to the HHS Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. $75 billion of this funding is designated for the HHS Provider Relief Fund, established under the CARES Act, to support healthcare providers with expenses or lost revenues related to the coronavirus. These funds are available until expended for coronavirus prevention and response efforts. The CARES Act and P.L. 116-139 provide funding for healthcare providers dealing with COVID-19. The funds can be used for testing, care, and containment efforts, including expanding testing capacity and purchasing protective equipment. $25 billion is allocated for these purposes, with $11 billion designated for states, localities, territories, tribes, and tribal organizations. $11 billion allocated for states, localities, territories, tribes, tribal organizations, urban Indian health organizations, or health service providers for COVID-19 response. Includes funding for CDC, NIH, testing, surveillance, and workforce support. The NIH will receive funding for COVID-19 testing and research, including $306 million for the National Cancer Institute, $500 million for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, $1 billion for the NIH Office of the Director, and $1 billion for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Additionally, $22 million will go to the FDA for testing-related activities. $600 million allocated for Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) grants for Health Centers program, $225 million for rural health clinics, and up to $1 billion for testing uninsured individuals. Reporting requirements and fund transfer provisions apply to the $25 billion appropriation. Title II provisions in Division A provide additional authorization and resources for SBA's PPP and EIDL programs. $50 billion is allocated for EIDL costs, $10 billion for Emergency EIDL grants, and $2.1 billion for SBA's Salaries and Expenses. The Secretary is required to transfer up to $6 million to the HHS Office of Inspector General for oversight of activities funded by this act through the PHSSEF."
