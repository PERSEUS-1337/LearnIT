    "content": "The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) was enacted in response to consumer concerns about toy safety and the effectiveness of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The new law established safety standards for lead content and phthalates in children's products, along with testing and certification requirements. Implementation issues have arisen, causing confusion and concern about compliance with the new standards. The CPSIA established safety standards for lead content and phthalates in children's products, along with testing and certification requirements. Despite efforts by the CPSC to issue regulations and guidelines, uncertainty remains, especially for small manufacturers and second-hand retailers. The report will describe new certification and testing requirements, safety standards, implementation issues, and legislative proposals to amend the CPSIA. The CPSIA established safety standards for lead content and phthalates in children's products, along with testing and certification requirements. Legislative proposals aim to provide exemptions and special considerations for small businesses and second-hand retailers. Understanding what products are covered by the CPSIA is crucial for its implementation. Consumer products subject to consumer product safety laws are regulated by the CPSC, with exemptions for certain products like tobacco, motor vehicles, pesticides, firearms, aircraft, boats, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and food. The CPSC also oversees non-permanently fixed amusement rides but not those permanently fixed. The CPSC does not have jurisdiction to regulate certain consumer products if the risk of injury can be reduced by other agencies like OSHA, the EPA, or the FDA. The CPSIA added a definition of \"children's product\" to the CPSA. The CPSIA added requirements for defining \"children's products\" as those designed for children 12 years and younger, considering factors like manufacturer statements, packaging, and consumer recognition. The CPSIA added requirements for defining \"children's products\" as those designed for children 12 years and younger. The certification and testing requirements of the CPSA as amended by the CPSIA include general conformity certification for consumer products and certification for children's products based on third-party testing. These requirements apply to products manufactured on or after November 12, 2008, with third-party testing taking effect on a rolling basis. Both types of certification are required for manufacturers or importers. The CPSIA requires manufacturers or importers to provide certificates with each product, furnish them to distributors and retailers, and provide a copy to the CPSC upon request. The CPSC can designate who issues the certificate and relieve others from this requirement. All manufacturers and importers must certify compliance with safety rules enforced by the CPSC. Manufacturers or importers must provide certificates with each product, certifying compliance with mandatory safety standards enforced by the CPSC. The certification must cover all applicable standards and can be based on in-house testing. The CPSC does not typically review individual testing programs. The CPSC does not investigate testing programs of manufacturers or importers but can prescribe reasonable testing programs for safety standards. The CPSIA expanded the certification requirement to cover all safety standards under CPSC enforcement, including products imported for consumption and warehousing. Previously, this requirement only applied to safety standards under the CPSA. The CPSIA expanded certification requirements to cover all safety standards under CPSC enforcement, including products imported for distribution and warehousing. Previously, only products imported for distribution required general conformity certification. Unlike general conformity certification, the CPSIA introduced new testing and certification requirements for children's products. Compliance with safety standards was previously left to manufacturers or importers, but the new third-party testing and certification requirement imposed additional costs on manufacturers. Under the CPSIA, manufacturers of children's products must certify compliance with safety standards through accredited third-party laboratories, imposing new costs. Testing can be done in-house under certain conditions, with the CPSC setting deadlines for accreditation requirements. The CPSIA set specific deadlines for the publication of accreditation requirements for testing various children's products like lead paint, cribs, pacifiers, small parts, children's metal jewelry, and baby bouncers/walkers/jumpers. The staggered deadlines allowed for a gradual implementation of the new requirements. Accreditation guidelines for other children's products had to be published early, with safety rules established before August 14, 2009, needing to be published 90 days before taking effect. The CPSIA set deadlines for accreditation guidelines and testing requirements for various children's products. Certification and testing are required for lead paint, cribs, pacifiers, small parts, and children's metal jewelry manufactured after specific dates in 2008 and 2009. However, accreditation guidelines and testing requirements have not been published for baby bouncers/walkers/jumpers yet. The CPSC announced a stay of federal enforcement for certain certification and testing requirements for one year, effective February 10, 2009. This includes general conformity and children's product third-party testing and certification for lead content, phthalates standards, and mandatory toy standards. Enforcement is not stayed for certification and testing that had already been implemented or for safety standards themselves. The CPSC announced a stay of federal enforcement for certain certification and testing requirements for one year, effective February 10, 2009. This includes general conformity and children's product third-party testing and certification for lead content, phthalates standards, and mandatory toy standards. Enforcement is not stayed for certification and testing that had already been implemented or for safety standards themselves. The CPSC does not stay safety standards or compliance with them, leaving manufacturers and importers liable for noncompliance. State attorneys general can enforce certification and testing requirements, potentially enjoining sales of non-compliant products. The implementation of new product standards for lead and phthalates has caused controversy, with CPSC unable to delay or suspend safety standards. The CPSC announced a new lead safety standard for children's products and paint, reducing the permissible trace amount of lead in paint to 0.009%. Manufacturers are concerned about the impact on certain products and furniture. The more stringent standard will take effect on August 14, 2009. The CPSC announced a new lead safety standard for children's products and paint, reducing the permissible trace amount of lead in paint to 0.009%. A CPSC Office of General Counsel memorandum clarifies that inventory of noncompliant products may not be sold after the new standard for lead in paint takes effect on August 14, 2009. The permissible lead level in products for children aged 12 and younger is being progressively reduced over three years: 600 ppm as of February 10, 2009; 300 ppm as of August 14, 2009; and 100 ppm as of August 14, 2011. If 100 ppm is not technologically feasible, the CPSC must set the lowest level that is technologically feasible. The CPSC is required to review and lower the lead limit every five years. Inventory of noncompliant products cannot be sold after the effective dates of each phase of the lead standard. Exemptions from the lead content/substrate standard are provided under CPSIA \u00a7101(b). The CPSC may exempt certain materials or products from the standard through a rulemaking process. The CPSC must review and lower the lead limit every five years. Exemptions from the lead standard can be requested based on scientific evidence to show no lead absorption into the body or adverse health impacts. The CPSC's Office of Hazard Identification and Reduction makes initial recommendations within 30 days for exemptions. No timeline is specified for a final decision. The CPSC allows for exemptions from the lead standard based on scientific evidence, with the exclusion request process outlined. The lead content standards do not apply to inaccessible component parts of children's products. Initial decisions on exclusion requests are published for comment, with final grants published as a final rule in the Federal Register. The CPSC has proposed an interpretative rule to define inaccessible components in children's products, which are parts not physically exposed and not easily accessible to children through normal use and abuse. The rule describes inaccessible components as those enclosed in materials like plastic, rubber, or metal. Fabric's classification as a barrier to lead exposure remains uncertain pending a final ruling. The CPSC has issued an interim final rule regarding electronic devices that cannot meet lead limits, requiring measures to minimize lead exposure. Fabric's role as a barrier to lead exposure is still uncertain. The CPSC has proposed a list of inherently lead-free materials, including precious metals and natural-fiber textiles. Manufacturers can request a determination from the CPSC if their products do not exceed lead content limits. The CPSC General Counsel has issued opinions on the lead standard's applicability to certain products like books. The CPSC has proposed a list of inherently lead-free materials, including precious metals and natural-fiber textiles. Manufacturers can request a determination from the CPSC if their products do not exceed lead content limits. The CPSC General Counsel has issued opinions on the lead standard's applicability to books, apparel/shoes, ATVs, bicycles, and small motorcycles/dirt bikes, stating that exclusions may only be granted if no lead absorption into the human body would occur. Legislation may be required to amend the exemption language in the CPSIA for metal parts of these products. Legislation may be needed to amend CPSIA's exemption language for motorcycles/dirt bikes due to lead absorption concerns. CPSC has received applications for product exclusions, with only one denial for ATVs. The denial was based on metal parts not being covered by the statutory exclusion language. CPSC is working on a plan to stay enforcement of lead content standards. The CPSC is developing a plan to stay enforcement of lead content standards for ATVs manufactured before May 1, 2011. Manufacturers must submit a request for protection within 45 days of the stay issuance. Senators believe CPSC has discretion to grant exclusions for conditions like those of ATVs. In NRDC, Inc. v. United States Consumer Prod. Safety Comm ' n, a court struck down an advisory opinion allowing the sale of noncompliant inventory after the phthalates ban. Congressional proponents criticized the interpretation as contrary to intent. The CPSC established a phthalates safety standard for certain consumer products under the CPSIA, banning certain phthalates permanently and temporarily banning others pending review. Children's toys or child care articles containing specific phthalates above 0.1% are prohibited, with interim bans on additional phthalates until further review. The court criticized the OGC analysis related to the standard, which was not appealed by the CPSC. The CPSC established a phthalates safety standard for children's toys and child care articles under the CPSIA. The standard includes banning certain phthalates permanently and temporarily banning others pending review by a CHAP. The definition of \"children's toy\" and \"child care article\" is provided, along with guidelines for determining product use by specific age groups. The provision does not restrict phthalate alternatives and clarifies preemptive effects on state laws. Non-identical provisions are preempted unless a state applies for and the CPSC grants an exemption for stronger protections. The new federal phthalates safety standard under the CPSIA preempts recent state laws that do not provide identical protection for the same risk of injury. The CPSC General Counsel has issued advisory opinions on the applicability of the phthalates ban to apparel and shoes, noting that they would generally not be considered toys or child care articles. The CPSC staff has acknowledged issues with certain home design items and sporting goods in public meetings regarding CPSIA implementation. It may be unclear if some products should be considered toys due to their appearance, or if they are designed for use by the child or parent. Draft guidance on children's products subject to the phthalates ban has been provided by the CPSC. The California statute prohibits the manufacture, sale, or distribution of children's products containing certain phthalates above 0.1%. Manufacturers must use less toxic alternatives and avoid replacing phthalates with carcinogens or reproductive toxicants. The California Attorney General asserts that the federal phthalates standard and the California standard are identical where they overlap, and the federal ban does not preempt the state ban. He also argues that the federal ban does not preempt state law for products not covered by the federal ban. The California Attorney General states that the federal phthalates standard aligns with the state standard, and the federal ban does not override the state ban for products not covered by it. Starting January 1, 2009, it will be illegal to sell toys and child care articles in California with more than 0.1 percent of six specified phthalates, regardless of manufacturing date or location. The federal CPSIA effective date does not impact California's phthalate restrictions. Industry has had sufficient time to prepare for California's phthalate limits taking effect on January 1, 2009. The Attorney General will enforce the ban, and California has petitioned for exemption of certain phthalates statutes from federal preemption. The CPSIA allows local governments to petition for exemption of state and local toy safety standards from federal preemption if they protect consumers from the same risks. The ASTM International Standard F963-07 was mandated by CPSIA, with a new revision F963-08 adopted. The CPSC has 90 days to decide whether to adopt the new revision, otherwise, the older standard will remain in effect. Certain departures from the ASTM toy standard are permitted under the CPSIA. The CPSIA allows states to petition for exemption from federal preemption of state standards. Small businesses and second-hand resellers have faced economic challenges due to the CPSIA, particularly with inventory loss and third-party testing costs. They have sought relief from the new lead and phthalates standards. The CPSIA does not provide a small-business exemption from new requirements, focusing on product standards rather than manufacturer size. Some small businesses argue that their work is not manufacturing but assembling, but the CPSIA does not differentiate between large-scale and small-scale manufacturers. The CPSIA does not differentiate between large-scale and small-scale manufacturers in terms of safety standards. The CPSC considers the needs of small businesses when promulgating regulatory standards but has no authority to delay safety standards for them. The CPSC issued guidelines for small businesses regarding the impact of the CPSIA. Second-hand resellers are dissatisfied with the guidelines, unsure of their obligations. Some states have requested exemptions from preemption of state safety standards under the CPSIA. The CPSC has received petitions for exemptions under the CPSIA, including toy standard provisions. Congressional committees have urged the CPSC to issue guidelines and exemption regulations promptly. The CPSC has responded to implementation issues and potential solutions, such as relief from deadlines and increased agency discretion. Component certification is being considered as an administrative solution. Consumer advocates are generally pleased with the CPSIA implementation but have concerns about the OGC memorandum allowing the sale of non-compliant inventory. They urge the CPSC to provide guidance and take necessary steps to address implementation issues. Some members suggest holding hearings to address these problems and consider potential legislation. The CPSC has not yet held hearings on CPSIA implementation issues, waiting for a new Chair to address them. The recent Omnibus Appropriations Act provided funds for hiring staff and upgrading technology. Several bills have been introduced to address these issues. Several bills have been introduced to mitigate the impact of new CPSIA requirements on small businesses and second-hand resellers, delay effective dates, and provide exemptions for certain products. Proposed legislation includes S. 374 and H.R. 968 to provide regulatory relief to small businesses, and S. 389 to establish a conditional stay on the ban of lead in children's products. Several bills have been introduced to provide regulatory relief to small and family-owned businesses, including S. 374, H.R. 1027, H.R. 1046, H.R. 1465, H.R. 1510, and S. 608. Several bills have been introduced to amend the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, including S. 608, H.R. 1587, H.R. 1692, and H.R. 1815, to provide exemptions for certain products and clarify applicability of provisions. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 faced challenges with burdensome requirements. An amendment sponsored by Senator Jim DeMint was not approved in the Senate on April 2, 2009."
