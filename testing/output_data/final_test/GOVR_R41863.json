    "content": "The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) allowed for proceeds from land sales managed by the Bureau of Land Management to be deposited in separate Treasury accounts for land acquisition and other purposes. FLTFA aimed to reconfigure land ownership patterns for better resource management and administrative efficiency. Proceeds from the sale or exchange of BLM lands under FLTFA were split between the state (4%) and a Treasury account (96%). The authority briefly expired in 2010 but was extended for one year. Congress is considering reauthorizing this authority. When FLTFA expired, $52 million in the Treasury account ceased to be available. The FLTFA account, with an estimated $52 million, expired, and an additional $2 million at the end of the extension also became unavailable. The funds were used by the Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture to acquire non-federal lands adjacent to federal lands with exceptional resources. At least 80% of the funds were to be used in the state where they were generated, with the remaining funds available for any state. From the enactment of FLTFA through FY2010, $115.7 million was raised through the sale or exchange of BLM lands, with 25,967 acres sold. $63.7 million in funding was disbursed, with $49.2 million spent on the purchase of 18,135 acres. The report is organized into four sections: Overview of FLTFA Authority, Implementation of FLTFA, Administrative and Legislative Action. President Obama proposed amending FLTFA to make it permanent. President Obama proposed amending FLTFA to make it permanent, with measures from the 112th and 111th Congress to extend and amend FLTFA. Issues related to extending or making FLTFA permanent include the need for it, length of extension, currency of land use plans, and retention of proceeds. BLM is authorized to sell land meeting specific criteria under FLPMA, identified through the land use planning process. FLTFA required the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program for the sale or exchange of identified land. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) established a program for the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal under BLM's approved land use plans. Eligible lands were those identified for potential disposal in the land management plans in effect as of July 25, 2000. Lands identified for disposal after this date could still be considered for sale or exchange, but proceeds would not go into the FLTFA account. There was no set schedule for land sales under FLTFA, with BLM deciding which lands to offer based on various factors like marketability and cost. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) follows laws and regulations for selling land, including appraisals to determine fair market value, competitive bidding, environmental studies, public notification, and comment opportunities. The process can take a year or longer. The law provided for revenue in the FLTFA account to be used for administrative expenses and land acquisitions. BLM could use up to 20% for expenses, while at least 80% had to be used for land acquisitions. BLM alone disposed of land under FLTFA, but other federal agencies could acquire lands with the proceeds. Under the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture were authorized to acquire inholdings within federally designated areas with exceptional resources. These areas included units of the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, wilderness areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers System, National Trails System, National Forest System, and certain areas managed by BLM. Exceptional resources were defined as resources of high value. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) authorized the acquisition of inholdings within federally designated areas with exceptional resources. Funding allocation required at least 80% to be spent in the state where funds were generated, with up to 20% for acquisitions in any state. Within a state, at least 80% of funding was for inholdings, with up to 20% for adjacent lands containing exceptional resources. FLTFA focused on addressing problems caused by inholdings for land management agencies. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) aimed to address issues caused by inholdings within federally designated areas with exceptional resources. The acquisition of land under FLTFA was governed by various authorities and criteria, requiring the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to prioritize acquiring inholdings and lands with exceptional resources from willing sellers at a fair price. The MOU among the four land management agencies for the implementation of FLTFA became effective on May 5, 2003, allocating acquisition funds as follows: 60% to BLM, 20% to FS, 10% to FWS, and 10% to NPS. The Secretaries could mutually agree to allocate funds for specific acquisitions, and state-level implementation plans were prepared as directed by the MOU. The FLTFA program involved state-level implementation plans prepared by each state, with recommendations on land acquisitions made by participating agencies. All four agencies had to agree on fund expenditures. FLTFA expired on July 25, 2010, with remaining funds transferred to the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. Approximately $52 million was estimated to be in the account at that time. During the one-year extension of FLTFA, land sales were limited due to lack of upfront funds. Of the $52 million in the account, $13 million was set aside for administrative costs. $3.8 million was collected from land sales, with $0.2 million going to states. Approximately $3.6 million remained in the FLTFA fund for land sales and acquisitions. BLM estimated that approximately $2 million was in the FLTFA account at the end of the one-year extension, and ceased to be available for FLTFA purposes. A total of $115.7 million was raised through the sale or exchange of BLM lands under the authority from FLTFA enactment through FY2010. $103.2 million was collected from the sale of 25,967 acres, and $12.5 million from equalization payments for exchanged lands. $4.6 million (4%) was provided to states, and $111.0 million (96%) was deposited into the FLTFA fund. Approximately $59 million was spent, with $49.2 million used for acquiring land and an estimated $10 million for administering the land sale program. Agencies acquired 18,135 acres using $49.2 million in FLTFA funds. The agencies acquired 18,135 acres using $49.2 million in FLTFA funds and $9.7 million in other funds, totaling $58.9 million. Approximately $59 million was spent from the FLTFA account, representing 53% of available funds before the program's termination. Challenges to land acquisitions included time, cost, complexity, identifying willing sellers, lack of realty staff, funding shortages for some states, and public opposition. Initial expenditures were delayed until FY2007 due to interagency agreements and funding availability. The acquisition of lands under FLTFA was delayed due to developing interagency agreements and funding availability. By 2007, all BLM state offices had established state-specific implementation agreements. Funding for land acquisition was limited in the early 2000s, with only $5.0 million generated from FY2000 to FY2003. However, receipts from land sales increased significantly in the following years, totaling $87.4 million from FY2004 to FY2006. Total expenditures amounted to $49.2 million during this period. Between FY2004 and FY2006, $87.4 million was generated from land sales, while $49.2 million was spent between FY2007 and FY2010. Of the $115.7 million in receipts under FLTFA, 89% came from land sales and 11% from cash equalization payments. Land sales were mainly concentrated in Nevada and Oregon, accounting for 78% of the total acres sold. Between FY2004 and FY2006, $87.4 million was generated from land sales, while $49.2 million was spent between FY2007 and FY2010. Of the $115.7 million in receipts under FLTFA, 89% came from land sales and 11% from cash equalization payments. Land sales were mainly concentrated in Nevada and Oregon, accounting for 78% of the total acres sold. The average price per acre sold varied among states, ranging from $198 in Montana to $24,850 in Arizona. The total acreage sold under FLTFA was 0.01% of the 247.5 million acres managed by BLM. The revenue generated from land sales and exchanges under FLTFA was mainly concentrated in Nevada, with $88.1 million (76%) coming from there. Arizona and New Mexico each contributed 6% of the revenues, while California and Colorado each contributed 3%. The remaining 6% came from nine other states. The acquisition of lands and expenditures on acquisitions were less concentrated among states compared to land sales. Acquisitions under FLTFA were spread across 10 states, with California and Colorado acquiring the most acreage. Expenditures of $49.2 million were dispersed among these states, with Nevada having the highest expenditure at 38%. An additional $9.7 million of non-FLTFA funds helped pay for parcels acquired with FLTFA funding. The average price per acre acquired by BLM varied widely among states, ranging from $763 in Colorado to $88,878 in Nevada. The average price of all 18,135 acres acquired was $3,250. Nonfederal lands, like federal lands, vary in resources, commercial potential, and location. Data on FLTFA activity is depicted by state in bar graphs. In Nevada and Oregon, land sales exceeded acquisitions under FLTFA through FY2010. Utah and Wyoming also sold more land than acquired, with Utah having small sales and acquisitions. In contrast, states like California and Colorado acquired more land than they sold, with California acquiring 12 times the amount sold and Colorado acquiring 9 times the amount sold. Factors influencing land acquisition included inholdings, willing sellers, cost, and natural resources. Figure 3 shows the receipts and expenditures of each state under FLTFA through FY2010. Nevada had the highest amount of both receipts and expenditures, mainly due to large BLM land holdings. Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon had higher receipts than expenditures, while six states had higher expenditures than receipts. California had a small difference, while Montana and Wyoming had expenditures more than triple receipts. States can have higher expenditures than receipts. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposed making FLTFA permanent and using current land management plans for determining which lands to sell or exchange. The Administration testified in support of reauthorizing FLTFA, stating it has been a critical tool for enhancing the nation's landscapes. The George W. Bush Administration also supported using updated land management plans. Legislation has been introduced in the 112th Congress to amend FLTFA, with bills such as S. 3525, S. 714, and H.R. 3365 proposing extensions of the authority to sell or exchange BLM lands. The extensions vary in length, with S. 3525 for 11 years, S. 714 for 10 years, and H.R. 3365 for 7 years. The bills aim to remove the provision that terminates the FLTFA account if the authority expires, allowing funds to be used for acquisitions and updating land management plans. The bills introduced in the 112th Congress, such as S. 3525, S. 714, and H.R. 3365, propose extensions of the authority to sell or exchange BLM lands. They aim to allow funds to be used for acquisitions and updating land management plans, regardless of when the lands were established. S. 3525 was considered on the Senate floor but was returned to the calendar due to a point of order against an amendment. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to reinstate funds in the FLTFA account that expired in 2010. Debates have centered around the need for FLTFA authority compared to other laws, the duration of any extension (short or long-term), and the requirement to use land use plans from 2000 as the basis for land sales. The expiration of FLTFA does not prevent BLM from selling or exchanging land identified for disposal under other laws. Congress needs to consider whether FLTFA provides a more efficient mechanism for the government to sell and purchase lands. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) provided a more expeditious process for disposing and acquiring land, with proceeds from BLM land sales retained for subsequent acquisitions. The expiration of FLTFA hinders agencies from keeping sales proceeds, impacting funding for land acquisitions. Congress may reinstate this funding source or consider alternative mechanisms for efficient land transactions. Congress may choose to reinstate permanent funding for land acquisitions through FLTFA or continue centralizing decision-making on acquisition funding in annual appropriations. The impact of FLTFA on land sales and acquisitions is unclear due to a lack of consistent data before and after its enactment. Challenges in selling and acquiring land could still arise independently of FLTFA. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) faces challenges in selling land, as some parcels are in low-value markets with little demand. BLM must sell land at fair market value, which may deter buyers. In 2008, GAO found that BLM had not prioritized land sales under FLTFA, leading to few purchases with FLTFA funds. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) faces challenges in selling land due to various obstacles, including limited realty staff availability, lack of sales goals, and difficulties in acquiring inholdings. BLM has taken steps to address these issues, but concerns remain about funding for land sales and acquisitions without revenues from FLTFA. Funding for BLM land sales is not readily available as appropriations are not specified in laws or budget materials. Each year, federal land management agencies receive appropriations for land acquisition from LWCF, ranging from $119.2 million to $316.0 million over the past decade. In FY2012, appropriations were $199.2 million, with varying amounts allocated to each agency. It is unclear if different LWCF appropriations would have been provided with FLTFA funding. A short-term extension of FLTFA could allow for further assessment of its long-term need and effectiveness in land sales and acquisitions. Shorter and more frequent program extensions could promote oversight and evaluation, while a longer-term extension may establish a more stable program. Land sales under FLTFA may progress slowly. The extension of FLTFA could lead to a more stable sale and acquisition program, allowing for the hiring of additional staff and addressing the lengthy process of sales and acquisitions. The uncertainty of program renewal may have weakened the incentive to sell land, and the acquisition process can take 2\u00bd to 3 years due to coordination among agencies. There is interest in amending FLTFA to use current land use plans for disposals. The BLM began updating land use plans in 2001 to address changing circumstances like increased energy demand. Over 75 plan revisions have been completed, with 48 more expected by 2016. The FLTFA prevents BLM from keeping proceeds of land sales identified for disposal after the enactment date, to avoid potential misuse of funds. The BLM is authorized to sell certain tracts of land if they meet specific criteria, with land use plan revisions since 2000 not significantly changing identified acreage for disposal. However, BLM has not prioritized the sale of lands under FLTFA. There are questions about how proceeds of land sales should be allocated, with a proposal in the FY2009 budget suggesting 70% of net proceeds be deposited in the Treasury's general fund to reduce the federal deficit and ensure public benefit. The BLM is authorized to sell certain tracts of land under specific criteria, with questions on how proceeds should be allocated. The George W. Bush Administration proposed using funds for conservation projects on federal lands. Another issue is whether funds for land acquisition should be used in the state where they were generated. The George W. Bush Administration proposed using funds from land sales for conservation projects on federal lands. However, there are questions on how proceeds should be allocated, with a focus on whether funds for land acquisition should be used in the state where they were generated. GAO found in 2008 that this requirement has hindered the acquisition of priority lands in states with limited land sales. The BLM had planned to use funds from the FLTFA fund, totaling $54 million, for selling lands and acquiring priority inholdings and edgeholdings. It is uncertain if these funds will be reinstated. Under current law, the LWCF generates $900.0 million annually from offshore oil and gas development. Congress has historically only appropriated this amount twice, usually allocating less than half of the revenues. There is uncertainty on whether these funds will be appropriated for conservation projects or redirected to another government program or the Treasury's general fund."
