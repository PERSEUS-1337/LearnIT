    "content": "The Act titled \"HMO Solvency Act of 2000\" aims to ensure the financial stability of Medicaid managed care organizations. The HMO Solvency Act of 2000 amends the Medicaid Program to include solvency-related requirements for Medicaid managed care organizations. This includes submitting financial reports to the State quarterly or more frequently to monitor financial stability and prevent insolvency. The State will review these reports and take appropriate action. Before entering into a contract with a Medicaid managed care organization, the organization must undergo an on-site audit to evaluate its internal structure for financial projections. The audit, conducted by an independent entity, will review claims processing capability and utilization. The Medicaid managed care organization must undergo periodic audits as required by the State under an approved audit plan. Audits focus on key business risks such as regulatory risks, competition, provider network, pricing, claims processing environment, reserves, and information system integrity. The Medicaid managed care organization must maintain a minimum net worth in cash or cash equivalents as specified by the State. Subcontractors must be approved by the organization. The Medicaid managed care organization must provide notice and a copy of the contract to the State at least 90 days before entering into a subcontract for health care services. An independent audit of the proposed subcontractor must be conducted before the subcontract takes effect. The Medicaid managed care organization must conduct an independent audit of the proposed subcontractor to ensure financial performance and service provision. The organization must report significant changes in ownership or operations to the State to maintain solvency. The Medicaid managed care organization must comply with additional solvency standards set by the Secretary. If the organization is owned or controlled by another entity, certain requirements also apply to that entity. Effective date of the amendment is subject to conditions. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies as of a date specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, not later than 6 months after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary may delay the effective date for states needing legislation to meet the new requirements and allow additional time for existing Medicaid managed care organizations to comply. The amendment allows for additional time to meet the new requirement of minimum net worth under section 1932(b)(9)(C) of the Social Security Act. SEC. 3. ASSURING THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE+CHOICE ORGANIZATIONS. SEC. 3. ASSURING THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE+CHOICE ORGANIZATIONS. Amends Section 1855 of the Social Security Act to apply solvency-related requirements to Medicare+Choice organizations in a manner similar to medicaid managed care organizations. Recognizes state enforcement in applying these requirements. The Secretary will deem a Medicare+Choice organization as meeting requirements if they meet certain conditions. The Secretary can waive requirements if they are duplicative and do not provide greater protection to enrollees. The requirement of section 1855(e) of the Social Security Act will apply to organizations providing Medicare benefits on a capitated basis. The amendment made by subsection (a) of the Social Security Act applies to organizations receiving capitated payments for services under title XVIII. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will implement this amendment and subsection (b) in a similar manner to other effective amendments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must report to Congress within a year on steps taken by states to protect health care providers in case of insolvency of Medicaid managed care or Medicare+Choice organizations, and recommend additional measures for provider protection."
