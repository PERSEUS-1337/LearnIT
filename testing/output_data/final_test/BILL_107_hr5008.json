    "content": "There is no text provided in the prev_chunk, so I will summarize the curr_chunk directly:\n\n\"SECTION 1. REPEAL OF CARRYOVER BASIS; ETC.\" The curr_chunk discusses the repeal of certain sections of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, with amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Sunset provisions are also amended to apply only until December 31, 2010. Conforming amendments are made to other sections of the Act. The repeal of certain sections of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, along with its amendments, is hereby enacted. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be applied as if these sections had never been enacted. MODIFICATIONS TO ESTATE TAX. Increase in Exclusion Equivalent of Unified Credit to $3,500,000 and Maximum Estate Tax Rate to Remain at 50 Percent; Phaseout of Graduated Rates and Unified Credit. The estate tax code is amended to phase out graduated rates and unified credit by increasing the tentative tax by 5% on amounts exceeding $10,000,000. The increase cannot exceed the applicable credit amount under section 2010(c) and $224,200. These amendments apply to estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 2002. SEC. 3. Valuation rules for certain transfers of nonbusiness assets; limitation on minority discounts. Valuation rules for certain transfers of nonbusiness assets are amended in the Internal Revenue Code. Nonbusiness assets held by an entity must be valued as if directly transferred to the transferee, without allowing valuation discounts. The value of an interest in an entity does not include nonbusiness assets. Nonbusiness assets are defined as assets not used in active business operations, with exceptions for certain passive assets. The value of an interest in an entity does not include nonbusiness assets, which are assets not used in active business operations, with exceptions for certain passive assets such as real property used in active real property trades or businesses. Material participation and requirements are determined under specific rules. Passive assets, including cash, stock, debt instruments, and annuities, held for working capital needs are considered used in the active conduct of a trade or business. Passive assets such as annuities, real property used in real property trades, assets producing royalty income, commodities, collectibles, and other specified assets are subject to specific rules under section 351(e)(1)(B). Nonbusiness assets with a 10-percent interest in another entity are treated differently under the look-thru rules. The rules under section 351(e)(1)(B) apply to passive assets like annuities, real property, commodities, and collectibles. Nonbusiness assets with a 10-percent interest in another entity are subject to look-thru rules based on ownership percentages in corporations, partnerships, or other entities. The amendments made by this section limit minority discounts for transfers of interests in entities, with no discount allowed if the transferee and their family members have control of the entity. Effective after the enactment of this Act."
