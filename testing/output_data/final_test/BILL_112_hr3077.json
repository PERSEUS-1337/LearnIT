    "content": "The \"Freedom and Mobility in Consumer Banking Act\" allows individuals the right to close personal checking and savings accounts under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The \"Freedom and Mobility in Consumer Banking Act\" permits individuals to close checking and savings accounts at insured depository institutions without any prohibitions or fees. Accounts must be closed within 48 hours of a customer's request, which can be made in person, over the phone, or through electronic means. Any insured depository institution may require an accountholder with an outstanding balance of $25,000 or more to close the account in person, if written notice is provided. Balances in closed accounts must be repaid to the accountholder, with in-person requests receiving the total amount of funds on deposit. The accountholder can request the total funds in their account without a fee, either by certified check, electronic transfer, or other means offered by the financial institution. If the request is made remotely, the funds must be promptly remitted without a fee. The insured depository institution must remit the total funds in the account requested to be closed by the accountholder within 3 business days without imposing any fees or charges. No insured depository institution can charge fees on a closed account. The institution cannot reopen a closed account without the consumer's explicit request. If a preauthorized recurring debit is directed to a closed account, the institution must notify the customer within 30 days. Limitation on Reporting: An insured depository institution cannot report a negative balance resulting from fees on a closed account to consumer reporting agencies if it could harm the consumer's ability to open a new account elsewhere. An insured depository institution cannot report a negative balance to consumer reporting agencies if it is due to funds paid to a third party, excluding fees, and related to an overdraft line of credit program. If an account at an insured depository institution has a negative balance when closed, the institution must notify the accountholder promptly and may report the outstanding balance after a 30-day notice period. After closing an account with a negative balance, the institution must notify the accountholder and may report the outstanding balance to a consumer reporting agency. They can also engage in collection activities for the unpaid balance. If a direct deposit is received after the account closure and repayment, the institution must handle it accordingly. The consumer must provide account details for a successor account at another institution. The receiving institution must transfer the amount without a fee to the specified institution. Federal banking agencies will create regulations for this process."
