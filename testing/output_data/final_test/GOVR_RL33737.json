    "content": "Section 106 of BAPCPA requires individuals filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy to undergo credit counseling within 180 days before filing. The counseling must be provided by an approved nonprofit agency and can be done individually or in a group setting, either by phone or online. Certain exemptions apply under section 109(h) of the Bankruptcy Code. The U.S. trustee may exempt debtors from mandatory credit counseling if approved agencies are unable to provide services. Exemptions require a certification of exigent circumstances and failure to obtain counseling within five days. The exemption lasts up to 30 days after filing, extendable for cause by the court. The requirements for an exemption from credit counseling under section 109(h) are strict, with failure to comply leading to denial of exemptions and inability to file for bankruptcy. Debtors may be exempt if they are unable to complete counseling due to incapacity, disability, or active military duty in a combat zone. Incapacity refers to mental impairment, while disability means physical impairment preventing participation in counseling. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) requires debtors to complete a personal financial management course to receive a discharge in Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Exemptions are available for debtors with incapacity, disability, or active military duty in a combat zone. The clerk maintains a list of approved credit counseling agencies and financial management courses. Section 111(b) outlines the requirements for approval of credit counseling agencies and financial management courses by a U.S. trustee. The trustee must review the qualifications to ensure they meet the standards set forth in section 111. If not initially listed, approval can be granted for a probationary period of up to six months, with subsequent approvals possible for one-year periods. A U.S. trustee can grant subsequent approvals for one-year periods if a counseling agency meets the requirements under section 111 and can continue to meet these standards. Section 111(c) sets minimum requirements for approval of a credit counseling agency, including having qualified counselors, safekeeping client funds, providing adequate counseling, and maintaining financial security. The agency must also have a board of directors, with the majority not employed by the agency. The credit counseling agency must have a board of directors, charge a reasonable fee for services, provide safekeeping of client funds, disclose funding sources and costs to clients, and offer adequate counseling on credit problems. The credit counseling agency must have trained counselors with no financial incentives based on outcomes, demonstrate experience in credit counseling, and have adequate financial resources for ongoing support services. District courts can investigate agency qualifications and remove agencies that do not meet requirements. During the probationary period, a credit counseling agency must meet specific requirements for approval by the U.S. trustee for a personal financial management instructional course, including trained personnel, appropriate learning materials, and convenient facilities. The personal financial management instructional course must meet specific requirements for approval, including trained personnel, appropriate learning materials, and convenient facilities. The course may be offered by telephone or through the Internet if effective, and reasonable records must be kept for evaluation. A reasonable fee may be charged, and services must be provided regardless of ability to pay. Additional requirements are needed for approval of the course during any one-year period. An instructional course provider must demonstrate that the personal financial management course meets specific requirements for approval, including effectiveness in assisting debtors and increasing understanding of personal financial management. Bankruptcy courts have addressed issues related to BAPCPA's credit counseling requirements, such as circumstances for waiving the requirements and eligibility for filing bankruptcy. In order to file for bankruptcy, an individual must undergo credit counseling. Under section 109(h)(3), a debtor can be temporarily exempted if they provide a certification describing exigent circumstances, stating they tried to obtain counseling but couldn't within seven days, and the court approves. In a specific case, a Chapter 13 debtor requested a waiver due to a foreclosure sale scheduled on the same day as the bankruptcy filing. The debtor requested a waiver of the credit counseling requirement due to a foreclosure sale scheduled on the same day as the bankruptcy filing. Despite claiming it was impossible to receive counseling in time, the bankruptcy court denied the waiver. The U.S. Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Eighth Circuit reviewed the decision, focusing on the definition of \"exigent circumstances\" and the requirements for a waiver. The U.S. Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Eighth Circuit discussed the definition of \"exigent circumstances\" and the criteria for waiving the credit counseling requirement in cases where obtaining counseling before bankruptcy is impossible due to imminent adverse events. The Panel considered whether the debtor's circumstances warranted a waiver, noting that state law required 20 days notice of foreclosure in the case at hand. The U.S. Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the decision to deny a waiver of the credit counseling requirement for a debtor facing foreclosure with 20 days notice. The debtor, who only spoke Creole, was unable to receive counseling in Creole and could not afford an interpreter. The Panel found that the circumstances were not exigent and upheld the denial of the waiver. The U.S. trustee declined the debtor's request for Creole-speaking counselors and the debtor sought a waiver of credit counseling requirements. The court waived the requirement, despite the trustee's argument against it. The court granted a waiver of credit counseling requirements for the debtor, despite the U.S. trustee's objections. The court found the credit counseling services in the Southern District of Florida inadequate for the debtor, who properly challenged their adequacy. The U.S. trustee's motion for reconsideration was denied. Courts have been strict in following the provision regarding credit counseling in bankruptcy cases, reluctant to accept petitions where counseling was sought after filing. In a specific case, a debtor sought to be excused from pre-petition counseling due to car repossession, but the court emphasized that compliance with the requirement could only be waived under specific conditions, not just based on equity principles. The court dismissed a bankruptcy petition because credit counseling must be obtained within 180 days before filing. Some courts require completion of credit counseling the day before filing, interpreting the \"date of filing\" as the entire calendar day. The \"rule\" states that credit counseling must occur before the filing date, with some courts interpreting this as the day prior to filing. This interpretation is supported by Rule 9006 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Other courts consider counseling valid as long as it occurs before filing. The Bankruptcy Code allows debtors to satisfy the credit counseling requirement on the same day as they file for bankruptcy, as long as the counseling occurs before the petition is filed. This interpretation prevents an uncovered gap where transfers could be made before filing, aligning with congressional intent. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 amends the Internal Revenue Code for credit counseling organizations seeking tax exemption. They must offer tailored services, not provide loans, and focus on improving credit records without separate fees. The organization providing credit counseling services must have a diverse board of directors representing the public's interests. Fees charged must be reasonable and can be waived if the consumer cannot pay, and cannot be based on the consumer's debt or savings from using the services, except as allowed by state law. The organization providing credit counseling services must have a diverse board of directors with restrictions on voting power and financial interests. The board members cannot have more than 20% vested interest if they benefit financially from the organization's activities, and not more than 49% if excluding only reasonable directors' fees. Additionally, the organization cannot own more than 35% of the total combined voting power of a corporation in the lending money, repairing credit, or debt management business. The organization providing credit counseling services must comply with restrictions on financial interests and voting power for board members. Exempt organizations under IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) face limits on income from debt management services and cannot solicit contributions from current consumers. Requirements under the Pension Protection Act are effective for taxable years starting after August 17, 2006, to maintain tax-exempt status."
