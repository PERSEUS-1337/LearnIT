SEC. 3. Establishes the Hurricane Sand Dunes National Recreation Area in Utah. The Hurricane Sand Dunes National Recreation Area in Utah is established to enhance recreational uses and allow off-highway vehicle use on approximately 18,447 acres of Bureau of Land Management land. The proposed exchange parcel is excluded from the Recreation Area, and the Secretary will administer both areas in accordance with applicable Federal laws. The Hurricane Sand Dunes National Recreation Area in Utah is established to allow off-highway vehicle use on Bureau of Land Management land, following applicable laws and land use plans. The Recreation Area's uses must align with its purposes, and the State retains jurisdiction over fish and wildlife. No protective perimeter is created around the Recreation Area, and off-highway vehicle use is specified for the described land. The Hurricane Sand Dunes National Recreation Area in Utah allows off-highway vehicle use on Bureau of Land Management land in perpetuity. SEC. 4. EXCHANGE OF FEDERAL LAND AND NON-FEDERAL LAND. The Secretary must accept a State's offer to convey non-Federal land to the United States and then convey Federal land to the State. The exchange is subject to valid existing rights, and the title approval must be acceptable to both parties. Appraisals by independent appraisers determine the value of the lands to be exchanged. Appraisers retained by the State, with the consent of the Secretary, conduct appraisals in accordance with nationally recognized standards. The appraisals are submitted for approval by the Secretary and the State. The value of Federal and non-Federal land to be exchanged must be equal or made equal if there is a surplus of Federal land. When the value of Federal land exceeds non-Federal land, adjustments can be made by reducing Federal land acreage or adding State land. Conversely, if non-Federal land value surpasses Federal land, non-Federal land acreage can be reduced to equalize values. The process is determined by the Secretary and the State. On conveyance to the Secretary, non-Federal land becomes part of the Recreation Area and is managed according to the Federal Land Policy Act of 1976."
