Georgia has been a reliable ally in global peace efforts and the US-Georgia Charter emphasizes the importance of their partnership in various areas. Georgia's democratic nature is a core strength that underpins the deep friendship between Georgia and the United States. Democratic reform, strong institutions, and free, fair elections are crucial for their continuing relationship. However, democracy in Georgia is facing challenges with political freedom and fair competition being threatened by government actions such as detaining opposition members and limiting press freedom. The 2010 Human Rights Report on Georgia highlighted significant problems with President Mikheil Saakashvili's re-election in 2008, including allegations of intimidation, flawed vote-counting processes, and incomplete adherence to international standards in parliamentary elections. United Nations Special Rapporteur Maina Kiai visited Georgia in February 2012 and expressed concerns about a growing climate of fear, intimidation, and restrictions on fundamental freedoms. He criticized the government for undermining political parties and NGOs, prosecuting activists without evidence, and blurring the lines between the ruling party and the state, especially in the context of upcoming elections. Georgia is preparing for parliamentary elections in October 2012, with constitutional changes reducing the president's power and increasing the prime minister's authority. President Saakashvili's term ends in 2013, and he plans to become Prime Minister if his party wins. Businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili formed the opposition party Georgian Dream in 2011 to unite opposition parties. Georgian Dream was created to challenge Saakashvili's control over the government. Saakashvili stripped Ivanishvili of his citizenship, leading to a campaign to undermine Georgian Dream's competition in the elections. The government fired employees, especially teachers, who supported the opposition parties. The Georgian Government has increased harassment and detention of supporters of Ivanishvili and other opposition parties, often using violent means without due process. Hundreds of opposition supporters were detained in March 2012 to intimidate voters and campaigners. Solomon Kimeridze, an Ivanishvili supporter, died under suspicious circumstances in police custody. Georgian security officials killed two protesters during a peaceful protest on May 26, 2011, prompting an investigation request by the United States Ambassador and the United Nations. On December 28, 2011, the Georgian Parliament passed new election laws criticized by the OSCE and U.S. State Department for limiting opposition parties' access to funds. The Chamber of Control, controlled by Saakashvili, targeted Georgian Dream and Bidzina Ivanishvili to block financial support for opposition candidates. United Nations Special Rapporteur Maina Kiai criticized changes to the election law for potentially violating rights to association and peaceful assembly. The Saakashvili regime targeted Bank Cartu, owned by Bidzina Ivanishvili, leading to the seizure of millions of dollars in assets, affecting the Georgian banking sector. The American Chamber of Commerce criticized a new law in Georgia that allows the government to seize loan collateral before banks, targeting Bank Cartu owned by Bidzina Ivanishvili. This action is seen as an attempt to force the bank out of business and remove a source of financial support. The United States emphasizes the importance of a democratic Georgia for national security interests in the region. Georgia's instability could lead to violent conflict, so the US must warn President Saakashvili about the consequences of not allowing fair elections. Failure to comply may result in the loss of political support and financial aid from the US. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA. No funds for fiscal year 2013 can be used to assist Georgia until the Secretary of State certifies that the 2012 parliamentary elections were free, fair, and competitive. The report must include details on election observers, opposition parties' campaigning ability, and whether Bidzina Ivanishvili and the Georgian Dream Party participated."
