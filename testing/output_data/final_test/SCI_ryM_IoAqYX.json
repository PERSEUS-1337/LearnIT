Gradient quantization has been proposed to reduce communication costs in distributed learning for deep neural networks. This paper explores how the combination of weight and gradient quantization affects convergence. Weight-quantized models converge to an error related to weight quantization resolution and dimension. Quantizing gradients slows convergence, but clipping before quantization allows for fewer bits. Empirical experiments confirm faster training with quantized networks compared to full-precision networks. Recently, weight quantization methods have been effective in reducing model size and accelerating network training. Loss-aware quantization directly minimizes loss with quantized weights, showing better performance. Distributed learning can further speed up training by reducing communication costs. Algorithms that sparsify or quantize gradients have been proposed to address this challenge. This paper explores quantization of both weights and gradients in a distributed environment, building on previous work in this area. In this paper, the authors focus on distributed learning and use gradient quantization to reduce communication costs and accelerate training of weight-quantized networks. Existing methods lack theoretical guarantees, with some limited to specific scenarios like stochastic weight quantization and linear models. The authors propose a method that relaxes these restrictions. The paper explores how gradient precision affects convergence of weight-quantized networks in a distributed setting. Results show that the average regret of loss-aware weight quantization converges to an error related to weight quantization resolution and dimension. Gradient quantization slows convergence compared to full-precision gradients. The larger the weight quantized model's dimension, the slower the convergence. Gradient clipping can mitigate speed degradation but incurs additional error. Empirical results demonstrate that quantizing gradients reduces communication cost, and clipping mitigates speed degradation, enabling faster distributed training of weight-quantized networks. The training of weight-quantized networks is faster with comparable accuracy using full-precision gradients. Notations for vectors and matrices are defined. Online learning adapts the model with a sequence of observations. The algorithm picks a model with parameters from a convex compact set and evaluates performance based on regret. In weight-quantized networks, loss-aware weight quantization improves performance by considering the effect of weight quantization on the loss function. Examples include loss-aware binarization (LAB) and loss-aware quantization (LAQ). The full-precision weights from all layers in the deep network are denoted as w, and the corresponding quantized weight is \u0175. In weight-quantized networks, the quantized weight is denoted \u0175. The second-order Taylor expansion of the stochastic gradient is used in deep network optimizers like RMSProp and Adam. The quantized weight is obtained through preconditioned gradient descent and quantization. The weight quantization resolution is \u2206 w = 1, and an efficient approximate solution is available. In a distributed learning environment with data parallelism, communication bottleneck is reduced by quantizing gradients before synchronization. Recent methods require unbiased quantized gradients, while deterministic quantization makes analysis more complex. This paper explores m-bit stochastic linear quantization for gradient quantization. The gradient quantization resolution is defined as \u2206 g = B r+1 \u2212 B r. The quantized gradients are synchronized and averaged at the parameter server. The server updates the second moment based on g t, and also the full-precision weight. The weight is quantized using loss-aware weight quantization to produce \u0175 t+1 = Q w (w t+1), which is then sent back to all the workers. Analysis on quantized deep networks has only been performed on models with full-precision gradients and weights quantized by stochastic weight quantization or simple deterministic weight quantization using the sign. This paper studies loss-aware weight quantization with both full-precision and quantized gradients. The analysis in this section focuses on the assumptions made for convex online learning and quantized networks, which are not directly applicable to deep networks. However, these assumptions aid in the analysis of deep learning models and help explain empirical behavior. Additionally, assumptions are made regarding the distance between weights and the decay of the learning rate for simplicity. The analysis in this section focuses on assumptions for convex online learning and quantized networks, aiding in the analysis of deep learning models. Loss-aware weight quantization with full-precision gradients converges at a rate of O(1/ \u221a T) for standard online gradient descent. The average regret converges at the same rate, but only to a nonzero error LD D 2 + d\u03b1 2 \u2206. Loss-aware weight quantization with quantized gradients significantly increases the norm of the quantized gradient compared to full-precision counterparts. The difference grows with gradient quantization resolution and dimension. The regrets for loss-aware weight quantization with quantized gradients are similar to those with full-precision gradients, but the difference lies in the gradient used. Quantizing gradients slows convergence. Loss-aware weight quantization with quantized gradients significantly increases the norm of the quantized gradient compared to full-precision counterparts. The regrets for this method are similar to full-precision gradients, but quantizing gradients slows convergence. Gradient clipping has been proposed as a solution to reduce convergence speed degradation caused by gradient quantization. The difference between quantized and full-precision gradients is related to dimension d. The bias in quantized clipped gradients is determined by the clipping factor c. A larger c leads to smaller bias. The regret in loss-aware weight quantization with quantized clipped gradients has an additional term. In distributed training with data parallelism, there is a trade-off between communication cost and convergence speed when using gradient clipping before quantization. Weak scaling is more popular in deep network training, where the same data set size is used for each worker. The regret in loss-aware weight quantization with quantized clipped gradients has an additional term D T t=1 E( Clip(\u011d t ) \u2212\u011d t 2 ) compared to full-precision gradients. This leads to slower convergence by a factor of (2/\u03c0) 1 2 c\u2206 g + 1. In distributed training with data parallelism, the convergence speed is improved by averaging gradients from N workers. The number of iterations for convergence is reduced by a factor of 1/N compared to using a single worker. The effect of dimension d on convergence speed and final error of a linear model with square loss is studied. Each model parameter entry is generated by uniform sampling. In distributed training with data parallelism, the convergence speed is improved by averaging gradients from N workers. The number of iterations for convergence is reduced by a factor of 1/N compared to using a single worker. The weights are quantized to 1 bit using LAB, with gradients either full-precision (FP) or stochastically quantized to 2 bits (SQ2). The optimizer is RMSProp with a learning rate of \u03b7 t = \u03b7/ \u221a t, where \u03b7 = 0.03. Training stops when the average training loss doesn't decrease for 5000 iterations. Convergence is slower for larger d, especially when gradients are quantized. In the current chunk, experiments are conducted on two neural network models - a multi-layer perceptron and Cifarnet. The effect of d on deep networks is studied, with d representing the number of hidden units or filters in each model. The weights are quantized to 3 bits or 2 bits, and the gradients are either full-precision or stochastically quantized. Different optimizers and learning rates are used for each model. The convergence of the average training loss is shown for both networks, indicating that a larger d leads to larger convergence. In the experiment, the Cifarnet model is used with weights quantized to 1 bit, 2 bits, or m bits. Gradients are full-precision or stochastically quantized to m bits without clipping. Adam optimizer is employed with a decaying learning rate. The convergence of average training loss is compared for different quantized weight configurations, showing that weight-quantized networks have larger training losses than full-precision networks upon convergence. Weight-quantized networks have smaller final loss compared to full-precision networks. Test set accuracies are shown in TAB1. Using fewer bits for gradients results in larger final error and worse accuracy. However, the degradation is minimal when 4 bits are used, sometimes even outperforming full-precision gradients. In experiments on gradient clipping with different clipping factors, Cifarnet is used with weight quantization LAQ2 and gradient quantization SQ2. Adam optimizer is utilized with a decaying learning rate. Full-precision gradients before clipping follow a normal distribution. Average ratios of nonclipped and clipped gradients are compared over iterations. The dimensionalities of the Cifarnet layers vary, with larger layers having higher values for g t 2 / \u011d t 2. Clipped gradients result in smaller g t 2 / \u011d t 2 values, leading to faster training but larger final training loss. Gradient clipping shows faster convergence, especially with fewer gradient bits. In a distributed learning setting with weak scaling, varying the number of workers using Cifarnet BID29 shows that 2-bit quantized clipped gradient performs comparably to full-precision gradient. Testing accuracies are shown in TAB2, with observations similar to Section 4.2.4. AlexNet is trained on ImageNet following BID29 with the same data preprocessing. In this section, AlexNet is trained on ImageNet with 4-bit loss-aware weight quantization (LAQ4) and either full-precision or 3-bit quantized gradients (SQ3) using Adam as the optimizer. Weight-quantized networks show slightly lower accuracies compared to full-precision networks. Quantized clipped gradient performs better than non-clipped gradient, achieving similar accuracy to full-precision gradient. Distributed training of weight-quantized networks with quantized/full-precision gradient shows speedup compared to training with one worker using full-precision gradient. The performance model in BID29 combines profiling and communication modeling. The AllReduce communication model in BID22 speeds up training by reducing network communication. Quantizing gradients is faster than using full-precision gradients, especially when bandwidth is limited. In this paper, loss-aware weight-quantized networks with quantized gradients are studied for efficient communication in a distributed environment. Convergence analysis is provided for weight-quantized models with different types of gradients. Empirical experiments show that quantized networks can speed up training and perform similarly to full-precision networks. Lemma 2 discusses the update for loss-aware weight quantization when only weights are quantized. The proof shows the convexity of the function and the dot product between vectors x and y over all dimensions and iterations. The text discusses inequalities derived from Lemmas 1 and 2, weight quantization, and the average regret calculation in the context of loss-aware weight quantization. The optimal values and representable ranges are also considered in the calculations.

Denote the quantized gradient elements and their expectations, showing that E(g t ) = \u011d t . The variance of quantized gradients is also analyzed using Cauchy's inequality. The proof of Theorem 2 involves quantized weights and gradients, showing that the equality holds under certain conditions. The update process is similar to Theorem 1, utilizing Lemma 3 and Proposition 1 to derive the result."
