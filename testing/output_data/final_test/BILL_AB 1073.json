    "title": "AB 1073",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4076 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require pharmacists to dispense prescriptions only in properly labeled containers that meet state and federal law requirements. Pharmacists must dispense prescriptions in properly labeled containers as required by state and federal law. Prescriptions must include the drug name, directions for use, and patient's name. Abbreviations and multiple active ingredients can be used. When dispensing prescriptions, pharmacists must include the patient's name, prescriber's name, date of issue, pharmacy information, prescription number, drug strength, quantity, and expiration date. The expiration date of the drug, the condition for which it was prescribed, and the physical description of the medication must be included on the prescription label. This requirement applies to outpatient pharmacies only. If a pharmacist dispenses a drug using a unit dose medication system for a patient in a healthcare facility, the labeling requirements will be met if the system contains the necessary information or if it is readily available at the time of drug administration. This provision will not take effect if the board adopts similar labeling regulations before January 1, 2006. If a pharmacist dispenses a dangerous drug in a licensed facility, individual unit dose containers for a specific patient do not need to include the names of healthcare professionals who function under standardized procedures or protocols. If a pharmacist dispenses a prescription drug in a licensed facility, they do not need to include certain information when the drug is administered by licensed medical personnel. Pharmacists must use professional judgment to provide patients with directions that enhance their understanding, in line with the prescriber's instructions. Additionally, a new section 4076.6 is added to the Business and Professions Code. Section 4076.6 of the Business and Professions Code requires dispensers to provide translated directions for use upon patient request. Translations can be on the prescription container, label, or a supplemental document, with English-language versions whenever possible. Dispensers can use board-approved translations to comply with this section. A dispenser is not obligated to provide translations beyond what the board has made available. They can create their own translations to comply with the requirements. Dispensers are responsible for the accuracy of English directions provided to patients. Veterinarians are not included in this section. Section 4199 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require veterinary food-animal drugs dispensed by a licensed veterinarian to food producing animals to adhere to specific labeling requirements. All prescriptions filled by a veterinary food-animal drug retailer must be kept on file for at least three years. The amendment to Section 4199 of the Business and Professions Code imposes specific labeling requirements on veterinary food-animal drugs dispensed to food producing animals by licensed veterinarians. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
