    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Worker Protection Against Combustible Dust Explosions and Fires Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges the urgent need for worker protection against combustible dust explosions and fires, citing a significant risk of death or severe injury. The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) reported 281 incidents between 1980 and 2005, resulting in 119 deaths and 718 injuries. The CSB emphasized the seriousness of combustible dust explosions in American industry, with a quarter of incidents occurring in food industry facilities. In response, the CSB recommended that OSHA take action to address this hazard. OSHA issued a standard to prevent combustible dust fires and explosions in general industry, following a catastrophic explosion at Imperial Sugar in 2008. The explosion was fueled by a massive accumulation of sugar dust, leading to multiple secondary explosions throughout the factory. The CSB reiterated its recommendation for OSHA to address this hazard. OSHA was recommended in November 2006 to create a standard to reduce fire and explosion hazards from combustible powders and dust. Since the 2008 Imperial Sugar explosion, there have been 24 more incidents resulting in 4 deaths and 65 injuries. OSHA issued a notice in 2009, but a final rule may take 4 more years, risking further injuries or fatalities. OSHA issued a grain handling facilities standard in 1987 to reduce combustible grain dust explosions. There is no comprehensive OSHA standard addressing combustible dust explosion hazards in general industry. NFPA standards exist to reduce the likelihood and impact of combustible dust explosions through hazard assessment, housekeeping, static electricity control, employee training, and other requirements. Implementation of hazard control measures includes tools, employee training, inspection, maintenance, ignition source control, dust emission control technologies, and written safety programs. Employers often follow NFPA standards to address combustible dust hazards and involve employees in program implementation. Implementation of hazard control measures, including tools, training, inspection, and written safety programs, is feasible and would reduce risks related to combustible dust fires and explosions for workers. SEC. 3. ISSUANCE OF INTERIM STANDARD ON COMBUSTIBLE DUST. The Secretary of Labor must issue an interim final standard within one year of this Act's enactment, regulating occupational exposure to combustible dust hazards. The standard will apply to various industries handling combustible particulate solids and their dusts, excluding processes covered by the grain facilities safety standard. The interim final standard required by this Act will be based on National Fire Protection Association Standards and include hazard assessment, written programs for dust inspection, testing, ignition control, and housekeeping to control combustible dust hazards in existing facilities. Requirements for minimizing accumulations of combustible dust on surfaces, engineering controls, administrative controls, operating procedures, workplace inspection, housekeeping, employee participation in hazard assessment and compliance with written programs. The interim final standard required under this section includes requirements for written safety and health information, annual training, housekeeping procedures, hot work procedures, maintenance procedures, ignition sources, and lock-out procedures. Other statutory requirements do not apply to this interim standard. The interim final standard, effective 30 days after issuance, may have a phase-in period for engineering controls. It will be legally binding until a final standard is in place under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The Secretary of Labor must issue a proposed rule for regulating combustible dust explosions within 18 months of the interim final standard issuance. A final rule must be issued 3 years after the proposed rule."
