    "content": "Nearly half a million miles of high-volume pipelines in the United States transport natural gas, oil, and hazardous liquids, connecting to critical infrastructure like power plants and military bases. While efficient, these pipelines can pose risks due to the materials they carry and their vulnerability to accidents and attacks. Recent incidents in various locations have raised concerns about pipeline safety, which is primarily overseen by the Department of Transportation. The federal program for pipeline safety is primarily under the Department of Transportation (DOT) and works closely with state pipeline safety agencies. After 9/11, pipeline security authority was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which collaborates with DOT to protect the nation's pipelines. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is not directly involved in safety or security but can address safety issues for interstate natural gas pipelines. These agencies collectively administer a complex set of regulatory authorities. The federal pipeline safety program, authorized under the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, reviews the history of federal programs for pipeline safety and security. Approximately 180,000 miles of transmission pipeline carry hazardous liquids, including a significant portion of the nation's crude oil and refined petroleum products. The U.S. natural gas pipeline network consists of around 300,000 miles of inter state and intra state transmission, connecting gas extraction wells to processing facilities. There are 120 inter state gas transmission systems and 90 intra state systems, feeding regional pipelines and local distribution networks serving over 66 million customers. Additionally, there are 127 active liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage sites to augment pipeline gas supplies during peak demand periods. Pipeline releases, although causing few annual fatalities compared to other transportation modes, can result from various causes such as excavation, corrosion, mechanical failure, and natural forces. In 2011, there were 140 hazardous liquid pipeline accidents, 84 natural gas transmission accidents, and 58 natural gas distribution accidents. While relatively few in number, a single pipeline accident can have catastrophic consequences in terms of deaths and environmental damage. Notable recent pipeline accidents include a gasoline pipeline explosion in 1999. Notable recent pipeline accidents include a gasoline pipeline explosion in Bellingham, WA in 1999, a natural gas pipeline explosion near Carlsbad, NM in 2000, corroded pipelines leaking crude oil in Alaska in 2006, an accidental release from a propane pipeline near Carmichael, MS in 2007, a pipeline spill in Marshall, MI in 2010, a natural gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, CA in 2010, and a natural gas pipeline explosion in Allentown, PA in 2011. In 2011, a natural gas pipeline explosion in Allentown, PA killed 5 people, damaged 50 buildings, and caused 500 evacuations. Another incident in 2011 near Laurel, MT spilled 42,000 gallons of crude oil into the Yellowstone River. In 2012, a natural gas pipeline explosion in Springfield, MA injured 21 people and damaged over a dozen buildings. These accidents have raised concerns about pipeline safety and the potential for intentional damage by vandals and terrorists. Oil and gas pipelines globally are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and have been targeted by various groups, such as rebels in Colombia. In Colombia, rebels have bombed oil pipelines over 950 times since 1993. London police foiled a plot by the Irish Republican Army to bomb gas pipelines in 1996. Militants in Nigeria attacked pipelines in May 2007. A Mexican rebel group bombed oil and gas pipelines in 2007. In the US, a terrorist group planned to attack jet fuel pipelines at JFK Airport in 2007. Natural gas pipelines in Canada were bombed multiple times between 2008 and 2009. Over $1 billion of crude oil was stolen in 2009. In 2009, the Washington Post reported that over $1 billion of crude oil had been stolen from Mexican pipelines by organized criminals and drug cartels. Federal warnings since September 11, 2001, have mentioned pipelines as potential terror targets in the United States. The Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) is a U.S. pipeline of concern, delivering 600,000 barrels of oil per day in 2011. In 1999, a man was arrested for planning to blow up TAPS for personal profit. In 2001, a vandal's attack on TAPS caused a two-day shutdown and extensive damage. In 2006, Al Qaeda was linked to a website encouraging attacks on U.S. pipelines, including TAPS. A U.S. citizen was convicted in 2007 of conspiring with Al Qaeda to attack TAPS and a gas pipeline. Despite these incidents, there have been no known Al Qaeda attacks on U.S. pipelines. The latest federal threat assessment states that the terrorist threat to the U.S. pipeline industry is low, with no specific or credible threats identified. Terrorist attacks on U.S. pipelines remain a possibility, with concerns growing about attacks by individuals not associated with organized groups. Recent incidents include a U.S. citizen planting an explosive device under a pipeline in Oklahoma and another man injured while attempting to plant a device in Texas. SCADA system cybersecurity has also become a significant pipeline security risk, with cyber intrusions identified among U.S. natural gas pipeline operators since December 2011. In December 2011, U.S. natural gas pipeline operators reported spear-phishing attempts and intrusions linked to a coordinated cyberattack campaign. McAfee previously identified similar cyberattacks originating from China targeting global energy companies in 2009, using spear-phishing and exploiting software vulnerabilities. The Stuxnet worm, discovered in 2010, targeted specific Siemens industrial SCADA systems, posing a threat to industrial control systems. The increased vulnerability of pipeline SCADA systems due to modernization has led to the emergence of SCADA-specific malicious software, increasing cybersecurity threats to pipelines. The Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Act of 1979 established federal regulations for pipeline safety under the Transportation Secretary's authority. Pipeline safety regulations are governed by Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, administered by the DOT through the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) within PHMSA. PHMSA employs 203 staff, including 135 inspection and enforcement personnel. State offices can act as agents for interstate pipeline safety programs. The program is funded by user fees on regulated pipeline operators. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is responsible for regulating pipeline safety. Annual expenditures for pipeline safety programs have increased over the years, with the President's FY2013 budget requesting $177 million. PHMSA uses various strategies to ensure compliance with safety standards, including inspections, investigations, and enforcement actions. PHMSA enforces pipeline safety through various actions, including corrective orders and civil penalties. From January to November 2012, 244 enforcement actions were initiated, with $8.3 million in proposed penalties. PHMSA also conducts accident investigations and system-wide reviews, focusing on high-risk areas. Integrity management programs have been increasingly required since 1997 for pipeline segments near high consequence areas. The integrity management approach prioritizes evaluation, risk assessment, inspection, data analysis, and repair for pipelines in high consequence areas like population centers and environmentally sensitive areas. PHMSA mandated integrity management programs for oil pipeline operators with 500+ miles of regulated pipeline in 2001. Presidential Decision Directive 63 assigned pipeline security responsibility to the DOT, specifically the OPS under the DOT's Research and Special Programs Administration. In 2002, the OPS conducted a vulnerability assessment to identify critical pipeline facilities and worked with industry groups and state pipeline safety organizations to assess readiness for a terrorist attack. They promoted consensus standards for security measures tiered to threat warnings and developed protocols for inspections of critical facilities to ensure security practices were implemented. OPS also established communication links to key staff at critical pipeline facilities. The OPS established communication links with key staff at critical pipeline facilities and began identifying technology to enhance security measures. They circulated guidance for security program recommendations and implementation expectations, urging operators to develop security plans and review them annually. Compliance was expected, with the OPS planning to review security programs within 12 months. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-355) strengthened federal pipeline safety programs, required risk analysis for natural gas pipelines in high-consequence areas, and increased penalties for violations. It also authorized safety actions for problematic pipelines and streamlined emergency restoration permitting. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-355) established an interagency committee to coordinate pipeline repairs and study ways to limit safety risks. The Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (PIPES Act, P.L. 109-468) focused on pipeline damage prevention, integrity management, corrosion control, and enforcement transparency. The PIPES Act of 2006 created a national focus on pipeline damage prevention through grants to states, established 811 as the national \"call before you dig\" number, and gave PHMSA limited enforcement authority. It also mandated minimum standards for integrity management programs and increased transparency of enforcement actions. In November 2001, President Bush signed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (P.L. 107-71) creating the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the DOT. The act transferred TSA from the DOT to the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. President Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in 2003, clarifying responsibilities for protecting critical infrastructure. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) designates DHS as the lead agency for pipeline security and instructs collaboration with private sector entities to protect critical infrastructure. TSA is involved in coordinating critical infrastructure protection programs in the energy and transportation sectors. HSPD-7 also mandates the development of a national plan for critical infrastructure and key resources protection. The TSA issued the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) in 2006, requiring each critical infrastructure sector to develop a Sector Specific Plan (SSP) for protection. Executive Order 13416 mandated the transportation sector SSP to prepare annexes for each mode of surface transportation. The TSA's Transportation Systems Sector Specific Plan and Pipeline Modal Annex were issued in 2007 with an update in 2010. Pipeline security activities at TSA are led by the Pipeline Security Division (PSD) within the agency's Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement (OSPIE). In addition to specific pipeline security initiatives, TSA has conducted regional supply studies, cyber security training, blast mitigation studies, and participated in multinational security assessments. The Corporate Security Review program evaluates pipeline operators' security plans and critical facilities. In 2004, the DOT reported that plans for pipeline security were responsive to OPS guidance. TSA completed Corporate Security Reviews (CSRs) for the largest 100 pipeline systems, finding areas for improvement. The Critical Facility Inspection Program (CFI) was initiated in 2008 to inspect critical facilities of the 125 largest pipeline systems in the U.S. The TSA concluded the Critical Facility Inspection Program in May 2011 after inspecting 600 critical facilities of the 125 largest pipeline systems in the US. They also established qualifications for personnel with access to critical pipeline assets and addressed legal issues related to terrorist attacks. Additionally, TSA issued security guidelines for pipeline operators in 2005 and revised them later. The TSA released revised pipeline security guidelines in 2010 and 2011, including a section on cybersecurity developed with the help of Johns Hopkins University. The President's FY2012 budget did not have a separate line item for TSA's pipeline security activities, but included funding for \"Surface Transportation Security,\" which covers security in non-aviation modes like pipelines. The PSD receives budget allocation for routine operations and funds 13 full-time staff. In 2007, the TSA Administrator testified about conducting pipeline security activities. In 2007, the TSA Administrator testified before Congress about conducting a pipeline infrastructure study to identify high-risk assets and develop baseline risk standards. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 requires TSA to develop a plan for increased security support for critical pipelines during high security alert levels or specific threats. Recovery protocol plans are also mandated for incidents affecting the pipeline system. The TSA Pipeline Security Division published a plan in 2010 for incidents affecting the pipeline system. They have conducted vulnerability assessments and supported investigations for potential terrorist activity. The division was involved in investigating a security breach at an LNG plant in 2006 and supported the FBI in the JFK airport terrorist plot. The TSA Pipeline Security Division worked with the private sector to assess potential targets and consequences. They collaborated with a pipeline company to discuss security practices and emergency response plans. A study by the Government Accountability Office focused on TSA's efforts to improve pipeline security under the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. TSA implemented a risk management approach but more work was needed to ensure the highest risk areas were addressed. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that TSA needed to prioritize pipeline security efforts and ensure high-risk systems received necessary scrutiny. TSA was missing opportunities to enhance pipeline security through its programs and recommendations. GAO suggested linking TSA's performance measures to national security goals for better oversight. TSA agreed with GAO's recommendations and has been implementing them. The siting approval of new gas pipelines falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), not PHMSA or TSA. FERC issues certificates for interstate natural gas pipelines and approves abandonment of gas facilities. FERC may include safety and security provisions in its approvals, but traditionally leaves these considerations to other agencies. After 9/11, FERC allowed recovery of costs to safeguard energy systems. FERC prioritized processing security cost recovery requests from oil and natural gas pipelines post-9/11 attacks. They allowed companies to propose surcharges to recover costs for safeguarding the nation's energy infrastructure. FERC also promulgated a rule in 2003 to protect critical energy infrastructure information. The rule defines critical energy infrastructure information (CEII) as data related to critical infrastructure that could be useful to terrorists and is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. It includes existing and proposed systems and assets that, if destroyed, would impact security, economic security, public health, or safety. CEII excludes location information and establishes procedures for public access. FERC issued new rules in 2003 (RM03-4) to expedite pipeline restoration after a terrorist attack, allowing immediate rebuilding under blanket certificate authority. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates transportation accidents, including pipeline accidents, and issues safety recommendations to prevent similar incidents. Despite lacking regulatory authority, the NTSB's recommendations are highly regarded for their thoroughness and expertise. The NTSB, known for its thoroughness and objectivity, has an average acceptance rate of 78% for safety recommendations. In 2013, the \"Most Wanted List\" called for enhanced pipeline safety. Following the San Bruno Pipeline accident, the NTSB issued critical findings and recommendations, highlighting issues with the pipeline operator and safety regulators. The NTSB found systemic problems in PG&E's pipeline safety program and criticized both state and federal regulators for failing to detect deficiencies. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration's inspection protocols were deemed inadequate, and the use of metrics for performance-based management programs was recommended for improvement. NTSB Chairman Hersman highlighted these issues in the San Bruno accident report. The NTSB Chairman criticized the lax oversight system and government agencies in the San Bruno accident report. The NTSB found weaknesses in PHMSA's enforcement program and state oversight, leading to a lack of effective oversight. 39 recommendations were issued, including audits to assess PHMSA's oversight and requiring pipeline operators to provide specific information for emergency response. Requiring pipeline operators to provide system-specific information to emergency response agencies, installing automatic shutoff valves in high consequence areas, conducting hydrostatic pressure tests on pre-1970 pipelines, accommodating internal inspection tools for all pipelines, and revising integrity management protocols with performance goals and regular assessments. Detailed accident findings and NTSB recommendations are available in the final report. The NTSB's recommendations from the final accident report are publicly available. The 112th Congress reauthorized the federal pipeline safety program and implemented new safety provisions. The 113th Congress may focus on key issues in pipeline safety oversight. The U.S. pipeline safety program utilizes federal and state staff for enforcement, with criticism on inspector staffing levels at PHMSA. The President's FY2013 budget request listed PHMSA's estimated staffing in 2013 as 290 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs), up from 206 funded staff in 2010. The addition of 10 inspection and enforcement staff under P.L. 112-90 represents a modest continuation of staff growth initiated in response to various incidents and regulatory expansions. The optimal number of PHMSA pipeline safety staff by 2014 remains uncertain. The President's FY2013 budget request for PHMSA included 290 FTEs, with most additions likely to be inspectors. However, there have been challenges in filling and retaining these positions due to a history of understaffing in the agency's pipeline safety program since 1994. The FY2010 budget request for PHMSA expected 191 employees in 2009, but only 175 were reported. There has been a staffing shortfall averaging 23 employees annually from 2001 to 2011, mainly among inspectors. In 2010, only 110 out of 137 funded inspectors were employed, and by 2012, 135 inspectors were employed out of 203 total staff. PHMSA attributes the historical staffing shortage to various reasons. The historical shortfall in inspector staffing at PHMSA is attributed to reasons such as a scarcity of qualified applicants, delays in the federal hiring process, and inspector turnover to pipeline companies. PHMSA aggressively recruits a diverse workforce but faces challenges from industry recruitment, especially with the high demand for engineers in the unconventional oil and gas shales sector. PHMSA faces staffing shortages due to various reasons such as a lack of qualified applicants and delays in the hiring process. The agency relies on FTE salary funding to meet obligations, and a report on staffing shortfalls required by P.L. 112-90 is pending. State agencies play a significant role in pipeline safety inspections, and budget cuts may impact the number of state inspectors. PHMSA can provide grants to states for up to 80% of the costs related to the federal pipeline safety program. The Department of Transportation (DOT) provides grants to support the federal pipeline safety program, enabling states to maintain their programs and hire additional inspectors. Despite these grants, state pipeline safety agencies have faced staffing shortages due to budget deficits, leading to furloughs and unfilled positions. PHMSA officials have expressed concerns about the erosion of the state pipeline safety workforce. The financial problems among state pipeline safety agencies are a major concern for senior DOT officials. States have been granted waivers from certain regulatory financial requirements to access federal grant money, but the future availability of state pipeline safety inspectors is uncertain. Congress is concerned about the possibility of states ending their roles in the federal pipeline safety program, which could shift more responsibility for inspections back to the federal government. Additionally, there are ongoing concerns about the resources available to implement the nation's pipeline security program. The nation's pipeline security program is facing challenges due to limited resources and staffing. Congress has expressed concerns about the lack of attention and funding for pipeline security compared to aviation security. TSA's Pipeline Security Division, with only 13 FTEs, has limited field presence and conducts security reviews with minimal staff. Despite focusing on the largest operators, there are still concerns about the effectiveness of security inspections. The TSA and PHMSA are facing challenges in the federal pipeline security program due to limited resources. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the agency's security plan verification and enforcement. Congress is concerned about the division of pipeline security authority between the two agencies. The TSA and PHMSA have a 24/7 communication relationship for pipeline security incidents. Concerns have been raised about the alignment of staff resources between the two agencies. Legislation has been proposed to study the roles of DHS and DOT in pipeline security. The initial explosion led to gas flowing from the pipeline for nearly two hours, fueling a intense fire and hindering emergency response. Delays in manually closing valves by the operator, along with inadequate employee training, prolonged the flow. Advocates suggest installing remotely or automatically controlled valves in pipelines, as recommended by the NTSB and required by P.L. 112-90 for transmission pipeline facilities. The Act requires a study on transmission pipeline operators' ability to respond to releases in high-consequence areas. Congress previously considered requiring remotely controlled valves for natural gas pipelines after a 1994 incident. The DOT conducted an assessment on remotely controlled valves (RCVs) for gas pipelines, finding that while RCVs can reduce risk, they are not economically feasible. Despite lacking data on their effectiveness in reducing property damage, the study recommended deploying RCVs in certain locations to improve safety perception. The DOT conducted an assessment on remotely controlled valves (RCVs) for gas pipelines, finding that while RCVs can reduce risk, they are not economically feasible. The potential consequences of gas pipeline ruptures include intense fires with significant damage to surrounding infrastructure. Despite the benefits of RCVs in minimizing these risks, the DOT has not mandated their use in natural gas transmission pipelines. Some pipeline operators oppose widespread installation of automatic valves due to cost concerns, reliability issues, and potential disruptions to fuel supplies. They argue that these valves may not prevent explosions and could lead to unnecessary shutdowns. Maintenance costs for non-manually operated valves are also a concern. The NTSB has long advocated for the use of remotely controlled or automatic valves on hazardous liquid pipelines since the 1970s. The Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 mandated the assessment of emergency flow restricting devices, including remote-operated valves, on these pipelines. The NTSB found the DOT's efforts to promote emergency flow restricting devices inadequate, leaving the decision to install them up to pipeline operators. Cost is a major factor in retrofitting manual valves with automatic valves, with over 30,000 valves in the nation's gas transmission system. In October 2010, PG&E identified 300 valves in 565 miles of high-consequence area pipelines in California that could be automated. Retrofitting manual valves with automatic ones can vary in cost, with estimates ranging from $32,000 to $83,000 per valve. The cost of retrofitting manual valves with automatic ones on large diameter pipelines ranges from $100,000 to $1.5 million per valve. The American Gas Association estimates a nationwide cost of $12 billion for replacing manual valves with automatic valves, potentially leading to increased rates for natural gas transportation. Gas pipeline service interruptions could also occur, especially in heavily populated areas. The retrofitting of manual valves with automatic ones on pipelines could lead to significant costs and service interruptions. The hazardous liquids pipeline industry may also face similar challenges if a widespread valve retrofit is required. Additional costs, environmental impacts, and construction accidents could be considerations. Installing remotely controlled or automatic valves on new pipelines could lower costs but still increase future expenses. A safety study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory highlighted the benefits of remotely controlled and automatic pipeline shutoff valves. The study concluded that installing valves on natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines can effectively mitigate potential fire damage if leaks are detected and valves are closed within a specific time frame. Fire hydrants must also be accessible near the leak for firefighting activities to begin promptly. The Oak Ridge study suggests that adding automatic closure capability to block valves in hazardous liquid pipelines can help mitigate potential damage from releases that do not ignite. However, for this strategy to be effective, it must be combined with rapid emergency response and investments in SCADA systems for leak detection improvement. The lack of remotely-operable valves and reliance on keeping the pipeline system operating control the quantity of product released after a rupture. SCADA system and leak detection subsystem are crucial for minimizing product release. NTSB report on a 1996 pipeline accident highlighted delays in recognizing ruptures due to system dynamics and SCADA design. Converting manual valves to automatic may require accounting for SCADA changes and leak detection costs. Converting manual valves to automatic may require accounting for SCADA changes, leak detection systems, and associated training costs. P.L. 112-90 mandates a DOT analysis of leak detection system limitations and the feasibility of setting standards. The DOT released a study in December 2012, providing data on technical and cost aspects without specific conclusions or recommendations. The agency may issue new leak detection standards if deemed \"practicable\" after congressional review. Increased reliance on SCADA systems poses reliability and security risks to pipeline systems from software failure or cyberterrorism. The DOT has not indicated plans to develop new leak detection standards based on a recent report. Stakeholders believe that public perception of improved pipeline safety is a significant benefit of automatic valves. Public perception plays a crucial role in pipeline design, expansion, and regulation, with challenges in gaining public acceptance for energy infrastructure projects. The National Commission on Energy Policy highlighted the challenge of energy-facility siting in the US due to public opposition, leading to delays and increased costs for pipeline projects. The Energy Information Administration noted that public resistance has stalled approved projects in the Northeast. For example, the Millennium Pipeline faced a nine-year delay due to community opposition to its route. Numerous proposed pipelines, especially in populated areas, have encountered similar challenges. The public perception value of remotely controlled or automatic pipeline valves may impact pipeline development and operations. The controversy surrounding the Keystone XL pipeline project exemplifies how public opinion can influence major pipeline projects, despite federal siting authority. Community stakeholders have avenues to affect energy infrastructure decisions, even for interstate natural gas pipelines. The technology of automatic valves applies to both large transmission pipelines and smaller gas distribution lines. Excess flow valves in natural gas distribution systems can automatically shut off pipeline flow in case of a leak, reducing the risk of fire or explosion. New standards require these valves in new gas distribution lines in single-family homes. Legislation allows for regulation mandating these valves in new or replaced distribution branch pipelines, service lines to multi-family residential buildings, and small commercial facilities. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 increased scrutiny on PHMSA's enforcement strategy and civil penalties. In 2005, $4.6 million in penalties were proposed, three times more than in 2003. PHMSA aimed for a \"tough-but-fair\" approach, guiding pipeline operators to improve performance. Proposed penalties were $4.5 million in 2010 and $3.7 million in 2011. Proposed penalties increased from $4.5 million in 2010 to $3.7 million in 2011, with an average penalty of $65,500. P.L. 112-90 raised the maximum civil penalty to $2.0 million for major consequence violations. The impact of federal penalties on operator compliance with pipeline safety regulations is uncertain. Pipeline companies prioritize safe operations for financial reasons. Pipeline companies prioritize safe operations for financial reasons, including potential PHMSA penalties, fines for environmental violations, spill response costs, civil litigation penalties, lost product value, and repair expenses. For example, Kinder Morgan spent $26 million to resolve a corrective action order for hazardous liquid spills in 2004 and 2005. Kinder Morgan agreed to spend $26 million on integrity management activities and pay $5.3 million in penalties for environmental violations related to spills releasing 200,000 gallons of fuel. Plains All American Pipeline agreed to upgrade 10,420 miles of oil pipeline for $41 million to resolve Clean Water Act violations for 10 crude oil spills. Enbridge Energy Partners faced expenses of $475 million to clean up oil spills on its Lakehead pipeline system in 2010, with additional costs for fines and penalties. The company also reported $16 million in lost revenue due to the pipeline system being out of service. Enbridge stated that most costs from the 2010 oil spills will be covered by insurance. Olympic Pipe Line settled for $75 million after a 1999 accident. El Paso settled lawsuits from a 2000 pipeline explosion, with costs covered by insurance. Safety enforcement penalties are a key tool for pipeline safety. Pipeline safety regulators rely on enforcement penalties to ensure operator compliance with safety requirements. Increasing fines may not have a significant impact on operator compliance, but direct authority to influence pipeline operations, such as corrective action or shutdown orders, can have a substantial financial impact. This operational authority is considered the most influential component of PHMSA's pipeline safety enforcement strategy. Congress may evaluate how PHMSA's authorities to set standards, assess penalties, and directly affect pipeline operations may reinforce one another to improve U.S. pipeline safety. Canadian oil exports to the United States have been increasing rapidly, primarily due to growing output from the oil sands in Western Canada, which are processed to extract bitumen for pipeline transport. The oil sands in Western Canada produce heavy crude oil, with most growth expected in diluted form for easier transport. Several pipelines connect the region to U.S. markets, with the controversial Keystone XL pipeline facing approval challenges. Concerns include risks to pipeline integrity when transporting heavy Canadian crudes. Opponents, like the NRDC, argue that new Canadian oil pipelines carrying corrosive bitumen mixtures could be more prone to failure and environmental damage. They call for a moratorium on new pipelines until safety concerns are addressed. Canadian officials and stakeholders refute these claims, citing inaccuracies in the NRDC analysis. Congress is considering a review of PHMSA regulations in response. Congress is calling for a review of PHMSA regulations to assess the need for new regulations for Canadian heavy crudes. P.L. 112-90 mandates PHMSA to evaluate if current regulations are adequate for pipelines transmitting \"diluted bitumen\" and to determine if this type of oil poses a higher risk of release. The study is being conducted by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences. PHMSA has relied on voluntary industry compliance with security guidance to enhance pipeline security measures and avoid disclosing sensitive information. The DOT Inspector General and TSA are required by specific laws to address the adequacy of security standards for gas and oil pipelines. TSA's current security guidance is not enforceable without regulations, and covert tests of pipeline systems' vulnerabilities are needed to assess compliance. Despite plans to issue regulations for non-aviation transportation modes, TSA has not done so for pipelines. The pipeline industry has concerns that new security regulations may be redundant and unnecessary for increasing pipeline security. TSA officials have questioned the need for covert testing of pipeline operator security measures, stating that they are complying with regulations and conducting thorough pipeline system inspections as required by law. The TSA believes in voluntary guidelines for pipeline security, maintaining a cooperative relationship with industry partners. However, Canadian regulators have mandated security regulations for Canadian pipelines, including those serving export markets in the U.S. Companies operating in both countries are affected by these regulations. The Canadian regulators have mandated security regulations for Canadian pipelines, including those serving export markets in the U.S. Canada's choice to regulate pipeline security may raise questions as to why the United States has not. Congress may evaluate the effectiveness of the current voluntary pipeline security standards based on findings from various reviews and reports. The NTSB issued urgent safety recommendations in response to the San Bruno pipeline accident, highlighting record-keeping issues that could lead to unsafe pipeline operations. PHMSA officials also noted concerns about operators not collecting necessary data for safety evaluations. In 2006, concerns were raised about the accuracy of pipeline location data in the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). P.L. 112-90 authorizes PHMSA to collect additional data from operators to improve NPMS accuracy. Congress may consider increasing requirements for pipeline operators to conduct internal inspections using \"smart pigs\" for older parts of the pipeline network. The NTSB recommends using internal inspection tools like smart pigs for natural gas transmission pipelines, but experts highlight limitations in detecting all pipeline anomalies. Smart pigs are effective for corrosion detection but may be less reliable for other issues like cracks. Operators suggest that direct assessment methods may be more useful for predicting future pipeline integrity problems. Some industry stakeholders caution against unrealistic expectations for smart pigs as a stand-alone pipeline inspection tool due to limitations in detecting all pipeline anomalies. As an alternative, policy makers have called for mandatory hydrostatic testing of pipelines to verify their integrity by filling them with water under pressure greater than the anticipated operating pressure. Hydrostatic testing is common for new pipelines and recommended for older ones. It involves filling pipelines with water under pressure to verify integrity. Despite being costly and causing service interruptions, it is necessary for safety. The NTSB recommends testing for pipelines built before 1970, and regulations require verification of maximum allowable operating pressure for all natural gas transmission pipelines. Congress may consider smart pig devices and hydrostatic testing as part of a range of maintenance practices for pipeline inspection. Operators are required to prepare emergency response plans for spills, but some stakeholders suggest making these plans public for better risk and response information. Operators have concerns about disclosing confidential information in these plans. The plans contain confidential customer and employee information, as well as security-sensitive details about pipeline vulnerabilities and spill scenarios. Congress may need to balance public awareness with pipeline security, especially in environments with significant safety and security hazards. The 2011 oil spill in the Yellowstone River was caused by the exposed oil pipeline during heavy flooding, despite the operator verifying the pipeline depth beforehand. Some policy makers are calling for a review of pipeline river crossings and safety requirements nationwide after a pipeline was found to be at least five feet below the riverbed, exceeding the four-foot minimum cover requirement in regulations. P.L. 112-90 mandates a review of PHMSA regulations for pipelines crossing inland bodies of water at least 100 feet wide, with legislative recommendations to be developed based on the findings. Despite efforts to improve pipeline safety, major incidents since 2010 indicate ongoing concerns. Despite efforts to improve pipeline safety, major incidents since 2010 suggest significant room for improvement. The NTSB and industry associations have identified federal oversight as a top priority, with a focus on safety improvements and addressing cyber and physical threats to U.S. pipeline infrastructure. The renewed efforts by industry and federal agencies aim to enhance the safety and security of U.S. pipelines. Congress may focus on key issues such as staff resources, shutoff valves, safety violations penalties, regulations for oil sands crudes, and the need for pipeline security regulations. Various groups including federal agencies, pipeline associations, operators, and communities are involved in pipeline safety and security efforts. The collaboration between pipeline operators, federal agencies, and local communities in achieving common safety and security goals may pose an oversight challenge for Congress."
