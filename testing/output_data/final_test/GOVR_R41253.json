The Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) program provides benefits to self-employed individuals who are eligible for unemployment benefits. SEA pays a weekly allowance identical to regular UC benefits, but waives the requirement to actively seek wage and salary jobs. Participants engage in self-employment activities and must meet additional criteria to qualify for SEA allowances. The Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) program is one of three programs within UC that focuses on reemploying UC beneficiaries. SEA aims to help individuals who are eligible for unemployment benefits through self-employment. In contrast to the job-sharing and profiling programs, SEA offers an alternative route out of unemployment by providing a weekly allowance to self-employed individuals. The Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) program, created in 1993, offers an alternative route out of unemployment through self-employment. Participation is low due to budget neutrality requirements. The program is financed by federal and state payroll taxes and limits the number of participants to 5% of all UC beneficiaries. The Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) program, established in 1993, allows certain claimants in Extended Benefit (EB) and now-expired Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) programs to engage in full-time activities related to starting a business. Participants do not need to actively search for jobs and must meet specific eligibility requirements. Additionally, P.L. 112-96 provided grants to states for establishing or improving SEA programs for UC, EB, or EUC08 claimants. The Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) program allows certain claimants in Extended Benefit (EB) and now-expired Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) programs to engage in entrepreneurial activities. Participants identified as likely to exhaust UC benefits can receive SEA allowances, which are equivalent to their regular UC benefits. Participants in state SEA programs are not eligible for additional benefits from the EUC08 or EB programs. Under P.L. 112-96, SEA allowances for certain EB and EUC08 claimants may be available in states with SEA programs. In 2016, 10 states have active SEA programs for UC claimants. Nationally, 6.4% of workers are self-employed. Participation in SEA is low, with less than 1% of UC claimants involved. Participation in SEA programs for UC claimants is low, with less than 1% involved. States with active SEA programs must ensure budget neutrality and provide entrepreneurial training and business counseling to participants. Most state unemployment agencies partner with relevant agencies or Small Business Development Centers for SEA training and services. Participation in SEA programs for UC claimants is low due to capped participation and the need for states to find funding for program administration and training. Individual-level barriers, such as ineligibility for other unemployment benefits and the challenging economic climate, also contribute to low participation rates. The recent recession and economic challenges make it difficult to start a new business, leading to low participation in SEA programs for UC claimants. In 2015, only 2,217 individuals nationwide participated in SEA programs. States can establish SEA programs for individuals with at least 13 weeks of remaining benefit entitlement and who are engaged in entrepreneurial training activities. Authorization is required for setting up SEA programs for EB claimants, with a minimum expectation of 13 weeks of remaining entitlement. States may no longer set up SEA programs for EUC08 claimants due to program expiration. Participation in SEA programs for EB claimants is capped at 1% in each state. SEA benefits for EB claimants are equivalent to UC benefits and exempt from work requirements. P.L. 112-96 allocated $35 million in SEA grant funding for FY2012 and FY2013. The U.S. DOL allocated $35 million in SEA grant funding for states to improve administration of UC, EB, or EUC08 programs and enroll eligible individuals. Prior to SEA authorization, self-employment demonstration projects in Massachusetts and Washington showed positive outcomes, increasing self-employment likelihood and participant employment duration. The Massachusetts program structure became the model for future SEA programs. The Massachusetts program served as a model for the SEA program authorization, proving cost-effective in promoting reemployment. A 2001 evaluation of state SEA programs in Maine, New Jersey, and New York showed that SEA participants were more likely to be self-employed and find employment compared to eligible non-participants. SEA program participants were four times more likely to obtain employment compared to eligible non-participants. Participants reported high satisfaction with self-employment and training. Limitations include the lack of a randomized design and the study being conducted during low unemployment. Project GATE was a federally funded project aimed at helping individuals start or expand their own businesses through self-employment training and services. It was implemented in seven sites across three states between 2003 and 2005. The program targeted a wider population interested in entrepreneurship, not just those likely to exhaust unemployment benefits. An impact analysis on a subgroup of recent unemployment benefit claimants in Minnesota showed both positive and negative outcomes for Project GATE participants. Participation in Project GATE increased the probability of owning a business and being employed for recent UC benefit claimants. However, participants earned less in wage and salary jobs and no more in self-employment than non-participants. The program also increased the duration of unemployment benefit receipt by about three weeks for recent benefit claimants."
