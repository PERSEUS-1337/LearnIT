    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Underserved Adult and Adolescent Immunization Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that despite record levels of childhood immunization in the 1990s, disparities in coverage still exist in high-poverty areas. There is a need to increase immunization rates for underserved adults and adolescents, who are not receiving necessary vaccines such as influenza, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, chickenpox, and meningitis. The United States lacks a comprehensive flu vaccination plan, leading to shortages and high prices. The distribution system prioritizes lower-risk populations, leaving out vulnerable groups like the elderly and sick who could benefit the most from immunization. Vaccine-preventable diseases in adults, such as influenza, cause thousands of deaths each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that pneumonia and influenza are the fifth leading cause of death among older adults, with over 90 percent of deaths occurring in individuals aged 65 years and older. The overall cost to society from these vaccine-preventable diseases exceeds $10 billion per year. Federal resources for immunizations have decreased over the last five years, creating uncertainty in State and local planning efforts. State health departments are facing challenges in monitoring the effectiveness of immunizations due to the majority of vaccines being delivered in private health care facilities. State health departments are struggling to monitor immunization effectiveness due to vaccines being mainly delivered in private health care facilities, leading to challenges in data collection and strategic planning efforts. Program for increasing immunization rates for adults and adolescents; collection of additional immunization data. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are authorized to receive $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 to increase immunization rates for adults and adolescents. Priority will be given to medically underserved individuals at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are authorized to receive $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 to increase immunization rates for adults and adolescents, with priority given to medically underserved individuals at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Amounts appropriated include payment for storing vaccines, outreach activities, and program expenses for immunization programs. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress evaluating the effectiveness of the immunization system in the United States. The Secretary is responsible for assessing the health status of the US population and identifying any issues that may impact immunization rates. The Secretary will also consider recommendations from the Institute of Medicine regarding immunizations. Additionally, there will be a program for research, demonstration projects, and education to support immunization efforts. The Secretary will coordinate with public and private entities to ensure immunizations are offered to adults and adolescents. They will also collect data on diseases and adverse events to increase awareness. The Secretary will work with various organizations to ensure immunizations are provided to adults and adolescents. Data on diseases and adverse events will be collected to raise awareness and identify minority groups with low immunization rates. The Secretary will collaborate with organizations to provide immunizations to adults and adolescents, collecting data on diseases and adverse events to raise awareness and identify minority groups with low immunization rates. Factors underlying disparities in immunization rates will be determined for the general population."
