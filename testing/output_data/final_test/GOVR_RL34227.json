    "content": "The USDA forecasts record high U.S. agricultural exports of $91 billion in FY2008, with imports reaching $75.5 billion. High value exports like wheat flour and fruits are outpacing bulk commodity exports. Agricultural exports are crucial for farmers and the U.S. economy. USDA estimates that 21-23% of U.S. agricultural production is exported, with exports accounting for almost half of wheat production, over one-third of soybeans, and a fifth of corn. Specialty crops like almonds have a 70% export share. Livestock products have a lower export share. Agricultural exports generate employment, income, and purchasing power in both farm and nonfarm sectors, stimulating additional supporting activities. Agricultural exports generate an estimated 806,000 full-time civilian jobs. Agricultural exports generate 806,000 full-time civilian jobs, influenced by various factors like income, population growth, and trade agreements. Farm bills include programs to support and promote U.S. agricultural exports. The farm bill authorizes agricultural export programs administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service of the USDA. The House and Senate bills reauthorize these programs with increased funding until 2012. They also include new authority for initiatives to strengthen U.S. participation in international food standard-setting organizations and challenge unfair trade barriers. The Senate passed its version of the 2007 farm bill on December 14, 2007, while the House passed its version on July 27, 2007. The farm bills for 2008-2012 include a trade title authorizing USDA agricultural export programs and international food aid programs. They align with WTO rules, increase funding for export market promotion, and address barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. Additionally, the bills support fruit, vegetable, and tree nut producers with increased federal support for production and marketing activities. The USDA's export credit guarantee programs, in partnership with the Farm Service Agency, aim to facilitate exports of U.S. agricultural products by guaranteeing payments for commercial financing. The GSM-102 program specifically guarantees repayment of short-term financing to eligible countries purchasing U.S. farm products. The USDA's export credit guarantee programs aim to facilitate exports of U.S. agricultural products by guaranteeing payments for commercial financing. The programs include GSM-103 for financing up to 10 years, SCGP for short-term deferred payments, and FGP for improving agriculture-related facilities in emerging markets. The 2002 farm bill authorizes export credit guarantees of $5.5 billion annually through FY2007. The USDA's export credit guarantee programs provide $5.5 billion worth of agricultural export guarantees annually through FY2007. In FY2006, $1.4 billion of U.S. agricultural exports were guaranteed. These programs have been a subject of dispute in the WTO, with a ruling in 2005 that certain programs were considered prohibited subsidies. The dispute settlement panel recommended the US to remove adverse effects of subsidies on various commodities, leading to the suspension of GSM-103 in 2006. The effectiveness of credit guarantee programs was questioned, with OMB finding them moderately effective and noting substantial defaults, leading to the suspension of SCGP in 2006. Proposed changes in CCC export credit guarantee programs aimed to bring them into compliance with findings. The Administration proposed changes to CCC export credit guarantee programs to comply with WTO findings, including removing the 1% cap on fees for GSM-102 and eliminating GSM-103 and SGCP. USDA also suggested repealing SGCP due to defaults and fraud. The FGP would be modified to attract buyers of U.S. agricultural products. Both versions of the farm bill support these changes. The GSM-103 and SGCP programs are being repealed, and the 1% cap on origination fees for GSM guarantees is being removed. The GSM-102 program is extended through FY2012. The Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) provide direct export subsidies for agricultural products. EEP was established in 1985 to combat unfair trading practices in world agricultural markets. DEIP spending averaged $18 million per year under the 2002 farm bill. The General Sales Manager administers EEP, a program established in 1985 to combat unfair trading practices in world agricultural markets. EEP subsidies have mainly been used to assist sales of wheat, with three exporting firms receiving almost half of the total subsidies from 1985 to 1995. The United States agreed to reduce its agricultural export subsidies under the 1994 WTO Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and advocates for the elimination of all agricultural export subsidies in ongoing multilateral trade negotiations. DEIP, established in 1985 to assist exports of U.S. dairy products, aims to counter the adverse effects of foreign dairy export subsidies, particularly those of the European Union. EEP and DEIP have been controversial since their inception. The EEP program, along with DEIP, has been controversial since its establishment. Critics argue that EEP interferes with market operations and distorts trade, while others believe it is necessary as long as competitors use export subsidies. Studies show mixed results on the effectiveness of EEP, with some suggesting it increased wheat exports while others found it displaced exports of unsubsidized grains. DEIP, which supports dairy product exports, has strong congressional support despite opposition similar to EEP. OMB evaluated the effectiveness of EEP and DEIP, finding them moderately effective in countering export subsidies. DEIP successfully offset EU export subsidies for dairy products to Mexico. The Administration proposed repealing EEP, citing its inactivity and minimal impact on U.S. agricultural exports. The Administration proposed repealing the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) due to its inactivity and minimal impact on U.S. agricultural exports. The Senate farm bill calls for the repeal of EEP, while the House bill extends its authority through FY2012. Both bills also extend the authorization for the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) through FY2012. The 2002 farm bill includes funding for programs like the Market Access Program (MAP) to promote U.S. agricultural products in overseas markets. The Market Access Program (MAP) promotes value-added products through advertising, market research, technical assistance, and trade servicing. Nonprofit industry organizations and private firms can participate on a cost-share basis. MAP funds support generic and brand-name promotions, with small businesses eligible for branded promotions. MAP is exempt from WTO export subsidy reduction commitments and authorized through FY2007 with a funding cap of $90 million. The 2002 farm bill authorizes the Market Access Program (MAP) funding to increase to $200 million for FY2006 and FY2007. It also reauthorizes funding for the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP) at $34.5 million annually through FY2007. FMDP promotes generic or bulk commodities for U.S. agricultural exports through activities like consumer promotions and market research. Projects under FMDP are jointly funded by the government and industry groups, with the government reimbursing the industry organization after project completion. The Emerging Markets Program (EMP) provides funding for technical assistance to promote exports of U.S. agricultural commodities and products. The Emerging Markets Program (EMP) aims to promote exports of U.S. agricultural commodities to emerging markets with specific criteria for eligibility. Funding for EMP is set at $10 million annually through FY2007. The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) provides funds to address barriers for U.S. specialty crop exporters. The 2002 farm bill defines specialty crops as cultivated plants produced in the United States, excluding certain commodities. The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program addresses barriers for U.S. specialty crop exporters through various activities. There is debate over whether federal government involvement in export programs like MAP and FMDP is necessary, with some viewing it as corporate welfare while others argue it benefits foreign consumers. The effectiveness of market development programs like MAP and FMDP is debated, with some arguing they benefit foreign consumers while others suggest funds could be better spent educating U.S. firms on exporting. OMB reviews found the programs moderately effective but questioned their necessity, noting that some recipients receive corporate funding and could support their own export efforts. However, the TASC program has successfully reduced barriers to U.S. agricultural exports, such as opening Taiwan's apple market to U.S. apples. The Administration proposed a $250 increase in mandatory funding for MAP. The Administration proposed increasing funding for market development programs like MAP and TASC to address inequities between different types of crops. This includes allowing organic agriculture to compete for funding and establishing a new grant program to focus on international SPS barriers for all agricultural commodities. Additionally, the Administration aims to enhance USDA participation in international standard-setting bodies. The Administration requested long-term mandatory funding of $15 million over 10 years for agricultural export promotion programs like MAP and TASC. Both the Senate and House bills reauthorize these programs through FY2012, with increased funding levels. The House bill also authorizes funding for FMDP through FY2012 with no change in levels, while the Senate bill increases funding by $22 million over five fiscal years. Total funding for TASC is also increased in H.R. 2419. The 2002 farm bill authorizes $2 million of CCC funds per fiscal year. Total funding for TASC in H.R. 2419 over five years would be $38 million, with the Senate bill providing $29.2 million. Both bills authorize discretionary appropriations to assist limited resource persons and organizations in addressing unfair trade practices and reducing trade barriers. The House-passed bill also authorizes funding to enhance U.S. participation in international standard-setting organizations. The Administration proposed a measure to bring U.S. interests to standard-setting organizations for trade issues."
