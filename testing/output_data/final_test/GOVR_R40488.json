    "content": "The United States consumes 186 billion gallons of light-duty road motor transportation fuel annually, mostly petroleum-based. Biofuels, like ethanol and biodiesel, make up 5% of total consumption. Ethanol accounts for 92% of agriculture-based biofuels. U.S. ethanol consumption was 8.9 billion gallons in 2008, displacing 125 million barrels of oil. This report focuses on \"first generation\" biofuels. Since the late 1970s, U.S. policymakers have implemented incentives and regulations to promote agriculture-based energy production, particularly first-generation biofuels like corn-starch ethanol and sugar cane ethanol. Second-generation biofuels, such as cellulosic biofuels, are not yet produced on a commercial scale in the United States. The debate over government subsidies for renewable energy continues, with proponents highlighting benefits to rural economies and the environment, while critics point out associated costs. Proponents and critics debate government subsidies for agriculture-based renewable energy. Proponents cite national energy security, environmental benefits, and increased domestic demand for U.S. farm products. They argue that rural energy production can boost incomes and create jobs. Critics from the petroleum industry argue that fossil fuels are cheaper and more accessible than biofuels. They also question the economic competitiveness of current biofuels production strategies. Critics argue that current biofuels production strategies are not economically competitive without subsidies, and technological advancements are needed. They believe subsidies distort energy market incentives and divert funds from other renewable energy sources. Some doubt the feasibility of producing enough feedstock for biofuels to offset petroleum imports. Additionally, there are concerns that focusing on alternative energy sources may hinder efforts to conserve energy. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates increasing volumes of renewable fuels to be blended with conventional fuels through 2022, with 10.5 billion gallons of corn ethanol required in 2009. Government intervention in the ethanol industry and economic, trade, and environmental issues related to ethanol will be discussed in the 111th Congress. Ethanol's role in renewable fuel discussions presupposes the dominance of the internal combustion engine and current infrastructure for fuel production. In April 2008, Texas Governor Rick Perry applied for a waiver of the renewable fuel standard due to economic concerns for the livestock and poultry industries. EPA denied the request, and legislation was introduced to limit the RFS to 9 billion gallons annually. Proponents argued that the RFS and corn ethanol production were contributing to rising food prices and high input costs for livestock. Corn ethanol production has been criticized for contributing to rising food prices and high input costs for livestock and poultry producers. Opponents of reducing ethanol production argue that it would hinder efforts to increase national energy security and achieve environmental goals. Legislation was introduced in the 110th Congress to eliminate or reduce the import tariff on ethanol. The tariff on ethanol, extended through 2010 in the 2008 farm bill, may generate debate in the 111th Congress due to various factors. These include the tariff being higher than the blender's tax credit, the potential role of imports in meeting mandated volumes, and the impact of lower-priced imported ethanol on blending practices. The use of food crops for energy production has affected agricultural markets, with a significant portion of the corn crop being refined into ethanol. In recent years, increased demand has led to higher corn prices and shifts in acreage from soybeans. This has raised costs for the livestock industry. Congress may focus on the role of speculation in food prices and responses to higher prices by food aid providers during the 111th Congress. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. The EPA is tasked with formulating rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which could impact certain biofuels. Concerns exist within the ethanol industry regarding distribution infrastructure limitations and the \"blend wall\" that restricts ethanol consumption in gasoline. If EPA rules are seen as too strict, Congress may introduce legislation to relax them. The blend wall is the limit on the amount of ethanol that can be consumed in gasoline, currently around 12.5 billion gallons due to practical constraints. This is because the volume of ethanol mandated by the RFS exceeds what can be consumed as E10 and E85, with limited E85 consumption due to infrastructure and vehicle constraints. Increasing the allowable blend to E12 could raise potential consumption to 17 billion gallons without additional investment in infrastructure or vehicle modifications. This solution is popular with corn and ethanol producers, supported by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. Opponents, such as livestock producers and retail food interests, fear higher food prices from increased corn demand. EPA is assessing the feasibility of increasing the ethanol blend rate, considering market impacts and effects on motorcycles. The ethanol industry is seeking additional government support, including guaranteed operating loans and tax credits for job creation. The blender's tax credit of $0.45 per gallon is set to expire in 2010, with proponents pushing for its extension. Cellulosic biofuels production tax credit and small producer's tax credit are also under consideration. Proponents of renewable energy argue for shifting government support away from ethanol towards wind, solar, and other sources. Critics question the excessive government expenditures on ethanol and its viability without assistance. A recent report shows biofuels received the majority of tax benefits and federal subsidies for renewable energy in 2007. In 2007, the corn-based ethanol industry received $3 billion in tax credits, surpassing other forms of renewable energy. Proponents urged policymakers to allocate economic stimulus resources to the ethanol industry, but the final stimulus plan did not include specific support for ethanol. The U.S. ethanol production has seen significant growth, reaching 9.2 billion gallons per year in 2008. The country has surpassed Brazil as the leading producer of ethanol since 2005. Various factors, such as energy crises and tax exemptions, have contributed to the industry's expansion. Ethanol production in the United States has been growing rapidly, supported by government incentives like tax credits and the Renewable Fuel Standard. As of November 2008, there were 172 refineries producing ethanol in 27 states, primarily in the Corn Belt. Most ethanol plants are located in rural areas to reduce transportation costs for corn feedstocks. Corn is the main feedstock for ethanol production in the U.S., with capacities ranging from 20 to over 100 million gallons per year. Ethanol production in the United States primarily uses corn as the main feedstock, accounting for 97% of total output. Other feedstocks like sorghum and wheat are also used. First-generation biofuels are produced from these feedstocks, while second-generation biofuels come from cellulosic sources. Some ethanol plants were not operating at full capacity in 2009 due to financial troubles, with some closing down or operating at reduced levels. The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates renewable fuels blending. The Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates renewable fuels blending requirements for fuel suppliers, expanding the earlier renewable fuel standard. It includes two main categories: unspecified biofuels and advanced biofuels. The RFS requires 11.1 billion gallons of renewable fuels in 2009, increasing to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates renewable fuels blending requirements for fuel suppliers, with two main categories: unspecified biofuels and advanced biofuels. The RFS caps the unspecified portion at 10.5 billion gallons in 2009, increasing annually to 15 billion gallons from 2015 to 2022. Corn-starch ethanol is likely to fill this portion, while any renewable biofuel meeting greenhouse gas emissions requirements can be used. Advanced biofuels have a more stringent GHG reduction requirement compared to corn ethanol and cellulosic biofuels. Eligibility under the RFS requires biofuels to achieve GHG emissions reductions. The EPA is formulating regulations for calculating lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, which will impact the biofuels industry. Ethanol can be produced from feedstocks containing sugar or materials convertible to sugar like starch or cellulose. Corn is the primary ingredient used in the United States for ethanol production. In the United States, corn is the main ingredient for ethanol production, while in Brazil, sugar cane is used. Ethanol can be produced from corn using wet milling or dry milling processes. The shift from wet milling to dry milling has improved efficiencies and reduced costs. Inputs for ethanol production include feedstocks, water, energy, labor, and capital. Ethanol yields in 2008 ranged from 2.5 to 2.9 gallons per bushel of corn. Most ethanol plants use natural gas or coal for operations. Ethanol production involves using natural gas or coal for operations, with some plants utilizing biomass or manure. Energy is needed for plant machinery, liquefaction, fermentation, distillation, and drying by-products like distillers grains. Water is a key input in the distillation process, with newer plants reducing water use through improved recycling processes. Additionally, ethanol refineries often locate near livestock feed users to reduce costs and may import sugar-cane ethanol from Brazil and CBI nations. Ethanol imports from Brazil and CBI nations like El Salvador, Costa Rica, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago reached 557 million gallons in 2008, accounting for 6% of U.S. supply. Brazil and CBI countries supply ethanol to the U.S., with CBI countries dehydrating Brazilian ethanol to qualify for tariff-free status. Under the CBI, ethanol can be shipped duty-free to the U.S. if indigenous feedstocks are used, encouraging countries like Jamaica to import hydrous ethanol. The U.S. imposes a $0.54 per gallon duty on ethanol imports, intended to offset tax credits available to domestically blended ethanol. This tariff, along with a 2.5% ad valorem tariff, has been criticized for increasing costs to consumers. Ethanol imports previously benefitted from a duty drawback provision until September 2008. The duty drawback for fuels without ethanol, like jet fuel, was eliminated by the 2008 farm bill. The ethanol tariff is a topic of interest for Congress, with proponents arguing it supports the industry and opponents claiming it is unnecessary. Legislation (S. 622) in the 111th Congress aims to address the disparity between the blender's tax credit and the tariff on ethanol. The bill proposes to periodically reduce the ethanol tariff by the same amount as any reduction in tax credit applicable to ethanol. This would ensure that the tariff is equal to or less than the tax credit. Ethanol production decisions involve capital investment, plant location, production technology, and marketing. Demand for ethanol is influenced by regulatory mandates and price. The profitability of ethanol refiners depends on the cost of corn, the value of ethanol, and co-products like distillers grains. Ethanol industry saw significant profitability in 2005-2006 but faced challenges in 2008 when ethanol prices exceeded gasoline prices. In late 2008, ethanol prices surpassed gasoline prices, leading to reduced demand and financial struggles for ethanol refineries. The economic downturn further worsened the situation, causing many refineries to cut back production and face bankruptcy. Corn prices also reached record levels before declining in early 2009, contributing to the challenges faced by the ethanol industry. Ethanol prices were higher than gasoline in late 2008 and early 2009, leading to challenges for the industry. The recession caused reduced demand, tight credit markets, and financial struggles for ethanol producers. VeraSun filed for bankruptcy in October 2008, and other plants suspended operations or operated at reduced capacity. Industry output was estimated at 84% of its potential by the end of 2008. Some analysts predict consolidation in the ethanol industry as output reaches 84% of its potential. Larger producers like Poet and ADM show interest in acquiring smaller struggling plants. Despite economic challenges, five new ethanol plants came online in late 2008. USDA estimates 3.7 billion bushels of corn used for ethanol production. USDA estimates that 3.7 billion bushels of corn from the 2008 crop will be used for ethanol production, with projections showing an increase to 35% of the corn crop by 2018. This shift in production could displace other field crops as corn prices rise. The shift towards corn production for ethanol could displace other crops and lead to environmental consequences. The increasing use of corn for ethanol has already impacted U.S. exports and global corn supplies, resulting in high commodity prices that affect consumers, especially in low-income countries. Opponents of corn ethanol production warn of negative consequences for traditional U.S. agricultural crop production and rural economies. Large-scale shifts in agricultural activities could have significant regional economic impacts that are not fully understood. For more information on the impact of ethanol on food and feed prices, refer to CRS Report RL34265. Critics of first generation ethanol claim it contributed to food price increases in 2008, citing USDA data showing a 5.5% increase in the U.S. Consumer Price Index for food. However, it is important to differentiate between farm-level commodity prices and retail food prices, as marketing costs play a significant role in determining consumer food prices. The rise in corn prices due to ethanol production is not a major factor in food price inflation. Retail food price increases are mainly driven by factors such as energy price hikes and increased demand from countries like China and India. The net energy balance (NEB) of ethanol production is crucial for comparing its efficiency with other fuels. Factors affecting ethanol's energy efficiency include corn yields, energy efficiency of corn production, and the energy efficiency of the corn-to-ethanol production process. The efficiency of the corn-to-ethanol production process is influenced by the use of natural gas or coal as processing fuel, technical improvements in agricultural inputs and ethanol production, and the energy value of corn by-products. Dry milling is the more efficient method, with 82% of corn used for ethanol processed this way. New plants are expected to continue using dry milling, increasing its share in the future. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) report in 2007 summarized various studies on the Net Energy Balance (NEB) for corn ethanol. Results varied, but most agreed that the NEB for corn ethanol is positive. Different assumptions led to varying NEB values, with some disputes over its representation. However, recent analyses show that with proper accounting for co-products, the NEB for corn ethanol is positive and improving with advancing technology. Some studies suggest that inefficient processes in corn production or ethanol processing can result in a negative Net Energy Balance (NEB) for corn ethanol. While most studies agree on a positive NEB, a few have found that it takes more fossil energy to produce a gallon of ethanol than it contains. These discrepancies are often due to higher energy inputs in various components of the ethanol manufacturing process. Lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the total emissions from all stages of fuel and feedstock production and distribution, including direct and significant indirect emissions. The use of ethanol is debated for its impact on reducing GHG emissions compared to conventional fuels. GHG emissions reductions from ethanol vary, and the methodology for calculating them is yet to be determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with determining the methodology for measuring lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ethanol production under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Different methodologies will assign varying weights to impacts such as indirect emissions from land use changes. The EPA was required to establish rules for measuring GHG emissions under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) by December 19, 2008, but this deadline has passed. The EPA was required to establish rules for measuring GHG emissions under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) by December 19, 2008. A proposed rule is expected soon, with intense debate likely as it will determine fuel eligibility for the RFS. Studies show a 10% to 20% reduction in GHG emissions for corn ethanol compared to gasoline, depending on various factors. Indirect GHG emissions from land use changes are not considered in these studies. The study compared vehicles powered by E85 ethanol and battery-electric sources, finding more harm from E85 ethanol vehicles. EISA mandates a 20% reduction in GHG emissions for corn ethanol produced after December 2007. EPA can adjust requirements if deemed not commercially feasible. The ethanol industry advocates for GHG emissions calculations to exclude international land-use effects until EPA establishes a reliable methodology. Distribution challenges may impede ethanol utilization, especially as the demand for advanced biofuels increases under the RFS. Infrastructure and vehicle limitations hinder efficient delivery of ethanol to retail outlets, as most production occurs in the Midwest and needs to be transported to more populated areas. The current ethanol distribution system relies on rail cars, tanker trucks, and barges to transport ethanol from the Midwest to more populated areas for sale. Ethanol cannot be shipped in gasoline pipelines due to separation and corrosion issues, requiring its own dedicated pipeline. Some Members of Congress have proposed legislation for an expensive 1,700 mile ethanol pipeline from Minnesota to New York. As non-corn biofuels become more prominent, infrastructure concerns may lessen with production dispersed nationwide. The \"blend wall\" is the maximum volume of ethanol that can be blended into U.S. motor gasoline, posing infrastructure challenges as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) exceeds this limit. Additional infrastructure investments are needed for ethanol storage and blending before pumping. The E-85 Investment Act of 2009 proposes increasing the tax credit for E85 refueling property to 75% from 30% for property placed in service before 2012. The credit maximum is $30,000 for depreciated property and $1,000 for other property, gradually reducing for property placed in service after December 2012 through 2016. This tax credit increase was also included in the 2009 economic stimulus package. The 2009 economic stimulus package (The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, P.L. 111-5) provides a temporary increase in the tax credit for installing alternative fueling equipment, with a maximum credit of $50,000 for equipment placed into service between December 31, 2008, and January 1, 2011. There are proposals to raise the ethanol blend level for conventional vehicles from E10 to E15 or E20, which would require EPA waivers and extended warranties from manufacturers. Recently, Underwriter's Laboratories certified gasoline dispensing equipment for blends up to 15% ethanol. Growth Energy applied to the EPA for a waiver to increase the maximum ethanol blend level from E10 to E12 or E13, and later up to E15 for conventional vehicles. EPA must respond to the waiver request within 270 days. Raising the blend rate for conventional vehicles could enable an additional 7-8 billion gallons of ethanol in gasoline, raising the \"blend wall\" to roughly 22 billion gallons. The waiver request is supported by corn and ethanol interests and opposed by livestock and environmental groups. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address supply and distribution issues, including the Open Fuel Standard Act of 2009. The federal government provides incentives and support for the ethanol industry through various means. The federal government provides support for the ethanol industry through tax credits, research and development, grants, loan guarantees, and the RFS usage mandate. Federal subsidies have historically encouraged investment in the industry, with measures like the Energy Tax Act of 1978 and the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit in 2005. The blender's tax credit, also known as the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit, is an income tax credit based on the volume of ethanol blended with gasoline for sale or use. It was established by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and extended through the 2008 farm bill. The credit is $0.45 per gallon of ethanol blended, aimed at reducing fraud and has no impact on the Highway Trust Fund. For more information on biofuels incentives, refer to CRS Report RL33572. The blender's tax credit, established in 2004 and extended through the 2008 farm bill, is $0.45 per gallon of ethanol blended with gasoline. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 limited the credit to fuels consumed in the United States. A small producer income tax credit of $0.10 per gallon is available for ethanol producers with output not exceeding 60 million gallons per year. The credit reduction for production exceeding 7.5 billion gallons became effective in January 2009, with estimated credits of $5 billion in 2008. The small producers credit, established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, applies to approximately 1.6 billion gallons in 2008 and terminates on December 31, 2010. The alternative fuel infrastructure tax credit, available for installing alternative fueling equipment, offers a maximum credit of 30% of the cost, not to exceed $30,000 for equipment placed into service before January 1, 2009. The economic stimulus package of 2009 increased the credit to 50% of the cost, not to exceed $50,000 for equipment placed into service on or after December 31, 2008, and before January 1, 2011. The alternative fuel infrastructure tax credit allows fueling station owners to receive a credit of up to $50,000 for installing qualified equipment before January 1, 2011. Consumers purchasing residential fueling equipment can get a tax credit of up to $1,000, increasing to $2,000 for equipment placed into service after January 1, 2009. The most-favored-nation tariff on imported ethanol was extended through December 31, 2010, with Caribbean Basin Initiative countries exempt from the duty up to 7% of total U.S. consumption. The Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program is a long-standing program. The Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program, authorized by the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972, is administered by USDA Rural Development to improve business, industry, and employment in rural areas. Biofuel projects, like ethanol refineries, often utilize this program. The percentage of guarantee is negotiated between the lender and USDA, with limits based on loan amounts. FY2009 appropriations for the program are $43 million to support $993.0 million in loans. The Repowering Assistance Program, authorized by the 2008 farm bill, provides grants to biorefineries using renewable biomass to reduce fossil fuel use. It has mandatory funding of $35 million for FY2009, with additional funding of $15 million per year from FY2009 to FY2012. Implementation rules are being developed by USDA."
