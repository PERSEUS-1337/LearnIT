    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs administers six GI Bills providing financial assistance to eligible servicemembers and veterans pursuing education or career training. In FY2017, over $12 billion in payments were made to almost one million participants. During the 114th and early 115th Congress, legislation was introduced to update and improve GI Bill benefits. Three bills were enacted in the 114th Congress to enhance GI Bill benefits and protect participants. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 was introduced to address remaining issues and stakeholder requests. The House passed the bill on July 24, 2017, and the Senate approved it on August 2, 2017. The President signed it into law on August 16, 2017. The Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017 made technical corrections to the Colmery Act on September 29, 2017. The Colmery Act amended the Post-9/11 GI Bill and other GI Bills, as well as other programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, established in 2008, provided over $11 billion in payments to 750,000 participants in FY2017. The Colmery Act made changes to participant eligibility, benefit payments, usage period, and reporting requirements for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eligibility previously required a minimum period of active duty service. The Colmery Act made changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill, including eligibility requirements and benefit levels. Prior to the Act, family members could also be eligible for benefits through transfers or in case of a servicemember's death. The Colmery Act expanded the types of active duty service that qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, as recommended by the Department of Defense in the 2012 Eleventh Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation. This includes various authorities such as voluntary orders for health care, involuntary orders for disasters or emergencies, and orders for missions in support of combatant commands by reservists. The Colmery Act expanded qualifying active duty service for the Post-9/11 GI Bill to include various types of orders such as voluntary health care missions, involuntary disaster response, DOD missions like drug interdiction, and assistance to federal agencies under certain conditions. This includes sections 101 and 401 of the Act which added 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a712301(h), 12304a, and 12304b for service after September 11, 2001. The Colmery Act increased benefit levels for individuals with qualifying active duty service, effective August 1, 2020. Purple Heart recipients now receive special benefits. The Colmery Act extends Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to Purple Heart recipients at the 100% benefit level regardless of active duty service length. Recipients must have received the Purple Heart after September 11, 2001, while serving in active duty to qualify. Purple Heart recipients can now receive benefits at the 100% level starting August 1, 2018. The Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) was terminated in 2015, but individuals who lost eligibility due to this can still receive benefits under Section 106 of the Colmery Act. Individuals who lost REAP eligibility due to the November 25, 2015 sunset date can now qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. They can transfer their benefits to their child, spouse, or a combination of both. The VA notified around 3,200 eligible REAP participants before January 2018 about their option to switch to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Section 110 of the Colmery Act allows for transfer of benefits for qualifying individuals who are no longer members of the Armed Forces, with exceptions for transferring entitlements from a deceased transferee to another dependent. This provision applies to deaths occurring on or after August 1, 2009, and for training on or after August 1, 2018. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers various benefit payments, including tuition and fees. The Colmery Act introduced changes to benefit payments for veterans, including the Yellow Ribbon program, housing allowance adjustments, and a new benefit payment. Institutions of higher learning can enter into Yellow Ribbon Payment agreements with the VA to help cover tuition and fees not fully covered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Prior to the Colmery Act, only veterans and some transferees at the 100% benefit level were eligible for Yellow Ribbon payments. The Colmery Act expanded eligibility for Yellow Ribbon payments to Fry Scholars, Purple Heart recipients, and active duty servicemembers at the 100% benefit level and their spouses. This change took effect on August 1, 2018 for Fry Scholars and Purple Heart recipients, and will take effect on August 1, 2022 for active duty servicemembers and their spouses. Additionally, Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible individuals may receive a monthly housing allowance based on the DOD-determined monthly basic allowance for housing. The DOD-determined monthly basic allowance for housing (BAH) for Armed Forces members with dependents in pay grade E-5 is the basis for the housing allowance. The Secretary of Defense can reduce BAH payments by up to 5% of the national average monthly housing cost through 2019. The Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance is exempt from these reductions. The Colmery Act applies the DOD reduction to Post-9/11 GI Bill participants starting January 1, 2018. Prior to this, the housing allowance was based on the E-5 with dependents BAH for the area of the educational institution or employer. The primary institutional location for educational institutions or employers is determined by the ZIP code where the majority of the institution is located. The Colmery Act modifies the maximum housing allowance for individuals pursuing noncollege degree programs. The Colmery Act changes the maximum housing allowance for individuals in noncollege degree programs, setting it at the E-5 with dependents BAH for the campus area. Active duty individuals are not eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance. Upon release from active duty, the housing allowance starts the following month. The Colmery Act prorates housing allowance based on time not spent on active duty during a month. It also establishes the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship for selected Post-9/11 GI Bill participants, granting up to nine additional months of entitlement. The STEM Scholarship provides extra time for individuals in STEM fields to achieve their educational goals. Recipients receive tuition, housing allowance, and supplies stipends under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, with a maximum payment of $30,000 per person. Eligible individuals can receive up to $100 million in payments annually starting in FY2023. The STEM Scholarship provides additional funding for individuals in STEM fields under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, with a maximum payment of $30,000 per person. Eligibility criteria include exhaustion of Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement, enrollment in a qualifying STEM program leading to a bachelor's degree or teaching certification, and completion of specific credit hours towards the degree. Priority is given to eligible individuals selected by the Secretary. The STEM Scholarship under the Post-9/11 GI Bill provides additional funding for individuals in STEM fields, with priority given to those needing the most credit hours and at the 100% benefit level. The Colmery Act mandates the Government Accountability Office to submit two assessment reports to Congress on the STEM Scholarship, comparing STEM Scholars to non-STEM Scholars in various areas. The final report is due by August 1, 2024, and will include programmatic changes, identified STEM fields, and recommendations for improvement. The final report for the STEM Scholarship under the Post-9/11 GI Bill will include the percentage of STEM Scholars employed in the STEM field for different time periods. Delimiting dates for GI Bill benefits were set before the Colmery Act, with specific timelines for qualifying individuals, spouses, children, and Fry Scholarship recipients. The Colmery Act eliminates delimiting dates for some individuals under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, making it the \"forever GI Bill\" for certain recipients. This provision applies to qualifying individuals, spouses using transferred benefits, and Fry Scholarship recipients who first became eligible on or after January 1, 2013. The Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 authorized the Secretary to disapprove courses at educational institutions that did not provide annual academic progress. The Colmery Act, also known as the \"forever GI Bill,\" eliminates delimiting dates for certain Post-9/11 GI Bill recipients. It requires the VA to disapprove courses at institutions not providing annual academic progress information. The VA's annual report to Congress must now include academic progress data for Post-9/11 GI Bill participants and DEA beneficiaries. This provision became effective on December 16, 2017, with a requirement for a yearly summary by March 1. Several changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill program have been enacted in recent years. The Colmery Act, also known as the \"forever GI Bill,\" made changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill program. Section 115 of the Act requires the VA to automate Post-9/11 GI Bill claims using rules-based processing. The VA must provide an implementation plan within 180 days and report to Congress within one year. Increased automation may take at least 24 months for procurement, development, and deployment. The Colmery Act authorizes $30 million for planning, automation, and reporting for GI Bill programs. It affects multiple GI Bills, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Changes include participant eligibility criteria and benefit payments administration. Prior to the Act, most GI Bills allocated 36 months of entitlement, while the DEA program allocated 45 months. The Colmery Act reduces DEA entitlement from 45 to 36 months for new enrollees starting August 1, 2018. Closure of for-profit institutions like Corinthian Colleges and ITT disrupted education. The Colmery Act, amended by P.L. 115-62, restores entitlement for students affected by school closures like Corinthian Colleges and ITT. It applies to individuals unable to receive credit due to closures or disapprovals of programs after January 1, 2015. The restoration of entitlement for closures and disapprovals from January 1, 2015, through August 16, 2017, is based on the individual's enrollment period. Entitlement restored after August 16, 2017, is based on the academic term. The VA has notified nearly 8,000 individuals of potential eligibility for entitlement restoration. Section 109 of the Colmery Act allows the VA to continue paying a Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance for up to 120 days after closure or disapproval. The Colmery Act extends housing allowance benefits for Post-9/11 GI Bill recipients following school closures or disapprovals. Eligibility for extended housing allowance payments starts on August 16, 2017, and is payable from August 1, 2018. The Act also requires the VA to notify individuals of school closures and how it affects their GI Bill entitlement. Additionally, the Act made changes to eligible tests for benefit payments, entitlement charges, DEA monthly benefit allowance, and benefit payment calculations. Section 108 of the Colmery Act expands reimbursement for approved tests under GI Bills, including national tests for course credit. It also modifies entitlement charges for the Post-9/11 GI Bill effective August 1, 2018. Section 203 of the Colmery Act increases the maximum monthly rate for DEA participants to $1,224 effective October 1, 2018. The allowance covers subsistence, tuition, fees, supplies, books, and equipment, and is adjusted annually based on the consumer price index. The Colmery Act increases the maximum monthly rate for DEA participants to $1,224 effective October 1, 2018. GI Bill benefits are calculated based on the dates of pursuing education. Educational institutions must report academic term dates, breaks, and course variations. Commencing date of the award for resident courses is usually the first scheduled date of the term, with exceptions for courses starting in the following week. The Colmery Act impacts GI Bill benefits, including housing and monthly allowances, based on enrollment rates. The VA is responsible for administrative functions and benefit payments, as well as program approval and outreach to eligible individuals. The Colmery Act provisions impact the administration of GI Bill benefits, including funding for state approving agencies, new requirements for educational institutions, and increased transparency measures. It also expands approved programs of education and extends a committee to improve GI Bill outcomes. State approving agencies play a crucial role in the process. Following the Colmery Act, state approving agencies (SAAs) ensure access to quality education for GI Bill participants. The Veterans Benefits Act of 2002 increased funding for SAAs, but in 2009, reimbursement did not cover all costs. In 2015, NASAA requested additional funds for increased SAA responsibilities. Section 301 of the Colmery Act increases mandatory fund allocation for SAAs to $21 million in FY2018 and $23 million for FY2019 onwards, with adjustments based on Social Security cost-of-living changes. An additional $3 million appropriation is authorized annually starting in FY2019. Funding decisions will be made through the annual appropriations process. VA utilizes SAAs for compliance surveys and oversight activities. The VA was tasked with conducting risk-based program reviews of educational institutions to ensure compliance with Executive Order principles. By December 30, 2015, 79 reviews had been completed based on complaints. The 2017 policy prioritized compliance surveys of higher risk programs and institutions, such as IHLs with flight programs and private for-profit establishments offering federal training. Section 310 of the Colmery Act requires the VA to conduct risk-based surveys and oversight in consultation with SAAs. Section 311 mandates the GAO to report on the performance of SAAs by August 16, 2018, analyzing cooperation effectiveness, resource requirements, use of risk-based oversight, and data utilization for evaluating educational institutions. The Colmery Act mandates that educational institutions designate a school certifying official (SCO) to administer GI Bill benefits. Prior to the Act, SCOs received formal and informal training from SAAs and the VA. Required SCO training is crucial for accurate GI Bill administration and reducing overpayments. Section 305 of the Colmery Act requires the VA to establish training requirements for SCOs in consultation with SAAs. Section 305 of the Colmery Act mandates training requirements for SCOs at educational institutions with GI Bill and VR&E participants, effective August 1, 2018. The VA pays reporting fees to institutions based on enrollment numbers to offset administrative costs. Reporting fee amounts have been adjusted since 2011 to account for increased GI Bill-related requirements. The reporting fee amounts for GI Bill and VR&E participants have been adjusted over time. The Colmery Act changed the reporting fee to $15 per participant from August 1, 2018, through July 31, 2020, eliminating the differential fee for advanced GI Bill payments. Reporting fees are used for certifying enrollment and pursuit of participants. The Colmery Act clarified that reporting fees for GI Bill and VR&E participants cannot be used for general fund purposes at educational institutions with 100 or more participants. It also emphasized the importance of providing information to veterans to help them make informed decisions about their benefits. The VA's GI Bill website offers resources for comparison. The Colmery Act requires the GI Bill Comparison Tool to include information on priority enrollment for veterans. SCOs previously had difficulty accessing information on GI Bill entitlement, claims, benefit amounts, and payment dates. GI Bill participants also used eBenefits for information. The Colmery Act mandates that the VA provide benefit entitlement information to educational institutions for enrolled GI Bill participants through a secure system starting August 1, 2018. Training establishments must meet specific requirements for GI Bill approval, including online programs leading to a degree or certificate from an IHL. The Colmery Act expands GI Bill approval for independent study programs, requiring accreditation and leading to a college degree or recognized certificate. The Colmery Act extends the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education (VACOE) through December 31, 2022, and introduces provisions related to educational programs for veterans and servicemembers. It amends the VA Work Study program, authorizes the VetSuccess on Campus program, initiates a pilot program for veterans education, and modifies eligibility for the Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E) program. The Veterans Work Study Program under the VR&E program allows various GI Bill participants to receive additional financial assistance through the VA in exchange for employment. The Colmery Act made three activities permanently eligible, including outreach services, hospital care, and medical services. The VA provides various services for veterans, including hospital care, medical treatment, and educational support through programs like VetSuccess on Campus. The Colmery Act made outreach services, hospital care, and medical services permanently eligible for veterans. The Colmery Act codifies existing initiatives for VA services and requires annual reporting to Congress on VSOC counseling. In 2015, the VA launched accelerated learning programs (ALPs) as part of an initiative to expand job-driven training for veterans, focusing on innovative education models for post-9/11 veterans, particularly in IT careers. The ALP pilot program offers transitioning servicemembers and veterans free IT courses designed to be completed in less than six months. Participants can use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits for other programs while enrolled in the ALP. Training providers receive reimbursement from the VA based on enrollment, completion, and employment. The Colmery Act authorizes a five-year High Technology Pilot Program for GI Bill-eligible veterans to enroll in high technology education programs sought by employers. The VA's High Technology Pilot Program allows GI Bill-eligible veterans to enroll in high technology programs that provide training sought by employers. The program is funded up to $15 million annually and contracts with qualified providers to offer computer programming, software, media application, data processing, or information sciences instruction. Qualified providers must meet specific criteria and offer tuition reimbursement to students who do not secure employment within 180 days of program completion. The VA's High Technology Pilot Program offers tuition reimbursement for eligible veterans in high technology programs. The program pays 25% of costs upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment. GI Bill-eligible veterans receive a monthly housing allowance based on DOD-determined rates. The Colmery Act's Section 116 does not establish the interaction between the High Technology Pilot Program and the GI Bill for eligible veterans. There is no prohibition against receiving benefits concurrently or combining the GI Bills and the High Technology Pilot Program for more than 48 months of educational benefits. Reports to Congress are required from the VA and GAO on the High Technology Pilot Program. The VA and GAO are required to report annually on the High Technology Pilot Program. The GAO will provide an interim assessment within three years of the first contract with a qualified provider and a final report two years later. The reports will include recommendations to improve the program and whether to extend it, along with information on qualified providers' experience, cooperation with industry, and program participants' average age. Measures such as program admittance rate, job placement and retention rates, and median annual salary for employed program completers will also be included. The Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program for veterans (VR&E) is an entitlement program that provides job training and other employment-related services to veterans with service-connected disabilities. Eligibility for the program was extended for veterans ordered to serve on active duty under specific sections. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 established new active duty orders\u201410 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a712304a and 12304b, allowing assistance in response to disasters or involuntary activations of Selected Reserve units. The Colmery Act now includes these types of active duty for VR&E eligibility extensions. The Colmery Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-315) expanded benefits for veterans exposed to mustard gas or Lewisite during World War II. It established presumptive eligibility for disability compensation for medical conditions caused by this exposure. The Colmery Act of 2016 expanded benefits for veterans exposed to mustard gas or Lewisite during World War II, providing presumptive eligibility for disability compensation. Section 502(a) requires the VA to reconsider claims for exposure to mustard gas or Lewisite, with claims eligible for reconsideration if they allege exposure at specified sites. Reconsidered claims are presumed eligible for disability compensation unless there is evidence to deny them. The Colmery Act of 2016 expanded benefits for veterans exposed to mustard gas or Lewisite during World War II, providing presumptive eligibility for disability compensation. The VA must reconsider claims for exposure to these substances, with benefits retroactive to the date of first application. DOD is required to investigate sites where evidence of chemical weapons testing has been found to assess the effects on humans. The Colmery Act of 2016 expanded benefits for veterans exposed to mustard gas or Lewisite during World War II. DOD is required to investigate sites for chemical weapons testing and provide a report to Congress. VA must reconsider claims for exposure to these substances and report on denied compensation claims."
