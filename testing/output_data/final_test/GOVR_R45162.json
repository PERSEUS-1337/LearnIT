    "content": "When large financial institutions face distress, policymakers must choose between a taxpayer-funded bailout or risking destabilization of the financial system, known as the \"too-big-to-fail\" (TBTF) problem. The origin of this issue lies in the high leverage and maturity transformation practices of banks and financial institutions, making them vulnerable to liquidity runs. While maturity transformation is valuable, it exposes institutions to risks. The high leverage and maturity transformation practices of banks and financial institutions make them vulnerable to liquidity runs, leading to a \"too-big-to-fail\" problem. Financial contagion can spread troubles from one institution to others, causing a contagious panic throughout the financial system. The 2007-2009 financial crisis highlighted the significance of the \"too-big-to-fail\" problem, where solvent financial institutions can become insolvent due to financial contagion. Policymakers often choose bailouts over economic collapse, creating incentives for excessive risk-taking by institutions. The crisis was triggered by the collapse of the housing market bubble, leading to severe recession. During the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Bear Stearns faced insolvency due to a run by creditors, prompting the Federal Reserve to intervene to prevent contagion and market disruptions. Ben Bernanke warned that Bear Stearns' bankruptcy could trigger panic and harm money market funds. During the financial crisis, Ben Bernanke warned that Bear Stearns' bankruptcy could harm money market funds and cause chaos in unwinding its derivatives portfolio. To prevent this, the Federal Reserve provided a bridge loan and facilitated an acquisition by JP Morgan on March 17. During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve facilitated the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan to prevent chaos in the market. The government refused to provide financial assistance to Lehman Brothers when it faced similar troubles, leading to its bankruptcy. Bank of America ended up acquiring Merrill Lynch instead. Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, after failing to secure government support or find a private buyer. This led to a significant impact on financial markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 500 points in its worst single-day decline in seven years. The bankruptcy also caused shares of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to lose value and triggered a \"run\" on money market funds, including the Reserve Primary Fund, which \"broke the buck\" due to its investment in Lehman's commercial paper. The troubles at the Reserve Primary Fund in September 2008 led to a $300 billion \"run\" on other funds, threatening short-term financing for companies. AIG, the largest insurance company at the time, faced financial pressure due to exposure to the housing market through credit default swaps. A credit rating downgrade required AIG to post margin on its obligations, leading to difficulties accessing the commercial paper market. The Federal Reserve rescued AIG with an $85 billion credit line to prevent a devastating bankruptcy. Other financial institutions like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Washington Mutual faced troubles in the fall of 2008. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted to bank holding companies for continued access to the Federal Reserve's resources. Numerous European financial institutions also suffered during this time. In October 2008, President George W. Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, establishing the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) with over $400 billion disbursed to financial institutions and the automotive industry. U.S. households lost 26% of their wealth ($17 trillion) and 8.3 million jobs were lost by December 2009. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 in response to the crisis, considered a significant overhaul of financial regulation. Dodd-Frank, signed in 2010, is a major financial regulation overhaul. It reformed securities and derivatives markets, set mortgage standards, and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It addresses systemic risk from TBTF institutions with enhanced regulations and a resolution regime outside the Bankruptcy Code. The report discusses legal issues raised by Titles I and II of Dodd-Frank, their implementation by federal regulatory agencies, and proposals for reform. Regulators use various tools to minimize financial institution failures, such as capital requirements, deposit insurance, and the Federal Reserve acting as a lender of last resort. Title I of Dodd-Frank establishes enhanced prudential regulatory standards for large financial institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, and non-bank financial companies designated as systemically important by the FSOC. The Federal Reserve is directed to impose more stringent prudential standards on these institutions compared to others, based on specific considerations. The enhanced standards for large financial institutions include risk-based capital requirements, liquidity requirements, overall risk management requirements, resolution plans, and credit exposure reporting requirements. Congress is considering changing the $50 billion threshold for bank holding companies. This section provides a legal overview of FSOC's process for designating non-banks as systemically important and criticisms of FSOC's designation process. During the 2007-2009 financial crisis, troubles at non-bank financial firms like Lehman and AIG led to market seizing up. The Obama Administration proposed creating FSOC to identify non-bank firms posing a threat to financial stability. FSOC can designate non-bank firms for Federal Reserve supervision with a two-thirds vote. Critics have raised concerns about FSOC's designation process and proposed reforms. FSOC can designate non-bank financial companies as systemically important if their financial distress could threaten US financial stability or if the nature of their activities poses a similar risk. Factors considered include leverage, off-balance-sheet exposures, and relationships with other significant financial entities. The FSOC can designate non-bank financial companies as systemically important based on factors like leverage, off-balance-sheet exposures, and relationships with other significant financial entities. Dodd-Frank requires FSOC to provide a non-bank financial company with written notice of a proposed systemic risk designation, including an explanation for the basis of the determination. Non-bank financial companies can be designated as systemically important by FSOC based on factors like leverage and relationships with other financial entities. Upon receiving a notice of proposed determination, the company has 30 days to request a hearing to contest it. FSOC then has 60 days after the hearing to make a final determination. The designated company can seek judicial review within 30 days, limited to whether FSOC's determination was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" FSOC annually re-evaluates systemic risk designations for non-bank financial companies and may rescind them with a two-thirds vote. In April 2012, FSOC issued guidance on the Title I designation process, organizing statutory factors into six categories. FSOC issued guidance on the Title I designation process for non-bank financial companies, categorizing factors into six categories to assess systemic risk. These categories include size, leverage, liquidity risk, maturity mismatch, and existing regulatory scrutiny. FSOC aims to evaluate potential spillovers and vulnerability to financial distress, considering transmission channels such as exposure, asset liquidation, and critical functions or services. The FSOC guidance outlines a three-stage process for systemic risk designations for non-bank financial companies, focusing on critical functions or services and evaluating quantitative and qualitative information before notifying companies being considered for designation as systemically important. During Stage 3, FSOC evaluates information from the company under consideration to decide on enhanced supervision. Four non-bank financial companies were designated, but AIG and GE Capital's designations were rescinded. MetLife challenged its designation successfully, leaving Prudential as the only company subject to enhanced regulation. FSOC designated AIG for enhanced supervision in July 2013 due to vulnerabilities in its insurance products that could lead to rapid withdrawals, potentially causing disruptive effects on financial markets. FSOC designated AIG for enhanced supervision in July 2013 due to vulnerabilities in its insurance products that could have disruptive effects on financial markets and cause financial contagion. AIG's complex structure complicated its resolvability, impacting financial stability. AIG did not contest the designation, but it was rescinded in September 2017 after AIG reduced its total debt. FSOC explained that AIG had reduced its total debt, short-term debt, derivatives portfolio, securities lending, repos, and total assets. Additional analyses showed that there is not a significant risk of market disruption from a forced asset liquidation by AIG. AIG had also sold businesses, simplified its operations, and reduced its global footprint, making it different from its pre-financial crisis state. GE Capital was designated by FSOC as a significant source of credit to the U.S. economy due to its size and exposure to global banks and non-bank financial companies. Financial distress at GE Capital could lead to runs on money market funds, impairing the ability of firms to fund their operations. FSOC also noted that GE Capital's complex structure complicated its resolvability. GE Capital did not contest FSOC's designation. After an annual re-evaluation, FSOC rescinded its designation of GE Capital in June 2016, citing significant changes in its business model, including divestitures, funding model transformation, and reduced interconnectedness with large financial institutions. GE Capital had decreased total assets by over 50%, shifted away from short-term debt, and no longer owned U.S. depository institutions or provided financing to consumers or small businesses. FSOC then designated Prudential for enhanced supervision shortly after. Prudential was designated by FSOC for enhanced supervision due to its extensive connections to other financial firms and markets through various financial products and capital market activities. FSOC reasoned that if Prudential faced pressure to liquidate illiquid assets quickly, it could disrupt securities markets and trigger runs on other insurance companies. FSOC also highlighted Prudential's multi-state and cross-border operations as factors contributing to the need for enhanced supervision. Prudential was designated by FSOC for enhanced supervision due to its multi-state and cross-border operations, making it difficult to resolve in an orderly fashion. FSOC made its final determination after reviewing Prudential's submissions and holding a hearing. Prudential remains the only non-bank financial company designated for enhanced supervision. FSOC designated MetLife for enhanced supervision, citing potential financial distress that could harm the economy. This decision followed a lengthy engagement process and submission of extensive materials to FSOC. FSOC designated MetLife for enhanced supervision due to potential financial distress that could disrupt securities markets. MetLife challenged FSOC's decision in court, which invalidated FSOC's determination in March 2016. The court found FSOC's assessment to be \"arbitrary and capricious\" for only considering the impact of MetLife's financial distress, not its vulnerability to distress as well. The court found that FSOC failed to follow its guidance in assessing MetLife's potential impact on financial stability, as it only considered gross market exposures without analyzing other mitigating factors. The court found that FSOC's designation of MetLife as a systemically important financial institution was arbitrary and capricious because FSOC did not adequately support its finding that MetLife's financial distress would impair financial market functioning to a degree sufficient to inflict significant damage on the broader economy. The court found FSOC's designation of MetLife as arbitrary and capricious due to lack of consideration for costs, leading to the case ending after an appeal dismissal. Criticisms include lack of specific information provided to firms under consideration and questions about the rigor of FSOC's analysis. Critics question FSOC's analysis of companies for designation, citing transparency concerns and lack of cost consideration. Defenders argue that flexible standards deter risky activities, while rigid formulas could incentivize seeking out unaccounted risks. FSOC contends that giving it broad discretion to designate firms as systemically important is necessary due to the difficulty of identifying risks. Bills introduced in Congress aim to alter FSOC's authority, with the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 proposing to repeal FSOC's authority altogether. H.R. 4061 suggests more limited changes to FSOC's authority. H.R. 4061 proposes limited changes to FSOC's authority, requiring consideration of prudential standards for non-bank designation. It also allows designated companies to contest their status during reevaluation, with specific feedback provided if designation is upheld. The report recommends FSOC to adopt an \"activities-based\" approach for assessing non-banks' risks and increase analytical rigor in designation analyses. The Treasury Department recommended enhancing engagement between FSOC and companies under review, improving transparency in the designation process, and adopting an \"activities-based\" approach for assessing non-banks' risks. The Treasury Department recommended greater engagement with companies' primary financial regulators, publicly releasing explanations of designation decisions, and providing a clear off-ramp for non-banks designated as systemically important. FSOC was advised to highlight key risks, adopt a more transparent reevaluation process, enable discussions on potential changes, and maintain consistent standards in evaluations. FSOC has yet to act on these recommendations. Title II of Dodd-Frank aims to resolve distressed systemically important financial institutions quickly and orderly. It establishes a new resolution regime outside of the Bankruptcy Code. The report discusses Title II's legislative history, new resolution authority, administrative rules, criticisms, and responses. Title II of Dodd-Frank establishes a new resolution regime for distressed systemically important financial institutions. Commercial banks, broker-dealers, and insurance companies are subject to different insolvency regimes, with commercial banks utilizing a special resolution regime administered by the FDIC. Before Dodd-Frank, broker-dealers and bank holding companies were limited to the Bankruptcy Code, while insurance companies were limited to state law insolvency proceedings. The purpose and mechanics of bankruptcy and the FDIC's resolution regime differ in important respects. The bank resolution process can be initiated by the bank's chartering agency, federal regulator, or the FDIC for reasons like undercapitalization, without the bank defaulting or being insolvent. Corporate bankruptcies are typically resolved in federal bankruptcy courts, with Chapter 7 appointing a trustee to handle insolvency, and reorganization allowing management to operate the company and develop a plan within 120 days. Bankruptcy court decisions, including reorganization plans, require creditor approval and court oversight. In contrast, FDIC resolutions for banks involve administrative proceedings where the FDIC takes control and makes decisions on liquidation or continued operation without separate oversight authority. In contrast to bankruptcy court proceedings, FDIC resolutions for banks lack separate oversight authority, and creditors, management, or shareholders have limited participation in the resolution process. FDIC decisions are not fully subject to judicial review, and creditor claims can be disallowed without review. Creditors can be temporarily prevented from pursuing claims in bankruptcy through an automatic stay, while FDIC resolutions differ in this regard. Certain financial contracts are exempt from the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay, allowing parties to exercise direct default rights or cross-default rights immediately upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition. In contrast, the FDIC can disaffirm or repudiate contracts of a failed bank if it deems performance burdensome, promoting orderly resolution. In FDIC resolution, disaffirmance or repudiation of contracts can promote orderly administration of a bank's affairs. Counterparties to qualified financial contracts with a bank are restricted from exercising direct default rights for one business day. If a QFC is transferred to another party, default rights are permanently stayed. Banks have more protection against runs by derivatives counterparties in FDIC resolution than non-bank corporations in bankruptcy. Legal priority of creditors differs between bankruptcy and FDIC resolution. The Bankruptcy Code establishes priorities for creditor payment during Chapter 11 reorganization, including the \"absolute priority rule\" that prevents junior creditors from being paid before senior creditors. Debtor-in-possession financing in reorganization takes precedence over certain pre-bankruptcy debts. If the FDIC cannot find a healthy bank to acquire a failing bank, it liquidates the bank and pays insured depositors first, followed by uninsured depositors and general creditors according to a statutory priority scheme. The FDIC follows a priority scheme for creditor payment during resolutions, aiming to minimize costs from the deposit insurance fund. The Treasury Secretary can waive the least-cost resolution requirement in certain circumstances. Open bank assistance (OBA) can be provided to troubled banks through loans, assumption of liabilities, asset purchases, or capital infusion, but it is rarely used due to the least-cost resolution requirement. The Bankruptcy Code and FDIC resolution have different priorities in insolvency schemes. Bankruptcy focuses on maximizing creditor recovery, while bank resolution emphasizes financial stability. Bankruptcy gives creditors a prominent role, while bank resolution is more centralized. The FDIC has significant authority over bank resolution, allowing it to quickly seize and sell assets of failed banks to minimize negative impacts on the financial system. However, the bankruptcy system may not be suitable for resolving large, complex financial institutions due to their reliance on short-term funding and susceptibility to runs. The Bankruptcy Code's \"safe harbor\" provisions for derivatives contracts exacerbate the problem of resolving large financial institutions in bankruptcy. Commentators argue that the complex legal structures of these institutions, with regulated subsidiaries like banks and insurance companies, make bankruptcy resolution difficult. Reorganizing a large financial institution in bankruptcy or continuing its subsidiaries' operations temporarily would be challenging due to the need for billions of dollars in debtor-in-possession financing, which private lending markets may not be able to provide during financial distress. The 2007-2009 financial crisis exposed flaws in the Bankruptcy Code, prompting the Treasury Department to propose a new resolution authority for systemically significant financial institutions not under FDIC supervision. The existing options for resolving large non-bank financial institutions were deemed inadequate during the crisis, leading to difficult choices between securing outside capital or facing destabilizing bankruptcies. The Obama Administration proposed a resolution regime modeled after the FDIC's authority to address the shortcomings in dealing with systemically significant financial institutions during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. This regime would allow the federal government to place a firm into conservatorship or receivership managed by the FDIC, enabling the sale or transfer of assets, renegotiation of contracts, and addressing of derivatives portfolios. Additionally, the FDIC could provide loans, purchase assets, assume liabilities, or guarantee obligations of the institution under conservatorship or receivership. The Obama Administration proposed a resolution regime allowing the federal government to place a troubled financial company into conservatorship or receivership. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC would provide recommendations to the Treasury Secretary, who would then make certain findings before commencing the conservatorship or receivership. The House of Representatives passed a version of the new resolution regime in December 2009. The House bill proposed a new resolution regime for troubled financial companies, similar to the Treasury Department's proposal. It required a two-thirds vote by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC for the appointment of a receiver, with a thirty-day period for judicial review. However, it did not grant the FDIC authority for equity financing during the resolution process. Any debt funding provided by the government had to be repaid from assessments on large financial institutions. A Senate bill introduced in April 2010 built on these proposals with a slightly different process for appointing a receiver for non-bank financial institutions. The Senate bill proposed a different process for appointing a receiver for non-bank financial institutions. It required approval from a panel of bankruptcy judges for the Treasury Secretary's decision to appoint a receiver, with a focus on the firm's default status. The bill also included secrecy requirements for resolution proceedings, such as filing the petition under seal, holding proceedings confidentially, and imposing criminal penalties for disclosing information. The panel had to make a ruling within 24 hours of receiving the petition. After the Senate bill was introduced, Senator Christopher Dodd proposed amendments for the appointment of a receiver for financial companies. The amendments required the Treasury Secretary to petition the U.S. District Court for the appointment. The district court would review if the firm met the definition of a financial company and if it was in default. The Senate passed the revised bill on May 20, 2010, and a Conference Committee resolved differences between the House and Senate bills, adopting an ex post assessment process for large financial institutions to repay government funding provided during resolution. Title II of Dodd-Frank, signed into law in July 2010, establishes the \"Orderly Liquidation Authority\" (OLA) allowing the FDIC to act as a receiver for failing financial companies deemed a significant risk to US financial stability. This authority applies to non-insured depository institutions and registered brokers or dealers meeting systemic risk criteria. Title II of Dodd-Frank, signed into law in July 2010, establishes the \"Orderly Liquidation Authority\" (OLA) allowing the FDIC to act as a receiver for failing financial companies deemed a significant risk to US financial stability. A \"covered broker or dealer\" is defined as a broker or dealer registered with the SEC and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Designated federal regulators may recommend the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a financial company, with specific recommendations based on the type of company. The recommendation requires a two-thirds vote from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and relevant regulatory bodies. The Orderly Liquidation Authority under Dodd-Frank allows the FDIC to act as a receiver for failing financial companies. Designated regulators can recommend FDIC appointment based on company type, with specific criteria including default evaluation, financial stability impact, and recommended actions. The Orderly Liquidation Authority under Dodd-Frank allows the FDIC to act as a receiver for failing financial companies based on specific criteria, including default evaluation, financial stability impact, and recommended actions. The Treasury Secretary can seek FDIC appointment if a \"systemic risk determination\" is made, considering factors such as default risk, impact on financial stability, and the availability of private sector alternatives. The financial company's actions must consider the impact on creditors, counterparties, and shareholders, as well as financial stability in the United States. Factors such as avoiding adverse effects, regulatory orders, and meeting the definition of a \"financial company\" are crucial. Upon a \"systemic risk determination,\" appropriate actions can be taken. The Treasury Secretary must appoint the FDIC as receiver of a financial company if it meets the definition of a \"financial company\" and is in default or in danger of default. If the company's board of directors does not consent, the Treasury Secretary can petition the U.S. District Court for an order authorizing the appointment, which will be reviewed under the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard. Title II of the financial regulations allows the Treasury Secretary to appoint the FDIC as receiver of a financial company in default. The court must make a determination within 24 hours, or the petition is deemed granted. The FDIC succeeds to all rights and powers of the company upon appointment as receiver. Criminal penalties are imposed for disclosing systemic risk determinations. The FDIC can continue the company's business and liquidate its affairs as deemed appropriate. The FDIC has the authority to wind up a troubled company's affairs by selling its assets, merging it with another company, or transferring its assets to a bridge financial company. This bridge company allows for the continuation of critical businesses until a buyer is found or the company is liquidated, without inheriting the previous company's liabilities. This provision helps prevent market destabilization by avoiding immediate and disorderly liquidation of collateral. Title II of the Bankruptcy Code allows the FDIC to prevent disorderly liquidation of collateral during market distress. It specifies payment priorities for unsecured claims, with the FDIC able to make additional payments if necessary to minimize losses. The FDIC must treat similarly situated creditors similarly, except when necessary to maximize assets or continue essential operations. Title II of the Bankruptcy Code grants the FDIC powers to oversee the receivership of financial companies, with the goal of maximizing asset value or minimizing losses. Creditors are protected to ensure they receive at least what they would in a Chapter 7 liquidation. The FDIC can disallow claims and terminate contracts if deemed burdensome. Title II of the Bankruptcy Code grants the FDIC powers to oversee the receivership of financial companies, with the goal of maximizing asset value or minimizing losses. The FDIC may transfer its rights under a contract or lease to an acquirer of a financial company's assets, despite any contractual provisions excusing a counterparty from performance in the event of insolvency. Additionally, the FDIC has the authority to sue to avoid fraudulent transfers, preferences, and improper setoffs, and to recover compensation from senior executives or directors responsible for the company's failure. Title II of the Bankruptcy Code grants the FDIC powers to oversee the receivership of financial companies, with the goal of maximizing asset value or minimizing losses. The FDIC may transfer its rights under a contract or lease to an acquirer of a financial company's assets, despite any contractual provisions excusing a counterparty from performance in the event of insolvency. Additionally, the FDIC has the authority to sue to avoid fraudulent transfers, preferences, and improper setoffs, and to recover compensation from senior executives or directors responsible for the company's failure. As a receiver, the FDIC must ensure actions taken are necessary for financial stability, prioritize payments to creditors over shareholders, remove management responsible for failure, and not take an equity interest in the company. Title II of the Bankruptcy Code grants the FDIC powers to oversee the receivership of financial companies, with the goal of maximizing asset value or minimizing losses. The FDIC may transfer its rights under a contract or lease to an acquirer of a financial company's assets, despite any contractual provisions excusing a counterparty from performance in the event of insolvency. Additionally, the FDIC has the authority to sue to avoid fraudulent transfers, preferences, and improper setoffs, and to recover compensation from senior executives or directors responsible for the company's failure. The FDIC must ensure actions taken are necessary for financial stability, prioritize payments to creditors over shareholders, remove management responsible for failure, and not take an equity interest in the company. Title II limits judicial review over the FDIC's actions as receiver, with no court having jurisdiction over claims for payment or determination of rights with respect to assets in receivership. The creation of an \"Orderly Liquidation Fund\" (OLF) funded with borrowed money from the Treasury Department is allowed, with borrowing not exceeding 10 percent of a financial company's total consolidated assets during the first. The FDIC can use the Orderly Liquidation Fund (OLF) to make loans or purchase assets of a company in receivership, but only after developing an acceptable liquidation plan. Taxpayers are protected from losses in an OLA resolution, with funds recovered from the company's assets or the financial sector through assessments. Title II of the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) allows the FDIC to prioritize loans made to companies in receivership from the Orderly Liquidation Fund (OLF) over other unsecured creditors. If the company's assets are insufficient to repay the Treasury Department within 60 months, the FDIC can impose risk-based assessments on creditors. Additional assessments may be imposed on eligible financial companies with assets over $50 billion. The provisions also address Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs). Title II of the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) allows the FDIC to prioritize loans from the Orderly Liquidation Fund (OLF) over other creditors. It also addresses Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs), including staying direct default rights and enforcing contracts of subsidiaries or affiliates in receivership. The FDIC must protect QFC counterparty interests if a QFC is supported by a company in receivership. The OLA has not been used, but federal agencies have implemented rules under Section 209 of Dodd-Frank to address creditor rights and priorities in Title II. The FDIC promulgated rules in January 2011 related to Title II, clarifying its authority to pay certain creditors more than others to maximize recovery for the receivership. This rule addressed concerns about favoring creditors and specified limitations on additional payments to certain types of debt holders. The FDIC may make additional payments to certain creditors, such as providers of essential services or those with contract claims tied to performance bonds. These payments will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and are expected to be rare. In July 2011, the FDIC issued a rule addressing various issues, including the recovery of compensation from executives and directors deemed substantially responsible for a financial company's failure. The FDIC established a negligence standard for recovery of executive or director compensation, rejecting proposals for a stricter standard like gross negligence. They also outlined a \"Single Point of Entry\" strategy for resolving financial companies in receivership. The FDIC's \"Single Point of Entry\" strategy involves appointing the FDIC as receiver of the top-tier U.S. holding company of a troubled financial institution. The institution's subsidiaries would remain open, and the FDIC would create a bridge financial company to transfer the assets of the holding company. The FDIC's \"Single Point of Entry\" strategy involves transferring assets of a troubled financial institution's holding company to a bridge company, with certain liabilities remaining in receivership. Creditors of the holding company would receive debt, equity, or contingent securities in the bridge company, allowing it to operate without the burden of certain debts. The FDIC would select new management for the bridge company, while the holding company's subsidiaries would continue critical operations to avoid disruption. The FDIC's \"Single Point of Entry\" strategy involves transferring assets of a troubled financial institution's holding company to a bridge company, with certain liabilities remaining in receivership. The FDIC seeks to maximize private funding in a Title II resolution, providing guarantees for new debt or funding from the OLF. Comments were sought on capital requirements, OLF usage, and treatment of foreign operations. The FDIC has yet to finalize a rule on its SPOE strategy. The Federal Reserve finalized a rule imposing \"total loss-absorbing capacity\" (TLAC) and \"clean holding company\" requirements on large bank holding companies. These requirements mandate minimum levels of long-term debt and certain types of capital to be maintained by bank holding companies of U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and top-tier U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign G-SIBs. The \"clean holding company\" requirements prohibit certain activities to ensure financial stability. The TLAC requirements aim to strengthen large bank holding companies by mandating minimum levels of long-term debt to ensure they have enough capital in times of financial distress. Additionally, these requirements also focus on improving the resolvability of these companies in case of failure. The TLAC requirements mandate minimum levels of long-term debt to provide new capital in financial distress, increasing a firm's equity. This helps avoid runs on deposits and facilitates orderly resolution of financial institutions. The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC finalized rules in 2017 to restrict certain regulated banks and bank holding companies from entering certain types of QFCs to facilitate the orderly resolution of financial institutions. The rules aimed to address gaps in the Bankruptcy Code, FDIC receivership authority, and Title II regarding default rights under QFCs. The Bankruptcy Code provides a safe harbor for counterparties to exercise rights under various financial contracts in bankruptcy proceedings. The Bankruptcy Code allows counterparties to exercise rights in bankruptcy proceedings, including cross-default rights. Safe harbors in the Code may increase the risk of runs against a company. In contrast, FDIC regulations provide a one-day stay on direct default rights for QFC counterparties, with permanent stay if QFCs are transferred to a third party. However, there is no similar stay for cross-default rights. The absence of a stay for cross-default rights in non-Title II FDIC resolutions could lead to runs on a bank's parent company or affiliates. Foreign courts may not enforce FDIA's stay-and-transfer provisions, disadvantaging domestic QFC counterparties. This exacerbates the risk of runs against a bank's parent or affiliates. In a Title II resolution, QFC counterparties are temporarily stayed from exercising default rights for one business day, and permanently stayed if the FDIC transfers a QFC to a third party. The FDIC can enforce contracts of subsidiaries or affiliates of a company in receivership, even if there are cross-default rights. Concerns have been raised about foreign courts enforcing Title II's stay-and-transfer provisions. The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC aimed to address gaps in default rights under QFCs in Bankruptcy Code, FDIA, and Title II. The QFC rules aim to prevent a \"run\" by derivatives counterparties in the event of a bankruptcy or resolution. Institutions must opt into stay-and-transfer provisions to minimize risk. The rules address gaps in default rights under QFCs in Bankruptcy Code, FDIA, and Title II. The QFC rules aim to prevent runs by derivatives counterparties in bankruptcy or resolution. Institutions must opt into stay-and-transfer provisions to minimize risk. Title II has attracted criticism for granting broad powers to the FDIC, raising concerns about creditors' rights and the cost of credit for financial institutions. Title II has faced criticism for potentially formalizing bailouts, imposing ex post assessments on the financial industry, and raising constitutional concerns regarding judicial review, systemic risk determinations, and compensation claw-backs. Defenders of Title II argue that it does not promote moral hazard as it results in the firm's equity being extinguished and its board and management replaced. They also refute claims that taxpayers are at risk, stating that the FDIC must be fully reimbursed for any expenditures. Critics of Title II's discretion argue that it is similar to that granted in resolving failed commercial banks. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner supports Title II for crisis management. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner argues that uncertainty in government support for financial institutions can be beneficial by creating a healthy sense of fear among investors and creditors. One commentator defends Title II's limitations on judicial review, stating that Congress has the power to set the standard for review. They believe the 24-hour review period for invoking the OLA is appropriate for the urgency of the issue, providing due process, though not as much as some may prefer. Title II provides for due process, although some argue that bankruptcy may not be effective in resolving a large financial institution during times of financial turmoil without massive government assistance. This assistance would allow the federal government to have significant control in the bankruptcy process. Legislation proposed in the House and Senate aims to amend the Bankruptcy Code to better resolve large financial institutions, either as a replacement or supplement to Title II. A bill introduced in the House proposed a new Chapter 14 in the Bankruptcy Code for the resolution of non-bank financial institutions, with specific provisions for derivatives contracts. The proposed legislation aims to amend the Bankruptcy Code to address the resolution of large financial institutions. It includes provisions for exempting derivatives and financial contracts from the automatic stay, as well as restrictions on obtaining credit from the United States. Scholars at the Hoover Institution have also suggested amendments to the Code, such as creating a new chapter for financial institutions with exclusions for banks, insurance companies, and broker-dealers. Professor Jackson's proposal suggests that QFCs secured by cash or \"cash-like\" collateral would benefit from the Bankruptcy Code's \"safe harbor,\" while other QFCs would be subject to the automatic stay. The financial institution's regulator would have special standing to raise motions and file a reorganization plan. Unlike H.R. 3310, the regulator could provide debtor-in-possession financing following traditional priority rules. This proposal has influenced legislative amendments to the Bankruptcy Code since 2010. The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2017 (FIBA) creates a new subchapter V of Chapter 11 for bank holding companies and financial institutions with over $50 billion in assets. Bankruptcy proceedings under subchapter V would be overseen by designated bankruptcy judges. Federal regulators could participate in cases under subchapter V, similar to the SPOE approach. Holding companies entering subchapter V bankruptcy could transfer assets to a newly formed bridge company. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 proposes changes to the Bankruptcy Code, including the creation of a new subchapter V, appointment of bankruptcy judges, transfer of property to a bridge company, and an automatic stay. Unlike FIBA, the CHOICE Act would repeal Title II. S. 1840, the Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act, proposes creating a separate Chapter 14 in the Bankruptcy Code for large financial institutions.
