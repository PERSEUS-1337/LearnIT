    "content": "The 111th Congress drafted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, known as the \"economic stimulus\" bill. The House passed a version providing $4.9 billion for DOD accounts and $6.0 billion for military construction. The Senate later passed an amended version adding $3.7 billion for other DOD accounts. The House-Senate conferees agreed on a compromise version of the economic stimulus bill, adding $4.6 billion to non-construction DOD accounts and $2.9 billion for military construction. The House and Senate approved the conference report on H.R. 1 on February 13, 2009. The FY2009 defense appropriations bill provided $477.6 billion for the Department of Defense's base budget, excluding combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees recommended the same amount, which was $4 billion less than what the President had requested. The FY2009 defense appropriations bill recommended $477.6 billion for the Department of Defense's base budget. A compromise version of the bill was negotiated informally by members of the House and Senate Appropriations committees and incorporated into the FY2009 continuing resolution. The bill was passed by the House on September 24, 2008, by the Senate on September 27, 2008, and signed by the President on September 30, 2008. The FY2009 defense appropriations bill allocated $578.9 billion for DOD appropriations, with $611.1 billion authorized for national defense, including $68.6 billion for war-related programs. The House version of the bill authorized $612.4 billion, with $542.4 billion for national defense activities and an additional $70 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate Armed Services Committee marked up its version of the FY2009 authorization bill, authorizing $612.5 billion for national security programs, including $542.5 billion for the base budget and $70 billion for war-related costs. Controversies over earmarks and offshore oil drilling delayed Senate action until September 8. The Senate passed the bill on September 17, 2008 by a vote of 88-8. The Senate passed the FY2009 authorization bill on September 17, 2008 by a vote of 88-8. The House and Senate negotiated informally to authorize $611.1 billion, reducing $1.4 billion from the Administration's request. Most of the reduction came from the $70 billion requested for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House passed the compromise bill as an amended version of S. 3001 by a vote of 392-39. The Senate also passed the amended version of S. 3001 by voice vote on September 27. The Senate passed the FY2009 authorization bill on September 17, 2008, reducing $1.4 billion from the Administration's request. The House passed the amended version of S. 3001 on September 27, clearing it for the President's signature on October 14, 2008. The economic stimulus bill added $4.6 billion to DOD accounts funded in the regular FY2009 defense appropriations bill. The economic stimulus bill added $4.24 billion for maintenance of DOD facilities, including $400 million for medical facilities and $153.5 million for barracks renovation. An additional $300 million was allocated for research and development projects to improve energy efficiency. Representative David R. Obey introduced the bill on January 26, 2009, and it was passed by the House on January 27 by a vote of 244-188. The economic stimulus bill, passed by the House with a vote of 244-188, added $4.9 billion to DOD accounts funded by the FY2009 Defense Appropriations Act. The Senate received the bill on January 29 and passed it on February 10 with amendments, adding $3.7 billion to DOD accounts. The economic stimulus bill, signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009, increased accounts funded by the regular FY2009 DOD appropriations bill by $4.6 billion. The federal budget request for FY2009 included $606.8 billion in discretionary budget authority for national defense, with $515.4 billion for the base budget of the Department of Defense. The Administration did not request funds to cover the full anticipated costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which was required by the FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2008 DOD budget request included $141.7 billion for war costs, later increased to $189.3 billion. The FY2009 defense request did not include a funding request for war due to uncertainty about future troop levels in Iraq. The Administration faced uncertainty about future troop levels in Iraq when providing a funding request for war costs for FY2009. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates estimated costs at $170 billion, but lacked confidence due to uncertainties. An amended budget request on May 2, 2008, specified $66 billion for DOD and $4 billion for foreign aid in the FY2009 war costs bridge fund. Congress addressed the request in H.R. 2642 (P.L. 110-252) for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Bush signed the bill on June 30. President Bush signed a bill providing $96.1 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in FY2008 and $65.9 billion for FY2009. The FY2009 base budget request for DOD is $515.4 billion, a 7.5% nominal increase from FY2008. Roughly two-thirds of the increase would go to military personnel and operations and maintenance funding. The FY2009 request represents a real increase of 5.4% adjusted for inflation. The FY2009 defense budget request was lower for procurement and military construction but higher for operations and maintenance and R&D compared to the February 2007 projection. Congress approved the defense authorization bill without a conference committee, passing a compromise version in September. The FY2009 defense budget request was approved by Congress in September as part of the FY2009 Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance and Continuing Appropriations Act. The bill was signed by the President on October 14 (P.L. 110-417) after a compromise version was passed by the Senate on September 27. The House and Senate negotiators worked out a compromise version which included the defense appropriations bill as Division C. Several senior military officers, research groups, and advocacy organizations argued for higher defense spending in the FY2009 defense funding legislation. They called for a baseline defense budget of about 4% of GDP, which would be $70 to $180 billion per year higher than the Administration's plan. Senior military leaders, including Admiral Michael Mullen, urged for this increase in defense budget. The Chief of Staff and Secretary of the Air Force argue for an additional $20 billion annually for weapons acquisition. Army officials note a budget of over $230 billion, with ongoing needs for equipment repair and replacement. Navy leaders project a $20 billion yearly cost increase for shipbuilding. These calls for increased defense spending coincide with historical military budget standards. The defense budget has increased significantly since the post-Cold War era, with the FY2009 baseline DOD budget being over $100 billion higher than the Cold War average. Additionally, funding for weapons acquisition in FY2009 was one-third higher than the Cold War average. The disconnect between the budget size and calls for more money is evident, especially when war costs are factored in. The defense budget has significantly increased since the post-Cold War era, with the baseline DOD budget growing from $255 billion in FY1998 to almost $520 billion in FY2008. Supplemental appropriations for war-related costs also rose from $19.4 billion in FY2001 to an estimated $189 billion in FY2008, with a focus on buying new equipment for the Army and Marine Corps. This spending, while mainly for force protection, communications, and transportation, has modernized the basic equipment stock of both services. Future baseline defense budgets are expected to decline due to the Administration's plan to balance the federal budget by FY2012, leading to a projected cumulative decline of about 3% between FY2009 and FY2012. Analysts anticipate a flat baseline defense budget in the foreseeable future, with increased costs in one area coming at the expense of resources in others. Additionally, supplemental appropriations are also expected to decrease, even though plans to withdraw from Iraq remain uncertain. Costs for military personnel have increased significantly in recent years, with Congress approving substantial pay and benefits increases. This includes pay raises above civilian indices, pay table reforms, improved housing allowances, and health insurance for Medicare-eligible military retirees. As baseline defense budgets are expected to decline, costs for training and equipment maintenance covered in supplementals will shift back, impacting other programs. Further upgrades for ground forces will need to be funded elsewhere. The cost of military personnel has significantly increased in recent years due to pay and benefits increases, including improvements for Medicare-eligible military retirees. Operating costs continue to grow above base inflation, with uniformed personnel now costing 40% more than in FY1999. Military operation and maintenance budgets have historically increased by about 2.5% per year above inflation. Continued growth in operating costs erodes resources for weapons modernization. Major weapons programs are experiencing increasing generational cost growth, with new generations of weapons becoming more expensive than their predecessors. This trend is a concern within the Defense Department as budgets may not increase rapidly enough to keep up with rising costs. The Government Accountability Office has highlighted the challenges of escalating inter-generational weapons costs due to poor cost estimation. This leads to instability in the defense budget, inefficient production rates, and increased costs for major weapons programs. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have also driven up equipment requirements for ground forces, particularly in areas like force protection, communications, and transportation. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased equipment requirements for ground forces, including force protection, communications, and transportation. National Guard combat units now require modern equipment, and forces must be designed for traditional conflicts, insurgencies, and support of allies. The key lesson learned is that \"minor procurement\" for ground forces was under-capitalized before. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to increased equipment requirements for ground forces, including force protection, communications, and transportation. Military planners are facing shortfalls in meeting these requirements due to other irregular wars, threats of catastrophic attacks, and new disruptive attacks. Senior military leaders are advocating for more defense funding, which may spark a debate in Congress when the next Administration takes office. The next Secretary of Defense and the 111th Congress may face a contentious debate about defense resources, with one alternative being to provide more money. The defense budget environment may force attention to alternatives such as shifting resources among military services, reviewing requirements for new technologies, and prioritizing non-military means of prevention. Congressional action on the FY2009 defense bills may bring up other issues based on prior years' debates and early discussions surrounding the President's pending decisions. The defense budget for FY2009 includes a $2 billion allocation for a 3.4% pay raise for military personnel, in line with private-sector wage increases. Advocates argue for higher pay raises to compensate for past budget constraints, with Congress typically mandating increases above the Employment Cost Index. The budget also includes funding for the multi-year plan totaling $112 billion. The FY2009 budget includes $20.5 billion for a multi-year plan to increase Army and Marine Corps personnel by 92,000. The plan aims to create new combat units for overseas deployment, allowing troops more time between deployments. Critics argue that the annual cost of $13 billion for additional units may strain the relatively flat DOD budget. The Administration's budget for FY2009 includes a plan to increase Army and Marine Corps personnel by 92,000 for new combat units. Critics argue that the cost of $13 billion for additional units may strain the DOD budget. Some believe the Army needs more units for counter-insurgency missions rather than traditional combat units. Proposed fee increases for the Defense Health program are opposed by organizations representing service members and military retirees. Some organizations oppose fee increases for the Defense Health program, arguing that providing medical care to military retirees is appropriate due to the unique hardships of a military career. Congress and the Senate Armed Services Committee have rejected proposed fee hikes in recent budget proposals. There is a projected shortfall of F-18 strike fighters in the Navy until about 2025, when the full planned number of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters becomes available. Boeing has offered to sell additional F/A-18E/F versions to the Navy for around $50 million each. Boeing offers to sell additional F/A-18E/F versions to the Navy for $50 million each, 10% cheaper than planned, in a potential multiyear contract. Congress may approve a new deal, but funding for more aircraft could compete with other projects. The Marine Corps seeks funding for a 10th LPD-17-class amphibious ship, potentially at the expense of surface combatant ships like the DOG-1000 destroyer. Support for shifting money from the DOG-1000 destroyer to LPDs or other ships comes from advocates of the Marine Corps and legislators representing the Gulf coast. The cost and design of the LPD-17, TAKE auxiliary ships, and DOG-51 destroyers have been stable, leading to proposals to use funds for these ships instead of the DDG-1000. Several legislators have suggested reallocating funds to sustain the industrial base and support programs with stable costs. The Administration has requested $920 million for two Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), a lower cost ship intended for operations in close-to-shore waters. Congress has cut funding for the program due to significant cost growth, raising concerns about affordability. The CG-X is a new ship designated for missile defense missions, facing challenges with its design and cost issues. The Navy is considering building a larger ship for missile defense missions, raising concerns about design and affordability. There is controversy in Congress over the Energy Department's plans for a new nuclear warhead, with funding only provided for conceptual design so far. In FY2008, no DOE funds were provided for the RRW in the consolidated appropriations act. In FY2009, DOE requested $10 million for RRW design and the Navy requested $23 million. Congress has generally supported the Administration's requested spending, but has reduced funding for more challenging systems and increased funding for deployed systems like the Patriot PAC III. Funding for missile defense sites in Europe has been eliminated by Congress for the past two years due to lack of firm agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic. The FY2009 request includes funding for military construction in Europe, specifically in Poland and the Czech Republic for interceptor and radar sites. The Administration has been pursuing programs to deploy conventional warheads on long-range missiles, focusing on Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Congress has not approved funding for this effort, with FY2007 permitting R&D on the reentry vehicle but not funding it. In FY2007, funding was permitted for R&D on the reentry vehicle, but not for modifying missiles and submarines. In FY2008, Congress rejected funding for the Trident modification and combined research funding with other DOD programs for prompt global strike technologies. Congress directed DOD to explore all options for the PGS mission and not focus on the Trident option. $100 million was appropriated in FY2008, with a $117 million request for FY2009. The FY2009 budget includes $3.6 billion for the Army's Future Combat Systems. The Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) is a computer-networked array of vehicles intended to replace current combat vehicles. The program has faced criticism for its cost, focus on conventional battles, and delays in getting effective weapons to troops. The estimated cost of the program is $230 billion, with projections of $300 billion by the Defense Department's Cost Analysis Improvement Group (CAIG). In FY2006-08, Congress cut $789 million from the Army's FCS budget. House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman John P. Murtha proposed increasing near-term funding by $20 billion to speed up deployment of FCS elements. The Administration has suggested canceling the development of the General Electric F-136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F-135 for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The $6.7 billion requested for the F-35 program in FY2009 includes funds for plane development and aircraft purchase, but no funds for the alternative engine. Congress has supported the development of an alternative engine for the F-35 fighter since 1996, adding funds to the budget in FY2007 and FY2008. There is debate over whether to add funds to the F-22 fighter program to either shut down production or continue it. The Air Force plans to buy only 183 F-22 planes, with the last 20 funded by $3.4 billion in the FY2009 budget. The FY2009 budget includes funds for 183 F-22 planes, with the last 20 paid for by $3.4 billion. There is debate over closing the production line, which could cost $500 million. DOD may request funds for 4 additional F-22s to delay the shutdown decision. $832 million is allocated for a new mid-air refueling tanker (KC-X) and $62 million for plane components. On February 29, 2008, the Air Force selected Northrop Grumman and EADS to build new tankers over Boeing. However, Boeing protested and the award was re-competed. Defense Secretary Robert Gates cancelled the second competition due to time constraints. The initial contract was worth $12.1 billion, with the final cost estimated at $35 billion. The next Administration will define budget allocation for a new plane, including tanker funds for FY2009. Air Force Chief of Staff estimates it could take 8 months to 4 years for a new tanker competition. The Administration's FY2009 budget request does not include funds for C-17 production continuation or termination. The future of the C-17 program will be decided by the next President. The future of the C-17 program is being debated, with some supporting additional production while others prefer upgrading older C-5 cargo planes. Policymakers are discussing the balance between military and civilian personnel in operations involving \"soft\" power functions like humanitarian assistance and institution-building abroad. Congress has granted DOD new authorities and funding for expanded activities in areas traditionally led by civilian agencies. The expanded use of the defense budget for \"stabilization and reconstruction\" activities reflects civilian agency budget shortfalls. Concerns include the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) and the Section 1206 Global Train and Equip authority. The optimal division of labor and funding sources for these functions is still debated. The Section 1206 Global Train and Equip authority allows the Secretary of Defense to fund training and equipping of foreign military forces for counterterrorism operations. The Bush Administration requested an increase in annual authorization to $750 million and permission to train a broad array of security forces. The Combatant Commander Initiative Fund (CCIF) is used for military exercises, education, training of foreign personnel, and humanitarian assistance. Congress added \"civic assistance\" to the permitted categories in 2006. In 2006, Congress expanded the Combatant Commander Initiative Fund (CCIF) to include \"civic assistance\" and added \"urgent and unanticipated humanitarian relief and reconstruction assistance.\" The Administration requested $100 million for CCIF in FY2009. \"Section 1207\" Security and Stabilization funding allows DOD to transfer support for civilian agency responses to critical situations. The Administration requested $200 million for this purpose in FY2009. Additionally, $389 million was requested in FY2009 to establish U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) for unified command over activities related to Africa. The new organization, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), consolidates military leadership in Africa and aims to work closely with civilian agencies. The John Warner FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act requires full disclosure of war funding, but the Administration only provided a placeholder figure of $70 billion in the FY2009 budget request. The Administration submitted an amended emergency war request with $66 billion for the Department of Defense and $4 billion for State/USAID programs. Congress passed the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act to cover war costs for FY2008 and a bridge fund for FY2009. The FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act covered war costs for FY2008 and established a bridge fund for FY2009, expected to last until June or July 2009. The House and Senate Armed Services committees included funding levels for the bridge fund in their bills, with the House passing H.R. 5658 and the Senate passing S. 3001. The conference version of the authorization, S. 3001, dropped funding levels proposed in the House and Senate bills. The conference version of the authorization, S. 3001, includes a total of $68 billion for war funding, with a $2.1 billion addition for C-17 transport aircraft. The total amount of DOD war funding for the fiscal year is estimated to be $176 billion, excluding non-related funding. Secretary of Defense Gates suggested that war costs in FY2009 could reach $170 billion. In FY2009, Secretary of Defense Gates estimated war costs could total $170 billion, similar to FY2008 excluding one-time costs for MRAP vehicles. The Administration did not submit a full-year budget due to uncertainty in predicting troop levels in Iraq. Gates hinted at further reductions in U.S. presence in Iraq, allowing for 12-month tour lengths. General Petraeus assessed troop levels post-withdrawal of combat brigades and completion of MRAP purchases. With the departure of five combat brigades from Iraq and completion of MRAP purchases, war costs in FY2009 are expected to be lower than FY2008. President announced a cut of 8,000 troops in Iraq by January 2009, with an increase in troops in Afghanistan. Congress proposed $70 billion in emergency funds for DOD in the FY2009 National Defense Authorization bills. The FY2008 war cost supplemental (P.L. 110-252) included a $65.9 billion bridge fund for FY2009 to cover DOD war costs until a new Administration submits and a new Congress approves a FY2009 supplemental. This bridge fund was intended to give time to a new Administration to determine the future course in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 70% of the appropriated FY2009 bridge fund is dedicated to operation and maintenance funding to ensure that funding for operations is available. The FY2008 war cost supplemental (P.L. 110-252) included a $65.9 billion bridge fund for FY2009 to cover DOD war costs until a new Administration submits and a new Congress approves a FY2009 supplemental. This appropriations act includes relatively small amounts for procurement\u2014$4 billion compared to the $67 billion requested by DOD for all of FY2008\u2014selecting those items that may be more urgently needed such as force protection upgrades or more uparmored HMMWVs for the Army. Congress halved DOD's procurement request in the FY2008 supplemental appropriations act passed in. Congress reduced DOD's procurement request in the FY2008 supplemental appropriations act (P.L. 110-252) due to informal proposals to reallocate funds for higher fuel costs and other needs. Congressional scepticism towards war-related procurement funding may be increasing, as major weapons systems funding was cut in the conference version of the FY2009 NDAA. Additional funding for six C-17 aircraft was included in the conference version, separate from the already enacted FY2008 Supplemental. The FY2009 NDAA conference bill adds $2.1 billion for six C-17 aircraft, bringing the total authorization to $68 billion. It resolves differences between the houses and P.L. 110-232, adding restrictions on funds for high-interest programs like the Iraq Security Forces Fund and Commanders Emergency Response Program. The bill authorizes $1 billion for the ISFF but prohibits funds for infrastructure, and $1.5 billion for the Commanders' Emergency Response. The FY2009 NDAA conference bill authorizes additional funding for various military programs, including $350 million for foreign military operations, $2.1 billion for C-17 aircraft, and $1 billion for the Iraq Security Forces Fund. The bill also includes provisions for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and separate budget displays for Iraq and Afghanistan. The overall funding for the full year's war costs for FY2009 will be decided by the next Administration due to uncertainties about troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2009 NDAA conference bill authorizes additional funding for military programs, including $1 billion for the Iraq Security Forces Fund. The funding cut reflects a push for Iraq to pay more of its security costs due to growing oil revenues. Authorizers prohibit funding for Iraqi facilities, limiting it to equipment, supplies, services, training, and facility repair. Senate authorizers argue that Iraq can finance its own infrastructure needs. The final version of the authorization bill for FY2009 NDAA sets new standards for Iraqi \"burden-sharing\" in rebuilding security forces and reconstruction. It provides $2.2 billion instead of the requested $3 billion, requires a science and technology investment strategy for countering IEDs, and mandates advance notification of obligations and transfers. The Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP) allows commanding officers to fund small-scale projects or local militias. The program has grown significantly in funding over the years. The authorization bill for FY2009 requires reporting on projects over $500,000 and certifications for projects over $1 million. Funding for projects over $2 million is prohibited without contributions from other countries, the Iraqi government, or private organizations, or a waiver from the Secretary of Defense. The final version of the authorization bill for FY2009 exempts CERP projects from the overall prohibition on infrastructure spending. It also requires equal cost sharing for reconstruction projects over $750,000 to decrease Iraq's reliance on U.S. funds. The Administration proposed broadening Sec.1206 authority to include training of foreign and border police, increasing funding cap to $750 million, and designated $500 million in funding. The final version of the authorization bill for FY2009 limits Section 1206 authority to train and equip foreign militaries for counter-terror operations, extends authorization for three years, raises the annual cap to $350 million, and increases the limit for Sec. 1208 authority to fund foreign irregular forces to $35 million until FY2013. The conference bill for FY2009 requested $2.6 billion for MRAP vehicles, adopting the $1.7 billion funding level from the FY2008 supplemental bill. The current requirement for 12,000 MRAP vehicles is funded, but more funding is suggested for additional heavy-duty trucks. Funding for Iraq and Afghanistan is mixed in standard appropriation accounts, with no separate amounts specified in the final authorization bill. The Senate bill for FY2009 requires DOD to present separate budget displays for Iraq and Afghanistan at the appropriation level and by program, project, or activity. This would improve transparency but DOD may object to designating funds by operation to preserve flexibility. The final version of the authorization bill for FY2009 sets a $4 billion cap on transfer authority for DOD funds, aiming to limit the amount that can be transferred between accounts. This transfer authority is crucial for DOD to adjust funding levels during execution. The Senate Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2009 establishes an overall target of $612.5 billion for national defense budget authority, aligning closely with the President's request. The Congressional Budget Office recalculated the President's request for a $611.1 billion defense budget, aligning closely with the final version of the Senate Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2009. The total budget covers funding for DOD, defense-related nuclear-energy spending, and defense programs in other agencies. The final version of the resolution sets a $612.5 billion cap on defense budget authority. The defense budget ceiling for FY2009 is $542.5 billion, with an additional $70 billion allocated for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House passed the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009, authorizing $531.4 billion for national defense activities and $70 billion for military operations. The total budget authority allowance for FY2009 defense appropriations is $487.7 billion. The budget request for FY2009 included $70 billion for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House Armed Services Committee authorized specific allocations for Afghan and Iraqi Security Forces, as well as nearly $4.9 billion for aircraft procurement programs not in the Administration's budget request. The Administration's budget request for FY2009 includes $70 billion for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress has incorporated this cost into the Second FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Bill. Additionally, there are allocations for aircraft procurement programs not included in the budget request, such as $3.9 billion for C-17 cargo planes and $523 million for components for F-22 Air Force fighters. The HASC report accompanying the bill H.R. 5658, reported to the House on May 16, includes provisions that may lead to a presidential veto. These provisions include exemptions from executive orders on earmarks, reductions in missile defense program funding, prohibitions on health care fee increases for military retirees, and requirements for Iraq to share costs of U.S. military forces. The bill also authorizes a 3.9 percent military pay raise. H.R. 5658 authorizes a 3.9 percent military pay raise and prohibits health care fee increases for military retirees in FY2009. It also includes increases in Army and Marine Corps end-strength, funded by transferring $1.3 billion from the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. The House bill for FY2007 includes provisions for increasing Navy and Air Force personnel, denying military-to-civilian conversions in medical care positions, allowing service members to take sabbaticals, and approving funds for the development of the Northrop Grumman KC-45A refueling tanker. Some members object to the Air Force's choice of the Northrop Grumman system over Boeing for a new tanker. The bill includes provisions for a report on the tanker selection process and a review of any illegal subsidies. Additionally, $3.9 billion is allocated in the budget for the program. The bill allocates $3.9 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including buying 15 additional C-17s and authorizing $3 billion for 20 F-22 fighters. It also includes provisions for retiring C-5A cargo planes and building more F-22s in FY2010. The bill authorizes $3.1 billion for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter development and $3.7 billion to buy 16 planes. An additional $525 million is allocated for an alternative engine. $200 million is cut from the Army's FCS program. Legislative restrictions are included, such as annual reports on cost growth and vulnerabilities in the program's digital communications web. The bill authorizes $10.1 billion for missile defense programs, with cuts to long-range missile programs and increases in defenses against short and medium-range missiles. Notably, $372 million was cut from deploying an anti-missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic. The bill includes provisions to delay the European deployment of a missile defense system until certain conditions are met, such as ratification by Poland and the Czech Republic. It also cuts funding for new interceptor missile and anti-missile laser development. These systems are designed to destroy missiles during their boost phase. The bill includes provisions to delay European missile defense system deployment until conditions are met, cuts funding for interceptor missile and anti-missile laser development. It also reduces funding for multiple-warhead interceptor and space-based anti-missile interceptor testing. HASC criticizes Navy's shipbuilding plan as unaffordable and unwise. The bill H.R. 5658 significantly alters funding for major shipbuilding programs, including denying funds for a third DDG-1000 destroyer and adding funds for an LPD-17 amphibious landing transport ship and T-AGE-class supply ships. It also authorizes $400 million for either additional DDG-1000 components or resuming DDG-51 destroyer production. HASC Seapower Subcommittee chair Gene Taylor recommends using the funds for DDG-51 procurement. Chair Gene Taylor has urged the Navy to use funds for DDG-51 procurement and to buy two additional Littoral Combat Ships. The bill authorizes $840 million for the ships, $722 million more than requested for Virginia-class submarines. This would accelerate the Navy's ability to purchase two subs per year. The bill reflects concerns about the Administration's shipbuilding plan. The bill did not grant the Administration's request to waive a law requiring the Navy to maintain 11 aircraft carriers. The Navy wants to retire the Enterprise in 2013, reducing the carrier force to 10 ships until the George H. W. Bush enters service. The HASC directed the Navy to report on the cost of returning the John F. Kennedy to service and retaining the Kitty Hawk. The bill denies funding for long lead-time components for modified LHA-class helicopter carriers. The proposed Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) would include 10-12 ships with the capability to deploy a Marine Expeditionary Brigade ashore. The MPF(F) vessels, based on amphibious ship designs like helicopter carriers, will lack some combat equipment. The HASC questioned using non-combatant ships for the MPF(F) mission and directed the Navy to report on the needed amphibious ships. The bill includes a provision for nuclear-powered helicopter carriers and large amphibious landing ships. The FY2008 defense authorization bill includes provisions for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, large surface warships, and submarines. It also authorizes up to $100 million annually for stabilizing and reconstructing conflict regions, establishes the State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization, and creates a response readiness corps.
