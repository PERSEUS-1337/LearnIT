    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 21608.5 of the Business and Professions Code in California is amended to require junk dealers or recyclers to only provide payment for nonferrous material by cash or check. Additionally, a clear photograph or video of the seller must be obtained at the time of sale. The junk dealer or recycler must obtain a copy of the seller's valid driver's license or other government-issued identification with a photograph and address, passport from another country, or Matricula Consular, along with another form of identification with the seller's address. The junk dealer or recycler must obtain a copy of the seller's valid driver's license or identification card with a photograph and address, along with a gas or electric utility bill addressed to the seller at an alternative address if requested. They also need to take a clear photograph or video of the nonferrous material being purchased and preserve the information obtained for two years. The junk dealer or recycler must obtain a thumbprint of the seller, to be kept with other information obtained for two years. Thumbprint inspection requires a criminal search warrant based on theft involving the transaction. During any three-month period after the effective date, if a junk dealer or recycler completes five or more separate transactions per month on five or more separate days with a seller, paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) does not apply. Seller must continue to complete five or more separate transactions per month for the exemption to remain valid. The junk dealer or recycler must carry a surety bond of at least $100,000 to cover the cost of loss to the owner of stolen scrap metal and local law enforcement expenses related to theft investigations. The reimbursement for stolen scrap metal does not imply guilt for criminal activity. The junk dealer or recycler must have specific information on file or received from the seller to exempt from certain regulations. Purchases of nonferrous material under $20 in value in a single transaction are exempt, excluding copper or copper alloys. Materials made of copper or copper alloys are prohibited from being purchased under this section. The definition of \"nonferrous material\" includes copper, copper alloys, stainless steel, or aluminum, but excludes beverage containers subject to redemption payment. This section does not apply to coin dealers or automobile dismantlers. The California Research Bureau will provide a report to the Legislature on the impact of metal theft reduction efforts by June 1, 2019. The report must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. City or county ordinances related to junk dealer transactions are allowed if passed by a two-thirds vote and shown to be necessary for unique jurisdictional problems. Section 21608.5 of the Business and Professions Code states that junk dealers or recyclers in California must not pay for nonferrous material unless specific requirements are met, including payment by cash or check and obtaining a clear photograph or video of the seller at the time of sale. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2020, after which it will be repealed. The junk dealer or recycler must obtain a copy of the seller's valid driver's license or other government-issued identification with a photograph and address, as well as an additional item of identification bearing the seller's address, except as provided in subparagraph (B). The junk dealer or recycler must obtain a copy of the seller's valid driver's license or other government-issued identification with a photograph and address, as well as an additional item of identification bearing the seller's address. If the seller wants the check mailed to a different address, the dealer must also collect a utility bill with the alternative address and preserve all information for two years. Additionally, a clear photograph or video of the purchased nonferrous material must be obtained and kept on record. The junk dealer or recycler must obtain a thumbprint of the seller, to be kept with other seller information for two years. Thumbprint inspection can only be done by a peace officer with a warrant based on theft related to the transaction. The junk dealer or recycler must obtain seller information and thumbprint for transactions, with exceptions for frequent sellers and required seller information. The section exempts purchases of nonferrous material under $20, excludes copper and copper alloys, and does not apply to coin dealers or automobile dismantlers. Nonferrous material includes copper, copper alloys, stainless steel, or aluminum, excluding beverage containers subject to redemption payment. This section allows for city or county ordinances related to junk dealer or recycler transactions involving nonferrous material if passed by a two-thirds vote and shown to be necessary for addressing a unique local problem. It becomes effective on January 1, 2020."
