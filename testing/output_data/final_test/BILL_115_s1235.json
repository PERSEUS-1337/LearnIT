Congress acknowledges that the Cold War is over, but the United States still maintains a large and costly nuclear arsenal with approximately 4,000 warheads, of which 1,750 are deployed across various delivery systems. The United States maintains a nuclear arsenal consisting of long-range strategic bombers, fighter aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and Ohio-class submarines armed with nuclear warheads. The maintenance of this force costs approximately $400 million between fiscal years 2017 and 2026. The United States faces a significant affordability problem in recapitalizing its nuclear force, with spending potentially exceeding $1 trillion over 30 years. Government officials have warned that current sustainment plans require long-term increases in defense spending or cuts to other military priorities. An April 2017 Government Accountability Office report highlighted a significant mismatch between the Department of Energy's 25-year plan to refurbish nuclear warheads and its budget estimates. Key warhead life extension programs are likely underfunded, as per the report. The Congressional Budget Office's 2017 long-term budget outlook report predicts continued constraints on discretionary spending, including national defense, due to factors like an aging population and rising healthcare costs. A substantial decrease in spending on the United States nuclear arsenal is recommended due to factors such as an aging population, rising healthcare costs, and the national debt. The current plans assume maintaining the arsenal for decades, but reports suggest the need for reductions under existing treaties. The New START Treaty allows for reductions in warheads to 1,000 to 1,100, saving billions of dollars by deploying warheads more efficiently and maintaining a triad of delivery systems. The Congressional Budget Office report suggests significant cost savings by trimming back current nuclear force plans. President Donald Trump must consider reshaping and scaling down nuclear plans in the 2017 Nuclear Posture Review to save costs and maintain a credible deterrent. President Donald Trump must consider reshaping and scaling down nuclear plans in the 2017 Nuclear Posture Review to save costs and maintain a credible deterrent, including reductions in nuclear forces. President Donald Trump must consider reshaping and scaling down nuclear plans in the 2017 Nuclear Posture Review to save costs and maintain a credible deterrent, including reductions in nuclear forces. Funds for the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2017 and beyond are restricted for procuring more than eight Columbia-class submarines, maintaining more than 150 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, and deploying strategic warheads. The Department of Defense and Department of Energy are prohibited from maintaining more than 1,000 deployed strategic warheads under the New START Treaty. Additionally, funds for the Department of Defense cannot be used for the procurement of the B-21 long-range penetrating bomber aircraft or for the F-35 nuclear mission. The Department of Defense and Department of Energy are prohibited from using funds for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to carry nuclear weapons or for extending the life of tactical versions of the B61 gravity bomb. Additionally, funds cannot be used for a new air-launched cruise missile. The Department of Defense and Department of Energy are prohibited from using funds for new air-launched cruise missiles, ground-based strategic deterrents, or intercontinental ballistic missiles for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. The Department of Defense and Department of Energy are prohibited from using funds for certain programs in fiscal year 2017 and beyond, including the IW-1 life extension program, the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility project, and the Uranium Processing Facility. Funds for the Uranium Processing Facility at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee cannot be used from fiscal year 2017 onwards by the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy. SEC. 4. REPORTS REQUIRED. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy must submit an initial report within 180 days of the Act's enactment outlining their plans for section 3. They must also submit annual reports by March 1, 2018, and annually thereafter, detailing their plans for section 3. Additionally, the President must provide an annual report by September 30, 2017, and annually thereafter, on the amounts spent by the Federal Government for nuclear weapons. The Federal Government must report the amounts obligated and expended for each nuclear weapon and related program annually. The Secretaries of Defense and Energy must submit a report on estimated cost savings within 180 days. The appropriate committees of Congress are defined as specific Senate and House committees. The House of Representatives committees involved include Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, Appropriations, Energy and Commerce, and Natural Resources."
