    "content": "Congress has established statutory offices of inspectors general (IGs) in many executive and legislative branch agencies, as well as two special IGs for programs funded for the reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan. The four main responsibilities of IGs are conducting audits and investigations, promoting economy and efficiency, preventing fraud, waste, and abuse, and informing agency heads and Congress about issues and recommending corrective actions. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 created the Special IG for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP). The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 established the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) to oversee the use of TARP funds. The 111th Congress passed the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program Act of 2009, granting SIGTARP additional audit and investigative authorities. The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) oversees the use of TARP funds and has additional audit and investigative authorities. P.L. 111-15 and P.L. 111-22 involve SIGTARP's role in public-private investment funds and coordination with other Inspectors General. The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) oversees the use of TARP funds, issues regulations for public-private investment programs, and receives additional appropriations for audits and investigations of federal loan recipients under EESA-funded programs. There are distinctions between SIGTARP and other special IGs, as well as statutory IGs created under the IG Act. The scope of SIGTARP's powers and authorities is ambiguous due to the statutory language in EESA. The scope of powers and authorities of the SIGTARP, a presidentially appointed IG overseeing TARP funds, remains unclear despite clarification by P.L. 111-15. Unlike other IGs, the SIGTARP is not required to be appointed without regard to political affiliation, potentially impacting independence. The SIGTARP, overseeing TARP funds, may have less independence compared to other IGs due to different appointment constraints. The nomination process for a SIGTARP involved hearings before Senate committees, with a standing order for referral to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Special IGs like SIGIR and SIGAR are not Senate-confirmed positions. The Senate Banking Committee is responsible for reporting the SIGTARP nominee to the full Senate. Neil Barofsky was confirmed by the Senate on December 8, 2008. The SIGTARP, like other IGs, can only be removed by the President, who must notify Congress of the reasons for the removal. Unlike agency IGs, the SIGTARP is not required to report to or be supervised by any agency head. The SIGTARP's supervisory role is not clearly defined in the legislative history, with one court case describing it as \"nominal.\" The SIGTARP may report only to Congress, not the agency head, giving it unique reporting arrangements. It has greater discretion in audits and investigations compared to the Treasury IG, with the ability to issue subpoenas. IGs may be prevented by agency heads from conducting audits or investigations, or issuing subpoenas, for reasons like national security concerns. Unlike SIGTARP, other special IGs report to and are supervised by the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense. SIGIR and SIGAR must keep the Secretaries informed about program issues and coordinate with other relevant IGs. Coordination with Treasury IG was not required before the enactment of P.L. 111-15. The SIGTARP established a TARP-IG Council with representatives from various IGs. P.L. 111-15 required coordination with specific IGs and any other relevant entities. This section discusses the interaction of EESA provisions and the duties of the IG Act, including the SIGTARP's authority to conduct audits and investigations related to TARP. The SIGTARP's authority to conduct audits and investigations related to the TARP, as well as proposals to modify his authorities, are discussed in detail in this report. EESA \u00a7 121(c)(3) grants the SIGTARP duties and responsibilities similar to those of inspectors general under the Inspector General Act of 1978, potentially including all IG duties or limited to specific responsibilities outlined in the IG Act. The provision in the acts creating SIGIR and SIGAR bridges some differences between special IGs and IGs under the IG Act, encompassing powers, duties, and responsibilities including reporting on fraud and violations of federal law. The SIGTARP's responsibilities may not include providing policy direction as required by the IG Act, focusing instead on conducting, supervising, and coordinating audits and investigations related to programs and operations. The SIGTARP's duties under the IG Act may not include policy direction but focus on audits and investigations. The SIGTARP may be subject to reporting requirements under both the IG Act and EESA, but it is unclear if additional reports are needed beyond those specified in EESA. The SIGTARP's duties focus on audits and investigations, with reporting requirements under both the IG Act and EESA. It is uncertain if the SIGTARP would need to comply with reporting requirements to the establishment head as specified in EESA. EESA \u00a7 121(f) outlines reporting requirements for the SIGTARP, including reports 60 days after confirmation and quarterly thereafter. P.L. 111-15 amended reporting requirements for the SIGTARP, now due quarterly with detailed financial statements related to TARP. It is unclear if IG Act \u00a7 5 reports are also necessary in addition to EESA reports. The SIGTARP reports required by P.L. 111-15 include detailed financial statements related to TARP. There is no explicit requirement for the Treasury Secretary to comment on these reports, unlike other IGs such as SIGAR and SIGIR. The IG Act mandates that reports be made public and available within 60 days of submission to Congress. P.L. 111-15 mandated the Treasury Secretary to address deficiencies identified by SIGTARP reports, required a report on TARP fund usage to be publicly available within 24 hours, and made all SIGTARP reports publicly available with exceptions. It is noted that EESA \u00a7 121(c)(3) may not cover whistleblower protections under \u00a7 7 of the IG Act. The IG Act allows for complaints from individuals other than employees, including whistleblowers reporting fraud or malfeasance. EESA mandates reporting of suspected illegal activities related to troubled assets to SIGTARP or the Attorney General, potentially providing protections for whistleblowers under the IG Act. The IG Act \u00a7 7 protections could cover the purchase or insurance of troubled assets if reported to the Treasury IG. Whistleblower protections do not exist in acts creating SIGIR and SIGAR. TARP focuses on banking, with whistleblower protection for employees of insured depository institutions applying to information given to federal banking agencies or the Attorney General. EESA grants SIGTARP authorities under the IG Act, requiring the head of an establishment to provide necessary resources. The Secretary of the Treasury could be considered the head of the TARP establishment. The Secretary of the Treasury could be considered the head of the establishment where TARP is located, allowing SIGTARP to request necessary resources. Treasury initially provided space to SIGTARP, while EESA mandates the Secretary to provide space for oversight until termination. The SIGAR enabled special IG to rely on resources from SIGIR, State Department, and Department of Defense. The IG Act allows certain IGs to carry firearms and make arrests with authorization from the Attorney General. The SIGTARP is exempt from the Attorney General's initial determination, allowing them to appoint necessary officers and employees under civil service laws. Congress granted temporary employment authority to SIGIR, following similar provisions. The SIGTARP, like SIGIR, has temporary employment authority exempt from competitive civil service rules. This authority allows for hiring outside of competitive service requirements for specific positions. Additionally, the SIGTARP can hire up to 25 retired annuitants. P.L. 111-15 granted the SIGTARP the authority to hire up to 25 retired annuitants with their annuity continuing while employed. EESA allows the SIGTARP to enter contracts for services and provides $50 million for office duties, with funds available within 7 days of enactment. The EESA provisions aim to prevent funding issues like those faced by SIGAR. SIGTARP's termination is tied to asset sales, while SIGIR and SIGAR end when unspent reconstruction funds drop below $250 million. The SIGTARP may be necessary to audit troubled assets under EESA \u00a7 3(9). IGs have discretion over audits and investigations for waste, fraud, and abuse within their agencies. IGs can be requested by various parties, including Congress members, to conduct audits or investigations. While only a statute can officially order an IG investigation, Congress has delegated auditing and investigative functions to IGs. IGs have broad authority under the IG Act to access agency records and information, and they generally comply with requests for information from Congress. The SIGTARP, like other Inspector Generals, has the authority to access records and information, request assistance from government agencies, subpoena documents, administer oaths, hire staff, carry firearms, make arrests, and execute warrants. Concerns have been raised about SIGTARP's ability to obtain records from third parties, especially in equity purchase transactions under TARP involving regulated banks and holding companies. The SIGTARP has the authority to access records and information, request assistance, and conduct audits and investigations related to the purchase, management, and sale of assets under TARP programs. Entities involved in mortgage-related securities purchases may not be accustomed to opening their books to federal regulators outside of their participation in the TARP program. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) gives the Secretary of the Treasury authority over asset sales and program management. The SIGTARP can prioritize audits and investigations of recipients of federal loans under EESA. The SIGTARP can prioritize audits and investigations of federal loan recipients under EESA to determine collusion or conflicts of interest. Congress amended EESA to clarify the SIGTARP's authority to audit activities related to EESA funds. The SIGTARP has the authority to conduct audits and investigations of actions taken under the TARP program, with exceptions for certain sections of the EESA. The language in P.L. 111-15 expanded the SIGTARP's authority regarding audits and investigations under TARP, which was broader than proposed in H.R. 384. H.R. 384 would amend EESA to address auto industry financing and restructuring, giving additional duties to the SIGTARP to conduct audits and investigations of the \"President's designee.\" The bill defines the \"President's designee\" as officers with expertise in economic stabilization, financial aid, restructuring, energy efficiency, and environmental protection. Additionally, the SIGTARP would have the duties, responsibilities, and authorities of inspectors general under the Inspector General Act of 1978. The Special Inspector General under EESA \u00a7 121(d)(1) has authorities from the Inspector General Act of 1978, allowing investigations and reports on agency programs. IGs' jurisdiction extends to private contractors as well. The Special Inspector General under EESA \u00a7 121(d)(1) has authorities from the Inspector General Act of 1978, allowing investigations and reports on agency programs, including private entities working closely with government agencies. IGs have access to all relevant records and materials, extending their investigative and audit powers to the private sector and individuals outside the agency. The SIGTARP, under EESA \u00a7 121(d), has the authority to audit contracts, investigate fraud, and access records of third-parties involved in the TARP program. The SIGTARP can use subpoena power if necessary to obtain information from private entities. The SIGTARP, under EESA \u00a7 121(d), has the authority to use subpoena power to require the production of necessary information and documents for performing assigned functions. Subpoena authority is delegable, judicially enforceable, and essential for both administrative and criminal investigations. Subpoena power is crucial for the Inspector and Auditor General to audit institutions receiving federal funds. While it may not be frequently used, having this power ensures prompt cooperation with audits and investigations. The committee expects the Inspector and Auditor General to use subpoena power for their statutory functions, mainly in criminal investigations. The IG Act grants them civil and criminal investigative authority with subpoena powers. They can also subpoena third-party bank records when necessary. The Inspector General has the authority to administer oaths, affirmations, or affidavits, extending investigative powers to the private sector. False statements made under oath can lead to criminal prosecution. Court cases support the IG's access to agency documents and personnel for auditing and investigative purposes. The court held that union proposals regarding investigatory interviews of agency employees by the Inspector General were not consistent with the IG Act as it would interfere with the IG's independent authority to decide when and how to investigate. The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit emphasized the IG's independent authority to conduct interviews under oath. The D.C. Circuit emphasized the importance of legal representation for anyone being questioned under oath, regardless of their affiliation. The Supreme Court detailed the independent characteristics of OIGs and their authority to conduct audits and investigations. NASA-OIG investigators are considered representatives of the agency when investigating employees. The Court highlighted limitations of the IG Act, including the authority to subpoena documents but not witnesses. The OIG may request agency head assistance for employee cooperation in investigations. IGs have discretion in conducting audits and investigations, including the ability to decline requests based on other priorities. The Inspector General (IG) may choose not to investigate based on other priorities, insufficient evidence of wrongdoing, or potential disruption to ongoing proceedings. SIGTARP Neil Barofsky planned to request information from TARP recipients regarding fund usage and executive compensation limits. Senator Grassley disclosed that OMB had advised SIGTARP that they couldn't initiate oversight efforts due to restrictions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. OMB initially approved emergency processing of SIGTARP's letter to TARP recipients but then withdrew approval shortly after. Grassley understood that OMB required SIGTARP to post a proposed inquiry letter for 15 days, wait for comments, and justify their actions to OMB. The SIGTARP office received approval from OMB to send letter requests to TARP recipients, issued letters with an OMB control number that expires in August 2009 from February 5-11, 2009, and has begun receiving responses to these requests for an interim report to Congress on the audit project. On February 5, 2009, the Department of the Treasury requested comments on information collection by SIGTARP for TARP recipients. The purpose was to prepare a report to Congress by September 2009, with questionnaires sent to 350 respondents. The estimate may increase due to the Treasury's plan for the remaining TARP funds announced on February 10, 2009. The Department of the Treasury requested comments on information collection by SIGTARP for TARP recipients on February 5, 2009. The Treasury announced its plan for the remaining TARP funds on February 10, 2009. Agencies must obtain approval for information collection requests under the PRA, failure to do so triggers the PRA's public protection provision. OIRA can disapprove any collection inconsistent with PRA requirements. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires agencies to justify any collection of information, with approval taking nine to ten months. The PRA does not apply to collections during federal criminal investigations or administrative actions, but does apply to general investigations involving a category of individuals or entities. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) mandates agencies to justify information collection, estimating burden on respondents, and ensuring it's the least burdensome method. Agencies must review proposed collections before submitting to OMB, evaluate public comments, certify compliance with statutory requirements, and obtain OMB approval. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires agencies to justify information collection and obtain OMB approval. Agencies can request authorization for information collection if it is essential to their mission and normal clearance procedures are not feasible due to potential harm, unanticipated events, or deadline constraints. OMB must report violations of the PRA to Congress annually. The EESA discusses whether IG investigations are subject to the PRA requirements. The PRA and IG Acts do not address this issue, nor was it raised in the Congressional Record debate on EESA. The potential impact of the PRA on SIGTARP's information collection was not discussed in confirmation hearings. If the PRA applies to SIGTARP, there are options to address any difficulties in the information collection process. The potential impact of the PRA on SIGTARP's information collection was not discussed in confirmation hearings. One approach to address this issue would be for Congress to enact an amendment to the PRA that would exclude SIGTARP from the definition of \"agency.\" This could help in ensuring compliance with requests for information regarding how TARP funds were spent. The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 suggested amendments to exempt federal IGs from the PRA definition of \"agency\" and provide an exemption for statutory IGs, special IGs, the Council of IGs on Integrity and Efficiency, and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. One approach to address the issue is for Congress to create an exemption from the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) for collections of information related to TARP funds. This exemption could specify that the PRA does not apply to information collected by the Special Inspector General for TARP (SIGTARP) using subpoena powers to compel TARP fund recipients to provide information."
