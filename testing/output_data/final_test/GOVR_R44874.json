    "content": "The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) was a result of budget policy negotiations between Congress and President Obama during a period of high deficits. Budget deficits in FY2009 through FY2011 averaged 9.0% of GDP, largely due to reduced revenues and increased spending from the Great Recession and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The BCA includes various components related to the federal budget. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) includes five primary components: 1. Authorization for the executive branch to increase the debt limit in three installments. 2. Requirement for Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment. 3. Limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending enforced by sequestration until FY2021. 4. Establishment of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Budget Control Act of 2011 included the establishment of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with proposing a deficit reduction of at least $1.5 trillion over FY2012 to FY2021. It also implemented automatic spending reductions starting in 2013 if Congress and the President failed to enact the proposed deficit reduction. This included annual adjustments to discretionary spending limits and a sequester of nonexempt mandatory spending programs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual statutory discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense spending, along with automatic mandatory spending reductions triggered by the absence of a deficit reduction agreement. The Act also set separate annual limits for defense and nondefense discretionary spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual limits for defense and nondefense discretionary spending. If appropriations exceed these limits, across-the-board reductions are required. Certain discretionary spending, like emergency requirements or overseas contingency operations, are exempt from the limits. Additionally, the Act mandates annual reductions to discretionary spending limits. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates annual reductions to discretionary spending limits, requiring reductions to statutory limits on defense and nondefense spending through FY2021. These reductions are not automatic cuts but lower the spending limits, giving Congress discretion to develop legislation within the reduced limits. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates annual reductions to discretionary spending limits through FY2021. If the $1.2 trillion deficit reduction was not enacted, the BCA requires annual sequester of nonexempt mandatory spending programs until FY2029. Many programs are exempt from sequestration, and special rules govern the sequestration of certain programs like Medicare. For a list of direct spending programs included in the most recent sequester report, refer to the annual OMB report to Congress on the Joint Committee sequester for FY2020. The sequester enforces budgetary limits through automatic spending cancellations, leading to across-the-board reductions in nonexempt programs. It is implemented by a sequestration order issued by the President to uphold statutory budget requirements. The purpose is to encourage Congress to adhere to specific budget goals. The sequester was not intended to be triggered but to serve as a deterrent. The sequester was not meant to be triggered but to act as a deterrent for Congress to adhere to budget goals. Sequestration is enforced through automatic spending cuts if appropriations exceed discretionary limits, with OMB issuing a final sequestration report within 15 days after the end of a session of Congress. Additional sequestration may occur if appropriations breach limits during the fiscal year, leading to spending reductions within 15 days of enactment. The Budget Control Act requires reductions to discretionary spending limits annually, calculated by OMB and included in the OMB Sequestration Preview Report. These reductions lower spending limits for Congress to develop legislation within. Nonexempt mandatory spending programs may face a sequester if breached. A sequester of nonexempt mandatory spending programs will occur annually through FY2029, calculated by OMB and included in the annual OMB report to Congress on Joint Committee reductions. The sequester is delayed until the beginning of the upcoming fiscal year. Legislation has been enacted to make changes to spending limits or enforcement procedures under the BCA from FY2013 through FY2021, including postponing the FY2013 sequester and reducing spending reductions by $24 billion. The Murray-Ryan agreement increased discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense for FY2014 and FY2015. It extended the mandatory spending sequester through FY2023. Legislation was enacted to prevent reduced cost-of-living adjustments for retired military members. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased discretionary spending limits for FY2016. The Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2015 and 2018 increased discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense in various fiscal years, with adjustments made to direct spending sequesters and nonbinding spending targets for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism levels. The Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2018 and 2019 increased discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense. BBA 2018 raised the defense limit to $647 billion and the nondefense limit to $597 billion, while BBA 2019 increased the defense cap to $672 billion and the nondefense cap to $627 billion for FY2021. Both acts also extended the mandatory spending sequester by two years. Congress has the authority to modify or repeal any aspect of the Budget Control Act procedures through legislation. Legislation to modify discretionary spending limits under the Budget Control Act would require House and Senate approval, along with the President's signature or a congressional override. Senate consideration would likely need a three-fifths majority vote for cloture. Past increases in spending limits have been tied to future spending reductions. Discretionary spending limits have been coupled with future spending reductions, such as extensions of the mandatory spending sequester. Previous legislative increases to the limits have adhered to the \"parity principle,\" increasing defense and nondefense limits equally. For example, BBA 2015 raised both limits by $25 billion for FY2016 and $15 billion for FY2017. The budget resolution acts as a plan for the upcoming budget year but does not provide budget authority to trigger a sequester for violation. Budget resolutions do not provide budget authority to trigger a sequester for violating discretionary spending limits. Even if a budget resolution includes spending levels above the limits, it does not override the limits set by the Budget Control Act (BCA). Congress can change the limits, but it requires legislation. Authorizations like the NDAA do not trigger a sequester for violating spending limits as they do not provide budget authority. Budget authority is granted through appropriations. Appropriations legislation, not budget resolutions or authorizations like the NDAA, can trigger a sequester by providing budget authority for discretionary spending programs that exceed the limits set by the Budget Control Act. Congress can modify or cancel these limits through legislation, but any appropriations exceeding them may lead to a sequester. The Budget Control Act sets limits on discretionary spending, and exceeding these limits can trigger a sequester, leading to automatic across-the-board reductions in budgetary resources. Budget authority, controlled by Congress through appropriation acts, allows federal agencies to spend, while outlays are disbursed federal funds. The Budget Control Act sets limits on discretionary spending, which can trigger automatic reductions in budgetary resources. Outlays are disbursed federal funds, with a lag between budget authority and actual spending. Some spending is exempt from the Act, not counted towards discretionary limits. The Budget Control Act sets limits on discretionary spending, with exemptions for certain types of funding like OCO/GWOT, disaster funding, and specific programs such as Social Security and Medicaid. Medicare is subject to a 2% reduction in sequestration. The Budget Control Act imposes limits on discretionary spending, with exemptions for specific programs like Medicare, which faces a 2% reduction in sequestration. Special rules and exemptions can be found in Sections 255 and 256 of the BBEDCA. The \"parity principle\" ensures equality between changes in defense and nondefense budget authority through deficit reduction measures established by the BCA. Budget parity has evolved over time from deficit reduction measures imposed by the Budget Control Act (BCA) and subsequent amendments. The BCA and subsequent laws reflected parity in budget impact between defense and nondefense budget authority across discretionary and mandatory spending categories. Amendments in BBA 2013 and BBA 2015 focused on parity for discretionary spending only, with larger budget reductions for nondefense activities. BBA 2018 introduced another type of parity by increasing discretionary cap levels in FY2018 and FY2019 relative to the initial BCA levels. BBA 2018 included larger increases to defense caps than nondefense caps, extending automatic mandatory spending reductions with larger cuts for nondefense programs. BBA 2019 imposed larger increases to defense programs for FY2020 and FY2021, but the gap between nondefense and defense caps was smaller than initially set by the BCA. Budget authority for BCA upward adjustments has not reflected parity between defense and nondefense activities. The Budget Control Act (BCA) has not achieved parity between defense and nondefense activities in terms of upward adjustments. The BCA imposes annual statutory caps on discretionary budget authority for defense and nondefense activities, enforced by sequestration in case of breaches. Automatic decreases to these caps occur annually. If a Joint Committee bill to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion is not enacted, the BCA requires downward adjustments. The Budget Control Act (BCA) mandated reductions in defense and nondefense spending limits annually through FY2021 to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion. These reductions are not automatic cuts but lower spending limits, giving Congress discretion to develop legislation within the reduced limits. Certain discretionary funding, like OCO or emergency appropriations, can allow for upward adjustments to the limits. The Budget Control Act (BCA) mandated reductions in defense and nondefense spending limits annually through FY2021 to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion. OCO funding is sometimes exempt from these limits, with subsequent modifications through ATRA, BBA 2013, and BBA 2015 lessening deficit reduction. BBA 2013, BBA 2015, BBA 2018, and BBA 2019 increased discretionary budget authority caps in FY2014-FY2021, limiting deficit reduction impact. Table 1 shows the evolution of discretionary spending limits from August 2011 to August 2019. The discretionary caps for FY2020 are higher than in FY2019, with defense at $667 billion and nondefense at $622 billion. The combined limit for FY2020 is $1,288 billion, $45 billion higher than FY2019. Automatic spending reductions were triggered for non-exempt mandatory programs from FY2013 to FY2021. Social Security payments were exempt, and Medicare spending was limited to 2% of annual payments to certain programs. Mandatory spending reductions were extended through BBA 2013, BBA 2015, BBA 2018, and BBA 2019, scheduled to continue through FY2029. OMB estimates these measures will reduce spending. The Budget Control Act (BCA) limits discretionary spending through FY2029, with estimated reductions of $20.7 billion in FY2020. Outlays represent actual government spending, which may differ from budget authority. Certain spending, like the Highway Trust Fund, is classified differently in budget authority and outlays. The Highway Trust Fund spending is classified differently in budget authority and outlays. Budget deficits declined in the 1990s but returned in 2002, peaking during the Great Recession. Deficits have since decreased due to the Budget Control Act and increased revenues. Since FY2011, modifications by the Budget Control Act (BCA) have led to increased revenues and the winding down of stimulus programs. The FY2019 deficit remains higher than the average since FY1969. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects real budget deficits to rise in the future, with changes to discretionary spending limits affecting outlays. CBO's baseline assumes these limits will continue through FY2021, with discretionary spending growing with the economy in subsequent years. Discretionary spending levels will increase with the economy in the coming years, using FY2021 as the baseline for projections."
