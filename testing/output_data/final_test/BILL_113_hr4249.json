    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Helping Hungry Students Learn Act.\" Congress finds that in 2012, 15.9 million American children faced hunger, leading to health issues and academic challenges. Federal programs, like free or reduced-price lunch and breakfast, play a crucial role in addressing childhood hunger. Three million low-income children received free meals during the summer. Forty-seven percent of participants in the nutrition assistance program are under 18. Students who eat school breakfast achieve higher math scores and attend school more regularly, leading to a higher graduation rate. School breakfast program participation is linked to lower Body Mass Index in children. The School Lunch Program is addressed in SEC. 3. Section 9(b) of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to adjust income guidelines for free lunches to 185 percent of the family size income levels in the nonfarm income poverty guidelines. Additionally, the reduced-price category will be terminated starting from a specific school year. Starting from a specific school year, no child shall be eligible for reduced-price lunch. The School Breakfast Program is addressed in Section 4. The School Breakfast Program under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 is amended to include a Universal School Breakfast Program where schools must provide breakfast to all students who desire it at no cost. Additionally, the National Average Payment Rate is adjusted accordingly. The Helping Hungry Students Learn Act amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to equalize the national average payment for each breakfast served to any child with the payment for each free breakfast served. Additionally, it provides severe need assistance by amending Section 4(d)(1) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. The Helping Hungry Students Learn Act introduces an alternative breakfast serving model to increase participation in the school breakfast program, such as serving breakfast in the classroom or using a school breakfast cart. SEC. 5. SUMMER ELECTRONIC BENEFITS TRANSFER FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to include the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children Program. The Secretary will carry out a summer electronic benefits transfer for children program by awarding grants to States to assist with initial administrative costs. The program will follow the terms of a previous demonstration project, with a monthly benefit of $60 per child. The Secretary will adjust national average payment rates for breakfasts and lunches annually. SEC. 6. WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS WITHOUT HUNGER. \"Section 18 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to include provisions for 'Weekends and Holidays Without Hunger' for at-risk school children. Eligible institutions must meet food safety standards set by the Secretary.\" The Secretary shall establish a program to provide commodities to State agencies for eligible institutions, including schools, food banks, homeless shelters, and other approved emergency feeding agencies. State agencies submit applications to the Secretary to participate in a program providing nutritious food to at-risk children on weekends and school holidays. Eligible institutions must also submit applications to receive commodities under this program. The application for the distribution of nutritious foods to at-risk school children must include a plan detailing food delivery methods, assurances of children not being publicly identified, types of food provided, and measures for food quality and safety. The application for distributing nutritious foods to at-risk school children must include information on the number of children to be served, cost per child, and other necessary details. Priority is given to institutions with experience serving at-risk children, good food delivery records, and high-quality control. The guidelines issued by the Secretary outline criteria for eligible institutions to receive commodities for distributing nutritious foods to at-risk school children. These criteria include maintaining high-quality control, providing high-nutrient food, demonstrating cost efficiencies, and the ability to continue projects for the full approved term. The guidelines issued by the Secretary for eligible institutions to distribute nutritious foods to at-risk school children include considering geographical variations, types of projects, and institutional capacity for data collection. The Secretary will evaluate and make recommendations to Congress based on the results of the pilot project. An interim evaluation is due by November 30, 2016, and a final report with recommendations by December 31, 2018. The Secretary will provide recommendations for legislative action. Funding for the project includes authorization of necessary appropriations, with a limit of 3% for review expenses."
