Eligible entities must have at least 2 years of experience serving the autism community. The \"Helping HANDS for Autism Act of 2009\" requires eligible entities to have staff with expertise in applied behavioral analysis, autism spectrum disorders, and rehabilitation for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The \"Helping HANDS for Autism Act of 2009\" mandates that eligible entities must have staff trained in autism spectrum disorders. The Secretary has the authority to determine eligible entities. Eligible entities seeking a grant must submit an application with specified information and assurances to the Secretary. The application must include a commitment to provide ongoing outreach services. The Secretary will determine the functions of autism navigators under this section, which may include coordinating and scheduling services for individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their families. The functions of autism navigators may include coordinating appointments, referrals, community outreach, transportation, housing, education arrangements, insurance assistance, case management, psychosocial assessment, care coordination of health care, and referral to services. The autism navigators provide various services including coordinating appointments, referrals, community outreach, transportation, housing, education, determining health insurance coverage, aiding with insurance issues, and ensuring access to prescribed care. They also facilitate partnerships within the health care and advocacy community. The autism navigators assist the underserved autism community by notifying individuals about clinical trials, helping overcome barriers in accessing services, and coordinating with State departments for providing services. The autism navigators provide caregiver supports, including mentoring, support groups, and legal consultation, for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. They also support culturally sensitive caregivers and serve as expert resources for accessing early intervention services. The eligible entity receiving a grant will develop an autism navigator program to recruit, train, and supervise autism navigators. Grants provided under this section will support access to various services such as early intervention, health insurance, housing, financial security programs, Medicare, and Medicaid services. The autism navigator program developed under this section shall be subject to annual approval by the Secretary for a period of up to 5 years. There is no limitation on the number of grants that may be made to an eligible entity. The program will reach out to physician offices and treatment centers to encourage referrals for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The autism navigator program trains individuals to provide culturally competent services, assist with access to health insurance and community resources, and understand the unique needs of those with autism spectrum disorder. The autism navigator program assigns navigators to manage care and assist individuals with autism spectrum disorder in accessing Federal and State programs. It provides centralized access to various activities and programs related to autism spectrum disorders. Various activities and programs related to autism spectrum disorders are carried out by multiple agencies and organizations, including the Administration for Children and Families, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Studies to Advance Autism Research and Treatment, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor are involved in data collection and reporting for autism navigator programs, ensuring confidentiality of information shared by participants. The recipient of a grant under this program can collect, use, or disclose aggregate information that is not individually identifiable, and must submit an annual report to the Secretary summarizing and analyzing the collected data. The Secretary will conduct evaluations to assess the impact of autism navigators' services and coordinate the grant program with other related programs. The Social Security Act, title XIX, and other programs do not require payment for navigation services or other services provided free of charge. Title II of the legislation focuses on Autism Awareness, specifically addressing the training of first responders in recognizing autism. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, along with other federal agencies, will develop a standard curriculum for training first responders to assist individuals with autism and other cognitive disabilities during emergencies. Grants will be awarded to States and local governments for training first responders in providing assistance to individuals with autism. Training under this section will educate first responders on the risks of autism and cognitive disabilities, as well as teach appropriate recognition and response techniques.
