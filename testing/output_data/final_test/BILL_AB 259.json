    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1798.29 of the Civil Code is amended to require agencies in California to disclose any breach of personal information in their computerized data systems to affected residents. This disclosure must be done promptly and without unreasonable delay to restore data integrity. Additionally, agencies that maintain personal information they do not own must notify the data owner or licensee of any breaches. The security breach notification required by Section 1798.29 of the Civil Code in California must be promptly issued after discovery, unless delayed by law enforcement for a criminal investigation. The notification must be written in plain language and include the reporting agency's contact information. The security breach notification in California must include the reporting agency's contact information, types of personal information involved, breach date details, any law enforcement delays, and a brief description of the incident. The security breach notification in California must include contact information for credit reporting agencies if social security numbers or driver's license numbers were exposed. If the agency was the source of the breach, they must offer identity theft prevention services for at least 12 months. The notification may also include details on how affected individuals are being protected. In the event of a security breach involving personal information for an online account, the agency can notify the affected person to change their password and security question promptly. This helps protect not only the breached account but also other accounts using the same credentials. In the case of a security breach involving personal information for an online account, the agency can provide notification through alternative methods instead of sending an email notification to the affected account. An agency must electronically submit a sample copy of a security breach notification to the Attorney General if it affects more than 500 California residents. A breach of the security system is defined as unauthorized acquisition of data compromising personal information, excluding good faith acquisition by agency employees for official purposes. Personal information, as defined in this section, includes an individual's name with sensitive data like social security number, driver's license number, account numbers, medical information, or health insurance information. It also covers user names or email addresses with passwords that grant access to online accounts. However, publicly available information from government records is not considered personal information under this section. For the purposes of this section, \"medical information\" refers to an individual's medical history, condition, treatment, or diagnosis. \"Health insurance information\" includes policy numbers, unique identifiers, and application/claims history. Notice can be given in writing or electronically in accordance with electronic records and signatures regulations. Substitute notice may be used by agencies if the cost of providing notice exceeds $250,000, the affected class exceeds 500,000, or contact information is insufficient. It includes email notice, posting on the agency's website, notification to major media, and the Office of Information Security. An agency can use its own notification procedures in compliance with information security policies for personal information breaches. The definition of \"agency\" includes local agencies as well."
