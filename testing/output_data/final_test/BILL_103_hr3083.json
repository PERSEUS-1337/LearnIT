    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Opal Creek Forest Preserve Act of 1993\". Old-growth forests are vital ecosystems for wildlife, water conservation, research, and recreation. Protecting these forests can enhance the quality of life for Oregon residents. The Opal Creek forest in Oregon is a significant old-growth ecosystem with trees up to 1,000 years old, providing recreational opportunities for visitors and facing threats from logging. The Opal Creek forest in Oregon, with trees up to 1,000 years old, faces threats from logging that will harm its ecological, scientific, educational, and recreational values. Preservation of the area allows for nondestructive old-growth forest research and credible public education. The Opal Creek Forest Preserve is established for research, education, and recreation purposes on Federal lands in Oregon's Willamette National Forest. The Preserve includes old-growth trees and is managed to protect its ecological, scientific, and educational values. The Secretary of Agriculture will develop a cooperative management plan with the Friends of Opal Creek for the Preserve, focusing on research, recreational, and educational uses. Timber harvesting in the Preserve is prohibited, except for subsistence use and research/educational purposes. The Secretary will terminate planning for Cedar and Elkhorn Creek timber sales. Nonmotorized recreation is allowed in the area without impacting the old-growth forest ecosystem. New road construction is prohibited, except as authorized. Existing special use permits will continue as per their terms. The Secretary will convert parts of the Shiny Rock Mining Company's plan to special use permits for the Friends of Opal Creek. Special use permits may be issued for activities consistent with the management plan and for exploration in the Bornite Project Area. Roads, structures, and utilities will be regulated. The Secretary will manage the Preserve by allowing roads, structures, and utilities for activities outside the Preserve. Guidelines include promoting research, conducting educational programs, and preserving historic assets related to old-growth forests. The Federal lands in the Preserve are withdrawn from various laws and regulations to protect historic assets. The Secretary may support the management of private inholdings in the special management area by a nonprofit organization. The Secretary may support the management of private inholdings in the special management area by a nonprofit organization if they agree to comply with specified standards and guidelines. Access to and acquisition of non-federal land is addressed in Section 5. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct an inventory of non-Federal lands within the Preserve and pursue a land consolidation program to acquire suitable lands for inclusion. The Secretary is required to purchase certain parcels at fair market value for inclusion in the Preserve. The Secretary of Agriculture will acquire parcels of real property for inclusion in the Preserve, including 60 acres on Stoney Ridge and 80 acres in Gold Creek. An annual report on the land consolidation program will be submitted to relevant committees. The Secretary will evaluate acquiring 640 acres in Cedar Creek from Rosboro Lumber Company for the Preserve. Lands in Bornite Project Area may be added to the Preserve under certain circumstances. The Bornite Project Area allows for the patenting of mining claims on lands for mining purposes only. Upon the cessation of activities, the lands will be reconveyed to the Federal Government or to Friends of Opal Creek. Access to existing inholdings within the Preserve will be allowed to continue. The Bornite Project Area will be maintained in its current condition, with no significant changes allowed except for serving the project area under special use permits. The Act includes a grandfather clause to protect existing timber sale contracts and special use permits issued before the enactment date. It also ensures that activities approved under environmental assessments or impact statements before the enactment date are not affected."
