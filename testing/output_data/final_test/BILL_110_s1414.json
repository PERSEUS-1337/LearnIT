In the 2006 National Assessment of Educational Progress, high percentages of students scored below basic in United States history and civics. For example, 30% of grade 4 students, 35% of grade 8 students, and 53% of grade 12 students scored below basic in history. Additionally, there is a 31 point achievement gap for grade 4 students from low-income families compared to those from high-income families. In the 2006 National Assessment of Educational Progress, significant achievement gaps were found among students in grade 4 based on race and income level. Additionally, a high percentage of students in grade 12 struggled to explain key historical events such as the Korean War and the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the United States civics assessment, a significant number of students in grades 4, 8, and 12 scored below basic levels. Achievement gaps were observed based on income level and race in grade 4. In grade 8, a majority of students could not explain the historical purpose of the Declaration of Independence. In grade 12, a high percentage of students were unable to demonstrate knowledge on key historical events. In grade 12, 57 percent of students were unable to describe federalism in the United States.
