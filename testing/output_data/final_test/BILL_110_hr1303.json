Chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include a new subchapter on air carrier passenger services. The \"Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007\" adds a new subchapter on air carrier passenger services to Chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code. It includes definitions for air transportation and covered air carrier, as well as standards for handling passenger complaints and providing information on diversions, delays, and cancellations. The \"Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007\" requires covered air carriers to provide information on delays, cancellations, and diversions to passengers. This includes the cause of the delay and the carrier's best estimate of departure time. Carriers must use airport announcements, on-board announcements, and airport monitors for notifications. Passengers have the right to exit an aircraft in case of departure and arrival delays. The \"Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007\" mandates procedures for allowing passengers to exit the aircraft during departure or arrival delays exceeding 3 hours, with exceptions for safety reasons or if the flight will depart or arrive within 30 minutes after the delay. The \"Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007\" allows pilots to extend the 30-minute delay period by an additional 30 minutes for unforeseen delays. Covered air carriers must provide essential services to passengers during ground delays, including food, water, sanitary facilities, medical access, ventilation, and comfortable cabin temperatures. Additionally, the Act addresses chronically delayed flights by requiring the publication of a list of affected flights. The \"Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007\" mandates covered air carriers to publish a monthly list of chronically delayed flights and disclose on-time performance for these flights to customers when purchasing tickets. A chronically delayed flight is defined as one that fails to arrive within 30 minutes of the scheduled time at least 40 percent of the time. The \"Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007\" requires covered air carriers to publish lowest fare information, schedules, and itineraries for flights. They must also make every reasonable effort to return lost baggage to passengers within 24 hours. The \"Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007\" mandates covered air carriers to display passenger rights information prominently, incorporate consumer rights into their contracts, and implement procedures for departure delays, including allowing pilots to return to airport terminals during long delays and creating contingency plans for weather emergencies. The Secretary will review emergency contingency plans of air carriers and airports to ensure coordinated response to weather emergencies, convening a meeting to develop procedures for long departure delays. The Secretary of Transportation will issue final regulations within 180 days to enforce standards for air carrier passenger services. Covered air carriers must comply with the requirements within one year. Additionally, there will be procedures developed for diverted flights. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on air carriers' ability to meet passengers' essential needs during diverted flights. A report on the study results, including methods for ensuring passenger needs are met, must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
