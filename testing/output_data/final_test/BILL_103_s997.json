    "content": "The Act titled \"Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1993\" is referred to as the short title. The findings and purposes of the Act are outlined in section 2. The Congress finds that the Nation's beaches are valuable for recreation, attract millions of visitors, and generate billions of dollars in tourism. Increased population has led to declining coastal water quality, with pollution crossing political boundaries. Each coastal State has varying methods for testing water quality, highlighting the need for consistent monitoring standards. The Act aims to establish uniform procedures for testing and monitoring coastal recreation waters to protect public safety and improve environmental quality. Monitoring water quality and posting signs at beaches during exceedance periods would enhance public health and safety. SEC. 3. WATER QUALITY CRITERIA AND STANDARDS. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters to protect public health during water activities. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include specific numeric criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters, such as those in the Great Lakes and marine coastal waters, to protect public health during activities like swimming and bathing. States must adopt water quality standards consistent with these criteria. States must adopt water quality standards consistent with specific numeric criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters within 3 years of publication. Failure to comply within this timeframe will result in consequences. The Administrator shall establish water quality standards for coastal recreation waters in each State, in accordance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. States must implement these standards in all relevant programs. SEC. 4. COASTAL BEACH WATER QUALITY MONITORING. Amends Title IV of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include a new section for coastal beach water quality monitoring. The Administrator shall publish regulations for monitoring coastal recreation waters for compliance with water quality standards and public safety, specifying frequency based on use, extent of use, and proximity to pollution sources. The regulations for monitoring coastal recreation waters include methods for detecting pathogens, exemptions for specific areas if water quality standards and public safety are not compromised, and notification requirements for violations. The regulations require prompt communication and posting of signs for violations of water quality standards in coastal recreation waters. The Administrator must issue guidance on monitoring floatable materials and specify when their presence poses a threat to public health and safety. The regulations allow states to delegate monitoring of coastal recreation waters to local authorities. The Administrator will periodically review and revise regulations related to water quality standards. Coastal recreation waters are defined as Great Lakes and marine coastal waters used for swimming, bathing, or similar activities. Floatable materials include plastic, aluminum cans, wood, bottles, and paper products that may pose a threat to public health and safety. SEC. 5. STUDY TO IDENTIFY INDICATORS OF HUMAN-SPECIFIC PATHOGENS IN COASTAL RECREATION WATERS. The Administrator, in cooperation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, conducts an ongoing study to provide information for better indicators to detect harmful bacteria and viruses in coastal recreation waters. A report describing the study findings, recommendations for improving water quality, and information on floatable materials in coastal waters is submitted to Congress every 4 years. The ongoing study conducted by the Administrator and the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere provides information on detecting harmful bacteria and viruses in coastal recreation waters. A report is submitted to Congress every 4 years, including recommendations for improving water quality and data on floatable materials in coastal waters and beaches. State efforts to implement this Act are also evaluated. SEC. 6. GRANTS TO STATES. The Administrator may make grants to States for fulfilling requirements under sections 3 and 4, with a cost-sharing limit of 50 percent of the State's implementation costs. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. Defines \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA, \"coastal recreation waters\" as public swimming areas, and \"floatable materials\" as debris like plastic and cans found in water. Authorization of appropriations for grants to States under section 6 is set at $3,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1994 and 1995, with an additional $1,000,000 allocated for other provisions of the Act during the same period."
