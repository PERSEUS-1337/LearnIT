    "content": "This report highlights the strategic competition between China and India in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region, posing policy and oversight issues for Congress. Congress must decide on responses to this rivalry, which could impact U.S. relations with India, China, defense programs, arms sales, foreign assistance, trade, and energy policy. Other related CRS reports cover U.S. relations with China, India, and other countries in the region, as well as China's military forces. The strategic competition between China and India in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region is of strategic importance to the United States. The evolving power dynamics related to China-India rivalry in the IOR are crucial for U.S. policy and interests in the region. Geopolitical thinkers have debated the significance of the Eurasian littoral in influencing the strategic direction of the Eurasian landmass. The shift towards Asia and the increasing strategic importance of the Indian Ocean Region due to trade and investment are highlighted. China's growing economic and military capabilities in the IOR create rivalry and tension. The Indian Ocean is a crucial trade corridor, handling a significant portion of global oil shipments and cargo. This reliance on the Indian Ocean for energy and trade poses a strategic vulnerability for countries like China, South Korea, and Japan. US policy aims to shape strategic dynamics in the Indo-Pacific to prevent dominance by a single hegemon or coalition of powers. The U.S. aims to prevent Asia from being dominated by a single hegemon or coalition of powers, support allies, promote a rules-based order, protect energy supplies, ensure freedom of navigation, prevent terrorism and WMD proliferation, avoid conflicts like India-Pakistan, and stay engaged in economic and strategic architectures. Under the Trump Administration, some policy positions have changed, including the importance of climate change. The United States has significant military assets in the Indian Ocean Region, with bases in Djibouti and Diego Garcia. A U.S. Navy Support Facility on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean provides logistic support to forces in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf areas. Approximately 2,500 U.S. and allied military personnel are stationed there. Naval Support Activity Bahrain supports U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and the U.S. Fifth Fleet in the CENTCOM AOR, which includes the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Arabian Sea. The U.S. Pacific Command's AOR extends across much of the Indian Ocean. The U.S. is also developing a rotational presence of up to 2,500 marines and aircraft near Darwin, Australia. The 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) of the Trump Administration emphasizes the Indo-Pacific region, highlighting China as a competitor challenging American power and interests. It states that China aims to displace the United States in the region and promote its state-driven economic model. The NSS identifies a geopolitical competition between free and repressive visions of world order in the Indo-Pacific. The 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) of the Trump Administration emphasizes the Indo-Pacific region, highlighting China as a competitor challenging American power and interests. It states that China aims to displace the United States in the region and promote its state-driven economic model. The NSS identifies a geopolitical competition between free and repressive visions of world order in the Indo-Pacific. The NSS also mentions India's emergence as a leading global power and stronger strategic partner, with plans to deepen security cooperation and partnership with India. It aims to increase quadrilateral cooperation with Japan, Australia, and India while acknowledging the reemergence of long-term strategic competition by revisionist powers. The National Defense Strategy highlights China's efforts to achieve regional hegemony in the Indo-Pacific through military modernization and coercive tactics. It emphasizes the importance of expanding alliances and partnerships in the region to deter aggression and maintain stability. In a speech emphasizing the importance of U.S.-India relations, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson highlighted the need for a strategic partnership with India. He mentioned the annual Malabar naval exercises and growing defense ties, stating that the two countries are global partners with shared values. Tillerson also discussed China's rise and its impact on the international order. China's actions in the South China Sea challenge international norms and sovereignty. The United States and India seek constructive relations with China but will not tolerate its disregard for the rules-based order. India values a reliable partner on the world stage, and the United States is that partner with shared values for global stability and prosperity. Former Secretary Tillerson also addressed the issue of \"predatory economics\" and the need to counter China's financing mechanisms. India supported Tillerson's remarks while China criticized them. Tillerson affirmed the strategic partnership between the United States and India, building on bilateral developments over the past years. The U.S.-India Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region in 2015 highlighted the growing partnership between the two countries. Bilateral cooperation includes jointly tracking Chinese naval movements in the Indian Ocean. The Trump Administration emphasizes the need to strengthen the military, highlighting the decrease in navy and air force size. Understanding the strategic dynamics between India and China is crucial for making military procurement decisions. Congress can assist in defining U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific, as seen in the introduction of H.R. 2621, \"Strengthening Security in the Indo-Asia-Pacific Act.\" The \"Strengthening Security in the Indo-Asia-Pacific Act\" introduced in May 2017 emphasizes the importance of the Indo-Asia-Pacific region to US national interests. It calls for maintaining military capability in the region to project power, deter aggression, and respond to threats. The legislation also highlights the need for continued US engagement in the region and expanding cooperative relationships with allies and partners. Congressional interest in the region was further demonstrated by a House Armed Services Committee hearing on security challenges in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. Admiral Harry Harris testified on the importance of the Indo-Pacific region to U.S. national interests, emphasizing the need for a strong America in the region. He also highlighted China's naval modernization program, which is on track to make it the world's second largest navy by 2020. U.S. policymakers' views on the China-India rivalry in the Indian Ocean Region will be influenced by their perspectives on China's rise and its potential threat to U.S. national interests. China's assertiveness in the Asia Pacific is driven by insecurity and opportunism, not a strategic plan to replace the U.S. Analysts see China as a rising competitor challenging the existing order, while India is viewed as a strategic opportunity for the U.S. in the region. The U.S. must prepare for all eventualities in the face of China's actions. India's rise is seen positively by U.S. strategic analysts for economic and strategic reasons. A strong India can help counter China's aggressive behavior in the Indian Ocean and Himalayan border. The U.S. energy landscape has changed with new domestic sources surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia in 2013. Natural gas production in the U.S. is projected to grow by 6% annually from 2017 to 2020. The U.S. energy landscape has changed with new domestic sources surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia in 2013. U.S. net imports of petroleum equaled 25% of U.S. petroleum consumption in 2016, up slightly from 24% in 2015. Despite growing energy independence, the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) remains strategically significant for the United States. Friends, allies, and China rely on energy and trade that transits the Indian Ocean. The strategic arguments for the Carter Doctrine are still relevant today. Despite the U.S. increasing energy production, it will continue to import oil. The Carter Doctrine, established in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, emphasizes the U.S.'s geostrategic focus on the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean Region. The U.S. aims to remain a key player in the region to protect its vital interests. The Carter Doctrine aimed to warn the Soviets against controlling energy resources in the Persian Gulf to maintain regional stability and U.S. access to energy. The Quad is a strategic response to China's rise in the Indo-Pacific, aligning states concerned about China's challenge to their interests. The Quad, consisting of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, was first convened in 2007 but experienced a ten-year hiatus in Australian participation. India's motivation to revive the group stems from the need for increased coordination on maritime security in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad emphasizes shared values in regional security groups. The Quad, comprising Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, aims to reinforce shared values in the global architecture and provide alternatives to predatory financing in the region. Reviving the security dialogue is seen as crucial in managing China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Some believe in the necessity of tough decisions to ensure a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific, while others question the effectiveness of the Quadrilateral group. China's growing economic and military power, particularly in naval capabilities, poses significant implications for India. The United States has sought to bolster India as a counterweight to China to prevent Chinese hegemony in Asia. There is a growing perception that China is expanding its influence and challenging the West, India, and the rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific region. China's geo-economic leverage, gained through the Belt and Road Initiative, challenges the West, India, and the rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific region. China's interest in Eurasia has strategic implications, with India concerned about encirclement through infrastructure projects with military implications. The Belt and Road initiative aims to rival the Euro-Atlantic region by turning the Eurasian landmass into an economic and strategic powerhouse. China-India strategic rivalry in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is influenced by various factors, including China's strengthening ties with Pakistan through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and its expanding presence in countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. India's concerns over sovereignty issues related to CPEC projects in Kashmir, border disputes, and China's opposition to India's international memberships also contribute to the rivalry. China's growing naval and military presence in the IOR, including bases in Djibouti and potentially Pakistan, further intensifies the competition. India's strategic interests include joining the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the United Nations Security Council, hosting the Dalai Lama and exiled Tibetans, pursuing the Act East Policy with Vietnam, addressing trade deficit with China, and navigating differences in political systems. India aims to maintain independence while welcoming US strategic overtures and aspiring for great power status in Asia under Prime Minister Modi's leadership. India's aspirations to great power status are longstanding, with several developments contributing to this goal. These include India's economic growth, modernization of its defense force, Prime Minister Modi's active foreign policy, and increasing economic interdependence. India's ability to achieve multidimensional success will determine if it becomes a leading power. India's growing status as a leading power is fueled by its strong economy (40% GDP from global trade), multi-polar world dynamics, and ambitions in South Asia and the Indian Ocean. With the world's fifth largest defense expenditure in 2016, India aims for greater connectivity with neighbors and an integrated Indian Ocean strategy. The country's transition reflects increased self-confidence and a shift towards aspiring to be a leading power, rather than just a balancing power, with a willingness to take on more global responsibilities. Ongoing border disputes with China and concerns over China's actions add to the complexities of India's foreign policy. India's growing status as a leading power is fueled by its strong economy and ambitions in South Asia and the Indian Ocean. Tensions with China and concerns over China's actions contribute to the complexities of India's foreign policy. India seeks to improve bilateral ties with China, with efforts to reset the relationship before the Prime Minister's visit to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in June 2018. The United States' support of a stronger India in world affairs is welcomed, but India's strategic autonomy and reluctance to antagonize China limit its relationship with Washington. In June 2018, India and China are making efforts to improve their bilateral ties following tensions. Prime Minister Modi and President Xi initiated a round of engagement focused on border confidence building measures. Both leaders emphasized the importance of peace and trust in border areas for further development of the relationship. Foreign Ministers met in December 2017 to discuss strengthening mutual trust. In December 2017, the Foreign Ministers of China, India, and Russia met in New Delhi to discuss common concerns and reiterated the importance of their trilateral platform. India joined the SCO in June 2017, and there are emerging implications of Sino-Indian rivalry in the Indian Ocean Region. This rivalry extends beyond the Himalayan border area. Indian analyst Raja Mohan suggests that India is open to dialogue with China on the Belt and Road Initiative if concerns on sovereignty and sustainability are addressed. The strategic competition between China and India is expanding into the Indian Ocean region, leading to potential development of naval assets with implications for U.S. naval procurement. This competition is increasing strategic linkages between East Asia, South Asia, and the Indian Ocean, shaping the broader Indo-Pacific region. India and China are both expanding their global presence, potentially leading to competition for resources in the Indian Ocean Region with impacts on global markets. Competition between China and India in the Indian Ocean region may drive India to strengthen ties with the United States and other regional partners. This rivalry could lead to opportunities for Indian Ocean states to leverage aid, military assistance, and trade benefits. The strategic competition may impact the United States' position in the region. Congressional oversight may be needed to address policy issues related to Sino-Indian rivalry in the Indian Ocean. The Trump Administration's strategy for responding to Sino-Indian rivalry in the Indian Ocean region and achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific is questioned. Congress may require a report on the development and implementation of this strategy. The evolving strategy towards the Indo-Pacific is questioned for being overly reliant on military tools post the US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Trump Administration's strategy towards the Indo-Pacific is being questioned, particularly regarding the impact of the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The State Department's staffing issues and the time and attention devoted to the Sino-Asia rivalry in the Indian Ocean region are also under scrutiny. The Trump Administration's strategy towards the Indo-Pacific is being questioned, particularly regarding the impact of the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The State Department's staffing issues and the time and attention devoted to tracking and responding to developments in the Indian Ocean region, including Sino-Indian rivalry, are also under scrutiny. The implications of this rivalry for U.S. relations with India, China, and other countries in the region, defense programs and spending levels, reliance on Indian military forces, and arms sales are all key considerations. China's military presence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) raises questions about U.S. arms sales and foreign assistance. The implications of Sino-Indian rivalry in the IOR on U.S. arms sales to India and other countries, foreign assistance funding allocation, and trade policy are key considerations. The Sino-Indian rivalry in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) raises questions about U.S. energy policy, congressional organization, and staffing. It may impact Persian Gulf oil supplies' role in U.S. foreign and defense policy and the optimal organization and staffing of congressional subcommittees. Geopolitics and geoeconomics provide a framework for Congressional decision-makers grappling with these implications. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a strategic plan focused on geopolitical dominance in the Eurasian region, using economic clout to achieve political goals. It aims to position China as the leading power in the region, impacting the Sino-Indian rivalry in the Indian Ocean Region. Other frameworks like the security dilemma could also be considered in this context. The \"Great Game\" concept, popularized by Rudyard Kipling, symbolized geopolitical competition on the Indian Subcontinent between the British East India Company and Czarist Russia. Today, a new Great Game in the Indo-Pacific involves economic competition between China, India, the United States, Japan, and Australia, with increasing strategic and military dimensions. This competition is reminiscent of the debate between Alfred Thayer Mahan and his work on sea power's influence on history. Alfred Thayer Mahan, Halford J. MacKinder, and Nicholas Spykman debated strategic control, with Mahan focusing on sea power, MacKinder on the Eurasian heartland, and Spykman on the \"rimland\" region of Eurasia. Their theories influenced geopolitical thinking during and after World War II. Discussions of heartland, rimland, and grand geopolitics in Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific region are resurfacing in strategic commentary. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger highlighted the systemic failure of world order and the return of traditional great power rivalry, emphasizing the need for a balance of power to prevent escalation. The renewed rivalry between major powers in the Indian Ocean region is a concern to prevent conflict. South Asia is seen as a subregion in need of strategic stability due to its importance in energy and security. The rivalry between China and India is intertwined with the rivalry between the United States and China in this region. Geostrategic debates inspired by Mahan, Mackinder, and Spykman are also evident in current discussions. In current Indian strategic debates, the focus is on deterring potential threats from China. There is a debate between developing a mountain strike corps for the Himalayan border defense or enhancing naval capabilities to interdict China's shipping in the Indian Ocean. Geopolitical concepts from Mahan, Mackinder, and Spykman influence Chinese strategic thinking, with the One Belt One Road project reflecting these ideas. The One Road project, influenced by geopolitical concepts from Mahan and Mackinder, aims to secure Eurasia and enable maritime ascendancy. America's strategic vision towards Asia is shifting towards the broader Indo-Pacific region, impacting security competition and cooperation in maritime Asia. The Indo-Pacific region is seen as a strategic system with growing economic, geopolitical, and security connections between the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean regions. Former Secretary of State Tillerson and Admiral Harris emphasized the importance of this region, stating that it will be the most consequential part of the globe in the 21st century. The Indian and Pacific Oceans are described as the economic lifeblood linking various countries, including India, Australia, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, Oceania, and the United States. Former President Obama also highlighted the Indian Ocean's significance to U.S. security interests across Asia. The Indo-Pacific region is strategically important for the U.S., with economic and security interests linked from the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean. The Obama Administration's rebalance to Asia strategy emphasized the region's significance, connecting U.S. interests in East Asia with concerns in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific Ocean. The concept of the Indo-Pacific has gained acceptance in various countries in the region. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the Asia-Pacific region as a key driver of global politics, extending the definition to include the Indian Ocean Region and South Asia. Geoeconomics, the use of economic instruments to promote national interests, is relevant for understanding Indo-Pacific dynamics, especially in relation to China's Belt and Road Initiative. The United States and China have utilized geoeconomics to further their geopolitical interests. Examples include the US's actions such as the Louisiana Purchase, Lend Lease Policy, Bretton Woods Agreement, Marshall Plan, and Suez Crisis, while China's use of geoeconomic power was demonstrated in its 2010 decision to halt rare earth elements exports to Japan. China's rare earth minerals dominance and efforts to shape the Asia-Pacific region were highlighted in a testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. The U.S. needs a new strategy to compete with China's influence, focusing on development financing, foreign assistance, coordination with allies, and trade. The Indo-Pacific region is defined by strategic choke points, including the Straits of Hormuz, Malacca, and the Bab el-Mandeb. These choke points are vulnerable to theft, terrorist attacks, and political unrest, impacting global energy costs. The Strait of Hormuz is the most critical oil transit choke point, with 35% of seaborne oil passing through it. The Strait of Malacca is a key choke point in Asia, with 35% of seaborne oil passing through it, primarily for Asia. It is deep and 21 miles wide at its narrowest point. Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia are located along the strait, with piracy being a threat. Approximately 120,000 vessels transit the strait each year, and any closure would force costly diversions through alternative routes. The Bab el-Mandeb Strait, located between Djibouti and Yemen, has been targeted by Houthi rebels. The Indian Ocean is the world's third-largest ocean with significant hydrocarbon reserves. It serves as a crucial energy and trade route connecting the Middle East, Persian Gulf, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Offshore oil and gas exploration in regions like the east coast of Africa and Australia's northwest coast increases strategic importance. The United States' military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has also heightened the area's strategic significance. The Indian Ocean has been of strategic importance for centuries, with fleets and bases established by Asian and European powers to secure trade routes. European colonial powers began extending influence in 1498, with the Portuguese establishing enclaves and trading posts in various locations. The Dutch East India Company, founded in 1602 in Batavia (present-day Jakarta), controlled much of Indonesia and the spice trade. The French, British, and Japanese followed earlier powers in the Indo-Pacific. The British Raj in India was a key part of the global British empire, with bases across the Indian Ocean. Japanese power extended into the western Pacific during World War II. During World War II, the Indian Ocean was briefly extended into the northeast quadrant following the fall of Singapore in 1942. Independence movements in the 1960s led to the end of colonial era in the Indo-Pacific, shifting power from colonial Europe to newly independent countries. China and India have ongoing land border tensions, stemming from a month-long border war in late 1962 that was a humiliating defeat for India. This conflict followed a 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese Communist Party rule, leading to the Dalai Lama's exile in India. Following the border war in 1962, China retained control over Aksai Chin, previously Indian territory, and disputes the border in Arunachal Pradesh. Buffer states like Bhutan and Nepal have come under pressure as China and India's power has expanded. Bhutan relies on India for defense, while Tibet and Sikkim also acted as buffers between the two countries. China's road-building activity in the disputed Doklam Plateau escalated border tensions with India in mid-2017. The plateau is located in territory disputed by Bhutan and China, near the Siliguri Corridor that links central India with its northeastern states. Control of the corridor by China would isolate millions of Indians. Bhutan has a special relationship with India but no diplomatic relations with China. Bhutan has a \"special\" relationship with India based on a 1949 Treaty of Friendship, giving India influence over defense and foreign affairs. The Doklam border tensions may be linked to China's displeasure over developing ties between India and the United States, or an effort to increase influence in Bhutan. Another view suggests it could be a signal of displeasure over India's decision not to join the BRI. India and China are at odds over the issue of border disputes, with India increasing defenses on its borders with Pakistan and China, and China upgrading its air defense capabilities in the Western Theater Command. China has expanded its claims to include Arunachal Pradesh, leading to protests when Indian officials visited the region. The area around Tawang is of particular concern to China due to its connections to Tibet. China's concern over the Tawang region is due to its religious and cultural ties to Tibet, as well as its strategic importance at the Bum La pass. The differences between India and China on border resolution are escalating, with China pressing its demands more extensively. China's reliance on sea routes through the Indian Ocean for energy and trade creates a strategic vulnerability, emphasizing the need to secure sea lines of communication. China is expanding its naval power projection capabilities in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific to secure alternative trade and energy routes, reducing its vulnerability at the Strait of Malacca. This development is a concern for India, other Asian states, and the U.S. Beijing is exploring overland energy routes from Xinjiang to Gwadar in Pakistan and through Burma to Yunnan province. China is developing alternative overland routes from the Indian Ocean through Burma to China's Yunnan Province. China's energy demand has increased significantly, making it the world's largest energy consumer and the second largest oil consumer. China's oil import dependency has grown, leading to diversification of oil sources. China is also a major producer, consumer, and importer of coal. China, the world's top coal producer, consumer, and importer, is looking to increase natural gas imports through pipelines and LNG. Its dependence on imported energy, mainly through the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Malacca, is a strategic vulnerability driving its engagement with the Indian Ocean Region. Overland energy linkages with Russia and Iran may reduce this vulnerability in the future. China's Belt and Road Initiative under Xi Jinping is shaping China's foreign policy outlook, making it an ideological and geopolitical rival to states like India and the United States. Xi's leadership is seen as increasingly autocratic and illiberal, with the initiative offering a new option for development while preserving independence. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), articulated by President Xi in 2013, aims to enhance China's trade and investment activities across the Indo-Pacific and beyond. It builds on historical trade links and seeks to secure China's continental periphery, energy security, political influence, and strategic expansion. The objective is to establish unrivaled Chinese influence in the region. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to achieve key objectives for China, including relieving domestic overcapacity, expanding trade routes, enhancing energy security, gaining influence, and reshaping the economic landscape of Eurasia and Asia. Some view BRI as a strategic move to deepen linkages between Indian and Pacific Ocean regions. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to reshape the economic landscape of Eurasia and Asia with China at its center. It includes six proposed overland corridors connecting China with South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean, potentially impacting China's relationship with India. The two most important routes in a South Asia/Indian Ocean context are CPEC and BCIM, with the latter facing challenges due to India's concerns about China's intentions. China's real intentions are a key concern in the BCIM corridor, focusing on infrastructure and investment from Kunming to Kyaukphyu. China's interest in having India join the BRI has led to sovereignty issues and a perception in India that the initiative aims to marginalize other major Asian powers. China's influence in the Indian Ocean region is expanding, encompassing trade, investment, and a military presence. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has garnered significant international cooperation, with India notably absent from key summits. This has raised concerns about India's foreign policy isolation. Analysts note China's rapid development of military presence in the Indian Ocean, with bases in Djibouti and potentially Gwadar, Pakistan. More bases are expected in East Africa and the central/eastern Indian Ocean. These bases will enhance China's capabilities for various operations, but it is unlikely to challenge U.S. dominance in the region soon. China's \"Far Sea Defense\" strategy reflects China's emerging power and increased confidence on the world stage. Premier Li Keqiang emphasizes the need for China to expand its air and naval defense capabilities due to deep changes in national security. China's naval modernization aims to defend Sea Lines of Communication and assert its status as a major world power. The Chinese navy deployed in the Indian Ocean in 2009. China's navy deployed in the Indian Ocean in 2009 as part of international anti-piracy operations, helping develop its long-range capabilities. China increased its naval presence in the Indian Ocean to 14 warships in December 2017. The commissioning of China's first aircraft carrier in 2012 and the launch of its second carrier in 2017 demonstrate efforts to enhance power projection capabilities. China is building its third aircraft carrier and plans to have four carrier battlegroups by 2030. China's military modernization program is focused on supporting missions beyond its periphery, including power projection and sea lane security. China is likely to establish additional military bases in countries with friendly relationships. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has shifted its focus from \"offshore waters defense\" to a mix of \"offshore waters defense\" and \"far seas protection\" to expand its operational reach. China's expanding interest in \"far seas protection\" is reflected in the high command's operational reach. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission's 2016 Report to Congress highlights China's growing global influence, particularly through initiatives like \"One Belt, One Road.\" This rise of China in South Asia is causing concern for traditional major power India, as China's support for Pakistan and military presence in the region are seen as potential threats. China's expanding naval capabilities and growing influence in the Indian Ocean are causing concern for India. China's support for Pakistan, military superiority along the China-India border, and increasing presence in the Indian Ocean indicate a strategy to encircle or contain India. The competition between China and India in the Indian Ocean is expected to escalate as both countries enhance their maritime capabilities. China's deployment of its first aircraft carrier in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait demonstrates its willingness to use naval power to achieve its objectives. Additionally, China's status as the world's third-largest arms exporter poses a security challenge for Indian Ocean countries. India's strategic posture in the Indian Ocean region has shifted towards maritime security, reflecting a significant change in geopolitical orientation. With a focus on its maritime borders, India's rivalry with China extends into the maritime domain, impacting states across the region and drawing the interest of the United States. India's military power, economic growth, and strategic location near key sea lanes highlight its importance in the region. China's arms transfers to countries in the Indian Ocean region, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, further contribute to the evolving dynamics in the area. India's strategic importance in the Indo-Pacific region is highlighted by key sea lanes from the Strait of Hormuz to the Strait of Malacca. India aims to develop strategic partnerships with the United States and Japan, shifting from old notions of non-alignment. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj's call to \"Act East\" in 2014 demonstrates India's objective of playing a more active role beyond South Asia. Popular perceptions in India show a growing favorability towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a positive view of the economy. In 2017, a Pew Research poll showed that a majority of Indians had a favorable view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the state of the economy. However, only 26% had a favorable view of China, marking a decline from previous years. Additionally, a decreasing number of Indians had a favorable view of the United States. Many Indians viewed China's growing economy and military power as a threat to India, indicating a shift in perceptions towards China. India's evolving role in international politics under Modi's leadership aims to transform outdated paradigms and establish the country as a leading power in Asia and the world. Concerns about China's rising influence in the Indian Ocean region have led to a more assertive strategic posture for India, with a focus on maintaining its influence among neighboring countries. Former Indian Foreign Secretary Saran has highlighted China's rise as the most significant challenge to India. India faces a significant challenge from China's rise, which seeks to narrow India's strategic space by penetrating its neighborhood. India has taken initiatives to counter China's presence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region, including the Act East policy, trade routes to Central Asia, the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, and the Quadrilateral initiative with the U.S., Japan, and Australia. The United States has collaborated with India to enhance regional stability. The United States collaborates with India on the Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor (IPEC) project to enhance engagement with Southeast Asia and promote regional stability. Prime Minister Modi's \"Act East\" policy signifies India's strategic interest in Southeast Asia and countering China's influence. India's economic interests drive the development of the underdeveloped northeast region. India is focusing on developing trade connectivity with Southeast Asia through infrastructure projects like the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway and the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transport project. Additionally, India is investing in the Chabahar port in Iran to establish a new trade route bypassing Pakistan, providing better access to Central Asian and Iranian natural gas. India is investing in the Chabahar port in Iran to establish a new trade route bypassing Pakistan, providing better access to Central Asian and Iranian natural gas. A $1.6 billion railroad is being built from Chabahar to Zahedan on the Iran/Afghanistan border, with rail linkages to Turkmenistan. India is also exploring the North-South Transport Corridor through the Iranian port of Bandar Abas to improve trade and transport linkages with Russia, the Caucuses, and Central Asia. Additionally, Prime Minister Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced plans for an Asia-Africa Growth Corridor focused on enhancing capacity and skills, quality infrastructure, development projects, and people-to-people partnership. Some view this corridor as a counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative. The Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) is seen as a partnership between India and Japan to create new sea corridors linking Africa, India, and countries in South and Southeast Asia. It is viewed as a counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative, with the annual Malabar naval exercises promoting maritime interoperability among India, the United States, and Japan in the Indo-Pacific region. China has reportedly tried to persuade India to slow down on the AAGC and keep Japan out of it. Malabar naval exercise, involving India, the United States, and Japan, began in 1992 and expanded to include Australia in 2014. India's relations with Australia improved with a 2014 nuclear cooperation agreement. China's concerns about India's involvement in the exercise are highlighted in a China Daily article. Geopolitical rivalry between China and India is evident in various states in the Indian Ocean Region. China's strategic military involvement in Djibouti, located on the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, includes the establishment of its first overseas military base in 2017 with a 10-year lease agreement allowing up to 10,000 troops. This move has raised concerns about Djibouti's ability to repay China's significant investments in the region. China has established its first overseas military base in Djibouti, raising concerns about the country's ability to repay loans to China. U.S. Pacific Commander Admiral Harry Harris highlighted China's potential force projection through Djibouti. China may also be looking to develop a second overseas base in Pakistan, where a strong strategic partnership exists, complicating relations with India. Pakistan plays a key role in China's Belt and Road Initiative and its Indo-Pacific influence. China's \"all weather friendship\" with Pakistan offers investment and acts as a strategic balancer against India. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a key project under China's Belt and Road initiative, with estimated investments of $46 billion in 2016. However, there is uncertainty over the actual investment amount, which may be less than announced. Pakistan owes an estimated $19 billion in debt to China. Pakistan's debt to China is linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a project aimed at improving Pakistani infrastructure and strengthening economic and political ties between the two countries. CPEC includes road, rail, and energy projects connecting Kashgar in China to Gwadar in Pakistan, providing much-needed infrastructure development. The project is seen as a positive factor in global security, with analysts suggesting that Washington and New Delhi should objectively study its benefits. CPEC is China's significant investment in Pakistan's economic development, aiming to create a 2000-mile economic corridor between Gwadar Port and China's Xinjiang region. The project includes infrastructure development such as highways, railways, pipelines, and a deep-water port in Gwadar. It is expected to create jobs, boost Pakistan's growth rate, and address energy shortages. Additionally, there are plans for a housing project for Chinese citizens and potential benefits for Pakistan's energy sector. CPEC energy projects in Pakistan aim to alleviate energy shortages. A Gwadar-Kashgar oil pipeline is set to be completed by 2021, reducing China's reliance on imported oil. Infrastructure upgrades include the Karakorum Highway, railway lines, and a new highway from Karachi to Lahore. Pakistan raised an Army division for security. China's economic leverage over Pakistan is increasing due to CPEC investments, with an estimated repayment of $90 billion over three decades. China's economic leverage over Pakistan is increasing due to CPEC investments, with an estimated repayment of $90 billion over three decades. China is a key security partner and major arms supplier to Pakistan, providing technology, expertise, and equipment for nuclear weapons and missile programs. China has also supplied tanks, aircraft, and small arms to Pakistan. Additionally, China and Pakistan have collaborated on nuclear reactor projects and held defense and security talks. In June 2017, Beijing hosted biannual naval exercises between China and Pakistan. Pakistan planned to purchase eight stealth attack submarines and frigates from China for $4 to $5 billion. There were reports of China potentially setting up a maritime logistics facility on the Makran coast and constructing a naval base and airfield at Jiwani. China's support for Pakistan, evident through the CPEC and military cooperation, highlights their strong relationship. India and Pakistan have a history of conflict, including wars in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999, as well as terrorist attacks like the 2001 parliament attack and the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Pakistan's alleged support for cross-border terrorism has made peace difficult to achieve, leading to ongoing tensions that concern U.S. policymakers. This volatile border situation also complicates efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. China's growing interest in Sri Lanka is driven by its strategic location near key sea lanes and its historical ties with India. China has increased security and economic assistance to Sri Lanka, playing a role in helping the country win the civil war against the LTTE. Sri Lanka aims to become an important economic hub in the Indian Ocean region and has attracted investment as part of China's Belt and Road initiative. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa welcomed Chinese naval ships, including a submarine, to Sri Lanka. China's growing interest in Sri Lanka is driven by its strategic location near key sea lanes and its historical ties with India. Total Chinese investment in Sri Lanka from 2005 to October 2017 is estimated at $14.87 billion. President Maithripala Sirisena sought to balance Sri Lanka's relations with China and India by revisiting Chinese investments, including the Colombo Port City project. Sri Lanka owed $8 billion to China in September 2016. The Sirisena government leased the Hambantota port to China for 99 years to help pay off its $65 billion debt to financiers. India has raised concerns about China's activities in Sri Lanka, particularly regarding the use of the port. India's relationship with Sri Lanka has historical ties, with India becoming involved in a counter-insurgency war against the LTTE in the late 1980s. The relationship was strengthened by visits between the two countries' leaders in 2015. India has also been a voice for reconciliation in Sri Lanka, particularly for the Tamil minority. The Maldives is seen as increasingly influenced by China in the Indian Ocean, with significant Chinese investments and agreements signed between the two nations. China's President Xi Jinping visited the Maldives in 2014, and the countries signed agreements on free trade and joined the Maritime Silk Road component of the BRI in 2017. China is funding major development projects in the Maldives, including a bridge from the capital, Mal\u00e9, to Hulhule Island. Concerns have been raised about the Maldives' high foreign debt owed to China. China's significant influence in the Maldives has raised concerns about the country falling into a debt trap, with 70% of its foreign debt owed to China. In 2018, China deployed a naval task force to the Indian Ocean during a constitutional crisis in the Maldives, which included warships that acted as a deterrent to Indian intervention. President Yameen declared a state of emergency and arrested Supreme Court Judges. This situation highlighted Beijing's determination to wield influence globally. India is enhancing its maritime surveillance capabilities in the Indian Ocean by developing its relationship with the Seychelles. A revised agreement signed in January 2018 allows India to build military infrastructure on Assumption Island, extending its strategic reach in the region. The cooperation agenda includes joint efforts in anti-piracy operations and enhanced surveillance to prevent intrusions in the Seychelles' exclusive economic zone. India is expanding its maritime surveillance capabilities in the Indian Ocean through cooperation with the Seychelles. This includes joint efforts in anti-piracy operations and enhanced surveillance to prevent intrusions in the Seychelles' exclusive economic zone. The Indian Navy has deployed assets and conducted joint military exercises with the Seychelles to strengthen defense capabilities. Prime Minister Modi visited the Seychelles in 2015 to launch initiatives for further collaboration. India is bolstering its maritime surveillance in the Indian Ocean by deploying radars and P-8I aircraft to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to counter China's expanding presence. The Seychelles has also signed agreements with China for infrastructure development projects. Bangladesh is strategically important due to its location between India, China, and Southeast Asia. Dhaka's foreign policy aims to strengthen ties with China while maintaining positive relations with India, the United States, and the West. India supported Bangladesh during its independence war in 1971, but relations have been mixed since then. Bilateral relations with India are more positive when the Awami League is in power. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina assured India in 2014 that Bangladesh would not support extremism. In 2015, a Land Boundary Agreement was reached during Modi's visit to Bangladesh, and India extended a $2 billion line of credit. However, tensions with India persist over issues like illegal immigration, water resources sharing, and Bangladesh's ties with China. The Teesta river dispute and Bangladesh's acquisition of submarines from China have caused concerns in New Delhi. China's strategic encirclement of India is seen through their deepening relationship with Bangladesh, including a Strategic Partnership and significant investments. China is a major arms supplier to Bangladesh, delivering submarines, patrol vessels, corvettes, tanks, and fighter jets since 2010. China's strategic partnership with Bangladesh includes significant arms exports, with Bangladesh being the second-largest destination for China's arms exports. The Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM) is a key pillar of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with India's reluctance potentially shifting the corridor's focus to the section between Kunming and the Rakhine coast in Burma. China is upgrading ports and infrastructure in Bangladesh to promote practical cooperation and support Bangladesh's growing export economy. China and Bangladesh were working on developing a deep-water port at Sonadia to anchor the Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar Economic Corridor. The project was canceled in February 2016 reportedly due to pressure from India, the United States, and Japan. Japan offered to loan $3.7 billion for the construction of a new port and related infrastructure. China is investing in new ports in Bangladesh, with a $4.6 billion cost for a port at Matarbari and a $15.5 billion investment for a port at Payra. China is also developing energy and trade routes in Burma, including oil and gas pipelines from Kunming to Kyaukpyu. The oil pipeline opened in 2017 and the gas pipeline in 2014, providing China with access to the Indian Ocean. China's influence in Burma faced setbacks in 2011 due to the country's transition to civilian-military rule, leading to a suspension of the Myitsone Dam project. Local resentment and protests have also arisen over land appropriation and inadequate compensation from mining operations by Chinese companies. China is now seeking to reestablish its influence in Burma through various initiatives, including exploring railroad linkages connecting Kunming and Southeast Asia. China is strengthening its influence in Burma by developing energy and trade connectivity through projects like a deep sea port and Special Economic Zone at Kyaukpyu, as well as investing in Rakhine with a pipeline to Western China. This move aims to reduce China's dependence on the Strait of Malacca and enhance its relationship with Burma. China is investing heavily in Rakhine with a $2.45 billion pipeline to Western China, aiming to secure a key route for importing crude oil from the Middle East. Additionally, Beijing has a $7.3 billion infrastructure development plan in Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone and a deep seaport, part of the Belt and Road program. This comes amidst the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine triggered by the Burmese military's operations against the Rohingya Muslim ethnic group. Burma's northwest coast on the Bay of Bengal has caused hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh, raising humanitarian concerns in the US and other Western countries. China's focus on Burma is mainly on trade and energy investments, with little emphasis on humanitarian issues. India is also strengthening ties with Burma for economic and strategic reasons, aiming to counter China's influence in the region. India is developing the $484 million Kaladan Multimodal Transport Project to enhance connectivity between Rakhine and Mizoram. The Transport Project aims to connect Sittwe in Rakhine with Mizoram in India, providing northeast India with a more direct route to the sea. India signed agreements with Burma in 2016 to develop the India-Myanmar-Thailand Highway. Malaysia, strategically located near the Strait of Malacca, balances relations with China and the United States, with limited ties to India. Malaysia, strategically located near the Strait of Malacca, balances relations with China and the United States. Malaysia's population is 50% Malay, 25% Chinese, and 7% Indian. In 2015, Malaysia and China began annual military exercises, and in 2016, they signed investment agreements worth $34 billion. Malaysia's relations with the United States were strained due to lawsuits related to the 1MDB scandal. Some observers believe Malaysia's recent diplomatic moves towards China may signal a strategic shift away from the U.S. despite continued military cooperation. The country's alignment shifts are influenced by a complex range of factors such as history, capabilities, and domestic politics. Australia, a treaty ally of the United States, has been developing strategic partnerships in the Indo-Pacific to counter China's rise and U.S. power decline. The export of uranium to India was facilitated by the Civil Nuclear Transfers to India Act. Prime Ministers Turnbull and Modi have reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful Indo-Pacific based on mutual respect and cooperation, sharing democratic values, rule of law, and international peace and security. Both India and Australia share common interests in maritime security and bilateral defense partnership. They aim to ensure the Indian Ocean architecture addresses regional issues and emerging threats. Bilateral naval and army exercises are scheduled for 2018 to deepen their security cooperation. In 2018, Australia and India reaffirmed their commitment to maritime security and safety of sea lines of communication during high-level visits. Prime Minister Modi visited Australia in 2014, the first Indian PM to do so in almost three decades. Both countries hold annual Foreign Ministers Framework Dialogue to advance their bilateral agenda. Australia and India have close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, which is vital for both countries' economic and strategic security. They also collaborate through the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). Bilateral trade has grown significantly, with Australia seeking an economic cooperation agreement with India to further boost trade. Australia's strategic vision is increasingly focused on India and the Indo-Pacific region, with a growing emphasis on the Indian Ocean as a zone of competition among major powers. Australia sees India as an important economic and security partner, as highlighted in the 2016 Defense White Paper. Australia and India have established mechanisms for strategic and defense cooperation, including a Framework for Security Cooperation in 2014. Bilateral defense relations are based on agreements from 2006 and 2009, with strategic dialogues and annual defense minister summits. Plans for research, development, and industry engagement were formalized during Prime Minister Modi's visit to Australia in late 2014. Despite strong defense cooperation between Australia and India, tensions have arisen in Australia's relationship with China due to issues such as political donations, land and infrastructure deals with Chinese businesses, and disputes over the South China Sea. Concerns over Chinese influence in Australia have been highlighted, with instances like Senator Sam Dastyari resigning over accepting Chinese corporate donations. The Northern Territory granted a 99-year lease to the Chinese-linked company Landbridge Group for port facilities in Darwin, a move that has raised security concerns. The port facilities in Darwin were leased to a Chinese-linked company, raising national security concerns. China's increasing investment in Australia, including in the agricultural sector, has sparked worries about Chinese influence. Australia has blocked certain sales to China on national security grounds, and there are concerns about Chinese buyers impacting real estate prices. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has called on China to respect international rulings on maritime disputes. The ruling by an arbitral tribunal under UNCLOS favored the Philippines over China's claims in the South China Sea in July 2016.
