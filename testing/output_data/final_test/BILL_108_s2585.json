The \"Small Business Jobs Tax Credit Act of 2004\" finds that population loss and low job growth in various parts of the US are causing people to leave their communities. A small business tax credit could promote job creation in these areas, utilizing the skilled workforce and revitalizing regions with limited federal investments. The \"Small Business Jobs Tax Credit Act of 2004\" aims to promote job creation in areas with population loss and low job growth. It introduces a tax credit for qualified small business employees hired by businesses located in development zones.

The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development designates a development zone with a population of 5,000 to 150,000, a poverty rate of at least 20%, and job growth below 2% in the preceding 5 years. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development designates development zones based on specific criteria, including population size, poverty rate, and job growth. The number of designations is limited to 100, and special rules apply for determining the amount of credit.
