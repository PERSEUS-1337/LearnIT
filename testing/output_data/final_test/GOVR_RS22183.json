    "content": "As parties to the GATT 1994, WTO Members must grant MFN treatment to like products of other Members. Tariff preference programs for developing countries are inconsistent with MFN obligations but have been accommodated for trade liberalization. In 1965, GATT Parties added Part IV to the General Agreement, recognizing the special economic needs of developing countries and the principle of nonreciprocity. A waiver of Article I was adopted in 1971 for the Generalized System of Preferences, allowing developed countries to provide more favorable tariff treatment to developing countries. Developing countries secured adoption of this system at the end of the GATT Tokyo Round in 1979. The Enabling Clause, adopted at the end of the GATT Tokyo Round in 1979, allows developing countries to receive differential and more favorable treatment without extending it to other contracting parties. This exception applies to preferential tariff treatment, multilateral nontariff preferences, arrangements among less developed countries, and special treatment for the least-developed countries. It has been incorporated into the GATT 1994 and a decision in 1999 waived GATT Article for preferential tariff treatment for least-developed countries. The Preferential Tariff Treatment for Least-Developed Countries waiver, extended until June 30, 2019, allows developing country Members to provide preferential tariff treatment to products of least-developed countries without extending the same rates to other Members. WTO Members can seek waivers of GATT obligations under Article IX:3 for preference programs falling outside the Enabling Clause or specific GATT articles. The WTO allows Members to waive GATT obligations for preference programs outside the Enabling Clause. The EU's Lom\u00e9 IV Convention provided benefits to ACP countries and deviated from MFN requirements. The EU deviated from MFN requirements for nonreciprocal free trade with developing countries under GATT Part IV and Article XXIV. GATT panels concluded that such a deviation was not justified. The EU obtained temporary waivers for the Lom\u00e9 agreement and the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. The European Union has been negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with ACP countries to replace the Cotonou Agreement. Concerns have been raised about the consistency of MFN clauses in the EPAs with the Enabling Clause. The United States administers various regional preferences with WTO waivers, including the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). GATT Article I:1 has been waived for tariff preferences for the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until December 31, 2016. The United States requested and received WTO waivers for regional trade preference programs such as CBERA, ATPA, and AGOA, with amendments made through December 31, 2014. The waivers included exemptions from GATT Article I:1 and Article XIII, paras. 1 and 2. The requests faced scrutiny from countries like Brazil, China, India, and Pakistan over textile issues, and Paraguay questioned its exclusion from the ATPA program. Ultimately, the U.S. requests were approved by the WTO Council on Trade in Goods in March 2009. The WTO Council on Trade in Goods approved the preferential-tariff programs in March 2009. The dispute between India and the EU over tariff preferences for combating illicit drug production was found to violate WTO obligations. The EU was in violation of GATT Article I:1 according to a report issued on December 1, 2003. The Enabling Clause serves as an exception to the GATT Article I:1 MFN obligation, with the burden of proof on the party invoking it. Developed countries must provide \"identical tariff preferences\" to all developing countries under GSP schemes. The Drug Arrangements were deemed inconsistent with GATT Article I:1. The AB report upheld that the Enabling Clause is an exception to GATT Article I:1, and both provisions must be considered in evaluating measures like the Drug Arrangements. The panel first assesses compatibility with Article I:1 and then examines if the measure can be justified under the Enabling Clause. The AB modified the panel's finding regarding the Enabling Clause, stating that India needed to raise it in their claim of inconsistency with GATT 1994. The burden of justifying GSP schemes under the Enabling Clause provisions still lies with the respondent. The AB reversed the panel's decision on the breadth of acceptable preference programs under the Enabling Clause, stating that developed countries can grant preferences beyond their GSP to developing countries with specific needs, as long as all similarly situated GSP beneficiaries receive identical treatment. The AB upheld the Panel's ruling that the EU failed to prove the Drug Arrangements were \"non-discriminatory\" due to closed beneficiary lists and lack of objective criteria. The U.S. representative was pleased with the AB's decision. In December 2009, Congress extended the GSP and Andean trade preference programs to December 31, 2010, continuing an existing denial of benefits to Bolivia. In December 2010, Congress enacted legislation extending Andean trade preferences, as accorded to Colombia and Ecuador, through February 12, 2011. Andean benefits for Peru, which has been a party to a free trade agreement, were also extended. The Andean benefits for Peru under the free trade agreement with the United States were terminated on December 31, 2010. The GSP program was extended through July 31, 2013, with retroactive application of duty-free rates. The U.S-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement extended ATPA benefits to Colombia and Ecuador until July 31, 2013. Colombia was removed from the GSP and ATPA programs when the U.S-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement took effect on May 15, 2012. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act program was made permanent. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) program has been made permanent and extended through September 30, 2020, along with tariff benefits from the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act and Haiti. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) program is authorized until September 30, 2015. Legislation such as H.R. 2387, S. 105, and S. 1244 aim to provide duty-free benefits for certain apparel items from the Philippines, contingent on meeting trade and customs conditions. S. 1443 would extend duty-free treatment for specific items until December 31, 2022. H.R. 913 (Aderholt) and S. 433 (Sessions) aim to extend the GSP program through June 30, 2012, with retroactive application to entries after December 31, 2010. S. 308 (Casey) proposes extending the GSP program and ATPA benefits for Colombia and Ecuador until June 30, 2012, with retroactive application. Certain sleeping bags would be ineligible for benefits under these programs. S. 380 (McCain) would extend ATPA benefits to Colombia and Ecuador through November 30, 2012, with retroactive application to entries made after February 12, 2011. Certain sleeping bags would be ineligible for GSP benefits, with exceptions for higher-value bags and certain kits."
