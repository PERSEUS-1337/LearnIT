It includes findings, establishment, activities, administrative provisions, and authorization of appropriations. The \"Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act of 2005\" establishes the Center for Caribbean Basin Trade to assist countries in the region improve their trade capacities. The Organization of American States (OAS) has experience in developing trade capacity initiatives and programs for countries in the Western Hemisphere. The Secretary of State is authorized to establish a Center for Caribbean Basin Trade through a voluntary contribution to the Organization of American States. The Center will focus on activities to enhance trade capacities in the region. The Center for Caribbean Basin Trade will provide technical assistance to government officials and private sector representatives in developing trade agreements, export readiness for firms, upgrading port facilities, strengthening security measures, customs procedures, and other critical infrastructure for trade in Caribbean Basin countries. The Center for Caribbean Basin Trade offers training and consulting services to government officials and private sector representatives in the region on import requirements of major trading countries, including the United States, and financing mechanisms. The Secretary of State will collaborate with the Organization of American States to determine the Center's location, staffing, programs, and methodology. Congress believes a study should be conducted to decide on a permanent location for the Center. The Caribbean Basin Skills-Based Training Program aims to provide training and consulting on import requirements and financing mechanisms. Congress acknowledges the need to prioritize secondary education in Western Hemisphere countries, including the Caribbean Basin, to address the widening educational gap hindering job growth. Access to education is crucial in combating poverty and promoting economic growth in the region.
