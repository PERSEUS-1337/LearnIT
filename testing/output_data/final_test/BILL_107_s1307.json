    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"China Free Enterprise Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that increasing privatized and start-up enterprises in China will benefit the country's people and economy. Limiting Chinese state-owned enterprises' access to US capital markets will encourage privatization efforts and deter support for autocratic governments. Investments in state-owned enterprises affiliated with China's military and technology industries could harm US interests due to China's military buildup, policies in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, and arms proliferation efforts. State-owned Chinese enterprises raising funds in the US fail to disclose their global business operations, including support for Sudan's government. State-owned Chinese company Sinopec offered securities in the US without disclosing its activities in Sudan and negotiations in Iran's energy sector, potentially violating sanctions. Limiting Chinese state-owned enterprises' access to US capital markets may not harm US businesses, consumers, investors, or the free flow of capital. Limiting Chinese state-owned enterprises' access to US capital markets will not harm the people of China and does not violate trade agreements. SEC. 3. BAN ON SECURITIES MARKET ACCESS.
