    "content": "Most federal employees are paid on the General Schedule (GS), which has 15 pay grades based on job performance and length of service. The Department of Defense (DOD) created the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) to link employee pay to job performance, but it faced criticism for inconsistencies and pay inequities. The National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2010 terminated the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) for DOD employees. By January 1, 2012, all NSPS employees had to be returned to the General Schedule (GS) or their previous pay system. Approximately 76% of NSPS employees were converted to the GS, with the remaining 24% placed in other pay scales. Approximately 4% of NSPS employees may lose their jobs due to military base closures from the 2005 BRAC findings. 72% of employees who transitioned to the GS received a pay raise. Virginia and California had the highest number of NSPS employees, while Vermont had the fewest. As of January 2011, around 54,000 DOD employees were still in NSPS. P.L. 111-84 ensured no pay decrease for employees transitioning out of NSPS, with 35,117 placed on \"retained pay\" as per statute (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5363). Employees who were in NSPS as of January 2, 2011, and received a performance rating of \"3\" or above for 2010 may qualify for a performance-based bonus or pay raise in 2011. Those on retained pay receive half of the annual pay adjustment for employees at the step 10 level of their GS pay grade. Some argue that NSPS employees on retained pay receive higher pay for similar work than GS employees, while others see the cap on annual pay increase as a loss in pay. Employees in NSPS for only part of 2010 or with a performance rating of \"2\" or below do not qualify for a performance-based bonus or pay raise. NSPS employees rated \"3\" or higher in 2010 may qualify for performance-based bonuses funded by existing pay system allocations. DOD states that 98.5% of NSPS employees are eligible for bonuses. Congressional oversight may continue on employees transitioning from NSPS to other pay systems. The report focuses on transitioning employees from NSPS to non-NSPS pay scales as required by P.L. 111-84. DOD had until January 1, 2012, to convert all NSPS employees to their previous pay system or a new one if necessary. As of September 30, 2010, 76% of employees had transitioned from NSPS to the GS pay system. Another 20% will be placed in other pay systems, and 4% will lose their jobs due to base closures. Some employees will move to new systems not yet established. DOD was authorized to create demonstration pay systems at certain defense-related laboratories. By April 2011, DOD must transition eligible employees from NSPS to new personnel systems at defense-related laboratories. Most positions under NSPS were previously classified under GS grades and steps. Employees returning to GS scale will maintain their pay level, with adjustments made to ensure no decrease in pay. If an employee's NSPS pay falls between two GS steps, they will be assigned to the higher step. Employees transitioning from NSPS to GS or similar pay scales may have been collecting pay rates higher than the position's GS grade classification permits. Under P.L. 111-84, these employees will continue to receive their NSPS rate of pay under pay retention statutes when converting to the GS system. The pay rate cannot be used in performance evaluations. For example, a GS-13 employee in 2011 could earn up to $93,175 at step 10, with a locality-adjusted rate potentially reaching $115,742 in the Washington, DC area. Supervisory employees in NSPS were not capped at this pay rate. Employees transitioning from NSPS to GS or similar pay scales may continue to receive their NSPS rate of pay under pay retention statutes. The pay rate is not capped and could be higher than the GS grade classification permits. For example, a GS-13 employee in 2011 could earn up to $93,175 at step 10, with a locality-adjusted rate potentially reaching $115,742 in Washington, DC. The adjusted basic pay rate for a hypothetical NSPS employee in DC would be $118,009. Pay retention ensures the employee's salary remains at this level when transitioning to the GS system. Employees transitioning from NSPS to GS or similar pay scales may continue to receive their NSPS rate of pay under pay retention statutes. The pay rate is not capped and could be higher than the GS grade classification permits. Pay retention ensures the employee's salary remains at this level when transitioning to the GS system, based on the GS grade assigned to the position. Agencies are required to provide employees on pay retention with half of the annual pay increase given to employees at the maximum payable rate for the GS grade (step 10) to which their position is classified. The employee's pay increase is calculated as a percentage of the pay increase given to an employee at step 10 of the GS grade to which their position is assigned. The employee will continue to receive a retained rate of pay until their GS rate of pay surpasses their retained NSPS rate of pay. The time it takes for this to happen depends on various factors, including future pay increases enacted by Congress. Approximately 72% of former NSPS employees transitioning to GS received a salary increase, with an average increase of $1,454 per year. Some employees kept their NSPS pay rate, while others are receiving a retained NSPS pay rate despite a lower GS classification. NSPS employees have opportunities to grieve new assignments and can seek information on filing grievances or alternative dispute resolution from their human resources office. Employees transitioning from NSPS to GS have various options for addressing pay issues. They can contact their local union representatives for a negotiated grievance procedure, appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) for pay reduction claims, or challenge their position's classification through a specific process. Those placed on pay retention when moving to a different pay schedule may suggest a loss in pay due to not receiving the full annual pay increase. Employees transitioning from NSPS to GS have various options for addressing pay issues. They may receive a retained pay rate, which allows them to keep their NSPS pay rate but only receive half of the annual pay increase given to GS employees until their pay rate in the GS system surpasses their NSPS rate. Once removed from NSPS, employees on retained pay no longer receive NSPS performance-based pay increases, but they can collect higher pay and qualify for larger pension benefits compared to GS employees. Employees transitioning from NSPS to GS have the option of receiving a retained pay rate, allowing them to maintain their NSPS pay rate. However, they will only receive half of the annual pay increase given to GS employees until their GS pay rate surpasses their NSPS rate. Some employees on retained pay may receive higher pay rates than GS employees with similar classifications. As of October 10, 2010, five employees transitioning from NSPS to GS have appealed their GS classification, with one appeal denied and four pending. Congress mandated the return of all employees to their previous pay system when NSPS was eliminated in 2010. DOD is working on placing NSPS employees into appropriate pay scales, including developing a new pay system. Congress has options to address pay and personnel issues, such as ensuring all employees receive full annual pay increases and modifying the GS system. DOD is determining where to place NSPS employees, including placing some on retained pay, which has led to complaints about potential pay disparities. Congress may need to ensure DOD's policies align with statutory requirements. The policies must align with P.L. 111-84 and Title 5 of the U.S. Code regarding civil service. Congress may need to address potential pay disparities for NSPS employees transitioning to a non-NSPS pay scale. Legislation may be enacted to ensure employees on retained pay receive the full annual pay increase, potentially causing retained pay rates to exceed GS pay rates indefinitely. Employees on retained pay could receive a performance-based cash award to supplement their pay and offset any loss due to the cap on their annual pay adjustment. The award, based on performance ratings of fully successful or above, can be up to $10,000 without OPM approval or up to $25,000 with approval. This could help address concerns about pay disparities for employees transitioning from NSPS to a non-NSPS pay scale. The one-time cash award for federal employees is designed to reward exemplary performance, based on specific criteria outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations. The award is not considered part of an employee's basic pay and does not count towards their annuity. The award may be given for suggestions, inventions, superior accomplishments, special acts in the public interest, or performance at a fully successful level or above. DOD could provide cash awards to employees on retained pay until their GS basic pay rate surpasses the NSPS pay rate. However, additional funding from Congress may be necessary for this. Employees in the GS system may not receive the same pay as those on retained pay, prompting Congress to consider adjusting the GS pay scale to align with NSPS rates. Legislation could be enacted to incorporate NSPS pay rates into the personnel system. The addition of new GS steps may complicate operations and policies, requiring new regulations and potentially higher costs. P.L. 111-84 mandated DOD to establish a new performance management system and hiring process, with Congress overseeing the implementation to address concerns from affected parties."
