The Congress finds that communities are working with various organizations to improve health and reach national objectives. Community leaders are addressing barriers in underserved areas and acting as bridges to local health services. These leaders, known as community health advisors, have unique knowledge of their communities' needs. Community health advisors play a crucial role in bridging the gap between community members and health service providers. They provide essential health information, increase the utilization of preventive health services, and contribute to improving the overall quality of life in their communities. They are key players in achieving the Healthy People 2000 vision for the new century. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"authorized program services\" as services approved in section 5(a) for a community health advisor program. A \"community health advisor\" is an individual who can perform these services, has lived in the community for at least a year, and is part of the target population. A \"community health advisor program\" is a program following a plan under section 5(a). The term \"financial assistance\" for an award under section 4 includes grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts. \"Healthy People 2000 Objectives\" are goals set by the Secretary to improve health outcomes in the US by 2000. A \"medically underserved community\" is defined as a community with a significant number of medically underserved individuals. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the term \"State\" includes all states, the District of Columbia, and various territories.

Subsection (b) calculates the amount based on 50% of funds appropriated under section 11 and the population ratio. Subsection (c) calculates the amount based on poverty levels. The amount determined under subsection (c) for poverty level is the product of the amount determined under subsection (b)(1) and the percentage constituted by the ratio of individuals residing in the State whose income is at or below 200 percent of the official poverty line.

This Act clarifies that the Secretary is not required to modify or terminate the Community Health Representative Program. Funding for this program should not be replaced by awards under section 4. In communities where both this program and a community health advisor program are in place, they should work together. Authorization of Appropriations for fiscal years 1996 through 2001 is provided under this Act. If funds are insufficient for state awards under section 4, the Secretary can make discretionary awards. Awards under section 4 are made on a discretionary basis by the Secretary, who determines which States or designated entities will receive the awards and the amount of the awards."
