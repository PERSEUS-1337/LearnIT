    "content": "Electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution, emitting gases like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. These pollutants pose risks to human health and welfare, with some gases regulated under the Clean Air Act. Carbon dioxide also contributes to global warming. Estimates show emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 from these facilities, with uncertain annual emissions of mercury. Utilities are subject to various regulations. The evolution of air pollution controls for electric utility generating facilities is complex, with regulations affecting operating costs and new construction. Controls for NOx, SO2, and Hg are being developed, along with voluntary CO2 emission limits under the UNFCCC. The Bush Administration rejected mandatory limits in favor of a voluntary reduction program. The Senate passed a Sense of the Senate in June 2005 calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases without significant harm to the economy. Calls for a simplified approach to air quality control have increased due to new control programs on pollutants like SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 intersecting with changes in the electric utility industry. The \"multi-pollutant\" approach aims to balance regulatory and economic mechanisms for utility emissions. The Bush Administration proposed the \"Clear Skies\" legislation in 2002 to control emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 from electric utilities through emission caps and a tradeable allowance program. The proposal aimed to balance environmental goals with industry stability and was introduced in Congress as H.R. 999 and S. 485 in the 108th Congress. The Bush Administration proposed a new voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program in response to the U.S. ratification of the 1992 UNFCCC. The plan focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy and projects a 100 million metric ton reduction in emissions by 2012. Total emissions would still rise, but the goal is to reduce emissions per million dollars of GDP from 183 to 151 by 2012. The Bush Administration proposed a voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program to improve carbon efficiency, aiming for a reduction in emissions per million dollars of GDP from 183 to 151 by 2012. Several bills in Congress aim to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, including carbon dioxide regulations. Several bills introduced in Congress propose emission caps starting in the 2009-2012 timeframe, with some including a second phase from 2013-2015. These bills utilize a tradeable credit program for SO2, NOx, and CO2 caps, with plant-wide averaging allowed for Hg requirements. The provisions in these bills are stricter than previous legislation. It is challenging to compare the CO2 caps in these bills with the Administration's voluntary proposal, which covers all greenhouse gas emissions. The details of the five bills are outlined in the Appendix. The five bills introduced in the 110th Congress propose a tradeable allowance scheme to implement emission caps on SO2, NOx, and CO2. The bills differ in their allowance allocation schemes, with detailed provisions in S. 1201 and S. 1554 for allocating allowances to various economic sectors and interests. The five bills in the 110th Congress propose a tradeable allowance scheme to implement emission caps on SO2, NOx, and CO2. S. 1201 mandates 100% auctioning of annual allowance allocation within 15 years. S. 1168 bases allowance formulas on fuel usage with 25% auctioned. S. 1177 sets limitations based on electricity output and current Title IV program. H.R. 3989 auctions 100% CO2 allowances with EPA discretion on SO2 and NOx allowances. The bills in the 110th Congress propose emission caps on SO2, NOx, and CO2. They differ in their approach to reducing mercury emissions, with varying reduction targets and compliance timelines. H.R. 3989 is the most stringent, imposing emissions limitations on a unit-by-unit basis. The Administration's CO2 proposal focuses on voluntary programs and incentives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The bills in the 110th Congress propose emission caps on SO2, NOx, and CO2. They differ in their approach to reducing emissions, with varying reduction targets and compliance timelines. S. 1168, S. 1177, S. 1201, and S. 1554 propose mandatory CO2 reduction programs, while H.R. 3989 has the most detailed reduction scheme with substantial reductions from coal-fired facilities scheduled through 2050. Comparing the mandatory reduction programs with the Administration's voluntary program is like comparing apples to oranges. S. 1168, S. 1177, S. 1201, S. 1554, and H.R. 3989 propose emission caps and reduction targets for greenhouse gases. These bills include provisions for offsets, sequestration efforts, and allowance allocations for renewable energy and clean coal technology. S. 1201 specifically requires the EPA to develop standards for geologic and biological sequestration. The bill would have modified provisions in the Clean Air Act for electric generating facilities, replacing NSPS with statutory standards for SO2, NOx, particulate matter, and Hg for new sources. Compliance with these standards would exempt facilities from various requirements such as NSR, PSD-BACT, visibility BART, MACT for Hg, and non-attainment LAER and offset requirements. The bill proposed exemptions for electric generating facilities from various Clean Air Act requirements, including NSR, PSD-BACT, visibility BART, MACT for Hg, and non-attainment LAER and offset requirements. It also included exemptions for industrial sources meeting particulate matter standards and good combustion practices, as well as an exemption for steam electric generating facilities from Hg regulation. The bills in the 110th Congress aim to revise the New Source Review program for older electric generating units to meet stricter SO2 and NOx standards by specific deadlines. Some bills also introduce new CO2 standards and eliminate caps from the Clean Air Interstate Rule. Additionally, new regulatory programs like an Efficiency Performance Standard and Renewable Portfolio Standard would be implemented through credit trading programs."
