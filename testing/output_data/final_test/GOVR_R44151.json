    "content": "The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) passed in 1982 mandated the federal collection of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level nuclear waste (HLW) for safe disposal. The Department of Energy (DOE) is required to transport SNF from commercial nuclear power plants to a permanent repository. Defense-related HLW may be stored separately if deemed necessary by the President. Congress aimed to address political challenges by establishing a scientific basis for the disposal facility. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982 established a multi-stage process for selecting a permanent geologic repository for nuclear waste. The DOE would develop the repository, funded by nuclear power providers through the Nuclear Waste Fund. The responsibility for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel lies with the owners and operators of nuclear power reactors. The federal government's authority for interim storage capacity expired in 1990. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982 established a process for selecting a permanent geologic repository for nuclear waste. The government's authority to license a monitored retrievable storage facility is conditioned on the NRC issuing a license for a permanent repository. Spent fuel from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors is stored at various sites, and the NWPA governs the establishment of a permanent repository through a multi-stage process involving the President, Congress, DOE, and the NRC. The NWPA of 1982 established a process for selecting a permanent geologic repository for nuclear waste. The Secretary recommended Deaf Smith County, Texas; Hanford, Washington; and Yucca Mountain, Nevada as candidate sites in 1986. Congress amended the site selection process in 1987, designating Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site for the repository. The 1987 amendments designated Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site for the repository. Yucca Mountain underwent extensive inspection and study to determine compliance with suitability guidelines. DOE obtained temporary water permits in 1992 for site characterization. In 1997, DOE filed applications for water rights needed for geologic repository operations. The DOE filed applications for water rights at the Yucca Mountain site, but they were denied in 2000. Litigation ensued over the denial, while the federal government faced legal action for not meeting its obligation to accept SNF by 1998. Despite safety concerns raised by Nevada, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham recommended the site for a repository. President George W. Bush approved the Yucca Mountain site for a repository in 2002, despite Nevada's objection. Congress passed a resolution to override Nevada's disapproval, ending the site approval stage of the process. The next stage began in June 2008 when the DOE... The fourth stage of the NWPA process started in June 2008 when DOE submitted a license application for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository to the NRC. The NRC is required to make a final decision on the construction authorization within 3 years of the application submission. The NRC was reviewing an 8,600-page license application for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository when the Obama Administration changed policy, stating Yucca Mountain is not a viable option for nuclear waste storage. The Administration sought to defund the project and established a commission to explore alternative solutions. The DOE attempted to terminate the NRC's Yucca Mountain licensing proceeding and recommended the closure of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. Funding for the Yucca Mountain facility has not been requested in recent budget proposals, leading to the official closure of OCRWM in 2010 after years of funding reductions. The Yucca Mountain project funding decreased from $288 million in FY2009 to $197 million in FY2010. Congress has not allocated funds for the project since then. The President established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to explore alternatives for nuclear waste storage. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future issued its final report on January 26, 2012, recommending a new \"consent-based approach\" for selecting nuclear waste repository sites. The commission emphasized deep geologic disposal as the most promising method for disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new approach for selecting nuclear waste repository sites, emphasizing deep geologic disposal as the most promising method. It also suggested the establishment of a single-purpose organization to oversee nuclear waste disposal, removing control from the Department of Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended deep geologic disposal as the best method for nuclear waste. The commission urged prompt efforts to develop consolidated storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel to meet waste acceptance obligations sooner. However, legal authority for centralized storage is lacking under the NWPA. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended deep geologic disposal as the best method for nuclear waste. The commission urged prompt efforts to develop consolidated storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel to meet waste acceptance obligations sooner. DOE responded with a new waste strategy in 2013, calling for a \"consent-based\" process to select storage and disposal sites. The strategy aims for geologic repository siting by 2026, with licensing completed by 2042 and operations starting by 2048. President Obama supported the strategy in 2015, authorizing planning for a separate repository. The DOE's 2013 strategy authorized planning for a separate repository for high-level radioactive waste from defense activities, reversing a previous decision to dispose of defense and civilian waste together. Public comments were sought on the consent-based siting components, with controversial actions including the attempt to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application. The DOE withdrew its Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, citing policy considerations and advancements in technology as reasons for seeking better alternatives. The decision came after NRC's review process, which included technical evaluation and adjudication of nearly 300 contested issues. The DOE withdrew its Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, stating it did not plan to refile. This decision sparked opposition from various parties who filed legal claims in different venues to intervene and stop the withdrawal. The DOE withdrew its Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, sparking legal battles over the Secretary's authority and the NRC's obligation to review the application. The dispute centered on specific statutory language within the NWPA, particularly Section 114, which outlines the process for obtaining site approval and construction authorization for a permanent repository like Yucca Mountain. The NRC received an application for a construction authorization for a repository, and must issue a final decision within 3 years. The Board ruled that the DOE couldn't unilaterally withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, as Congress had established a specific procedure for the process. The NRC Board held that Congress had established a detailed procedure for the license application process, removing control from the Secretary. The NRC Chairman directed staff to use funds to close down the review of the Yucca Mountain license application. The NRC Chairman instructed staff to continue Yucca Mountain activities in line with the FY2011 budget request, despite opposition from two commissioners. The NRC released an order on September 9, 2011, stating the Commission was evenly divided on whether to overturn or uphold the Board's decision. The order directed the Board to complete all necessary case management activities by the end of the fiscal year due to budgetary limitations. The NRC Chairman instructed staff to continue Yucca Mountain activities despite budget uncertainties. The Board suspended the proceeding due to funding and staffing uncertainties, but the decision to deny DOE's motion to withdraw the license still stands. Parties filed cases in federal court to oppose the termination, with claims consolidated in the D.C. Circuit alleging violations of various statutes. In July 2011, the D.C. Circuit dismissed challenges to the DOE license withdrawal as unripe. However, plaintiffs could have had more success challenging the NRC's obligation to review the license application. The parties re-filed, arguing that the NRC lacked authority to terminate the licensing process. In August 2012, the court held the case in abeyance until December 14, 2012, to await updates on FY2013 appropriations. In August 2013, the D.C. Circuit issued a writ of mandamus ordering the NRC to resume processing DOE's license application for Yucca Mountain. The court stated that the NRC had sufficient funds to continue the licensing process and that Congress had not taken further action on the matter. The court emphasized that the NRC was defying a law enacted by Congress without any legal basis. The court ruled that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must continue with the legally mandated licensing process for the Department of Energy's application for Yucca Mountain, stating that Congress had not repealed or suspended the mandate. The dissenting opinion argued against ordering what they deemed a useless act. Following the decision granting the writ of mandamus, the State of Nevada sought rehearing en banc, but its petition was denied. Certain petitioners moved to recover attorneys' fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, with one claim settled and the court denying the remaining claims on October 23, 2014. Nye County submitted motions to lift the suspension of the licensing proceeding for Yucca Mountain, prompting the NRC to gather budgeting information and complete the Safety Evaluation Report for construction authorization. The NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application, directing staff to undertake records management activities. They declined to resume contested adjudication and requested DOE to prepare an EIS supplement due to deficiencies in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) regarding groundwater impacts. The NRC recognized the primary responsibility for evaluating environmental impacts lies with either DOE or the NRC. The NRC, not DOE, would be preparing the EIS supplement for the Yucca Mountain project. The NRC anticipated using nearly all of the $11 million in funds for the SER and EIS supplement, leading to orders for efficient fund use and restrictions on general appropriations for Yucca Mountain-specific activities. NRC Chairman Stephen Burns testified that $330 million in additional appropriations would be needed to complete the licensing process for the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository. Key deficiencies were found in NRC staff's Safety Evaluation Report related to DOE's land and water rights at the site, which would need to be resolved before a license could be granted. The NRC staff generally approved the safety and regulatory compliance of DOE's application for the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository, pending resolution of land and water rights issues. The SER volumes evaluated the repository design and concluded it complied with NRC regulations with certain conditions. The NRC staff approved DOE's application for the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository, stating it complies with regulations but has issues with land ownership. The GROA and surrounding land within the proposed preclosure controlled area are under the control of federal agencies. DOE had submitted a land withdrawal bill to Congress in 2007 but it was not enacted. NRC regulations require DOE to have obtained water rights for the repository, but their attempts have not been successful. The NRC staff found that DOE's actions to obtain water rights for the repository were unsuccessful, leading to the regulatory requirements not being satisfied. As a result, the NRC did not recommend issuing a construction authorization at that time. However, proposed conditions for construction authorization were included in the SER, and a supplement to DOE's 2002 EIS was released in 2016 to address potential environmental impacts at Yucca Mountain. The NRC found that potential impacts from a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain would be small. DOE's lack of water rights for the repository is a regulatory deficiency highlighted in the Safety Evaluation Report. The legal framework for water rights in Nevada is primarily governed by state law, requiring users to put water to beneficial use. Beneficial uses include irrigation, mining, stock watering, recreation, commercial, industrial, and municipal uses. The appropriative rights system of water allocation follows the principle of 'use it or lose it' in the West where water resources are scarce. In Nevada, water users must demonstrate actual beneficial use of water to obtain permits from the State Engineer. The State Engineer oversees appropriations of surface water and groundwater, requiring a permit for any new water use or changes to existing rights. The permit application must detail the amount of water needed, purpose, proposed works, and timeline for construction and use. The \"use it or lose it\" principle applies, preventing speculation or holding onto unused water rights. In Nevada, water users must demonstrate actual beneficial use of water to obtain permits from the State Engineer. The applicant must prove good faith intention, financial ability, and reasonable expectation to construct necessary works for the intended use. The State Engineer rejects applications without unappropriated water, conflicting uses, or detrimental public interest. Appropriations cannot exceed what is reasonably required for the intended use. DOE submitted five water permit applications to the Nevada State Engineer on July 22, 1997, seeking to appropriate 430 acre-feet annually from the groundwater of the Fortymile Canyon \u2013 Jackass Flat Hydrographic Basin for industrial purposes related to the proposed Yucca Mountain repository. The State Engineer has the authority to grant certificates of appropriation only after proof of beneficial use is demonstrated. The DOE submitted water permit applications for the Yucca Mountain repository, which were denied by the State Engineer due to a Nevada statute banning radioactive waste storage. The federal district court later overturned the ruling but the State Engineer denied the applications again, citing concerns about detrimental effects on the Nevada public. The district court granted a stay of water rights proceedings related to the Yucca Mountain project, citing unresolved licensing issues. The court maintained the stay, allowing only for the DOE to file an amended complaint with the State Engineer's updated ruling. The litigation remains stayed pending resolution of the licensing question. The litigation remains stayed as the licensing question remains uncertain, particularly given DOE's current opposition to the repository. The NRC's publication of the SER may have resolved some questions regarding the repository's licensability. If the stay is lifted, the court could affirm the State Engineer's ruling, overturn it, or remand it for a new ruling. Other parties have initiated litigation to prevent progress on the Yucca Mountain repository. Parties have initiated litigation to prevent progress on the Yucca Mountain repository, with the State of Nevada challenging decisions related to the repository for many years. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required EPA to issue standards for radioactive material at Yucca Mountain, and the National Academy of Sciences provided recommendations in 1995. EPA issued the standards in 2001, and Nevada joined in the legal challenges. In 1995, EPA issued standards for Yucca Mountain, which were challenged by the State of Nevada and environmental groups for not adequately protecting public health and safety. The challenges also included NRC's licensing criteria, DOE's site-suitability criteria, and Congress's site approval resolution. The cases were consolidated and decided in 2004 in Nuclear Energy Institute, Inc. v. EPA, where the D.C. Circuit ruled against EPA's 10,000-year compliance period as violating the Energy Policy Act. The EPA's selection for Yucca Mountain violates the Energy Policy Act as it does not align with the National Academy of Sciences' recommendations. Challenges to the EPA regulation are deemed meritless. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's licensing requirements are generally lawful, except for the 10,000-year compliance period. Congress's resolution for the Yucca site is within its authority. The Department of Energy's and the President's actions in selecting Yucca Mountain are not subject to review. Most of Nevada's challenges to these actions are moot. Nevada's challenges to the EPA and NRC regulations regarding the 10,000-year compliance period are moot and unripe. The court dismissed Nevada's challenge to the FEIS on ripeness grounds, allowing for subsequent lawsuits. DOE issued a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for Yucca Mountain in 2008. In June 2008, DOE issued a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Yucca Mountain repository and related Nevada Rail Corridor. Nevada opposed DOE's application to construct the rail corridor, citing flawed NEPA analyses. NRC completed a supplement to DOE's 2008 Environmental Impact Statement in May 2016. EPA released new public health and safety standards for Yucca Mountain in 2008. The Obama Administration's opposition to a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain led to the suspension of the license application adjudicatory proceedings. Nevada's lawsuits against EPA and NRC regarding their Yucca Mountain standards have been put on hold. The legal validity of EPA and NRC standards for Yucca Mountain was assumed by NRC in its Safety Evaluation Report. Litigation on the topic dates back to the late 1970s, with ongoing litigation shaped by the Yucca Mountain saga. In the 1979 Minnesota v. NRC decision, the D.C. Circuit ordered the NRC to determine the safe disposal of radioactive waste for individual reactor operating licenses. The NRC was ordered to determine offsite storage or disposal options for SNF when reactor licenses expired. In response to Minnesota v. NRC, the NRC issued its first waste confidence rule in 1984, ensuring safe disposal of SNF and HLW in a geologic repository by 2009. The NRC amended its waste confidence rule in 2010 to extend storage timeframes for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) to at least 60 years beyond a reactor's operating license expiration. This amendment was later struck down in 2012 for violating NEPA obligations, requiring the NRC to assess environmental effects of not establishing a permanent repository and potential risks of interim SNF storage. The NRC finalized a rule in 2014 for the continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, addressing potential environmental impacts over short-term, 160-year, and indefinite timeframes due to uncertainty in repository availability. The NRC finalized a rule in 2014 for the continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, addressing potential environmental impacts over short-term, 160-year, and indefinite timeframes due to uncertainty in repository availability. The rule provides that impact determinations in the GEIS are incorporated into environmental assessments and statements for licensing actions. The NRC lifted the suspension on licensing decisions, leading to legal challenges from various states, interest groups, and power companies. In September 2014, licensing decisions and motions were filed with the NRC regarding nuclear reactor licensing dockets. Litigation was postponed until after the NRC denied administrative petitions and motions in February 2015. A three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit upheld the NRC's Continued Storage rule on June 3, 2016, stating that the GEIS adequately analyzed the impacts of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel. The court emphasized the limited scope of review under the 'arbitrary and capricious' standard and the role of Article III courts in the nuclear energy policy debate. The D.C. Circuit denied petitioners' request for rehearing en banc regarding the NRC's policy for spent nuclear fuel storage. The court's decisions have impacted the funding mechanism for the Yucca Mountain repository, requiring DOE to review fees annually for the Nuclear Waste Fund. The DOE collected NWF fees despite not collecting nuclear waste or having a disposal facility. The NARUC challenged the fee collection, leading to a court ruling against the DOE's actions. In June 2012, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the Secretary's fee determination for the Yucca Mountain waste facility was inadequate and unreasonable. The court criticized the agency for using Yucca Mountain as a basis for future cost calculations when the facility was deemed unworkable. The Secretary was directed to provide a new fee assessment within six months, as the court found it premature to suspend the fee. The Secretary claimed uncertainty in determining fee adequacy due to a wide range of potential costs for nuclear waste disposal. The D.C. Circuit criticized the Secretary for an inadequate fee determination for the Yucca Mountain waste facility, ordering a new assessment. The court rejected the Secretary's position and ordered a zero fee until compliance with the NWPA or Congress enacts an alternative plan. The DOE stopped collecting the NWF fee in May 2014. The DOE ceased collecting the NWF fee on May 16, 2014, breaching contracts with nuclear power utilities for disposal of SNF and high-level waste. DOE failed to meet the deadline for disposal, leading to lawsuits by nuclear providers seeking damages for the storage of toxic waste. The DOE is facing lawsuits from nuclear power providers for failing to meet contractual obligations, with estimated total liability reaching $29 billion. Litigation has been necessary to determine the damages nuclear utilities can recover under breach of contract claims, pursued under a partial breach theory. Successful claims for full breach discharge contractual obligations for both parties, while partial breach claims allow for ongoing contractual disputes. The DOE is facing lawsuits from nuclear power providers for failing to meet contractual obligations, with estimated total liability reaching $29 billion. Litigation has been necessary to determine the damages nuclear utilities can recover under breach of contract claims. A claim for partial breach preserves the ongoing contractual relationship between the parties, allowing for ongoing disputes. Damages for partial breach are limited to costs incurred from the date of awareness of the breach to the date of trial, excluding future damages. Successful claims for full breach discharge contractual obligations for both parties. The Judgment Fund of the U.S. Treasury, not the NWF, has been the source of federal funds for the payment of eligible claims related to nuclear utilities. As of the end of FY2015, $5.3 billion had been paid for settlements and final judgments. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget included funding for disposal of SNF and developing a \"consent-based\" nuclear waste disposal system. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the funding request and allocated $170 million to continue the Yucca Mountain licensing process. The NRC Chairman testified that completing the licensing process for Yucca Mountain would cost $330 million. The Senate did not include funding for the Yucca Mountain licensing process in the FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill, but granted DOE authority to move forward with a pilot nuclear waste storage facility. Several bills have been introduced to implement recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. The Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 would establish a new Nuclear Waste Administration as an independent agency in the executive branch, removing limitations on the nuclear agency's authority imposed by the NWPA. It would require a consent-based procedure for repository and storage siting, and the establishment of a program for federal or private nuclear waste storage facilities. The Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 proposes a program for high-priority waste, reevaluation of the need for separate facilities for defense nuclear waste, and revocation of current repository volume limitations. It also includes provisions on waste transportation, technical assistance, and funding. Ongoing litigation against DOE regarding waste disposal contracts would not be affected by the Act, but settlement of claims is required for the Administrator to take title to and store the waste. The Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 proposes a program for high-priority waste and revocation of current repository volume limitations. Bills introduced in the 114th Congress focus on a \"consent-based approach\" to nuclear waste facility siting, requiring agreements with state governors, local governments, and Indian tribes for repository construction licenses. The bills clarify consent requirements for nuclear waste facility siting, including DOE's pending application for Yucca Mountain. S. 854 extends provisions to storage facilities and repositories, but excludes local governments. H.R. 3643 and H.R. 4745 authorize DOE to enter contracts for storage with interim facilities and use funds for related costs. Waste Control Specialists LLC (WCS) and Holtec International are proposing interim consolidated storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico, respectively. H.R. 3895 in the 113th Congress aimed to expedite the approval of DOE's Yucca Mountain repository application within 180 days. H.R. 3895 aimed to remove limitations on radiological material at Yucca Mountain, accelerate nuclear energy development, and address nuclear waste reduction. Other bills in the 114th Congress also focused on nuclear waste reduction and storage safety, taking different approaches to the issue. The bill H.R. 1806 aims to reduce nuclear waste and environmental impact of nuclear energy activities by replacing DOE's Nuclear Reactor 2010 program with a new program focusing on reactor concepts that reduce high-level waste production. It also includes research on fuel cycle strategies to minimize waste creation, improve safety, and enhance waste management. The bill passed the House and is now with the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Additionally, Senate bills target spent nuclear fuel storage management for active and decommissioned nuclear power plants, with a focus on moving spent fuel out of pools. The Safe and Secure Decommissioning Act of 2015 (S. 944) would require NRC to impose full safety and security requirements for shut down nuclear reactors once all spent nuclear fuel (SNF) has been transferred from pools to dry casks. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2015 (S. 945) mandates nuclear power plants to develop plans for transferring SNF to dry cask storage facilities. The Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2015 (S. 964) expands requirements for decommissioning activities reports to increase public involvement and NRC oversight. Similar bills were introduced in the 113th Congress."
