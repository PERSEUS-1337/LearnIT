    "content": "The Act titled \"Shambala Wild Animal Protection Act of 2000\" amends the Animal Welfare Act to regulate the possession of wild animals by adding Title II - Shambala Wild Animal Protection, which includes definitions and licensing requirements for personal possession. The \"Shambala Wild Animal Protection Act of 2000\" defines a protected wild animal as a wild species specified by the Secretary of Agriculture, including Felidae (Cats) and Ursidae (Bears) and their subspecies. The \"Shambala Wild Animal Protection Act of 2000\" includes protected wild animal species such as Canidae (Wolves and Foxes), Lemuridae (Lemurs), Indridae (Indrisoid Lemurs), Daubentoniidae (Aye-Aye), Lorisidae (Galagos and Loris), Cebidae (New World Monkeys), Callithrichidae (Marmosets), and Cercopithecidae (Old World Monkeys) and their subspecies. The term \"confinement facility\" refers to where a protected wild animal is kept, and \"law enforcement authority\" includes officers at various levels. A \"permit\" issued by the Secretary allows personal possession of a protected wild animal. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of key terms related to the possession of protected wild animals, including \"permittee,\" \"personal possession,\" \"veterinarian,\" and \"wildlife sanctuary.\" These definitions are important for understanding the regulations surrounding the ownership and care of such animals. The curr_chunk discusses the operation of a wildlife sanctuary for protected wild animals in need of care or pending release back to their natural habitats. The curr_chunk discusses the list of protected wild animals. The Secretary prepares a list of protected wild animals based on specific criteria, publishes it in the Federal Register, and can make changes to the list as needed. The Secretary can remove a species from the protected list without congressional action if it no longer meets specific criteria. \"SEC. 203. PERMITS FOR PERSONAL POSSESSION OF PROTECTED WILD ANIMALS.\" A permit issued by the Secretary is required for personal possession of protected wild animals. Offspring of a protected wild animal can be retained without a permit if the person applies for one within 30 days of birth. Transfer of personal possession to another person also requires a permit from the Secretary. To breed a protected wild animal, a permit issued by the Secretary is required. The permit is nontransferable, and exceptions to the permit requirement include government agencies, research facilities, zoos, animal parks, and wildlife sanctuaries. Any zoo, animal park, or wildlife sanctuary licensed by a State or local government agency must meet requirements equivalent to those of this Act. Individuals with protected wild animals can keep them without a permit for up to one year while their permit application is being considered by the Secretary. \"SEC. 204. PERMIT PROCESS.\" The Secretary can issue a permit for personal possession of a protected wild animal, including breeding purposes. To apply, a person must submit an application with required information and pay a fee to cover processing costs. An application for a permit to possess a protected wild animal must include details such as species, gender, reproductive status, age, acquisition method, and source. The permit application for possessing a protected wild animal must include the applicant's personal possession details, the licensed veterinarian's information for care, all required personal possession permits, license and surety bond copies, and evidence of the applicant's knowledge of animal care. The permit is valid in any state where possession of that type of animal is allowed. The permit application for possessing a protected wild animal must include proof of compliance with State laws where applicable. \"Required guarantees for personal possession of protected wild animals are outlined in Section 205.\" The applicant for a permit to possess a protected wild animal must ensure the animal is supervised, not mistreated, receives veterinary care as needed, and is kept in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. The applicant for a permit to possess a protected wild animal must guarantee the animal's health and well-being by regulating factors such as temperature, ventilation, diet, and exercise during confinement. The facility must meet all applicable caging requirements, and the applicant must have liability insurance coverage for the animal. When a protected wild animal for which a permit is issued dies, the death must be certified by a veterinarian at the permittee's expense. The permittee must notify the Secretary within 10 days of the animal's death. If the animal escapes or is released, the permittee must immediately notify law enforcement and the Secretary, and will be responsible for all expenses related to recapture efforts. The permittee is responsible for all expenses related to recapturing the animal and providing veterinary care upon recapture. \"Special requirements for importing or exporting protected wild animals under SEC. 206.\" Importing or exporting protected wild animals into or out of the United States must comply with all relevant State, Federal, and international laws and treaties, including regulations on possession in the respective states or countries. Before a protected wild animal is imported into the United States, the person receiving the animal must have a permit issued by the Secretary. The destination and proposed new possessor of a protected wild animal to be exported from the United States must be approved in the foreign country. A statement acknowledging the terms and conditions of import or export must be submitted to the Secretary. The statement for export must include quarantine details if required. SEC. 207. ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. The Secretary can use existing authorities for enforcement, including issuing permits and enforcing permit requirements. Law enforcement authorities can confiscate protected wild animals to ensure compliance. If a protected wild animal is held improperly, the Secretary or law enforcement can place the animal elsewhere. Disposition options for a protected wild animal include returning it to the permittee, placing it in a wildlife sanctuary permanently or temporarily, or euthanasia under certain restrictions. If the person in possession of the animal is unknown, it will be remanded to a wildlife sanctuary until a decision is made. SEC. 208 of the document outlines restrictions on euthanasia of protected wild animals. Euthanasia can only be carried out under specific circumstances, such as when the animal is moribund, in pain, poses a health or safety risk, or in extenuating circumstances with no wildlife sanctuary available. For endangered or threatened species, coordination with the Fish and Wildlife Service is required. The Secretary department must notify licensed dealers, exhibitors, and individuals in possession of protected wild animals about the requirements of this title. The Animal Welfare Act is amended to include a new section titled \"TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS.\" These amendments will take effect one year after the enactment of this Act."
