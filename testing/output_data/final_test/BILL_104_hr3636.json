    "content": "The \"Social Security Preservation Act of 1996\" allows for the investment of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The \"Social Security Preservation Act of 1996\" allows for the investment of Trust Funds in marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States. The \"Social Security Preservation Act of 1996\" permits Trust Funds to invest in marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States, including certificates of deposit in insured depository institutions. The annual surplus for each Trust Fund is determined by the excess of appropriated amounts for the fiscal year. The \"Social Security Preservation Act of 1996\" allows Trust Funds to invest in US government obligations. The amendments specify the calculation of annual surpluses for Trust Funds starting from fiscal years after October 1, 1996. The \"Protection of the Social Security Trust Funds from the Public Debt Limit\" is addressed in Section 3 of the legislation. Protection of Trust Funds: No officer or employee of the United States may delay deposits or credits to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to avoid increasing public debt obligations. Additionally, disinvestment from these Trust Funds is prohibited. Protection of Benefits and Expenditures: During periods when cash benefits or administrative expenses cannot be paid due to the public debt limit, public debt obligations in the Trust Funds can only be sold or redeemed to cover these payments. Disinvestment from the Trust Funds to reduce public debt obligations is not allowed. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue public debt obligations to obtain cash for payment of benefits or expenses from the Trust Fund, despite the public debt limit, with advance notice required before sale or redemption. The Secretary of the Treasury must report to Congress and the Comptroller General before undertaking a sale or redemption of public debt obligations. The Comptroller General will review compliance and issue findings and recommendations. The term \"public debt obligation\" refers to any obligation subject to the public debt limit."
