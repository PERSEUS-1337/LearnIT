    "content": "Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) allow individuals to pay for medical expenses on a tax-advantaged basis. To qualify, individuals must have a high-deductible health plan with specific deductible amounts. Contributions are tax-deductible, withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free, and unused balances can accumulate without limit. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) were authorized in 2003 under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. Other tax-advantaged accounts for health care expenses include Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) from the 1980s, Archer Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) from 1997, and Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs) from 2002. These accounts have similarities and differences, as detailed in CRS Report RS21573 and IRS publication 969. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are part of consumer-driven health plans, encouraging individuals to save for healthcare expenses and spend wisely. They provide financial incentives for prudent spending and allow individuals to choose their own healthcare services. While the full extent of their impact is still uncertain, HSAs are gaining interest from individuals and employers. This report summarizes the key rules governing HSAs, including eligibility, qualifying insurance, contributions, and withdrawals. The rules governing Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are primarily outlined in Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code and guidance from the Department of the Treasury and the IRS. The section has been amended multiple times by various legislative acts. HSAs are also subject to rules regarding qualified medical expenses outlined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and IRS guidance. An HSA is a tax-exempt trust or custodial account established for paying qualified medical expenses. Accounts can be set up with approved entities like banks, insurance companies, or other IRS-approved trustees. Insurance companies offering qualified high-deductible health plans often establish HSAs for policyholders, but federal law does not mandate this. Additional details and supporting documentation can be found in IRS publications or secondary analyses. Individuals interested in establishing an HSA must find an entity that accepts the accounts, as federal law does not require HSAs to be set up by the health plan provider. Eligibility to contribute to an HSA is based on having a qualifying HDHP and no disqualifying coverage, such as Medicare or Veterans Administration benefits. HSA eligibility is determined monthly, so individuals may be eligible in some months but not others. Individuals can be eligible for an HSA if they have not received Veterans Administration medical benefits in the past three months, are not claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return, and do not have disqualifying coverage. They can keep their HSAs even if they become ineligible, but cannot make contributions until they are eligible again. Individuals can have their own HSAs or be covered through a family member's HSA. They may have multiple HSA accounts. A qualified health plan must meet specific criteria, including a minimum deductible and a maximum out-of-pocket limit for covered benefits. The HSA must provide general coverage, with minimum deductibles of $1,200 for self-only coverage and $2,400 for family coverage in 2012. Only usual, customary, and reasonable charges for covered benefits are considered towards meeting the deductible. Premiums do not count towards the deductible, but copayments may be included at the option of the HDHP. The minimum deductible requirement for an HDHP does not apply to preventive care, which includes periodic health evaluations, prenatal care, immunizations, and screening services. Preventive care does not cover treatment for existing illnesses, except when incidental to the preventive service. The minimum deductible requirement for an HDHP does not apply to preventive care services. Prescription drugs are not exempt from the deductible, and discount cards do not disqualify individuals from meeting the requirement. Annual out-of-pocket expenditure limits for covered benefits are $6,050 for self-only coverage and $12,100 for family policies in 2012, adjusted for inflation in future years. The out-of-pocket expenditure limits for covered benefits under an HDHP are $6,050 for self-only coverage and $12,100 for family policies in 2012, adjusted for inflation in future years. These limits do not include premiums, non-covered benefits, or charges exceeding usual, customary, and reasonable rates. Deductibles and copayments are considered in determining if the limits are exceeded. HDHPs can impose reasonable lifetime benefit limits, and individuals must not have other non-high deductible coverage while covered by a qualifying HDHP. Eligible individuals cannot establish or contribute to an HSA if covered under a spouse's low deductible policy for the same benefits. Permitted insurance includes coverage for workers' compensation, specified diseases, hospitalization, accidents, disability, vision care, dental care, or long-term care. This type of insurance does not qualify as a qualifying health plan for HSAs. Eligible individuals may contribute to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for qualifying health plans, which do not include coverage under Flexible Spending Accounts for dental services or preventive care. Contributions can be made by individuals, employers, or state governments, and can also be made on behalf of eligible family members. Flexible Spending Account balances can be used during a 2\u00bd-month grace period or transferred to an HSA. Contributions to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) can be made by eligible individuals, employers, or state governments. Total contributions must not exceed annual limits, and contributors cannot restrict how HSA funds are used. Withdrawals can be made for any purpose, but nonqualified withdrawals are subject to taxation. Contributions can be made at any time during the calendar year until the federal income tax filing date, typically April 15 of the following year. Contributions to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) can be made through cafeteria plan salary reduction agreements, allowing employees to lower take-home pay in exchange for deposits into their account. The IRS allows employees to adjust their HSA contributions throughout the year, with restrictions that apply to all employees. Employers can also contribute amounts to cover medical expenses exceeding HSA balances, with employees required to repay accelerated contributions before year-end. Individuals can make one-time contributions to their HSAs from their traditional or Roth IRAs and limited, one-time rollovers from Flexible Spending Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts. Contributions must be made in cash, not property. There are two types of contributions, regular and catch-up, with annual limits calculated on a monthly basis. For each month of eligibility, individuals can contribute up to one-twelfth of the annual limit. Individuals can contribute to their HSAs from traditional or Roth IRAs and make one-time rollovers from Flexible Spending Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts. Contributions must be in cash, not property, with regular and catch-up contributions allowed. Monthly contributions can be up to one-twelfth of the annual limit. Contributions for self-only coverage in 2012 have an annual limit of $3,100, while family coverage has a limit of $6,250, adjusted for inflation in future years. Married couples with family coverage split the monthly limit unless agreed otherwise. Individuals aged 55 and above can contribute. Individuals aged 55 and above can contribute an additional $1,000 to their HSAs in 2012. Rollovers from one HSA to another are allowed without affecting contribution limits, with a limit of one rollover per year if funds are withdrawn and deposited in another account. HSA trustees can transfer funds without limits on rollovers. Limited rollovers of termination balances from Flexible Spending Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts are also permitted, made by employer transfers. Individuals can rollover MSA balances to their Health Savings Accounts, with contributions exceeding annual limits due to various reasons. Excess contributions can be withdrawn by the filing date for the federal income tax return to avoid penalties. If individuals exceed annual contribution limits to their Health Savings Accounts, they can withdraw the excess amount by the federal income tax return filing date to avoid penalties. Employers are not required to contribute to employees' HSAs, but if they do, contributions must be comparable in amount or percentage of the annual deductible. Matching contributions must be made through a cafeteria plan to satisfy the comparability requirement. Employers allowing transfers from Flexible Spending Accounts or Health Reimbursement Accounts to HSAs must offer this option to all eligible individuals covered under their HDHPs. Employers may accelerate contributions for employees with qualified medical expenses exceeding cumulative contributions. Contributions must be uniform for all eligible employees, with different treatment based on full-time/part-time status and coverage type. Larger contributions are allowed for non-highly compensated employees. Collective bargaining agreement employees may be excluded from comparability requirements. The comparability requirement does not apply to HSA contributions for individuals like independent contractors, partners, and sole proprietors. Contributions to HSAs are tax-deductible above the line, available to all taxpayers, and excluded from gross income for employees. Employer contributions are also exempt from Social Security and Medicare taxes. Employer contributions to HSAs are exempt from Social Security and Medicare taxes for both employers and employees. HSA contributions made through salary reduction cafeteria plans are also exempt from employment taxes. State income taxes generally follow federal rules, but some states may have different treatment. Withdrawals from HSAs for qualified medical expenses are exempt from federal income taxes, except for health insurance. Over-the-counter medications not prescribed by a physician are no longer considered qualified medical expenses. Health insurance payments are considered qualified expenses but generally not for HSA withdrawals. Under Section 213(d), HSA withdrawals are generally not qualified for paying HDHP premiums. However, payments for certain types of insurance are considered qualified HSA expenses, such as long-term care insurance, COBRA premiums, health insurance premiums during unemployment, and health insurance premiums for individuals 65 and older. Withdrawals not used for qualified medical expenses are subject to a 20% penalty, waived for disability, death, or individuals 65 and older. HSA withdrawals are not subject to penalties for disability, death, or individuals aged 65 and older. There is no requirement to spend down account balances at a certain age. Withdrawals can be made at any time to pay for qualified expenses as long as records are kept. If a surviving spouse is the beneficiary, the HSA continues for them; otherwise, it is terminated, and the fair market value becomes taxable income. If there is no designated beneficiary, the assets become part of the estate. The remaining assets become part of the estate and the fair market value becomes taxable income to the deceased individual on the final return. Amounts included in gross income are reduced by qualified expenses incurred by the deceased before death and paid within one year. The IRS has proposed model forms for banks, insurance companies, and other entities to use as trust or custodial agreements with eligible individuals. Trustees and custodians may rely on account owners' representations about their age, HDHP coverage, and contribution limits. They are not responsible for determining if distributions are used for medical expenses. HSA funds can be invested in various approved options like bank accounts, annuities, stocks, and bonds. Restrictions can be placed on the frequency and minimum amount of distributions. ERISA sets requirements for employee benefit plans, including reporting. Administration fees can be withdrawn from the HSA or paid separately. Life insurance contracts and collectibles are not eligible investments for HSA funds. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) establishes standards for benefit plans, including reporting and fiduciary requirements, superseding state laws. HSAs are generally not considered ERISA plans if employer involvement is limited. Certain employer actions, such as restricting fund movement or influencing investment decisions, can disqualify HSAs from the exemption. Cash contributions from HSA trustees as incentives are not prohibited. Cash contributions from HSA trustees as incentives to establish an HSA are not prohibited under ERISA."
