    "content": "TANF is a federal-state program providing cash assistance to needy families with children. States determine eligibility rules and benefit amounts, which vary greatly. Table 1 shows cash welfare benefits in states affected by Hurricane Katrina and neighboring states, with low benefits compared to other regions. Cash welfare benefits in this region are relatively low compared to other areas. TANF imposes requirements to ensure temporary assistance and encourage work. States can provide emergency assistance benefits. States can provide emergency assistance benefits to low-income families with children, which are nonrecurrent, short-term benefits designed to address specific crisis situations. These benefits are not meant to meet ongoing needs and typically do not extend beyond four months. Families receiving emergency benefits are exempt from work requirements and time limits that apply to cash assistance recipients. Additionally, TANF can also fund various social services such as child care, transportation aid, and family support services for eligible families. Welfare programs, like TANF, can provide emergency assistance to needy families with children during crisis situations. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the potential of TANF block grants to help disaster victims, as states have flexibility in designing programs under TANF. The legislation passed by Congress addressed policy considerations, allowing states to draw from the TANF contingency fund for 100% federal funding in certain situations. In FY2006, $48.4 million was drawn from the TANF contingency fund to provide short-term benefits for evacuees of hurricane-damaged areas. States could access 100% federal funding for certain benefits, capped at 20% of the host state's annual block grant. Extra funding was provided for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi in FY2005 and FY2006. TANF recipients with ongoing cash assistance are subject to requirements like time limits and work requirements. For FY2005 and FY2006, P.L. 109-68 waived penalties for states not meeting work requirements and having over 20% of caseload on rolls for more than five years. States were given authority to provide short-term benefits for evacuee families and those in hurricane-damaged states without affecting work requirements or time limits."
