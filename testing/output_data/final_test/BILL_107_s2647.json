    "content": "The \"Access for Afghan Women Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to Afghan women. Congress finds that despite the removal of the Taliban, Afghan women still face human rights violations, especially outside Kabul where warlords are gaining control. Continued US support is crucial for the progress of Afghan women. The US has provided significant aid to Afghanistan, but long-term development assistance is needed. Afghanistan has one of the highest maternal mortality rates globally. Afghan women face high maternal mortality rates, with reports showing a death every 30 minutes. Access to primary health care services can significantly reduce this rate. Women make up a majority of refugees and internally displaced persons. Rural women play vital roles in food production. The reconstruction and development assistance in Afghanistan should target rural women for agricultural interventions. Local women's organizations are crucial in delivering relief aid. The Afghan Ministry for Women's Affairs plays a vital role in re-establishing women's rights and providing essential services across the country. Afghan women are actively promoting peace efforts. Women's perspectives and experiences are crucial in seeking solutions to conflicts for lasting peace. Adequate security in urban and rural areas is essential for women and girls to exercise their human rights and participate in humanitarian and development programs sponsored by the United States. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO UNITED STATES ACTIVITIES IN AFGHANISTAN. Activities in Afghanistan by the United States must comply with specific requirements related to governance, including the inclusion of Afghan women's perspectives in policymaking, promoting women's participation in legislative bodies, and supporting the Ministry for Women's Affairs. The United States must ensure Afghan women's inclusion in governance and support the Ministry for Women's Affairs during the transition to a long-term government structure. Post-conflict activities in Afghanistan should prioritize funding local Afghan organizations, especially those led by women, and provide technical assistance for sustainable development efforts. The Act authorizes funds to partner with Afghan-led organizations, provide financial resources and technical assistance, support the Ministry of Women's Affairs, promote women-centered economic programs, increase women's access to assets, and provide long-term education assistance for Afghan girls and boys. Provide financial assistance for health infrastructure and comprehensive health care programs, integrate education and training for former combatants with economic development, rehabilitate children affected by conflict, support educational efforts on landmines, and prevent trafficking in persons. With respect to training for military and police forces in Afghanistan, programs should include training on the protection, rights, and needs of women, emphasizing prosecution of violations. Trainers should consult with women's organizations to ensure training content is adequate. Internally Displaced.--In Afghanistan, steps must be taken to ensure women refugees and internally displaced receive food, shelter, and medical services. Protection from sexual exploitation for women and children in refugee camps is also crucial. The United States-sponsored efforts should ensure that refugees and internally displaced persons can return to their place of origin voluntarily, safely, and with full rights protection, without coercion. SEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The President must submit a report to Congress within 60 days of this Act's enactment and annually thereafter, detailing progress in implementing section 3 requirements, with data disaggregated by sex."
