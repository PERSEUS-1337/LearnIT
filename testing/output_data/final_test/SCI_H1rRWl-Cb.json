    "content": "In an information-theoretic framework, trade-offs in unsupervised learning of deep latent-variables models using variational inference are explored. The framework considers the ability to reconstruct inputs and communication cost. The optimal frontier of generative models in the rate-distortion plane is derived, showing different trade-offs in latent variable usage. Experimental results on MNIST and Omniglot demonstrate how the framework sheds light on extensions to the variational autoencoder family. Our framework explores trade-offs in unsupervised learning of deep latent-variable models using variational inference. Recent advances in VI have sparked research in deep latent-variable models, optimizing the ELBO and utilizing the reparameterization trick for training efficiency. However, VAEs with powerful decoders may ignore latent variables, as demonstrated empirically and theoretically through the ELBO's derivation in terms of mutual information between data and latent variables. The paper discusses the importance of mutual information in deep latent-variable models and how the \u03b2-VAE objective can optimize the rate of information for specific tasks without extensive architectural search. Mutual information measures dependence between random variables, but computing it exactly in high dimensions is challenging. The use of variational inference tools can help address this issue. The paper explores the use of variational inference tools to approximate mutual information in deep latent-variable models. It introduces a lower and upper bound on mutual information related to the ELBO, highlighting the trade-offs between distortion and rate in optimal models. By leveraging additional information about the latent variable, the ground-truth generative model can be recovered in a toy model experiment. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MNIST dataset. The curr_chunk discusses experiments on MNIST and Omniglot using various model architectures to understand trade-offs. It shows how optimizing the \u03b2-VAE objective can control trade-offs directly. The focus is on the amount of information in the latent variable for unsupervised representation learning. The curr_chunk focuses on learning a representation that contains information about the input and can reconstruct it well. It involves converting data into a latent representation using a stochastic encoder. The goal is to maximize the representational mutual information between the input and the latent representation. The curr_chunk discusses the representational mutual information and variational bounds on mutual information, providing lower and upper bounds for the rate of representation in connection with rate-distortion theory. The goal is to compute a latent representation that maximizes the mutual information between input and representation. The curr_chunk discusses the rate term R of representation BID42, measuring the additional nats needed to encode samples using an entropic code from a general distribution. The distortion term D is defined by a learnable decoding distribution, contrasting with fixed perceptual loss measures in compression literature. The lower bound is the data entropy H minus the distortion D, reflecting dataset complexity and reconstruction accuracy. The \"sandwich equation\" from the curr_chunk sets a bound on the values of rate and distortion achievable for any set of distributions. This boundary separates feasible and infeasible regions in a two-dimensional RD-plane, based on data entropy, distortion, and rate constraints. The boundary in the RD-plane separates feasible and infeasible regions based on data entropy, distortion, and rate constraints. The lowest possible rate is given by the entropy of the data, corresponding to the zero distortion setting. Higher rates at fixed distortion can be achieved by adjusting the marginal. By using a powerful decoder, we can achieve the auto-decoding limit, reducing distortion to the lower bound of H without encoding information about the input. This allows for density estimation without the need for a good learned representation. By using a powerful decoder, density estimation can be achieved without a good learned representation. Solutions along the diagonal line satisfy D = H \u2212 R, ensuring tight bounds on m(z) and d(x|z). In the infinite model family limit, the bounds are tight, but with finite parametric families, the bounds may not be tight due to failures in modeling the true marginal. The failure of the approximate marginal m(z) or the decoder d(x|z) to model the true likelihood can lead to a gap in the optimal black surface. However, there will still be a one-dimensional optimal surface in the rate-distortion (RD) plane, which can be found through constrained optimization. This optimal surface, referred to as the RD curve, should be monotonic in both rate (R) and distortion (D). In this section, the discussion focuses on finding models targeting specific points on the rate-distortion curve. The rate (R) and distortion (D) can be approximated using a Monte Carlo sample from the training set. Efficient computation and sampling of terms like log d(x|z), log m(z), and log e(z|x) are necessary. Modeling choices for experiments will be described in Section 4 to explore optimal solutions along the frontier. Different rate-distortion trade-offs need to be explored to find qualitatively different optimal solutions. To explore different rate-distortion trade-offs, constrained optimization at fixed rate can be performed. The Legendre transformation can help find the optimal rate and distortion for a fixed \u03b2, by minimizing the objective function. Setting \u03b2 = 1 aligns with the ELBO objective used in training a VAE, distinguishing between models that utilize the latent variable. The marginal likelihood cannot distinguish between models that make no use of the latent variable versus models that make large use of the latent variable and learn useful representations for reconstruction. By allowing a general \u03b2 \u2265 0, the \u03b2-VAE objective is used to interpolate between auto-encoding and auto-decoding behavior without changing the model architecture. Additionally, optimization over the marginal m(z) and comparison across various architectures is explored, as illustrated empirically in Section 4. In this paper, the focus is on the VAE family of models for unsupervised learning with neural networks. Various recent variants such as IAF, MAF, PixelCNN++, and VampPrior are considered, along with common Conv/Deconv encoders and decoders. BID5 introduced tractable variational bounds on mutual information, making analogies to maximum likelihood learning and variational autoencoders. The information bottleneck framework allows a model to balance the minimality of learned representation from data by minimizing mutual information, I(X; Z), and the informativeness of the representation for the task by maximizing mutual information, I(Z; Y). The optimization problem is rephrased with the Lagrange multiplier, \u03b2, to I(X; Z) \u2212 \u03b2I(Z; Y). Previous work considered supervised settings and did not account for information in stochastic decoders. This paper explores the \u03b2-VAE for unsupervised learning, scaling the KL term by \u03b2. In this paper, the use of \u03b2 in autoregressive decoders is explored, showing that \u03b2 < 1 is necessary for the model to consider the latent code. Various studies have focused on rate/distortion tradeoffs in image compression using latent-variable generative models, with different approaches such as adjusting Lagrange multipliers and using GAN optimization procedures. Our work explores how model selection impacts the rate/distortion curve, highlighting the auto-encoding limit. We do not assume constraints like quantized latent spaces or fixed decoder model families with perceptual losses. An empirical case shows that the ELBO objective can learn a model capturing the data distribution but fails to learn a useful latent representation. By minimizing distortion while achieving a target rate, we can recover a latent representation closely matching the true generative process. A data generating process with a true latent variable and added noise is used. The model family chosen can perfectly autoencode or autodecode. Various distributions computed using three models are shown in FIG1. See Appendix E for more details on data generation and model. The left column uses hand-engineered encoder, decoder, and marginal to illustrate an optimal model, while the middle and right columns learn these components using infinite data. The VAE fails to learn a useful representation, achieving a rate of R = 0.0002 nats, while the Target Rate model achieves R = 0.4999 nats and closely matches the true generative process. The VAE fails to learn a useful representation, achieving a rate of R = 0.0002 nats, while the Target Rate model achieves R = 0.4999 nats and closely matches the true generative process. The optimal model and the Target Rate model have two clusters, one with about 70% of the probability mass corresponding to class 0, and the other with about 30% of the mass corresponding to class 1. The z-space of the VAE mixes the clusters, only learning a single cluster. In this section, we compare VAE model architectures using the MNIST dataset. We focus on rate and distortion rather than marginal log likelihoods. Various encoder and decoder variants are considered, along with different types of marginals. The study compares VAE model architectures on the MNIST dataset, focusing on rate and distortion rather than marginal log likelihoods. Different encoder and decoder variants, along with various types of marginals, are explored. The encoder includes a 64-dimensional Gaussian for e(z|x), followed by a more complex version with 4 steps of mean-only Gaussian inverse autoregressive flow. The decoder ranges from a simple multilayer deconvolutional network to a more powerful PixelCNN++ model. Marginals vary from a fixed isotropic Gaussian to a more intricate 4-step 3-layer mean-only Gaussian autoregressive flow. The target value R = I(x; z*) = 0.5 is computed with knowledge of the true data generating distribution. The study explores different VAE model architectures on the MNIST dataset, focusing on rate and distortion. Various encoder, decoder, and marginal variants are considered, totaling 12 models trained to minimize a specific objective. The RD plot for these models is shown, with a dashed line indicating the best achieved test ELBO. Points on the Pareto frontier represent achieved RD values across all model families. The study examines different VAE model architectures on the MNIST dataset, focusing on rate and distortion. A total of 12 models are considered, with strong decoder models dominating at the lowest and highest rates, while weak decoder models dominate at intermediate rates. The models appear to be pushing against a smooth RD curve, performing worse in the auto-encoding limit due to a lack of power in marginal approximations. The RD plot shows the achieved points across all model families, with differences in performances more easily resolved when plotting ELBO=R + D versus R. Models with deconvolutional decoders perform well at intermediate rates around 22 nats but suffer distortion penalties as they move away. Models with autoregressive decoders excel at low rates but collapse to pure autodecoding models for \u03b2 \u2265 1, unless VampPrior and KL annealing are used to maintain \u03b2 = 1 at rates around 8 nats. Techniques like \"free bits\" and KL annealing effectively train at reduced \u03b2, improving VAE performance with powerful decoders. Analyzing model performance using the RD curve provides insightful comparisons of relative model performance. Models with reduced \u03b2 achieve nonvanishing rates without additional architectural adjustments. Achieving competitive rates for single layer latent variable models, the models show different tradeoffs between rate and distortion, resulting in qualitatively different behaviors. In FIG3, the interaction between latent variables and powerful decoders is explored by changing \u03b2 in a VAE model. When \u03b2 = 1.10, the reconstructions are independent of the input x, but the generated images look good. When \u03b2 = 3, the generated images from the decoder are of good quality. At \u03b2 = 0.05, the model excels at auto-encoding but produces poor quality samples from its prior. For intermediate values like \u03b2 = 1.0, the model retains meaningful information while maintaining variation in reconstructions. This intermediate rate encoding represents a desirable outcome in unsupervised learning. In unsupervised learning, rate encoding aims to achieve a highly compressed representation that retains key data features. The model with \u03b2 = 0.15 demonstrates good reconstructions while maintaining compression, but higher rates reveal limitations in current architectures. Visual degradation in generated samples highlights the need for improvement in theoretical performance. Researchers are advised to visually compare multiple decodings for a comprehensive analysis. In unsupervised learning, rate encoding aims for a compressed representation retaining key data features. Comparing multiple decodings visually is crucial for analyzing model performance. The \u03b2-VAE objective is motivated by information theory, offering a better evaluation of model architectures than marginal log likelihoods. Adjusting \u03b2 can fix models ignoring latent space, providing a simpler solution than other proposed methods. The text suggests retraining models to improve performance by reporting rate and distortion values independently. It emphasizes the importance of demonstrating performance at various tradeoffs and highlights the effectiveness of autoregressive decoders at low rates. The current approaches struggle to achieve high rates at low distortion, indicating the need for further experiments with simpler encoder/decoder pairs. The text suggests experiments with a powerful autoregressive marginal posterior approximation to reach the autoencoding limit. Results on Omniglot dataset show powerful decoder models dominate weaker ones, sitting at low rates naturally. This hints at advancing unsupervised representation learning with constrained optimization techniques. Decoder models with autoregressive form naturally sit at low rates, achieved finite rates using KL annealing. Experiments with different \u03b2 values on Omniglot dataset showed best ELBO at 90.37 nats with ++-model and \u03b2 = 1.0. Model is nearly auto-decoding with R = 0.77, D = 89.60. 14 models had ELBOs below 91.2 nats. Sample reconstructions and generated images from \"-+v\" model family demonstrate smooth interpolation between auto-decoding and auto-encoding by adjusting \u03b2 value. Lower bound established by positive KL divergences. The lower bound is established by positive KL divergences, while the upper bound is determined by the positive semidefinite quality of KL divergence. The optimal marginal approximation is the marginal distribution of the encoder. The variational derivative of the rate with respect to the marginal approximation must vanish for the total variation to vanish. The lower bound is established by positive KL divergences, while the upper bound is determined by the positive semidefinite quality of KL divergence. The variational derivative of the rate with respect to the marginal approximation must vanish for the total variation to vanish, ensuring the correct posterior decoding distribution induced by data and encoder. The upper bound on KL divergences is established by positive semidefinite quality. An inequality relating functionals of distributions is found by deriving bounds on mutual information in joint density. This leads to considering mutual information along a new generative path. The mutual information along a new generative path is considered, with variational lower and upper bounds established. The lower bound involves a variational approximation to the decoder posterior, while the upper bound requires a variational approximation to the marginal density of the generative process. The variational approximation to the marginal density of the generative model, denoted as q(x), establishes lower and upper bounds on the generative mutual information. It is important to constrain or target values for these bounds to ensure consistency in the joint distributions. Models trained with the \u03b2-VAE objective tend to have loose bounds on the generative mutual information when \u03b2 varies from 1. The appearance of a new independent density estimate q(x) allows for rearranging the variational lower bound on the representational mutual information. The new reparameterization couples the bounds for representational and generative mutual information using q(x). Splitting the function S into data entropy and cross entropy terms allows setting a target cross entropy on the density estimate q(x) with respect to empirical data distribution. This offers a way to control overfitting and formulate original bounds on representational mutual information. Recent work has leveraged information theory to improve understanding of machine learning, particularly in unsupervised learning. The authors present theory for the success of supervised deep learning and propose training methods for deep learning models. KL divergence is used as a target for preventing overfitting in reparameterized objectives. The authors propose a two-phase training approach for deep learning models, focusing on error minimization and compression. They suggest that the compression phase helps diffuse the conditional entropy of model layers, leading to convergence near the information bottleneck optimal frontier. Different \u03b2 values are discussed for learning disentangled representations, with a bits-back model introduced to address issues with powerful decoders in standard VAEs. This approach aims to find a solution without the need for additional noise sources in the decoder. The authors propose a two-phase training approach for deep learning models, focusing on error minimization and compression to diffuse conditional entropy. Different \u03b2 values are discussed for disentangled representations, with a bits-back model introduced to address issues with powerful decoders in standard VAEs. BID6 suggests annealing the KL term weight of the ELBO to train an RNN decoder effectively. BID40 applies this idea to ladder network decoders. BID0 introduces Information Dropout as a regularization method for network activations. The authors propose injecting noise into deep networks to optimize for disentangled and invariant representations, promoting invariance through architectural bottlenecks and depth. They decompose the standard cross entropy loss into four terms, including one named 'overfitting', which can be increased without regularization. An optimization procedure can reduce total loss by increasing the number of samples from the encoder during training. BID7 introduced an importance-weighted variant of the VAE objective to improve test log likelihood. BID32 used normalizing flows to approximate the true posterior, overcoming limitations of standard mean-field posterior approximations in VAEs. BID24 introduced inverse autoregressive flow (IAF) to leverage the expressive power of autoregressive models. Autoregressive models have been used for density estimation and sample generation. MADE BID14 proposed masking autoencoder parameters to enforce the autoregressive property. PixelCNN extended this idea to a convolutional model for autoregressive prediction of image pixels. In PixelCNN, the autoregressive property is enforced through masked convolutional filters. Salimans et al. improved performance with PixelCNN++ by making architecture changes for faster training. BID30 unified normalizing flow models with autoregressive models. BID44 proposed a method for learning the marginal posterior by using k pseudo-inputs. In learning the marginal posterior, k pseudo-inputs are used to approximate true samples x \u223c p * (x). The data generating process involves sampling a latent binary variable z \u223c Ber(0.7), a 1d continuous value h|z \u223c N (h|\u00b5 z , \u03c3 z ), and observing a discretized value x = discretize(h; B). The encoder and decoder have parameters for latent categorical and observed categorical variables. The variational marginal is m(z i ) = \u03c0 i, leading to the true joint distribution. The true joint distribution p e (x, z) = p * (x)e(z|x) is determined by the variational marginal m(z i ) = \u03c0 i. Different model families were considered for the encoder and decoder, with a linearly gated activation function used for all layers. The simple encoder for the static binary MNIST dataset had 5 convolutional layers outputting parameters to a diagonal Gaussian distribution. The encoder for the MNIST dataset had 5 convolutional layers outputting parameters for a diagonal Gaussian distribution. The more complex encoder used the same architecture with 4 steps of mean-only Gaussian inverse autoregressive flow. The decoder was a transposed convolutional network with 6 layers followed by a linear convolutional layer for an independent Bernoulli distribution. The decoder for the MNIST dataset utilized a modified PixelCNN++ style network with linearly gated activation functions and six blocks of two ResNet layers each. Shortcut connections were implemented between matching sized feature maps, and a 64-dimensional latent representation was processed through a dense linearly gated layer to produce a 784-dimensional representation. This representation was reshaped and concatenated with the target. The final output of the MNIST dataset decoder was processed through a convolution to produce logits for a Bernoulli distribution on each pixel. Three different types of marginals were used, including a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution, a more complex Gaussian autoregressive flow, and a VampPrior mixture. The choice of marginal for the models was based on VampPrior, denoted with (v), using a mixture of encoder distributions on pseudo-inputs. Additional learned weights on the mixture distributions were constrained to sum to one. The models were trained using the \u03b2-VAE objective with Adam optimizer for 200 epochs, with a fixed learning rate decreasing linearly towards 0."
