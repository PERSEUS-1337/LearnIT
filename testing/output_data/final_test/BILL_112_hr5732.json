    "content": "The \"Schools of the Future Act\" is the short title of this Act. The findings section follows. Congress finds that digital learning technology has the potential to transform rural education by overcoming distance barriers and increasing school capacity. However, smaller rural educational agencies face challenges in accessing and implementing these tools, risking being left behind without support for their implementation. Digital learning technologies need to be developed for rural areas to meet their unique needs. The demand for these tools is increasing, making evaluation of their effectiveness crucial for informed decision-making by school leaders. The Secretary of Education can award grants to eligible partnerships for 3 to 5 years to carry out activities described in section 6. If a partnership receives a grant, a school partner will serve as the fiscal agent. An eligible partnership seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with details about the partnership, the technology-based learning project, relevant information for selection criteria, and the evaluation process involving school and evaluation partners. The eligible partnership seeking a grant must provide details about the implementation of the project, evaluation design, number of students to be reached, and assurance of reaching the proposed number of students. The partnership must ensure that each school served by the grant is designated with a school locale code of Fringe Rural, Distant Rural, or Remote Rural, as determined by the Secretary. Any additional information required by the Secretary must also be provided. SEC. 5. APPLICATION REVIEW AND AWARD BASIS. The Secretary will use a peer review process to evaluate grant applications, appointing individuals with relevant expertise. Grants will be awarded based on ensuring diversity in funded activities. Selection criteria include the need for technology-based learning, quality of design, and existing research evidence. The Secretary will evaluate grant applications based on the need for technology-based learning, quality of design, and existing research evidence, as well as the experience and evaluation quality of the eligible partnership. The use of funds is outlined in Section 6. An eligible partnership receiving a grant under this Act must use the funds to implement and evaluate technology-based learning practices, tools, and courses designed to personalize the learning experience. This includes personalized instructional systems, adaptive software, games, tools, and computer-based tutoring courses for struggling students. Technology-based practices and strategies include games, digital tools, smartphone applications, adaptive software for formative assessment, and web resources aligned with high-quality standards for personalized learning experiences. Technology-based practices and strategies include tools, courses, and resources aligned with high-quality standards for personalized learning experiences, online professional development opportunities, teacher mentoring, and addressing specific instructional problems. Tools, courses, and strategies aimed at enhancing student achievement, particularly for those with specific educational needs, include digital tools for students with disabilities, online courses for credit recovery, language instruction for English language learners, and other tailored resources. Technology-based tools, courses, and strategies aim to personalize the learning experience and help students develop 21st-century skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, collaboration, and innovation. Online courses provide access to learning opportunities that students may not have otherwise. Technology-based or online courses identified under this paragraph include elective courses, foreign language courses, and advanced college-level courses that can be taken for credit. An eligible partnership receiving a grant under this Act may use funds to develop technology for technology-based learning. The grant funds can be used to develop technology-based learning strategies, purchase necessary hardware or software (up to 50% of total grant funds), address the needs of student subgroups, provide professional development on technology use, and tackle cost and capacity issues in rural areas and shortage subjects. SEC. 7. DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION. Each eligible partnership receiving a grant under this Act must conduct a comprehensive evaluation after the third year to measure the impact on student achievement, achievement gaps, graduation rates, college enrollment, and teacher effectiveness. An evaluation partner may use funds to conduct an implementation evaluation for schools, agencies, and networks. Results must be reported to the Secretary and made publicly available. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"eligible partnership\" as a partnership including a school partner and at least one digital learning partner and evaluation partner. The term \"school partner\" includes various educational entities such as local educational agencies, charter school networks, and regional educational service providers. The Act defines \"digital learning partner\" as an organization with expertise in technology to implement digital learning practices, tools, and strategies. An \"evaluation partner\" is a partner with the ability to evaluate grants received under the Act. The Act defines \"digital learning partner\" as an organization with expertise in technology for digital learning practices. An \"evaluation partner\" can be an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization with evaluation expertise, or an evaluation firm."
