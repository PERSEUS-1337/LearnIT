    "title": "AB 1921",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3017 of the Elections Code is amended to require all vote by mail ballots to be returned before the day of the election either by mail, in person to the elections official, or at a polling place. Designated individuals can also return the ballot, but it must be received before the polls close on election day. The elections official must ensure ballot secrecy, personal information security, and track receipt of voted vote by mail ballots by March 1, 2008. Non-compliance with these procedures will result in the ballot not being counted. The amended Section 3017 of the Elections Code prohibits any form of compensation for returning vote by mail ballots and imposes punishment for criminal acts related to the ballots. All vote by mail ballots must be returned on or before the election day. Voters can return the ballot by mail, in person to the elections official, at a polling place, or to a designated dropoff location. If unable to return the ballot, a voter can designate someone else to do so. Compensation for returning ballots is prohibited under the amended Section 3017 of the Elections Code. Vote by mail ballots must be returned before the close of polls on election day. If returned to a different county, it will be forwarded to the issuing elections official within eight days. The elections official must ensure ballot secrecy and personal information security. Procedures for tracking and confirming receipt of mail-in ballots must be established by March 1, 2008. Non-compliance with these procedures will result in the ballot not being counted. A person returning a vote by mail ballot cannot receive compensation based on the number of ballots returned. Any form of compensation offered in exchange for returning another voter's ballot is prohibited. Those who engage in criminal acts related to mail-in ballots, such as fraud or tampering, will face punishment as specified in the law. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to the Elections Code, contingent on the enactment of Senate Bill 450 before this bill, and both bills amending Section 3017 of the Elections Code by January 1, 2017."
