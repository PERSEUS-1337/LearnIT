The Small Business Goaling Act of 2012 establishes governmentwide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns, including those owned by service-disabled veterans, HUBZone small business concerns, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women. The Small Business Goaling Act of 2012 sets governmentwide goals for small business participation in prime and subcontract awards, including those owned by service-disabled veterans and HUBZone small business concerns. The goals are set at 25% for small businesses, 40% for subcontract awards, 3% for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, and 3% for HUBZone small businesses. The governmentwide goals for small business participation in prime and subcontract awards are set at 25%. Additionally, the goals for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses and HUBZone small business concerns are set at 3% each. The goals for small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and women are set at 5% each. The Small Business Act requires federal agencies to establish annual procurement contract goals, ensuring that at least 5% of the total value of prime contracts and subcontract awards are allocated. The Administrator must ensure that the cumulative annual prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed the annual Government-wide prime contract goal set by the President. The Small Business Act mandates federal agencies to set annual procurement contract goals for small businesses, including those owned by service-disabled veterans, HUBZone, socially disadvantaged individuals, and women. These goals must align with the President's goals and cover both prime contracts and subcontract awards. The participation percentage for small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, HUBZone, socially disadvantaged individuals, and women must meet or exceed governmentwide goals for subcontract awards. The head of each Federal agency consults with the Administrator to establish goals for subcontract awards for small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, HUBZone, socially disadvantaged individuals, and women. If there is a disagreement, it is submitted to the Administrator for final determination. The head of each Federal agency develops a plan to achieve procurement goals, apportioning responsibilities among agency employees. They must also make consistent efforts to expand participation by small businesses in procurement contracts, including those owned by service-disabled veterans and HUBZone small business concerns. The head of each Federal agency aims to increase participation of small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women, and other eligible groups in procurement contracts. They consider contracts awarded through unrestricted competition and those awarded after competition restricted to eligible small businesses. The procurement employees or program managers must emphasize the importance of achieving established goals to their subordinates. These employees include senior procurement executives, senior program managers, or Directors of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization with contracting authority. Enforcement and determinations of the total value of contracts are also addressed. Enforcement and determinations of the total value of contract awards are addressed in the Small Business Act. If the Administrator fails to issue a required report within 120 days after the prior fiscal year, no pilot programs can be carried out until the report is issued. The total value of contract awards for a fiscal year must not exclude contract value based on where it is awarded or performed. The Small Business Act addresses enforcement and determinations of contract awards based on various factors such as where the contract is performed, if it is mandated by Federal law, funding availability, and compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. SEC. 3. REPORTING ON GOALS FOR PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS AWARDED TO SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. Subsection (h) of section 15 of the Small Business Act is amended to require Federal agencies to report on the participation of small business concerns, including those owned by veterans, HUBZone small businesses, socially disadvantaged individuals, and women, in procurement contracts at the end of each fiscal year. The Small Business Act now requires Federal agencies to report on small business participation in procurement contracts at the end of each fiscal year. The Administrator must submit a report to the President and Congress within 60 days of receiving agency reports, including an assessment of goal achievement and justifications for any failures. The Small Business Act mandates Federal agencies to report on small business participation in procurement contracts annually. The report must include an assessment of goal achievement, reasons for any failures, and planned actions to address them. Additionally, it should analyze the number and dollar amount of prime contracts awarded to small business concerns. The Small Business Act requires Federal agencies to report on small business participation in procurement contracts annually. This includes contracts awarded through sole source, competitions restricted to small business concerns, and unrestricted competition. Specifically, it focuses on small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, including contracts awarded through sole source and competitions restricted to small business concerns. The Small Business Act requires Federal agencies to report on small business participation in procurement contracts annually, including contracts awarded through sole source, competitions restricted to small business concerns, and unrestricted competition. This also includes contracts awarded to qualified HUBZone small business concerns through various methods such as sole source contracts, competitions restricted to small business concerns, and competitions restricted to qualified HUBZone small business concerns. Small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals can participate in procurement contracts through various methods, including sole source contracts, competitions restricted to small business concerns, and unrestricted competition with or without a price evaluation preference. Small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals can participate in procurement contracts through various methods, including competitions restricted to small businesses and unrestricted competition. Additionally, small business concerns owned by an Alaska Native Corporation can also participate through sole source contracts and competitions restricted to small business concerns. Small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, Alaska Native Corporations, and women can participate in procurement contracts through various methods, including competitions restricted to small businesses and unrestricted competition. During the fiscal year, subcontracts were awarded to small business concerns, including those owned by service-disabled veterans, HUBZone small business concerns, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Small business concerns owned and controlled by women were awarded subcontracts during the fiscal year. Senior executives in federal agencies are required to undergo training on federal procurement requirements, including those under the Small Business Act. Their performance appraisals now include meeting goals set by the agency head in accordance with the Small Business Act."
