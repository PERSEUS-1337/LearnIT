    "content": "The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Reauthorization Act of 2005 amends the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000. It may be cited as the `Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000'. Congress finds that the United States will need increased quantities of electricity, natural gas, and transportation fuels to promote energy independence. Reports indicate that the US has significant gas hydrate resources, estimated at 200,000 trillion cubic feet, and may possess over 1/4 of the world's methane hydrate deposits. The Energy Information Administration predicts a natural gas supply shortfall in 2020, while the National Academy of Science suggests methane hydrate could help alleviate this shortage. \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as contract, cooperative agreement, Director, grant, industrial enterprise, and institution of higher education. Definitions for key terms such as institution of higher education, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of the Interior are provided in the Act. The Interior refers to the Secretary of the Interior, who acts through the Directors of the US Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, and Minerals Management Service. The Secretary of the Interior oversees the US Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, and Minerals Management Service. The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Program is established under Section 4. The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Program will commence within 90 days of the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Reauthorization Act of 2005. Designated individuals from various departments will coordinate activities related to methane hydrate research and development within the Department of Energy. The Methane Hydrate Research and Development Program, established under the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Reauthorization Act of 2005, involves designated individuals meeting regularly to review progress, coordinate interagency efforts, and award grants for research and development activities. The Secretary may award grants or contracts to institutions for research on methane hydrate as an energy source, resource identification, seismic data acquisition, technology development, and education/training. The Secretary may award grants or contracts for research on methane hydrate as an energy source, resource identification, technology development, and education/training. This includes conducting research to assess and mitigate environmental impacts, developing technologies to reduce drilling risks, and conducting exploratory drilling and testing operations on gas hydrates. Funding is subject to competitive peer review. The Secretary will establish a Methane Hydrates Advisory Panel consisting of representatives from various sectors to assist in developing recommendations and priorities for the methane hydrate research program. The Methane Hydrates Advisory Panel will oversee the methane hydrates program, assess progress, evaluate balance, and make recommendations for program improvement. They will submit assessments of the research program and Department of Energy's 5-year research plan to Congress. The advisory panel established by the Secretary ensures members have no conflicts of interest, holds meetings biennially, and coordinates with Department of Energy program managers. The Secretary is responsible for developing partnerships to research methane hydrate resources, creating programs for long-term interest in methane hydrate as an energy source, and ensuring data accessibility and dissemination. The Secretary is responsible for developing partnerships to research methane hydrate resources, creating programs for long-term interest in methane hydrate as an energy source, and ensuring data accessibility and dissemination. Additionally, they must promote cooperation among agencies developing technologies for methane hydrate resource development, report annually to Congress on actions taken, and increase the Department of Energy's participation in international cooperative efforts. The Secretary will offer an agreement to the National Research Council to conduct a study on methane hydrate research progress and future needs. A report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to Congress by September 30, 2009. The Secretary will provide reports and studies to Congress as directed. Authorization of appropriations is set for fiscal years 2006 to 2010."
