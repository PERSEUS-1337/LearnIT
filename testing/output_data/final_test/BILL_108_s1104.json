    "content": "Protection of children and parental involvement in abortions for dependent children of members of the armed forces. Parental Notice requirement for abortions on pregnant unemancipated minors who are children of members of the armed forces under title 10, United States Code. A physician must provide 48 hours actual notice to the member of the armed forces or another parent, or a court-appointed managing conservator or guardian, before performing the abortion. An order from a district court is required for the minor to consent to the abortion. The appropriate district court of the United States may authorize a minor to consent to an abortion if the physician determines it is necessary to avert death or serious risk to the minor's health. The physician may perform an abortion if medical indications support their judgment, and if the person to be notified cannot be reached, 48 hours constructive notice by certified mail is required. The 48-hour actual notice requirement can be waived with an affidavit. A physician may execute an affidavit for a minor's medical record stating that notice has been provided to a parent or guardian. The certification required for notification is confidential and does not include personal information about the minor. The physician must keep medical records of a minor in compliance with regulations. Performing an abortion on a pregnant unemancipated minor in violation of this subsection is punishable by a fine. It is a defense if the minor falsely represented her age, but not if the physician had independent knowledge of the minor's actual age. Judicial approval is required for a pregnant unemancipated minor. A pregnant unemancipated minor who is a child of a member of the armed forces can file for a court order to have an abortion without notifying her parents or guardian. The application can be filed in any district court of the United States, and proceedings can be conducted by telephone if the minor chooses not to travel to the US. The application must be made under oath and include a statement of pregnancy. A pregnant unemancipated minor can file for a court order to have an abortion without parental notification. The court will appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor and may appoint an attorney if needed. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a minor, selecting from various qualified individuals, and must determine within 48 hours if the minor can make the decision to have an abortion without parental notification. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a minor to determine if she can consent to an abortion without parental notification. If the court finds that notification is not in the minor's best interest or may lead to abuse, the minor can consent to the abortion without notification. If the court fails to rule on the application, it is deemed granted. If the minor does not meet the requirements, she cannot consent without notification. The court may not notify a parent, managing conservator, or guardian about a minor's pregnancy or desire for an abortion. Court proceedings must protect the minor's anonymity, and all related documents are confidential. The minor can use a pseudonym or initials when filing the application. Any court order issued is confidential and can only be disclosed to specific individuals involved. A minor filing an application for abortion does not need to pay a filing fee or court costs. If the application is denied, the minor can appeal to the court of appeals. If the appeal is not ruled on within 48 hours, the abortion can proceed using Department of Defense facilities. The court of appeals can authorize a minor to consent to an abortion without notification, with proceedings given priority. The ruling is confidential and privileged, not subject to disclosure, and no filing fee or court costs are required for the minor filing an appeal. The term 'abortion' is defined as the use of any means at a Department of Defense medical facility to terminate a pregnancy of a known pregnant female with the intention of causing the death of the fetus. The term applies to unemancipated minors and does not limit access to contraceptives. The appropriate district court of the United States is defined based on the location of the proposed abortion. The district court of the United States with proper venue is determined based on the location of the Department of Defense facility where the minor is seeking an abortion, whether within or outside the United States or its territories. The district court of the United States authorizes abortion for minors. The term 'fetus' refers to a human organism from fertilization until birth. 'Guardian' is a court-appointed guardian, 'physician' is a licensed medical practitioner, and 'unemancipated minor' includes unmarried minors without disabilities of minority."
