The Biometric Exit Improvement Act of 2013 mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to report on the effectiveness of the biometric exit data system at specified airports and seaports. Within 18 months of the Act, a pilot program will test the system on non-pedestrian outbound traffic at three land ports of entry. A pilot program will test biometric exit data systems at three land ports of entry to determine feasibility, infrastructure requirements, and effects on legitimate travel and trade.

The Secretary of Homeland Security will submit the results to the Government Accountability Office for review within 30 days of the program's conclusion. The Comptroller General will then provide a review of the results to relevant committees within 90 days of receiving them. The Secretary of Homeland Security will submit a plan to implement a biometric exit data system at all land ports of entry for non-pedestrian outbound traffic to the Committees on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Additionally, within three years, the Secretary will expand the biometric exit system at land ports of entry for pedestrians.
