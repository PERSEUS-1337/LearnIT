    "content": "The Act titled the \"American Shipping Reinvestment Act of 2009\" repeals the qualified shipping investment withdrawal rules. The Act titled the \"American Shipping Reinvestment Act of 2009\" repeals section 955 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to withdrawal of previously excluded subpart F income from qualified investment, along with making conforming amendments to sections 951(a)(1)(A) and 951(a)(3) of the Code. The \"American Shipping Reinvestment Act of 2009\" repeals section 955 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and makes amendments to related sections. The changes apply to taxable years of controlled foreign corporations and United States shareholders. The \"American Shipping Reinvestment Act of 2009\" repeals section 955 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and introduces a one-time temporary dividends received deduction for previously untaxed foreign base company shipping income. For a corporation electing under this section, 85% of cash distributions received from controlled foreign corporations attributable to pre-2005 income are deductible in computing taxable income. Indirect dividends are treated as cash dividends under this section, with limitations on the amount of dividends considered. Taxpayers can make elections and designations on their tax returns for the applicable year. The taxpayer can elect to apply the section to their last taxable year before the enactment of the Act or their first taxable year during the 1-year period following the date. The taxpayer can make an election for a taxable year on or before the due date for filing the tax return, as long as no previous election has been made for the same distribution in any other taxable year. Failure to maintain employment levels may result in a reduction of benefits during the 24-month period after receiving the distribution. The taxpayer must maintain employment levels equal to their prior average. If employment falls below this average, they must include $25,000 multiplied by the shortfall in their income. Prior average employment is calculated based on the average number of full-time equivalent employees in the 24 months before receiving a distribution. The taxpayer's average employment level must be maintained, with penalties for falling below. All domestic members of a controlled group are treated as a single taxpayer. Special rules from the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 apply. Effective for taxable years ending after enactment."
