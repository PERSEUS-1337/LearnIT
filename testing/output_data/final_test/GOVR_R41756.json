    "content": "The widespread use of the Internet and cloud computing has led to increased concerns about privacy due to the collection and use of personal information by various entities. Online advertising, fueled by the availability of personal data, has become a lucrative industry, with over $22 billion spent in 2010. This revenue allows websites to offer free content and services. The Wall Street Journal's investigative series revealed the fast-growing Internet business model of data-gatherers conducting intensive surveillance on website visitors to sell their personal data and predictions of interests. Congress is investigating new technologies like flash cookies and privacy practices of websites with the most tracking technology. Consumers and public interest groups are challenging the collection of consumer data without consent. Online privacy concerns are widespread, and the success of electronic commerce depends on resolving privacy and security issues related to personal information. The U.S. Department of Commerce emphasizes the importance of online personal information for the Internet economy and calls for a \"privacy bill of rights\" to address privacy issues. The Federal Trade Commission recommends a Do Not Track system for online tracking opt-out. Congress is reviewing the legal framework for protecting personal information. The U.S. Congress has a history of protecting personal information online through laws and hearings. The current Congressional privacy agenda includes addressing new technology-related privacy issues and updating electronic surveillance laws. Members of the 112th Congress are planning to introduce privacy legislation. Online consumer privacy is a key focus for the Senate Commerce Committee. The Senate Commerce Committee, along with other members of Congress, are focusing on introducing privacy legislation to address online consumer privacy issues. Representative Rush reintroduced a comprehensive privacy bill, H.R. 611, while Representative Stearns drafted a consumer privacy bill with an FTC-approved self-regulatory program provision. The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade will examine online privacy issues in hearings. Senate Judiciary Chairman Leahy also has a long-standing interest in privacy. Judiciary Chairman Leahy's committee has initiatives on privacy, including a new Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law. Senator Wyden plans to draft a bill on legal standards for tracking individuals' movements using geolocation data. Congress is considering whether to draft specific legislation for privacy threats or a comprehensive federal privacy law. There is a debate on whether to implement basic privacy rules (such as for behavioral advertising) or a comprehensive federal privacy law. Stakeholders disagree on what the federal privacy law should cover, including types of information, reach, enforcement, and more. A legal scholar suggests looking at privacy from a broader perspective, outlining six aspects: actors-relationships, conduct, motivations, harms-remedies, and nature of information. Microsoft recommends a multi-pronged approach to protecting individuals' privacy, including legislation, industry self-regulation, technology tools, and consumer education. Transparency, control, and security are the principles underlying Microsoft's approach to privacy, which would provide consistent baseline protections for consumers and simplify compliance. Privacy legislation would preempt inconsistent state laws. In the 19th century, a law review article established the \"right to be let alone\" as a key principle of American privacy law in response to privacy invasions from mass printing and portable cameras. American common law later developed tort remedies for personal privacy protection. With technological advancements like the Internet, privacy concerns have evolved. Today, privacy is more about understanding and controlling personal information in the digital era. In the digital era, privacy is about knowing and controlling personal data, including online transactions and personally identifiable information. Some advocate for the right to \"information privacy\" to control how personal information is acquired, disclosed, and used. In the United States, there is no comprehensive legal protection for personal information, with limited constitutional safeguards. The protection of personal information is limited to government intrusions, with no comprehensive legal safeguards in the US. Constitutional guarantees only apply to \"state action,\" leaving threats in the private sector unaddressed. Any restrictions on data collection by private entities are governed by federal or state laws, not the federal Constitution. The Fourth Amendment protects privacy by requiring warrants for government intrusions. The Fourth Amendment protects individual privacy against certain governmental intrusions, but its protections extend beyond privacy. The Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause does not necessarily provide privacy protection. In Whalen v. Roe, the Supreme Court recognized a constitutional \"right of informational privacy\" in a case involving a centralized state computer file of prescription medication recipients. The Supreme Court recognized a constitutional right to information privacy in cases involving gathering personal information and drug treatment questions. This right is protected under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court ruled that NASA's inquiries about contract workers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory did not violate a constitutional right to informational privacy, citing the Privacy Act's protections and the government's use of pre-employment investigations. Federal and state laws protect personal information, but there is no comprehensive federal privacy statute covering both public and private sectors. Congress addresses private sector data collection on a sector-by-sector basis. Various federal laws protect different types of personal information, such as consumer credit reports, health information, and children's online data. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair and deceptive practices in commerce. The FTC Act allows the Commission to seek relief for violations related to fair information practices in commerce. The first online behavioral advertising case involved an online network advertiser accused of deceptive practices by offering a short opt-out period for targeted advertising. The Commission's order prohibits future privacy misrepresentations by the advertiser. The FTC recently approved a final consent order in a case involving Twitter, where data security lapses allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access. The order prohibits misrepresentations about Twitter's privacy protection, mandates security measures, and requires independent security audits. The FTC settled a case involving a software company selling Sentry Parental Controls, which collected children's information without parental consent. The company was ordered to stop sharing the data and destroy any collected information. In a separate case, a data broker allowed consumers to opt out of search results for a fee, but their information still appeared. The broker was required to disclose limitations. The FTC settled a case with a data broker over misleading opt-out offers and refunds for consumers. Google was also involved in a settlement with the FTC regarding privacy violations related to Google Buzz. The FTC alleged that Google's privacy policy was misleading as it did not ask for user consent before using their information for another purpose. The proposed settlement requires Google to implement a comprehensive privacy program and undergo independent privacy audits for the next 20 years. This is the first time the FTC has required a company to implement such a program to protect consumer information. The FTC recently released a Staff Report on a Preliminary Framework on Protecting Consumer Privacy, requiring companies to integrate privacy into their operations, provide meaningful privacy options, and improve transparency in data practices. The Framework applies to all commercial entities collecting consumer data and recommends providing consumers with reasonable access to their data. The FTC Staff Report recommends implementing a universal choice Do Not Track mechanism for behavioral tracking and advertising. The Commerce Department's Internet Policy Taskforce is examining consumer data privacy in the Internet economy and made 10 recommendations to strengthen privacy protections. The Taskforce found that current privacy policies are ineffective and recommended improvements. The IPTF recommended updating the commercial data privacy framework due to the ineffectiveness of the notice-and-choice system. They suggested clear principles for online companies to collect and use personal information, building on existing Fair Information Practice Principles. The report also recommended authorizing the FTC to enforce baseline privacy protections and create incentives for compliance. The IPTF report recommends updating the commercial data privacy framework by authorizing the FTC to enforce baseline privacy protections and create incentives for businesses to adopt self-regulatory privacy codes of conduct. Congress is urged to review the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) in the context of cloud computing, which was enacted in 1986 to balance privacy rights and law enforcement needs in electronic and telecommunications services. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) includes provisions from Title III, the Stored Communications Act, and regulations on trap and trace devices and pen registers. It prohibits interception of communications without exceptions, wiretapping, possession of eavesdropping equipment, and unauthorized access to stored communications. ECPA establishes rules for law enforcement regarding electronic communications. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) sets rules for law enforcement to access data from service providers, ranging from subpoenas to search warrants. ECPA reform aims to update the legal structure for modern technology while protecting user privacy. Cloud computing presents challenges to ECPA, with lower privacy standards for data stored in the cloud. When law enforcement officials seek data stored on personal or business hard drives, a higher privacy standard applies compared to data stored in the cloud or online word processing services."
