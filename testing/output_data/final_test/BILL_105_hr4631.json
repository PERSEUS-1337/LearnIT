    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Value in Supporting International Tourism in the United States Act of 1998\" or \"Visit USA Act.\" The travel and tourism industry is a significant contributor to the US economy, directly employing 7 million Americans and indirectly employing an additional 9.2 million. It is a major employer in 32 states and the District of Columbia, with a total annual payroll of $127.9 billion. The travel and tourism industry in the US generates billions in total expenditures and tax revenues for governments. Through partnerships, the industry promotes the US as a top tourist destination, with significant spending on marketing to international visitors. Foreign visitors spending in the US also contributes to a trade surplus in the service sector. The United States generated a trade surplus of over $26 billion in the service sector. It is crucial for the US to aggressively compete for a larger share of international tourism expenditures to not miss out on a major marketing opportunity. France had 17.9 million more visitors than the US in 1997. 92% of the tourism industry consists of small- and medium-sized businesses, which could benefit from a well-funded international marketing effort. Congress can increase opportunities for attracting international visitors and enhancing their stay in the United States by continuing the successful visa waiver pilot program, improving international signage at various entry points, increasing multilingual tourist information availability, and creating a toll-free, private sector-operated emergency telephone number. Establishing a satellite system for travel data would help policymakers gauge the impact of the tourism industry on the economy. The United States National Tourism Organization aims to increase the country's share of the international tourism market through a national strategy and long-term marketing efforts. The Act aims to support long-term marketing efforts and regulatory reform initiatives to promote international travel to the United States, with the purpose of facilitating international visitors' travel and making the US the top travel destination globally. The Act establishes the International Visitor Assistance Task Force under Title I. The Secretary of Commerce will establish an Intergovernmental Task Force for International Visitor Assistance within 9 months of the Act's enactment. The Task Force will examine signage inadequacies at various facilities in the US and propose solutions, as well as assess the availability of multilingual travel information for international visitors. The Intergovernmental Task Force for International Visitor Assistance will be established by the Secretary of Commerce within 9 months of the Act's enactment. The Task Force will focus on improving signage at US facilities, providing multilingual travel information for international visitors, and exploring the feasibility of a toll-free, private sector operated telephone number for tourists in emergencies. The Task Force will consist of members from various federal agencies and organizations related to tourism. The Intergovernmental Task Force for International Visitor Assistance, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, will include representatives from federal agencies and private sector entities. The Task Force will meet biannually and submit a report to the President and Congress within 18 months, proposing amendments to laws or regulations based on their review. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a satellite accounting system for the travel and tourism industry to track expenditures. Authorization of appropriations for the International Marketing Program is also included. Authorization is granted for funding international promotional activities by the United States National Tourism Organization to promote the US as a top travel destination. Funds must be matched by the private sector, cannot be used for administrative expenses, and must be dedicated to marketing and research for promoting US tourism. The Organization's general and administrative expenses are covered by the private sector as determined by the Board of Directors. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress analyzing the impact of international tourism on the US economy and market share. The Secretary must analyze the impact of expenditures on international tourism on the US trade balance and other economic impacts. The report should also include details on the expenditure of appropriated funds."
