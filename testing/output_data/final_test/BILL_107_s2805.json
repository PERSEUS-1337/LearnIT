The Act \"John's Law of 2002\" introduces liability for permitting an intoxicated arrestee to operate a motor vehicle. It includes withholding 10 percent of apportioned funds from states that do not meet specified requirements regarding public intoxication arrests. States must have and enforce a law providing written statements to individuals transporting or accompanying arrestees, with the content and form established by the State. The Act \"John's Law of 2002\" introduces liability for permitting an intoxicated arrestee to operate a motor vehicle. It includes impoundment of the vehicle operated by the arrestee for 12 hours after arrest, with no obligation on healthcare providers involved in the arrestee's treatment. The vehicle impounded can be released to a person other than the arrestee if the vehicle is not owned or leased by the arrestee and the owner meets release conditions, or if the vehicle is owned or leased by the arrestee and the arrestee meets release conditions. The vehicle impounded can be released to another person if the vehicle is not owned or leased by the arrestee and the person meets release conditions, including presenting valid documents and insurance. A law enforcement agency impounding a vehicle can charge a fee for towing and storage, and retain custody of the vehicle until the fee is paid. Compliance with release conditions allows for the vehicle to be released to another person. Funds withheld under subsection (b) from apportionment to a State remain available for four fiscal years. If the State meets requirements before the end of this period, the funds will be apportioned to the State. Any funds apportioned under subsection (b) shall remain available for expenditure until the end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds are apportioned. Unobligated funds at the end of this period will be allocated equally among States meeting the requirements. If a State does not meet the requirements for funds apportionment, the funds will be allocated equally among States that do meet the requirements. A conforming amendment is made to the analysis for subchapter I of chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code. Liability for allowing an intoxicated arrestee to drive a motor vehicle."
