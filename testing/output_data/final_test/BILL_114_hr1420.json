The Congress finds that state data and monitoring systems provide reliable information on traumatic brain injury causes and risk factors, enabling the development of prevention strategies. New causes of traumatic brain injury have emerged since 1995, including military-related injuries, sports-related concussions, texting while driving accidents, and falls among older adults. In their 2013 report, the Institute on Medicine and the National Research Council highlighted the lack of data to estimate sports-related concussions in youth accurately. They recommended the establishment of a national surveillance system by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the incidence of sports-related concussions in youth ages 5 to 21. Traumatic brain injury is a significant public health issue among older individuals. The need for cost-effective prevention measures for traumatic brain injury among older persons is urgent as the population continues to grow in the United States. Collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and various Federal agencies, school systems, and State agencies is necessary to implement prevention measures effectively. Establishing requirements to improve research and treatment of traumatic brain injury. The Secretary will evaluate existing surveillance systems for traumatic brain injury, submit a report to Congress, and establish the National Traumatic Brain Injury Surveillance System. This system will facilitate further research on brain injury. The Secretary will collect and store information on the incidence and prevalence of traumatic brain injury in the United States, including demographics such as age, race, sex, geographic location, and history of head injury. The Secretary will collect and store information on traumatic brain injury, including demographics and details on the injury, pre-existing conditions, and co-occurring issues. Information on impact location, diagnosis qualifications, assessment tools, symptoms, and activity levels will also be stored for analysis. The Secretary will consult with experts on traumatic brain injury, including epidemiologists, national health associations, and state public health agencies. The Secretary may award grants to public or private nonprofit entities for activities related to traumatic brain injury surveillance. Coordination with other federal agencies is required for sharing information from the National Traumatic Brain Injury Surveillance System. The Secretary will make information from the National Traumatic Brain Injury Surveillance System available to federal departments, agencies, and the public, ensuring privacy protections similar to HIPAA laws. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the implementation of the National Traumatic Brain Injury Surveillance System, including information on data collection, use, and coordination with other databases. The term \"HIPAA privacy and security law\" refers to the law defined in section 3009 of the Public Health Service Act. \"Personally identifiable information\" includes data that can identify an individual, such as their name or social security number. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The term \"surveillance\" refers to the systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of health-related data for public health action. \"Traumatic brain injury\" is defined as head injury from various causes.
