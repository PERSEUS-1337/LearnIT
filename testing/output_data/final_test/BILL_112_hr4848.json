    "content": "The \"Save Our Neighborhoods Act of 2012\" may be cited as the short title. Stays of foreclosures are addressed in the Act. A mortgagor of a property with a federally related mortgage loan can file a motion in court to stop foreclosure proceedings for 60 days. The mortgagor is limited to filing one motion under this provision. The mortgagor and mortgagee must meet within 30 days of the mortgagor filing a motion to stop foreclosure. The mortgagee must provide a list of approved housing counseling agencies 15 days before the meeting. If a modified mortgage agreement is not reached within 60 days, the court may issue an order for foreclosure. The mortgagor can request one additional meeting before the foreclosure period ends. The court may grant an order to stay foreclosure proceedings if the mortgagor proves their ability to make payments, financial hardship, and intent to reside in the property. The order will stay foreclosure proceedings 60 days after the motion is filed. The court order under subsection (a)(1) can stay foreclosure proceedings for up to 3 years, prohibit late fees, toll the statute of limitations, and require payments on the federally related mortgage loan. During a foreclosure stay, the court can require the mortgagor to make payments determined by the court, which may include fair market rental value. The mortgagee must apply payments to taxes, insurance obligations, interest, and principal amount due on the mortgage. During a foreclosure stay, the court may order an appraisal to determine the fair market value of the property. If the value is less than the remaining mortgage principal, the court can adjust the principal amount accordingly and order reasonable interest on the adjusted principal. During a foreclosure stay, the court may order an appraisal to determine the fair market value of the property. If the value is greater than the remaining mortgage principal, the court can order payments at a reasonable interest rate based on the average prime offer rate for mortgages. The fair market rental value of the property is determined by considering fair market rents in the area and any other relevant information deemed appropriate by the court. (g) Authority of Magistrate Judges: A magistrate judge can hear proceedings related to a motion under subsection (a) and issue orders as per this section, despite the limitations of section 636(b)(1)(A) of title 28, United States Code.\n(h) Limitation on Remedies: The mortgagee's remedies are restricted to those available in a foreclosure proceeding.\n(i) Definitions: \"Federally related mortgage loan\" and \"financial hardship\" are defined as per the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974. The curr_chunk discusses reasons why a mortgagor may be unable to make payments, such as income loss, financial changes, increased mortgage payments, higher expenses, lack of cash reserves, and excessive debt payments. The court determines predatory lending practices by considering abusive collection practices, balloon payments, encouragement of default, repeat financing depleting equity, excessive fees and interest rates, fraud, high loan-to-value ratio, lending without regard to ability to repay, loan flipping, mandatory arbitration clauses, payday lending, and pre-payment penalties. The curr_chunk discusses predatory lending practices such as refinancing without economic benefit, high-cost lender referrals, subprime lending, and high yield-spread premiums. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director has regulatory authority to make rules for the Act. The Act will be effective for 5 years from the date of enactment."
