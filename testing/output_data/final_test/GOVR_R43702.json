    "content": "The number of unaccompanied children from the \"northern triangle\" of Central America attempting to enter the United States has significantly increased in recent years, particularly during the 2014 fiscal year. U.S. Border Patrol apprehended nearly 52,000 unaccompanied minors from the region at the southwest border, a 150% increase compared to FY2013. Despite a decline in overall numbers since FY2014, apprehensions of unaccompanied children remain high, straining government resources and raising concerns about their safety and protection. The number of Central American minors leaving their homes to enter the United States has increased significantly. Analysts attribute this to push factors like violence and poverty in Central America, and pull factors like family reunification and perceptions of U.S. immigration policies. Migration levels are expected to remain high until security and socioeconomic issues in the region are addressed. Congress is concerned about the influx of unaccompanied minors and has taken steps to address the situation. This report focuses on the foreign policy aspects of the issue. The report focuses on U.S. policy towards increased migration from Central America, discussing issues such as humanitarian implications, international response, reintegration of deported children, addressing root causes, and Mexico's role as a transit country. It concludes with an outlook for U.S. policy on the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. The increased flow of unaccompanied minors from Central America to the United States has led policymakers to reevaluate U.S. relations with the region. During the Cold War, the U.S. government provided extensive assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The geographic proximity has historically led to close political, economic, and cultural ties between the United States and Central America. During the 1980s, the US provided significant aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras as they faced civil conflicts. Many people were killed or disappeared, with government forces responsible for human rights abuses. Despite seeking refuge in the US, most Salvadorans and Guatemalans were denied asylum. The US also established the Caribbean Basin Initiative to support stability in Central America. The US provided aid to Central America in the 1980s during civil conflicts. Support waned in the 1990s after peace accords were signed. Aid declined in the 1990s, and deportations of Central Americans increased after the IIRIRA of 1996. Between 1998 and 2005, the United States deported nearly 46,000 convicts to Central America, including members of gangs like MS-13 and M-18, leading to increased gang violence in the region. Despite this, many Central Americans continued to migrate to the US for economic reasons. The US has been working to enhance security cooperation with the northern triangle countries to address crime, violence, and drug trafficking through initiatives like CARSI. CARSI, funded by Congress with nearly $1.5 billion since FY2008, provides equipment, training, and technical assistance to Central American nations for law enforcement operations. It aims to strengthen governments' long-term capacities to address security challenges and underlying social and political factors. While most U.S. agencies shifted focus to security concerns in the region, the Millennium Challenge Corporation provided economic aid. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provided economic aid to Central American countries. In 2005, a $205 million compact was signed with Honduras for transportation infrastructure and rural development. Despite not renewing the compact due to corruption issues, a $15.6 million threshold program was approved in 2013. El Salvador received a $461 million compact in 2006 and an additional $277 million in 2014 for development. Guatemala has not received a compact yet, but a $28 million program was approved by the MCC Board. The MCC Board approved a $28 million threshold program for Guatemala in 2014 to support fiscal reform, partnerships with the private sector, and improve education-labor market linkages. Trade relations with the United States under CAFTA-DR have boosted U.S. merchandise trade with the northern triangle countries by 54% between 2005 and 2015. U.S. imports from the Central American region have increased by 29%. The stock of U.S. direct investment in the northern triangle countries has also risen from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $4.7 billion in 2014. There are strong cultural ties between the United States and Central America, with significant foreign-born populations from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras residing in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security estimates that a significant percentage of Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and Hondurans in the U.S. are undocumented. ICE removed thousands of individuals from the northern triangle in FY2015. Some Central Americans have Temporary Protected Status in the U.S. due to natural disasters. Policymakers are concerned about the increasing number of unaccompanied minors and Central Americans at the U.S. border. The Obama Administration has taken steps to address the foreign policy dimensions of the increasing number of unaccompanied minors and Central Americans arriving at the U.S. border. This includes diplomacy with northern triangle governments, public awareness campaigns, anti-human smuggling operations, support for Mexican immigration enforcement, in-country refugee processing program, and a \"U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America\" to promote economic prosperity, good governance, and improved security in the region. The Obama Administration has worked with northern triangle governments to address the migration crisis, coordinating responses and conducting diplomatic outreach. This has led to public awareness campaigns, efforts to combat human smuggling, and the drafting of the \"Plan of the Alliance for.\" The Obama Administration collaborated with northern triangle governments to combat human smuggling and drafted the \"Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity\" to address migration factors through economic growth, education, security, and government institution strengthening. Presidents from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras reviewed achievements and committed to further actions in 2016. The Alliance for Prosperity aligns with U.S. assistance goals in the region, and Administration officials engaged in public diplomacy efforts. The Obama Administration collaborated with northern triangle governments to combat human smuggling and drafted the \"Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity\" to address migration factors through economic growth, education, security, and government institution strengthening. Presidents from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras reviewed achievements and committed to further actions in 2016. Administration officials engaged in extensive public diplomacy efforts, including warning Central Americans about the dangers of irregular migration to the United States and correcting misperceptions about U.S. immigration policies through campaigns like the \"Dangers Awareness Campaign\" and \"Executive Action on Immigration: Know the Facts.\" The 2014 and 2015 public awareness campaigns aimed to explain U.S. immigration policies and dispel misinformation but were halted due to a court ruling. A recent study questions the effectiveness of such campaigns in deterring migration, as knowledge of the dangers and deportation policies did not impact individuals' intentions to migrate. Those victimized by crime were more likely to consider migration. The Obama Administration intensified efforts to target human smuggling operations with \"Operation Coyote,\" resulting in numerous arrests, indictments, and convictions related to human smuggling in FY2015. Victims of crime are nearly twice as likely to intend to migrate, suggesting immediate concerns outweigh hypothetical dangers in migration decisions. In FY2015, there were 690 indictments and 612 convictions for human smuggling. Analysts believe that anti-smuggling operations may not significantly impact migration flows in the long term, as other criminal groups could fill the void. The US has seen increased apprehensions in FY2016, and efforts have been made to secure Mexico's southern border. The plan announced in July 2014 includes increased security at 12 ports of entry into Guatemala and Belize, as well as increased immigration enforcement along migration routes. Mexico's INM has set up over 100 mobile highway checkpoints, with $130 million allocated by the U.S. State Department for border security in Mexico. $20 million has been delivered for nonintrusive inspection equipment, canine teams, and training in immigration enforcement as of February 2016. Additional funding will support a biometrics system and secure communications network for Mexican agencies. The U.S. government is providing funding for a biometrics system and secure communications network for Mexican agencies in the southern border region, using M\u00e9rida aid. The implementation of the U.S.-backed Southern Border Plan in Mexico has led to increased apprehensions and deportations of Central Americans, resulting in fewer migrants reaching the U.S. border. Human rights advocates are concerned about Mexico's Southern Border Plan leading migrants to take dangerous routes, hindering access to shelters and asylum. The U.S. established a refugee/parole program in Central American countries to provide a safer alternative for unaccompanied children. The United States established a refugee/parole program in Central American countries to allow certain parents lawfully present in the U.S. to request refugee resettlement for their children in their home countries. Over 7,000 CAM applications were filed by early April 2016, with 162 individuals arriving in the U.S. Assistance has been increased for northern triangle nations to address conditions prompting migration. In FY2014, Congress did not fund a $300 million emergency supplemental appropriations request for Central America. However, in FY2015, Congress allocated over $570 million for the region, $241 million more than initially requested. The funds were to address key factors contributing to migration of minors to the U.S. The act required a strategy for addressing border security in Central America and Mexico, focusing on economic and social development, judicial and police reform, combating human trafficking, and supporting the safe repatriation of minors. The Obama Administration introduced a new U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America in March 2015, aiming to promote economic prosperity, improve security, and strengthen governance in the region. The strategy required reports every 60 days on progress made towards objectives, including funding allocation, border security measures, and cooperation with U.S. agencies. Failure to comply could result in the suspension of assistance to governments. In FY2016, Congress allocated $748 million for the Central America strategy, with $349 million for CARSI. The State Department and USAID were directed to prioritize assistance to address key factors contributing to migration of minors to the U.S. Conditions were placed on aid, requiring a multiyear spending plan to be provided before funds could be obligated. The State must provide a multiyear spending plan to the Appropriations Committees detailing the proposed purposes, objectives, indicators, and implementation timeline of the funding. 25% of funds for the central governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras cannot be used until the Secretary of State certifies that they are taking steps to inform citizens of the dangers of the journey to the U.S. border, combat human smuggling, improve border security, and cooperate with U.S. agencies for the return of illegal migrants. The State Department has issued certifications for all three governments. The Secretary of State issued certifications for the northern triangle governments on March 10, 2016. 50% of funds for central governments cannot be used until effective steps are taken to combat corruption, improve transparency, and involve local communities in the plan's activities. The plan aims to counter criminal activities, prosecute human rights violators, support poverty reduction programs, establish a civilian police force, protect civil liberties, and increase government revenues. The State Department has not yet issued certifications related to conditions for Central American governments to receive assistance. The Obama Administration requested $772 million for Central America in FY2017, including funds for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, CARSI, and other regional programs. The Obama Administration requested $772 million for Central America in FY2017, with $357 million allocated for Development Assistance to support good governance, economic growth, and social stability. Additionally, $34 million would be provided for Global Health Programs to strengthen health systems in Guatemala and combat HIV/AIDS in the region, along with $5 million in Food for Peace development food aid for Guatemala. The Obama Administration requested $772 million for Central America in FY2017. $143 million, or 19% of the total aid request, would be provided through the Economic Support Fund for USAID's CARSI programming, justice and security sector reform, crime and violence prevention, food security, and economic and energy integration. Another $232 million, or 30% of the request, would fund security efforts, with $205 million from the INCLE account supporting CARSI programming. The Obama Administration requested $772 million for Central America in FY2017. Nearly $27 million from the INCLE account would support CARSI programming for security and justice sector institutions, specialized law enforcement units, and combatting organized crime. Additionally, $500,000 in NADR aid would be provided to Panama for a strategic trade management system. $772 million would be allocated for Central America, with a focus on training and equipment for professionalizing militaries and enhancing border security. The Obama Administration requested $772 million for Central America in FY2017, with additional funding of $135 million from other U.S. agencies to support a whole-of-government strategy in the region. This includes funding from the Department of Defense, Department of Agriculture, Department of the Treasury, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Labor, Inter-American Foundation, Trade and Development Agency, and OPIC. The Administration also plans to leverage $158 million in private-sector resources for the region through OPIC and USAID's Development Credit Authority. Congress is debating the budget request and legislative options to address increased migration from Central America. The increased migration from Central America raises foreign policy concerns, including humanitarian implications, international response, capacity of nations to receive deported children, addressing root causes, and Mexico's role as a transit country. The UNHCR called for a regional humanitarian response in 2014 due to a surge in unaccompanied children at the U.S.-Mexican border. Distinctions between refugees, asylum-seekers, and migrants are not always clear in this situation. The UNHCR has urged for a regional response to assist and protect unaccompanied children and others seeking asylum in countries in the region, as the number of asylum applications has significantly increased in countries like Mexico, Costa Rica, and Belize. In Belize, 633 people sought asylum, which is 10 times more than in 2014. The United States had the most asylum applications, with a 250% increase over 2013. UNHCR called for a stronger protection response due to the surge in people fleeing violence in Central America. The U.S. and other governments expressed concern for the human rights of vulnerable children during their journey and upon arrival in the destination country. Unaccompanied children require comprehensive assistance with food, medical care, shelter, protection, safety, legal assistance, and education during the return process. Building reception capacity is critical in addressing the humanitarian needs of children and families while protecting their rights and dignity. The situation in the northern triangle countries and Mexico creates forced displacement due to factors like poverty, violence, food insecurity, and criminal activity, rather than natural disasters or conflicts. The conditions in the northern triangle and Mexico are causing displacement, especially among women, girls, and unaccompanied children, who face dangers like recruitment into criminal gangs and violence. This population movement is known as mixed migration, involving different groups of people traveling without proper documentation. The ongoing severe drought in Central America, caused by El Ni\u00f1o, has affected millions of people in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, leading to food insecurity and loss of livelihoods. U.N. agencies and authorities are coordinating efforts to respond to the crisis. The response to the drought in Central America includes international humanitarian efforts by U.N. agencies and NGOs to address food insecurity and migration. UNHCR is collaborating with governments and partners to improve screening procedures for those fleeing violence and enhance access to asylum. UNHCR launched an appeal for $23.5 million to support authorities in countries of origin, transit, and asylum to create robust protection systems and strengthen asylum policies in the Northern Triangle and surrounding countries. Interventions by UNHCR focus on protecting and assisting asylum-seekers, refugees, deported persons with specific needs, and internally displaced persons. Other humanitarian organizations like ICRC and IOM also prioritize assisting vulnerable communities affected by armed violence and addressing migration issues in the region. The International Rescue Committee, Catholic Relief Services, Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), and World Vision are among the NGOs providing assistance to vulnerable migrants in Central America and Mexico. The State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration supports efforts to protect asylum-seekers and migrants in the region, with funding from the Migration and Refugee Assistance account. In FY2015, PRM provided $20.1 million to UNHCR for strengthening asylum systems and international protection screening, particularly for children. In FY2015, PRM provided $41.4 million in funding for international protection screening, including $700,000 for UNHCR's programs for Central American minors. Additionally, PRM allocated $19.3 million to the ICRC for its regional appeal in the Western Hemisphere, focusing on response to violence and family reunification. In FY2016, PRM plans to fund $1.3 million for UNHCR's 2016 regional appeal. In FY2015, PRM provided funding for international protection screening and emergency food assistance through the Food for Peace program. As of late February 2016, over $7 million in funding had been programmed for FY2016. Regional and international entities, including UNHCR and the Central American Integration System, are working to address the needs of unaccompanied children. Coordination within the U.N. system involves UNHCR and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance. International and regional entities are collaborating to develop protection strategies for children facing deportation in Latin America. The Central American Integration System (SICA) and the Organization of American States (OAS) are leading discussions on displacement policies. The UN Development Group for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNDG LAC) is exploring ways to link projects to the humanitarian situation, while the National Refugee Commission is working on improving asylum systems. Meetings are being held to create a regional initiative to identify alternatives to detention and improve reception for at-risk children. The UNHCR emphasized the need for a regional approach to address the root causes of child and family movement in Latin America. In December 2014, governments in the region adopted the Brazil Declaration and Plan of Action to uphold international protection standards and find innovative solutions for refugees and displaced persons. The Plan of Action from the Brazil Declaration aims to address the needs of refugees, displaced persons, and stateless individuals in the region. It includes a broader definition of refugees than the 1951 U.N. Convention and 1967 Protocol, focusing on regional protection for vulnerable groups. Concerns arise about the deportation of unaccompanied minors back to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, with experts warning about potential harm to returnee children if adequate support is not provided. These countries have improved their capacity to receive and process deported youth. The northern triangle countries lack effective tracking and reintegration programs for deported children, increasing the risk of re-migration. The number of unaccompanied children deported from the United States to these countries has remained relatively stable in recent years. In FY2014, 1,379 children were deported, with concerns about the lack of support for returnee children. In FY2015, ICE deported 1,141 unaccompanied children to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Despite limited deportations, all three countries are struggling to provide services due to overall increases in deportations, especially from Mexico. The U.S., Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran governments fear that as the cases of apprehended Central American children are processed, more minors will be deported. The U.S. government has expressed concerns about the ability of El Salvador and Honduras to handle large numbers of deported minors. Observers worry about the northern triangle countries' capacity to protect vulnerable groups, such as children under 12 and girls, amid a surge in child emigration from Central America since 2013. The governments in the region are working on plans to improve assistance for deported children and seeking support from international donors and institutions. USAID has initiated programs in the northern triangle countries to improve their capacities to receive unaccompanied minors. IOM, with U.S. assistance, supports programs like renovating reception centers, distributing hygiene kits, food, and providing health services to deported children and youth. Through the Northern Triangle Migration Information Management Initiative, IOM is training officials to manage migration information for humanitarian action and protection of vulnerable populations. The Guatemalan government provides comprehensive services to returned citizens, including reception at an Air Force base in Guatemala City with various services like welcome talks, refreshments, free phone calls, and psychological care. These services were initially funded by IOM with USAID support but were taken over by the government in 2013. The Guatemalan government provides services for deported individuals, including processing at an Air Force base in Guatemala City. Returnees receive assistance from various government agencies, such as obtaining national identification cards, access to health services, and help with transportation. Unaccompanied minors are separated from adults and taken care of by the Attorney General's office until a guardian is found. The government operates hostels in Guatemala City and Quetzaltenango for unaccompanied children, providing temporary accommodation and support. In southern Mexico, children are deported weekly and receive support at hostels run by the Secretariat of Social Welfare. IOM is expanding services at the Quetzaltenango shelter, while World Vision is building a reception site at an Air Force base for returning women and children. Honduras has improved reception centers for repatriated citizens, including unaccompanied minors who undergo assessments upon arrival. Labor Ministry officials assist adults in finding employment, and Education Ministry officials provide support. The Honduran president promises to enroll qualifying individuals in social welfare programs. Deportees stay in temporary shelters for up to two days and receive transportation stipends and food. The National Directorate for Children, Adolescents, and Family (DINAF) places unaccompanied children with families or in care centers. International and local organizations assist the Honduran government, with UNHCR supporting improvements at reception centers for deported children and families. IOM is improving reception centers for deported people in Honduras, providing hygiene kits and appliances. Casa Alianza assists in screening children repatriated from Mexico. The Salvadoran government, with support from USAID, offers reintegration assistance for deported migrants, including meals, medical attention, and psychological services. El Salvador's program for deportees now provides specialized services for unaccompanied minors, with over 90% being reunited with family within 12 to 24 hours. IOM has renovated facilities in San Salvador for deported minors needing special attention and provided workshops to improve care. However, UNHCR notes that the capacity to safely reintegrate children in the northern triangle countries is lacking. Although El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have made some progress with UNHCR's support in establishing protocols for identifying protection needs among deported citizens, specific procedures for those expressing fear of returning to their communities are lacking. Providing effective protection for deported unaccompanied minors and others remains a significant challenge for all three countries. Cases of severe persecution or death post-deportation have been reported, but UNHCR and its partners do not systematically track them. UNHCR is starting to assist the governments in identifying and documenting returned migrants with protection needs in the northern triangle. In the northern triangle countries, efforts are being made to understand the reasons behind the emigration of unaccompanied minors and improve their reception upon deportation. Programs like Guatemala's National Council for Attention to Migrants offer support and reintegration services for repatriates. Honduras now allows children to enroll in schools at any time to aid in their reintegration. In El Salvador, children without family are placed in shelters, and some municipalities have Committees on Children's Rights. In El Salvador, Committees on Children's Rights have been formed in some municipalities. The government has established networks to assist deported minors, but these networks lack sufficient resources. A pilot project for child protection was launched in 2015, providing multidisciplinary teams to support deported children. USAID-funded programs are collecting data to develop reintegration policies, including generating community profiles on migration and key needs. The Northern Triangle Migration Information Management Initiative is training government officials on managing migration issues. Migration Information Management Initiative is training government officials to manage data integration systems and collect information for public policy development in local communities. NGOs are supporting unaccompanied minors with limited funding, such as Casa Alianza in Honduras and Kids in Need of Defense in Guatemala. Services include temporary shelter and follow-up services for deported children. The Guatemalan Child Return and Reintegration Project by KIND provides a range of services including temporary shelter, family reunification assistance, psychological support, education, job training, and ongoing follow-up services for repatriated children. They also offer emergency food assistance and health support for the child's family, and open educational and job training programs to siblings and parents. KIND is working on identifying and meeting the specific needs of returning girls, with plans to expand similar projects in the region. Central American governments need to provide a broader range of social services for returned citizens to address the root causes of migration. The countries face poor security, high crime rates, gang activity, economic challenges, and significant poverty and inequality. Addressing these issues is crucial for reintegration and preventing further migration. The northern triangle countries face a coffee rust crisis, high levels of inequality, and insecurity that hinders development. Analysts believe the governments lack the necessary resources and political will to address these issues. However, they have collaborated on the \"Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle\" to tackle long-standing development challenges. The governments of the northern triangle countries struggle with controlling criminal elements, leading to a lack of citizen security. Police and military forces are undermanned and ill-equipped, allowing well-armed criminal groups to operate freely. Corruption in security forces, justice institutions, and political systems is a major concern, leading to high levels of impunity in the criminal justice systems. Guatemala has made some progress in reducing impunity rates in recent years. Corruption and impunity in the northern triangle countries, particularly in Guatemala and Honduras, have been fueled by incomplete institutional reforms after armed conflicts in the 1990s. Criminal groups influence public officials and elections, leading to massive corruption scandals. Guatemala's attorney general, supported by the U.N. Commission Against Impunity, uncovered corruption in customs and social security systems, resulting in the resignation of top officials. Honduras also faces corruption charges, with President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez accused of embezzling funds for his election campaign. Central American political elites benefit from emigration to the United States, which reduces social pressure to address high unemployment and natural disasters. Remittances from workers in the U.S. provide supplementary income to families in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. In 2014, remittances were equivalent to a significant percentage of GDP in these countries. Governments in the northern triangle countries struggle to increase revenues, leading to inadequate public services. Elites resist tax hikes, rely on private services, and avoid investing in public institutions. This cycle weakens governance, erodes citizen trust, and hinders socio-economic progress. Despite some efforts to improve conditions, the situation remains challenging. In El Salvador, the government is prioritizing community policing, investing in health infrastructure and schools, and promoting public-private dialogue in key sectors. Honduras has increased taxes, allocated funds for crime prevention, and signed agreements to combat corruption. Guatemala has made progress in addressing crime and impunity with CICIG's help. The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, with assistance from the IDB, collaborated on the \"Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle.\" The \"Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle\" aims to stimulate the productive sector, develop opportunities, improve public safety, and strengthen institutions in Central America. The plan includes actions such as reducing energy costs, modernizing infrastructure, increasing training, and enhancing government transparency. The presidents allocated $2.6 billion in their 2016 budgets for the plan, but the countries estimate needing $22 billion over four years for full implementation. The Mexican government is seeking $22 billion over four years to implement a plan and is looking for resources from allied countries and development partners. Mexico is seen as a partner in securing the southern border and combating Central American transmigration. They collaborate with U.S. law enforcement to combat alien smuggling and illegal migration. Mexico's migration reform in 2011 did not create a transit visa for migrants crossing through Mexico. Visas are still required for Central Americans entering Mexico without a valid U.S. visa, except for those from Belize or Guatemala with work permits or regional visitor's cards. Despite efforts to address migration flows, Mexico lacks funding and institutions to handle increasing immigrant numbers. The National Migration Institute (INM) has removed corrupt staff, but still lacks adequate internal affairs. Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM) lacks an adequate internal affairs unit, leading to few consequences for staff involved in human rights abuses against migrants. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto's Southern Border Plan increased security at entry points with Guatemala and Belize, while also facilitating legal migration. INM agents, along with federal and state police, have enforced the plan by stopping migrants from boarding trains and setting up checkpoints on highways. In 2015, Mexico removed 150,170 migrants from the northern triangle countries, up from 104,269 in 2014. Mexico removed 150,170 migrants from the northern triangle countries in 2015, including 30,347 children (14,514 unaccompanied). INM agents referred more cases to prosecutors for crimes against migrants, but the government faced criticism for failing to prevent abuses, detaining children, and not offering eligible migrants access to humanitarian visas or asylum. Migrants traveling through Mexico are vulnerable to human rights abuses, including human trafficking, by criminal organizations and corrupt officials. Mexico's immigration law mandates informing migrants of their right to apply for international protection, but activists claim few unaccompanied children are informed about humanitarian visas or asylum. Despite regulations prohibiting children from being held in migration detention centers, many remain in facilities lacking infrastructure to implement the rules. INM has child protection officers, but they are spread thin, and some children are referred to DIF shelters. However, DIF facilities struggle to comply with regulations. Despite a 17% increase in asylum applications in 2014, the Mexican Commission for the Aid of Refugees (COMAR) received a budget increase of only 4% for 2015, leading to limited manpower to process all migrants. The lack of information about migrants' right to apply and lengthy detention periods have deterred many from applying. The State Department has allocated $130 million in assistance to support border security in Mexico, with $20 million already delivered for equipment and training assistance. The Obama Administration faces challenges in responding to the increase in unaccompanied children and Central Americans attempting to enter the United States. U.S. authorities apprehended nearly 52,000 unaccompanied minors from the region in FY2014, straining resources and creating a complex crisis with humanitarian implications. Despite a 45% decline in FY2015, apprehensions have increased again in the first five months of FY2016. The Obama Administration's response to the surge in unaccompanied minors and Central Americans entering the U.S. included public awareness campaigns, anti-smuggling operations, and a refugee/parole program in northern triangle countries. Mexico's increased immigration enforcement efforts, supported by the U.S., have been key in deterring migrants from reaching the U.S. border. However, this has led to migrants taking more dangerous routes, raising humanitarian concerns. The U.S. government is focusing on deportations of unaccompanied minors and strengthening Central American nations' capacities to receive deportees. International organizations are providing assistance to northern triangle governments for repatriated citizens, but concerns remain about the ability of these governments to protect deportees. The United States is expected to continue receiving mixed migration flows from Central America until citizen security and economic opportunities improve. The Obama Administration has introduced a new strategy to promote economic prosperity and security in the region, with $750 million in assistance allocated for implementation. Improving conditions in Central America will require long-term international support. Central American nations need external support to address challenges, but improvements in security and socioeconomic conditions depend on internal reforms by leaders. The Northern triangle countries must increase revenues, reduce corruption, strengthen institutions, and enhance educational and economic opportunities. Congress has placed strict conditions on U.S. assistance to incentivize reforms outlined in the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity. Progress in the region will be closely monitored by Members of Congress to ensure that U.S. initiatives are successful."
