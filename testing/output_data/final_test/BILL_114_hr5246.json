It consists of a 393.53 acre tract of land in Galveston County, Texas, described in detail. The curr_chunk describes the location of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Brass Caps on the Texas City Dike in Texas City, Texas. The caps are used as reference points for distances and directions along Bay Street. The chunk also outlines the courses and distances along State Tracts 98A and 99A towards Galveston Bay. The curr_chunk describes the direction and distances along State Tracts 98A and 99A towards Galveston Bay, including angles and distances to various points on the tract. The curr_chunk details the specific angles, distances, and curves along State Tracts 98A and 99A towards Galveston Bay, including non-tangent curves to the left and right with varying radii, central angles, chords, and arc lengths. The curr_chunk describes angles, distances, and curves along State Tracts 98A and 99A towards Galveston Bay, including non-tangent curves with varying radii, central angles, chords, and arc lengths. The curr_chunk describes angles, distances, and curves along State Tracts 98A and 99A towards Galveston Bay, including non-tangent curves with varying radii, central angles, chords, and arc lengths.

Southwesterly along the tangent curve to the left with a radius of 185.00 feet, central angle of 82\u000f 27' 32\", chord of South 62\u000f 01' 41\" West - 243.86 feet, and arc length of 266.25 feet to the beginning of a compound curve. Southerly along the compound curve to the left with a radius of 4,535.58 feet, central angle of 11\u000f 06' 58\", chord of South 15\u000f 14' 26\" West - 878.59 feet, and arc length of 879.97 feet. The curr_chunk describes angles, distances, and curves along State Tracts 98A and 99A towards Galveston Bay, including non-tangent curves with varying radii, central angles, chords, and arc lengths. South 64\u000f 37' 11\" West, 146.03 feet. South 67\u000f 08' 21\" West, 194.42 feet. North 34\u000f 48' 22\" West, 789.69 feet. South 42\u000f 47' 10\" West, 161.01 feet. South 42\u000f 47' 10\" West, 144.66 feet to a point for the beginning of a tangent curve to the right. Westerly along said tangent curve. The curr_chunk describes angles, distances, and curves along State Tracts 98A and 99A towards Galveston Bay, including non-tangent curves with varying radii, central angles, chords, and arc lengths. North 77\u000f 22' 21\" West, a distance of 591.41 feet to the intersection of said parallel line with the edge of fill adjacent to the easterly edge of the Texas City Turning Basin for the southwesterly corner of the tract herein described. The curr_chunk describes eighteen courses and distances along the edge of fill adjacent to the easterly edge of Texas City Turning Basin, with various angles and distances specified. The curr_chunk describes multiple distances and angles along the edge of a tract, with specific measurements provided for each point. The curr_chunk provides detailed measurements of distances and angles along the edge of a tract, including specific points and directions.
