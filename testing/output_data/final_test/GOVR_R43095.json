    "content": "The McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945 authorized states to regulate insurance, a role reaffirmed by Congress in laws like the GLBA and the Dodd-Frank Act. Despite this, Congress has shown ongoing interest in the efficiency of the state-based insurance regulatory system, with organizations like the NAIC and NCOIL working to harmonize laws nationwide. Various federal proposals have been suggested to change the state-based insurance regulatory system, from creating a federal charter to preempting some state laws. In the 113th Congress, licensing issues for insurance producers were addressed through the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Act. The 114th Congress passed legislation known as \"NARAB II\" which mandates the creation of a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers. This bill, signed into law as P.L. 114-1 on January 12, 2015, aims to streamline insurance producer licensing across states to enforce standards of conduct and consumer protections. The insurance producer licensing system includes education requirements, exams, and background checks. The NAIC has model laws, but states can modify them, leading to variability in licensing requirements. Many insurance producers hold licenses in multiple states, with larger agencies holding licenses in more states. Producers operating in multiple states seek increased uniformity and reciprocity. Insurance producers operating in multiple states seek uniformity and reciprocity to reduce costs related to license requirements. GLBA aimed to address the variability in licensing requirements among states. Some view local licenses as important consumer protections, while others see them as burdensome. In 2008, insurance agents highlighted states imposing additional requirements on nonresident agents despite GLBA reciprocity laws. The Government Accountability Office identified fingerprinting and background checks as barriers to uniformity in producer licensing, potentially leading to uneven consumer protection and higher costs for insurers. The NAIC certified 47 states as reciprocal for insurance licensing, but California, Florida, and Washington were not certified, representing 20% of the population. Licensing regimes act as barriers to entry, potentially increasing consumer costs and allowing license holders to extract economic rents. The public benefits of licensure must outweigh the costs. Licensure in the financial services industry is generally accepted and required by federal law for those involved in securities transactions with the public. H.R. 26 in the 114th Congress, now P.L. 114-1, created the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers with key features outlined. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) is a private, nonprofit corporation that prohibits receiving federal funds. Insurance producers must be licensed, pass a background check, and meet criteria set by NARAB. Members can operate in any state by paying a licensing fee, subject to state regulations. NARAB is overseen by a board of eight appointees. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) is overseen by a board of appointees with expertise in insurance. The President can dissolve the board or suspend actions, and NARAB must submit reports to the President and States. S. 534, the NARAB Reform Act of 2013, was introduced by Senator Jon Tester and referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment held a hearing on the bill on March 19, 2013, and the full committee marked up S. 534 on June 6, 2013. S. 534 aimed to establish a NARAB, a private, nonprofit corporation for insurance producers to operate in any state with a single license. Members needed to pass background checks and meet specific criteria. The proposed NARAB would have allowed insurance producers to operate in multiple states with a single license, overseen by a board of appointees including state insurance commissioners and industry representatives. The President could dissolve the board or suspend actions, with annual reports submitted to the President and NAIC. Senate Committee marked up S. 534 on June 6, 2013. The amendment offered by Senators Jon Tester and Mike Johanns made changes to the original legislation, including adding the Department of the Treasury as a conduit of information from NARAB to the President, requiring public availability of NARAB bylaws and annual report on their website, and changing the reporting recipients to include the President and the States. Additionally, two amendments were adopted in the markup regarding the board of directors' appointees having expertise in the insurance industry. Following amendments by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tom Coburn, the NARAB organization was prohibited from receiving federal funds and states were given the option to opt out of participation. The amended version of S. 534 was favorably reported and introduced as H.R. 1155 by Representative Randy Neugebauer. Representative Neugebauer motioned to pass an amended version of H.R. 1155, closely following S. 534 with amendments by Senators Warren and Coburn. Differences included background check language, with the House bill requiring fingerprints and higher penalties for improper disclosure. The amended H.R. 1155 passed the House with a vote of 397-6. H.R. 1155 as amended passed the House of Representatives with a vote of 397-6. S. 1926, introduced by Senator Robert Menendez, had two titles focusing on flood insurance provisions. Senator Coburn's amendment to allow states to opt out of NARAB was rejected. S. 1926 as amended passed the Senate by a vote of 67-32 on January 30, 2014. On June 19, 2014, an amendment was accepted on a voice vote as part of a markup of H.R. 4871 to extend and amend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The overall bill was ordered to be favorably reported to the full House on June 20, 2014. On July 17, 2014, Senator Tester offered an amendment to S. 2244 to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, adding a new section that would terminate NARAB II provisions two years after the association approves its first member. On December 10, 2014, the House passed S. 2244 with amendments, including NARAB II provisions and changes to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The bill also added a new Title III related to derivatives and margin requirements for end users. The Administration supported NARAB II legislation in the 113th Congress. The Federal Insurance Office recommended passage of NARAB II legislation to modernize insurance regulation in the US. The Administration expressed support for the policy goals of S. 1926 but had reservations about the bill's process for criminal background checks and raised constitutional concerns. The Administration supported the policy goals of NARAB II legislation but had concerns about the bill's process for criminal background checks and constitutional issues. Legislation to create NARAB organization was introduced in multiple Congresses, with similar bills passed by the House but not brought to the floor in the 112th Congress. The NARAB II bills aim to create a nonprofit organization for state-licensed insurance producers to operate across states without individual state licenses. The makeup of the board of directors has varied in different versions of the legislation. The NARAB II bills changed the makeup of the board to 13 people, with 8 insurance commissioners and 5 insurance industry representatives, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Previous legislation required a report by NARAB to the President, Congress, and the NAIC, but later legislation required the report to be made solely to the President and the NAIC. The creation of NARAB was part of financial regulatory reform legislation in the 105th and 106th Congresses, ultimately becoming law as part of GLBA in the 106th Congress. The GLBA law proposed the creation of NARAB, a licensing body for insurance producers to operate across state lines without individual state licenses. NARAB would be overseen by the NAIC and its board appointed by the NAIC. States had the option to avoid NARAB if they established uniform or reciprocal licensing systems within three years. The NAIC quickly responded to the GLBA by creating a model law for insurance producer licensing reciprocity. Enough states adopted this law, meeting the GLBA standards and preventing the creation of NARAB. The first legislation for NARAB was introduced in the 102nd Congress, but it was not created due to the states' actions. The original version of NARAB was reintroduced in the 103rd Congress but was not acted on further. It would have created a federal commission for solvency oversight of insurers, with a narrower preemption of state law. Members would have been state-licensed insurance producers operating through a central clearinghouse and uniform producer application. The board of directors would have been elected by the membership, and oversight authority would have been held by the Federal Solvency Commission."
