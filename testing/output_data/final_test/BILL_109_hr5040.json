    "content": "The \"Death Penalty Reform Act of 2006\" is cited as the short title. It includes amendments to Title 28 of the United States Code and Section 3592 of Title 18. Section 3592 of title 18, United States Code is amended to include additional offenses such as conspiracy against rights, interference with religious exercise, tampering with a witness, and retaliating against a witness. The amendment to section 3592 of title 18, United States Code includes adding new offenses like obstruction of justice in cases where the defendant causes the death of another person to hinder an investigation or prosecution. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SECTION 3593 OF TITLE 18. Amendment to section 3593 of title 18, United States Code, requires the government to file a notice of intent to seek the death penalty before accepting a guilty plea. The court must grant a continuance if needed for the defense's preparation. The amendment to section 3593 of title 18, United States Code requires the government to provide notice of any factors related to the defendant's state of mind or intent. Additionally, the court is prohibited from dismissing alternate jurors during the guilt phase without good cause or if the sentencing hearing will be heard by the court alone. Alternate jurors must be retained for the sentencing trial until its completion, even if a sitting juror becomes unable to continue for any reason. The court may discharge a juror for good cause and replace them with an alternate juror, who will follow the same rules. If deliberations have started, the new jury must restart deliberations. The panel remains unchanged except for the substitution of the alternate juror. In subsection (c), notice must be provided for factors related to the defendant's state of mind or intent. The amendments include allowing the government to cross-examine the defendant on statements to the sentencing jury and allowing the defendant to introduce information on mental retardation if raised. The burden of proving mental retardation lies with the defendant. The defendant must prove mental retardation by preponderance of information. The jury or court will determine mental retardation only if an aggravating factor is found to exist. In cases where section 3592 exists, the jury or court must determine if the defendant is mentally retarded before considering any mitigating factors. If mental retardation is found, the defendant will be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release or a lesser sentence allowed by law. In assessing a death sentence, the decision must be based on the offense facts and aggravating and mitigating factors. The defendant must sign and file notice if the government seeks a death sentence, as required by subsection (a). The defendant must provide notice of mitigating factors, including mental retardation, before trial. The government has the right to an independent mental health examination if mental impairment is claimed as a mitigating factor. The court may order a psychiatric or psychological examination by a licensed professional for up to 30 days to evaluate the defendant. The facility director can request a 15-day extension if needed for observation and evaluation. The court may grant a continuance for adequate preparation time for the government after a defendant files a notice. A defendant is considered mentally retarded if they have had an IQ of 70 or lower since before age 18, leading to diminished mental functioning. SEC. 5. Amendments to Section 3594 of Title 18 involve changing references to specific sentences and limitations. SEC. 6. Amendments related to Sections 3595, 3596, and 3597 of Title 18 are also addressed. Amendments to Section 3596 of title 18, United States Code, involve implementing death sentences according to regulations by the Attorney General and allowing the government to seek rehearing for mental incapacity findings. Section 3595 is amended by changing references from 3593(d) to 3593(e). Section 3597 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to ensure confidentiality of individuals involved in the implementation of death sentences, including employees of various government departments and contractors. Section 3597 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to ensure confidentiality of individuals involved in the implementation of death sentences. The participation or witnessing of an execution under contract by a victim or survivor shall not be publicly disclosed without consent. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections in chapter 228 of title 18. SEC. 7. Amendment relating to section 3005 of title 18. Amendment to section 3005 of title 18 requires assigning a second counsel for defendants in capital cases where the death penalty is sought. Counsel must be knowledgeable in capital case law and have access to the accused. The court allows voir dire of the venire on death penalty views and strikes for cause. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections in title 18. \"Procedural modifications for capital cases include counsel and voir dire.\" Modification of Mitigating and Aggravating Factors in Capital Cases, as well as Juries of Less Than 12 Members, are amended in title 18, United States Code. The court amends Rule 24(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding peremptory challenges, allowing for additional challenges when seven, eight, or nine alternates are impaneled."
