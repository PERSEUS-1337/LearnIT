    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Life Sustaining Treatment Preferences Act of 2008\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that serious illness, death, and dying are difficult subjects to discuss, and poor communication about end-of-life care can cause distress. More education is needed to help individuals make treatment choices and communicate their preferences to healthcare providers. Research shows that orders for life-sustaining treatment effectively convey preferences and guide medical personnel. These orders differ from advance directives. Advance directives, such as living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care, should be completed while individuals have capacity and apply to future medical circumstances. Patients' values and goals in advance directives require interpretation for real-time medical decisions. Orders for life-sustaining treatment complement advance directives by focusing on current medical circumstances. States like California, Colorado, Georgia, and others have programs for orders for life-sustaining treatment to ensure medical preferences are followed across different care settings. Programs for orders for life-sustaining treatment are being implemented in various states such as Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These programs offer valuable services through education, training on advance care planning, collaboration with healthcare facilities, and monitoring program success.
