The Taxpayer Empowerment and Advocacy Act of 2009 adjusts discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014 based on the Consumer Price Index over the previous 12 months prior to specific dates. The Taxpayer Empowerment and Advocacy Act of 2009 adjusts discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014 based on the Consumer Price Index changes.

The Taxpayer Empowerment and Advocacy Act of 2009 adjusts discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014 based on the Consumer Price Index changes. Amendments include accrual accounting for accrued Federal retirement and health benefits. Additionally, amendments are made to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 regarding the reduction in mandatory budget authority resulting from legislation charging Federal agencies for accrued costs. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to enforce pay-as-you-go rules. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to enforce pay-as-you-go rules, ensuring that any legislation increasing the deficit triggers an offsetting sequestration within 15 days of Congress adjourning. The Office of Management and Budget calculates deficit changes caused by direct spending legislation enacted before October 1, 2015. The curr_chunk discusses the estimated savings in direct spending programs resulting from prior year's sequestration, any deficit changes in the current year due to direct spending legislation, and calculations required for fiscal year 2010. The OMB assumes an automatic deficit increase of $58,160,000,000. Sequestered amounts come from non-exempt direct spending accounts in a specific order: first, reductions in automatic spending increases; second, additional reductions in specific accounts; third, further reductions if needed. For non-exempt direct spending accounts, reductions are required to meet the necessary spending cuts. Outlay reductions resulting from sequestration in one fiscal year can be credited for the following fiscal year. Accounts are assumed to be at the baseline level for fiscal years 2011 and adjusted for any sequester in fiscal year 2010. CBO estimates are provided as soon as possible after Congress. As soon as Congress completes action on direct spending, CBO provides estimates to OMB. OMB must transmit a report to Congress within 7 days of enactment, including CBO and OMB estimates with explanations for any differences found. When there is a significant difference between OMB and CBO estimates, OMB must consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate. This consultation should include written communication allowing the committees to comment before the report is issued. The estimates should cover changes in outlays for the current year, the budget year, and each outyear, excluding certain amounts related to deposit insurance guarantees. The OMB and CBO will determine common scorekeeping guidelines and prepare estimates for direct spending legislation. Emergency provisions designated by the President and Congress will be treated as emergency requirements in budget reports. Section 4 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to change the expiration date from \"2002\" to \"2015\" for certain provisions. SEC. 5 amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 regarding emergency spending legislation and the baseline. Emergency appropriations and legislation are specified not to be extended in the baseline. SEC. 6 addresses OMB emergency criteria. The term 'emergency' is defined as a situation requiring new budget authority for the prevention of loss of life or property, or a threat to national security, that is unanticipated, sudden, and urgent. The term 'emergency' is defined as a compelling need requiring immediate action, unforeseen, and temporary in nature. This definition is in line with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. SEC. 7 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 amends Title III to include a new section regarding the designation of legislative provisions as emergencies. In designating legislation as an emergency requirement, the committee report must analyze if it meets the definition of an 'emergency' as outlined in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Bills with emergency designations under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 must also meet this definition to be considered in the Senate or House of Representatives. The Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 outlines procedures for waiver and appeal in the Senate, requiring a three-fifths vote to suspend certain sections. In the House of Representatives, it is not allowed to consider a rule that waives the application of a specific subsection. The Chair in the House must put the question of consideration for a point of order, which is debatable for 10 minutes.

In the House of Representatives, the Chair must put the question of consideration for a point of order, which is debatable for 10 minutes. The disposition of the question of consideration under this section with respect to a bill or joint resolution also determines the question of consideration under this subsection with respect to an amendment made in order as original text. The Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 outlines procedures for waiver and appeal in the Senate and House of Representatives. Sec. 316 addresses the designation of legislative provisions as emergencies."
