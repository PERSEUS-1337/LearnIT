    "content": "The \"Public Housing Rent Reform Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for public housing ceiling rents. The \"Public Housing Rent Reform Act\" includes amendments to the United States Housing Act of 1937 regarding public housing rents. The amendments specify criteria for determining rent amounts based on debt service, operating expenses, and rental paid by families. The \"Public Housing Rent Reform Act\" amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to establish criteria for determining rent amounts in public housing. This includes setting ceiling rents based on various factors such as automatic annual adjustments and fair market rent for comparable units. The Secretary may annually review agency ceiling rents to ensure they are not deliberately understated, with corrective actions imposed if necessary, including payment of understated amounts to the Secretary. The Secretary may require determination of ceiling rents by a third party. A waiver is not needed for public housing agencies to adopt ceiling rents. The Secretary's approval is limited to ensuring requirements are met. Public housing agencies must use the same method for determining ceiling rents for all projects unless approved by the Secretary. For single-family scattered site housing or projects with 10 or fewer units, a different method may be used. The Secretary may require the use of a specific method for certain units. After initial approval by the Secretary, a public housing agency cannot change the method of calculating ceiling rents without further approval. Different ceiling rents can be set for each project owned by the agency, subject to limitations. The agency must annually review and adjust the ceiling rents for each project, with approval from the Secretary if deemed necessary. Ceiling rents for public housing projects must be approved by the Secretary and can only be changed with further approval. A maximum of 25 percent of dwelling units in a project can have rents limited by ceiling rents. If more than 25 percent of units are eligible for ceiling rents, the agency must adjust the rents to comply with the limit during the next annual review. Ceiling rents in public housing projects are limited and can only be changed with approval. A family's rent can be limited by ceiling rents for a maximum of 3 years, with a new 3-year period starting if the rent falls below the ceiling rent for more than 12 consecutive months due to income reduction or rent increase. Ceiling rents in public housing projects are limited and can only be changed with approval. A family's rent can be limited by ceiling rents for a maximum of 3 years, with reductions in rent gradually decreasing over subsequent years until no reduction is applied after the 7th year. Ceiling rents in public housing projects are limited and can only be changed with approval. The maximum rent that can be charged to a family is determined by a public housing agency and approved by the Secretary. This limit applies to all families and must be reviewed annually. The restriction does not apply to housing designated for elderly persons. Buildings with the same project number assigned by the Secretary are subject to rent restrictions. SEC. 3. EARNED INCOME EXCLUSIONS. Section 3(b)(5) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to include documentation of health insurance payments made by families for members not receiving government healthcare assistance. Additionally, a new subparagraph is added regarding earned income exclusions for elderly and nonelderly families. In the case of 2-parent families with children, an additional 10 percent of the earned income can be excluded. For families residing in public housing, 100 percent of any earned income of a formerly dependent child who is a family member can be excluded. The redetermination of rent and family composition for a family occurs at different stages as the child reaches certain ages: 85% of earned income after age 18, 85% after age 21, and 65% after age 22. The redetermination of rent and family composition for a family occurs at different stages as the child reaches certain ages: 85% of earned income after age 18, 85% after age 21, 65% after age 22, and 40% after age 23. The amendments made by this Act will take effect 120 days after enactment. The Secretary will issue final regulations to implement the amendments, which must be in place by the effective date. Regulations will be issued after public comment in accordance with specific procedures."
