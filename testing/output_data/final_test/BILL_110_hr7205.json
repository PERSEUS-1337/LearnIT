The \"Judgment Evading Foreign States Accountability Act of 2008\" aims to address the issue of foreign states and instrumentalities doing business in the United States, then refusing to comply with U.S. court judgments, causing significant financial harm to U.S. taxpayers and undermining the credibility of U.S. courts. Argentina is highlighted as a recent example of such behavior, having borrowed billions of dollars in the U.S. capital markets and agreeing to U.S. court jurisdiction, but failing to satisfy judgments related to these transactions. Argentina defaulted on its debt in 2001, leading to over $2 billion in judgments against it in U.S. courts. Despite a dramatic economic recovery, Argentina has refused to pay these judgments and instead used its foreign exchange reserves to pay other creditors preferentially. This behavior has sparked interest from other foreign states in following Argentina's lead. The Republic of Ecuador has threatened to default on its sovereign debt, citing Argentina's default as a precedent. This behavior can corrupt corporate behavior and harm United States taxpayers with little recourse due to protective laws for foreign states. The United States Government must take action to combat the problem of judgment evading foreign states and their domestic corporations. One effective measure is to prevent these entities from raising capital in the US until they improve their behavior. The United States Government aims to combat judgment evading foreign states and their domestic corporations by preventing them from raising capital in the US until they satisfy all outstanding US court judgments. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"judgment evading foreign state\" as a foreign state with judgments exceeding $1,000,000 that remain unpaid for over 6 months, and \"domestic corporation of a judgment evading foreign state\" as a corporation organized under the laws of such a foreign state. The term \"final judgment\" refers to any judgment from a US district court or state court that cannot be appealed further. The term \"foreign state\" is defined as per 1603(a) of title 28, US Code. The term \"international organization\" refers to an entity designated by the President for certain privileges. The term \"State\" includes all U.S. States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, with privileges under the International Organizations Immunities Act. SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF POLICY. The policy of the United States is to advocate for the compensation of its citizens and others with court judgments, protect taxpayers' economic interests by restricting access to capital markets of judgment evading foreign states, and uphold the authority of U.S. courts by preventing foreign states from ignoring court judgments. To enforce mandatory penalties to prevent judgment evading foreign states from misconduct. SEC. 6. BAR ON ACCESS TO UNITED STATES CAPITAL MARKETS. The Securities and Exchange Commission will prevent judgment evading foreign states from accessing US capital markets to satisfy outstanding judgments. If a foreign state remains in default for over 2 years, domestic corporations from that state will also be denied access. SEC. 7. REQUESTS FOR AID OR ASSISTANCE FROM JUDGMENT EVADING FOREIGN STATES. Whenever a proposal is made to provide aid, loans, or assistance to a judgment evading foreign state, the relevant US department or agency must prominently display a specific legend. For multilateral assistance proposals to international organizations, the Secretary of State must promptly notify Congress with the same legend. The legend displayed for aid, loans, or assistance to a judgment evading foreign state is \"REQUEST FOR GRANT-IN-AID OR LOAN BY A JUDGMENT EVADING FOREIGN STATE\". SEC. 8. REPORTS; RECOMMENDATIONS OF ADDITIONAL MEASURES. The Secretary of the Treasury must provide an annual report to Congress identifying judgment evading foreign states, detailing the basis of determination, quantifying the impact on the US economy and taxpayers, and describing measures taken by relevant departments and agencies. The Secretary of the Treasury will certify to Congress when a foreign state no longer qualifies as a judgment evading foreign state, at which point the requirements of the Act will no longer apply. Other departments must reference the Treasury's findings in reports on the economic risk of such states. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide recommendations to Congress on additional measures to carry out the purposes of the Act, based on findings from the most recent annual report regarding unsatisfied final judgments against judgment evading foreign states."
