    "content": "Marijuana, a psychoactive drug derived from the cannabis sativa plant, is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States. Its popularity as a recreational drug dates back to the early 20th century. Despite variations in THC content, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law. The percentage of the population using marijuana has been increasing, with 8.3% reported in 2015. The rate of past-month marijuana use among youth (aged 12-17) has remained relatively unchanged at 7.0% from 2010 to 2015. Marijuana availability has increased, with 34% of law enforcement agencies reporting an increase in availability. The report discusses federal marijuana policy, state trends in decriminalization and legalization, and implications for law enforcement. Congress may face policy questions regarding marijuana legalization in the District of Columbia. Marijuana's classification as a Schedule I drug under the CSA raises questions for Congress, including legalization in DC, financial services for marijuana businesses, its medical use, oversight of law enforcement, and its status as a controlled substance. Federal drug policies on marijuana continue to spark debates among policymakers, law enforcement, scholars, and the public. The move in 1970 to criminalize marijuana sparked significant discussions on its place in American society. Public attitudes have shifted, with 60% of adults now supporting legalization, a significant increase from 12% in 1969. Many believe the federal government should not enforce marijuana prohibition in states where it is legal. Despite being classified as a Schedule I drug, many states have laws allowing for medicinal use. The FDA has not approved marijuana or any drug containing marijuana for medicinal use, but has approved two drugs containing synthetic THC. Drugs with plant-derived THC and/or CBD are in the approval process. The efficacy of marijuana for medical issues is unclear, with some reporting benefits while others find reports inconsistent. The FDA and the National Academies have struggled to determine the medicinal value of marijuana due to regulatory restrictions on research quality and quantity. Both entities found that the current evidence base falls short of demonstrating effective medical use. The National Academies state that conclusive evidence on the health effects of cannabis remains elusive. Research on controlled substances must comply with federal laws, including obtaining registration from the DEA. Some argue that federal regulations hinder marijuana research for FDA approval, but efforts have been made to simplify the process. The federal government has made efforts to facilitate marijuana research by eliminating steps in obtaining research-grade marijuana, allowing researchers to modify protocols for CBD trials, and increasing approved sources of research-grade marijuana. These changes aim to address concerns about the quality and quantity of marijuana provided to researchers. The federal government has made efforts to facilitate marijuana research by eliminating steps in obtaining research-grade marijuana, allowing researchers to modify protocols for CBD trials, and increasing approved sources of research-grade marijuana. States have established laws and policies regarding marijuana's medical and recreational use, sparking questions about federal drug enforcement activities and national drug policies. Despite mounting pressure, marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law for nearly 50 years. Various entities have petitioned the DEA to reevaluate marijuana's classification, leading to a five-year evaluation process in 2016. The DEA rejected petitions to reschedule marijuana under the CSA, citing high potential for abuse, lack of accepted medical use, and safety concerns. Congress and the Administration have the power to change marijuana's Schedule I status. States have deviated from an across-the-board prohibition of marijuana, with nearly 90% allowing for medical use and some allowing for recreational use. State laws now permit manufacturing, sale, distribution, and possession of marijuana, contrary to the CSA. Evolving state positions include decriminalization, medical use exceptions, and legalization for recreational use. See Figure 2 for state marijuana policies. Decriminalization and legalization initiatives in states reflect growing public support for marijuana. Before the CSA in 1970, only 12% supported legalization, but in 2016, 60% of surveyed U.S. adults expressed support. Decriminalization removes criminal penalties but retains civil penalties. Possession of small amounts is considered a civil offense, not criminal prosecution. States are not legalizing marijuana by decriminalizing its possession. Decriminalization initiatives in states do not legalize marijuana possession but remove criminal penalties for small amounts. Possessing marijuana remains a violation of both federal and state law, with differing penalties for each. In Nebraska, possession of small amounts of marijuana can result in a civil penalty of up to $300 for the first offense. Some states have decriminalized marijuana possession, but in New York, it is still considered a crime under certain circumstances. In 2015, over 21,000 individuals in New York were arrested for possession of marijuana in the fifth degree. In November 2014, NYC Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bratton announced a change in marijuana enforcement policy, allowing for summons instead of arrests for possession of 25 grams or less. Despite this, marijuana possession arrests in NYC increased in 2016. Some cities like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have decriminalized possession, contrary to state laws. In 2016, Harrisburg decriminalized possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana with a $75 fine. California was the first state to allow medicinal marijuana in 1996. Over half of the states, DC, Puerto Rico, and Guam permit medicinal marijuana. Some states allow limited access medical marijuana with low THC or CBD oil. The CSA does not differentiate between medical and recreational marijuana use. Federal law conflicts with states allowing medical marijuana use. In 2012, Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana use, allowing for regulation and taxation of small amounts. Federal law enforcement focuses on growers and dispensers rather than individual users of medical marijuana. Marijuana legalization measures remove state-imposed penalties for specified activities involving marijuana. In 2012, Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana use, allowing for regulation and taxation of small amounts. In November 2014, Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia also voted to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Later, in November 2016, Massachusetts, California, Maine, and Nevada passed recreational legalization initiatives. These initiatives legalized possession of specific quantities of marijuana for individuals aged 21 and over, with state-administered regulatory schemes for sales. Variations exist among states, such as allowing individuals to grow their own marijuana plants. Many actions involving marijuana remain crimes despite legalization. In some states like Washington and Colorado, certain actions involving marijuana are still considered crimes, such as driving under the influence or consuming it openly in public. However, there are city-level initiatives, like in Denver, that allow designated areas for public marijuana consumption. Federal law enforcement focuses on criminal networks rather than individual drug users, with efforts consistent with this approach. The federal government's marijuana enforcement efforts target traffickers and distributors, not low-level users. President Obama prioritized focusing on more serious drug offenses over recreational users in states where marijuana is legal. The Trump Administration may increase enforcement against recreational marijuana, distinguishing between medical and recreational use. The Department of Justice maintains that marijuana activities are federal crimes despite state legalization for medical purposes. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has clarified federal marijuana policy through memos, reaffirming that marijuana activities are federal crimes regardless of state laws. The focus remains on combating major drug traffickers, with resources directed towards disrupting illegal drug networks. The DOJ clarified federal marijuana policy, stating that enforcing the Controlled Substances Act is a core priority, even in states with legalized medical marijuana. Deputy Attorney General Cole warned against assisting medical marijuana dispensaries, emphasizing that activities violating the CSA are federal crimes regardless of state laws. The DOJ emphasized that activities violating the Controlled Substances Act are federal crimes, regardless of state laws. Deputy Attorney General Cole warned against assisting medical marijuana dispensaries, highlighting potential violations of federal money laundering statutes and other financial laws. This has led to difficulties for dispensaries in accessing banking services. In an August 2013 memorandum, DOJ outlined enforcement priorities focusing on the most significant threats related to marijuana distribution. The DOJ outlined eight enforcement priorities for marijuana, including preventing distribution to minors, stopping revenue from criminal enterprises, and preventing drugged driving. Deputy Attorney General Cole further emphasized these priorities in a February 2014 memorandum. In February 2014, Deputy Attorney General Cole reinforced enforcement priorities for marijuana-related financial crimes, directing U.S. Attorneys to apply the eight priorities outlined in a previous guidance. In October 2014, a DOJ memo reiterated these priorities for marijuana efforts in Indian country, clarifying that federal law can still be enforced in tribal lands. The Cole Memorandum outlines priorities for marijuana enforcement in Indian Country, but does not specifically address distribution and regulation. Some tribes have proceeded with plans to grow and sell marijuana on tribal lands, leading to DEA enforcement actions. The tolerance of legal marijuana on tribal land remains uncertain. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the DOJ historically did not prosecute individuals for possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal use on private property, leaving enforcement to state and local authorities. GAO recommended that the DOJ monitor the impact of state marijuana legalization on DOJ enforcement priorities, using tools like communication with states like Colorado and Washington. The DOJ has not been documenting its monitoring process for the effects of state marijuana legalization on federal enforcement priorities. Congress has included provisions in appropriations acts to prevent DOJ from interfering with states' medical marijuana laws. The current provision is in effect until April 28, 2017, restricting DOJ from taking legal action against states or initiating criminal prosecutions of state officials. The appropriations provision restricts DOJ from taking legal action against states or initiating criminal prosecutions of state officials related to state medical marijuana laws. Federal courts have interpreted the provision to protect individuals complying with state laws from federal prosecution for marijuana offenses. However, financial institutions could still face criminal and administrative sanctions for providing financial services related to marijuana due to its federal classification as a Schedule I controlled substance. Financial institutions face legal risks for providing financial services to state-authorized marijuana businesses due to federal laws classifying marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance. Owners could be subject to severe criminal and administrative sanctions, including confiscation of property and proceeds from marijuana sales. Many financial institutions are hesitant to work with these businesses, fearing federal prosecution and adverse consequences under federal law. Financial institutions face legal risks when providing financial services to state-authorized marijuana businesses. If a bank acquires proceeds from the sale of marijuana knowing it violates federal law, the funds could be confiscated by federal authorities. This includes principal and interest payments earned on loans to such businesses. In addition to asset forfeiture, there is a risk of violating federal anti-money laundering laws. Federal anti-money laundering laws criminalize handling proceeds derived from unlawful activities, including marijuana sales. Violators may face fines, imprisonment, and property forfeiture. For example, a bank employee could receive a 20-year prison sentence for engaging in financial transactions with marijuana-related proceeds. Bank officers and employees can face severe penalties for handling cash derived from marijuana sales, including a 10-year prison term under Section 1957. Financial institutions are required to report suspicious activity related to illegal transactions, such as the sale of marijuana, to the Treasury Department. Additionally, institutions must have anti-money laundering programs in place to prevent illicit financial activities. Financial institutions must ensure employees have sufficient knowledge to identify when to file SARs and CTRs for transactions over $10,000. Non-compliance can lead to fines, imprisonment, and administrative enforcement actions for violating anti-money laundering laws. Banking regulators may take action against institutions and affiliated parties involved in unlawful activities, such as marijuana-related transactions. Banking regulators have legal authority to take action against institutions and individuals engaging in unlawful marijuana-related activities, including issuing cease and desist orders, imposing penalties, revoking deposit insurance, and liquidating institutions. FinCEN issued guidance on marijuana-related financial crimes in response to state legalization efforts. The FinCEN guidance issued on February 14, 2014, provides a roadmap for financial institutions to comply with reporting requirements for transactions involving state-authorized marijuana businesses. Financial institutions must file a SAR on activity involving a marijuana-related business, even if duly licensed under state law, due to federal prohibition on marijuana distribution and sale. FinCEN advises filing one of three types of special SARs when providing services to a marijuana business. The FinCEN guidance issued on February 14, 2014, outlines reporting requirements for financial institutions dealing with state-authorized marijuana businesses. Three types of special SARs are recommended: marijuana limited SAR, marijuana priority SAR, and marijuana termination SAR. These SARs are to be filed based on the bank's assessment of the customer's activities and their alignment with DOJ's investigation and prosecution priorities. Additionally, FinCEN provides examples of \"red flags\" to help determine when a marijuana priority SAR is necessary. The FinCEN guidance on reporting requirements for financial institutions dealing with state-authorized marijuana businesses includes recommendations for filing marijuana priority SARs. While public support for marijuana legalization is high, concerns exist regarding potential negative implications such as increased marijuana use among youth, traffic incidents involving impaired drivers, interstate trafficking, and international treaty compliance. However, there are also positive outcomes anticipated, such as new tax revenue for states and a potential decrease in marijuana-related issues. The report discusses the potential implications of marijuana legalization, including new tax revenue for states and a decrease in marijuana-related arrests. Data on the effects of legalization should be interpreted cautiously due to limited information. Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the US, with an increasing number of users from 2010 to 2015. The rate of past-month marijuana use among youth has remained fairly unchanged from 2010 to 2015. In states that legalized recreational marijuana, both youth and adult current users have changed in various ways over the same period. Colorado and Washington have higher percentages of marijuana use compared to national estimates, both before and after legalization. Rates of drug use may be influenced by many factors. Rates of drug use are higher than those reported in 2010/2011 and may be influenced by factors such as availability, family, peers, school, economic status, and community variables. State government officials in states that have legalized marijuana are monitoring changes in drug use patterns and health effects. Recent marijuana use impairs driving ability, with low doses of THC moderately impairing cognitive and psychomotor tasks associated with driving. In Colorado, despite limited traffic data, the Department of Public Safety reports a slight decrease in DUI summons involving marijuana or marijuana-in-combination from 2014 to 2015. However, the prevalence of marijuana as an impairing substance in DUI cases increased during the same period. The Denver Police Department also saw an increase in citations related to marijuana use while driving between 2013 and 2015. In Denver, citations for marijuana or marijuana-in-combination in DUIs accounted for about 3% of all cases. Positive cannabinoid screens for drivers increased from 57% in 2012 to 65% in 2014, with a rise in THC detection from 52% to 67%. Fatalities involving THC-positive drivers rose from 55 in 2013 to 79 in 2014. Detection of THC in blood does not indicate impairment, but delta-9 THC may suggest impairment. Washington State researchers found no trend in drivers testing positive for marijuana post-legalization. The percentage of drivers testing positive for marijuana in traffic fatalities showed no trend, with a decrease in \"marijuana incidents\" on highways from 2,462 in 2012 to 625 in 2014. This drop may be linked to the legalization of marijuana possession after 2012, leading to fewer law enforcement investigations for marijuana-related traffic stops. In Washington State and Colorado, marijuana arrests decreased after the legalization of recreational marijuana. Possession was the most common criminal activity, with a significant decrease in arrests from 2012 to 2014. However, youth marijuana arrests increased slightly in Colorado during the same period. Criminal organizations historically supplied marijuana to the US, with some from Canada and the Caribbean. Domestic legalization impact on Mexican-produced marijuana entering the US is unclear due to lack of data. Marijuana cultivation in Mexico has decreased. The decrease in Mexican marijuana cultivation has led to a shift towards producing more profitable drugs like heroin and methamphetamine. Despite a decline in marijuana seizures along the Southwest border, the DEA predicts that Mexico-produced marijuana will still be trafficked into the US in bulk quantities and may increase in quality to compete with domestically-produced marijuana. Since the legalization of marijuana in some states in 2012, there has been a sharp decline in the number of individuals prosecuted and sentenced for marijuana-related offenses. In 2012, there has been a decrease in federal marijuana trafficking prosecutions and sentences. Factors contributing to this decline include federal enforcement efforts, traffickers concealing contraband, and the amount of illegal marijuana entering the US. Some states allege increased trafficking from neighboring states with legalized marijuana. For example, Colorado's legalization of recreational use has led to more trafficking in surrounding states, with 394 instances of interdiction in 2015. In 2015, there were 394 instances of interdiction of Colorado marijuana destined for 36 other states. Experts estimate these seizures represent about 10% or less of the total amount moved across the border undetected. Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado in 2014, claiming adverse impacts on their law enforcement and criminal justice systems due to Colorado's marijuana laws. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case challenging Colorado's marijuana law in 2016. Changes in the domestic black market for marijuana have been reported as more states legalize it for medical and recreational purposes. The market in Denver, CO, has become smaller and less violent since marijuana legalization. Buyers are now purchasing more from \"mom-and-pop operations\" rather than larger cartels. Most domestically produced marijuana is cultivated in California, by both U.S. persons and foreign criminal networks like Mexican traffickers. Marijuana concentrates like hashish and hash oil are a growing concern for federal law enforcement due to their high potency levels. State marijuana legalization initiatives have had various effects, according to the DEA. The DEA reports an increase in seizures of marijuana concentrates and THC extraction labs in the US due to state legalization initiatives. Mexican drug traffickers are improving their product to meet the demand for high-quality marijuana in both the US and Mexico. Anecdotal reports suggest smuggling of high-quality marijuana from the US to Mexico. In Colorado, state law allows cultivation of up to 99 marijuana plants for patients and caregivers and up to 6 plants for recreational use. Governor Hickenlooper seeks to establish new limits on residential plants to combat illegal sales. Mexican drug trafficking organizations control a significant portion of wholesale marijuana distribution in the US. Mexican criminal networks control a large portion of wholesale marijuana distribution in the US, forming relationships with US gangs for retail distribution. These gangs, including street, prison, and outlaw motorcycle gangs, have increased involvement in wholesale drug trafficking, a primary source of revenue for them. Estimates of illicit drug sales in the United States, including marijuana, have high uncertainty. The sale of illicit drugs generates billions in wholesale drug proceeds annually for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations. The impact of marijuana legalization on these organizations is unknown due to lack of clear data on proceeds, proportion of marijuana sales, and control by criminal organizations. Experts have debated the impact of marijuana legalization on proceeds generated along the supply chain, including production, transportation, and distribution. The potential fiscal impact on Mexican drug trafficking organizations could result in a significant loss of drug export income. Some estimates suggest that professional farmers could dominate the marijuana market if federal legalization occurs, potentially impacting small-scale growers. Large drug trafficking organizations earn a significant portion of their income from exporting marijuana to the U.S., which could be at risk if recreational marijuana production is legalized. The Tax Foundation estimates the annual U.S. marijuana market at $45 billion, which is 0.28% of GDP. Legalization could shift revenue from traffickers to authorized sellers and governments through taxes. Concerns have been raised about U.S. compliance with U.N. drug treaties regarding recreational marijuana laws. The U.N. drug treaties, including the Single Convention, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic, require parties to limit cannabis use to medical and scientific purposes. The International Narcotics Control Board and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs monitor compliance with these treaties. The U.N. drug treaties require parties to limit cannabis use to medical and scientific purposes. The International Narcotics Control Board and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs monitor compliance with these treaties, but have limited ability to enforce it. The impact of state laws legalizing recreational marijuana on U.S. compliance with these treaties is uncertain. The government's response to state laws legalizing recreational marijuana may not align with international obligations. There are differing opinions on whether the U.S. is violating the Single Convention by legalizing marijuana for non-medical purposes. Some officials advocate for a flexible interpretation of U.N. Drug Control Conventions, allowing countries to have varying drug policies. Some experts believe the U.S. is not violating drug control conventions with state-level marijuana laws, while others argue otherwise. There are calls for treaty reforms to accommodate state laws, but President Obama disagreed in 2014. The Trump Administration's stance is unknown. States legalizing marijuana for recreational use impose taxes and licensing fees. Tax rates on cultivation and retail sales of medical marijuana vary by state, with some states taxing at the cultivator level and others at the retail level. In Colorado, medical marijuana sales are exempt from a special excise tax but subject to a general state sales tax, while in Washington, they are subject to a 37% excise tax but exempt from the state's general sales tax. Some states allocate marijuana-related revenue for specific purposes like education or criminal justice programs. Some states allocate marijuana-related revenue for specific purposes like education, criminal justice programs, or public health and substance abuse programs. Government officials and voters respond to changes in revenue collections and budget priorities. Congress may address issues such as financial services for marijuana businesses, federal tax issues, oversight of law enforcement, state implementation of medical marijuana laws, and marijuana's designation as a Schedule I drug. Financial institutions remain reluctant to enter relationships with state-authorized marijuana businesses. Some states allocate marijuana-related revenue for specific purposes like education, criminal justice programs, or public health. Financial institutions are hesitant to engage with state-authorized marijuana businesses, even if they are able to open accounts or secure financial services. Legislative proposals have been introduced to facilitate financial relationships with these businesses and alleviate reporting burdens. These proposals aim to prevent banking regulators from discouraging depository institutions from providing services to marijuana-related legitimate businesses. Financial institutions are cautious about providing services to marijuana-related businesses due to federal regulations. Legislative proposals aim to ease these concerns by reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II substance for medical use. This could help alleviate banking issues with marijuana businesses. Reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II substance for medical use may ease bank concerns with providing financial services to medical marijuana businesses. However, financial institutions still face legal risks, especially if they work with businesses in states with weak regulations. Reclassification would have little impact on financial services for recreational marijuana businesses operating in violation of federal law. Marijuana producers and retailers cannot deduct business expenses on federal tax filings due to IRC Section 280E. The IRS enforces Section 280E, disallowing deductions for marijuana businesses, creating a tax burden equivalent to the value of these deductions. However, costs of cultivating or acquiring marijuana can be deducted as a \"cost of goods sold.\" This impacts businesses like Canna Care in Sacramento. The IRS disallowed $2.6 million in deductions for employee salaries, rent, and other costs for the Sacramento-based Canna Care marijuana dispensary, resulting in $875,000 in additional taxes owed. The discrepancies in tax treatments for marijuana businesses may lead to underground economic activity. Marijuana businesses are unable to deduct their expenses, leading to implicit taxes of up to 39.6% for sole proprietors or partnerships, and 35% for C corporations, in addition to state and local taxes. The current administration of federal tax laws creates an economic advantage for illicit marijuana sellers by not subjecting them to direct taxation. Various past marijuana-related tax proposals have included exemptions for businesses complying with state laws, removal of marijuana from controlled substances lists, and the imposition of federal excise taxes on domestic recreational marijuana sales. Congress may choose to address these discrepancies in tax treatments for marijuana businesses. Congress may examine the impact of state marijuana legalization on federal law enforcement missions, particularly the DEA's. They may review how drug-related investigations are influenced by varying state marijuana policies and question the consistency of enforcement priorities across states. Policymakers may debate incentivizing task forces and fusion centers to combat drug-related crimes effectively. Policymakers evaluating funding for drug task forces should consider the impact of state marijuana policies on task force goals and collaboration. Inconsistent state policies, such as decriminalization or legalization of marijuana, may hinder effective coordination among task force partners. Internal conflicts within task forces could also impede investigations. The Arizona Court of Appeals ruled that patients compliant with the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act are entitled to have their seized marijuana returned. In Colorado, some law enforcement officers avoid seizing marijuana to avoid having to return it, which is a violation of federal law. The DOJ issued federal enforcement priorities for states with legal marijuana, monitoring state legalization effects and prosecuting cases that threaten federal priorities. The DOJ issued federal enforcement priorities for states with legal marijuana, monitoring state legalization effects, and consulting with state officials. However, as of December 2015, the DOJ has not documented efforts to ensure these priorities are being emphasized. It is unclear how metrics will be used to determine federal intervention in states that have legalized marijuana. Congress may oversee DOJ's enforcement priorities and metrics for tracking illicit activity in states. The Trump Administration indicated potential increased enforcement against recreational marijuana in a February 2017 statement. State medical marijuana laws have raised questions for federal policymakers about enforcing federal law in compliance with state law. Previous Congresses have introduced legislation to amend the CSA regarding marijuana enforcement. The Trump Administration has shown some acceptance of medical marijuana, acknowledging its benefits for patients with terminal illnesses. Federal policymakers are particularly interested in how federal health care providers, like the Department of Veterans Affairs, navigate state medical marijuana laws. VA policy allows veterans to participate in state marijuana programs without denying them health care services. The gap between federal and state policies on marijuana is widening each year. Legislation has been introduced to allow VA providers to complete forms for state medical marijuana programs. Congress may need to reevaluate federal marijuana policy as more states legalize marijuana, creating contradictions with federal law. Congress may need to reevaluate federal marijuana policy in response to state-level legalization efforts. Options include upholding current federal policy, enforcing the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in states, or reevaluating marijuana's Schedule I classification. A committee of experts could assess marijuana laws and its medicinal value, potentially leading to legislative action to remove it from the Schedule I list. Congress may need to reevaluate federal marijuana policy in response to state-level legalization efforts. Options include placing marijuana on a different schedule of controlled substances or removing it altogether. If the conflict with states persists, Congress may choose to allow states to continue with recreational marijuana laws or increase enforcement actions. The FDA has approved synthetic THC drugs nabilone and dronabinol for antiemetic and appetite stimulant purposes. GW Pharmaceuticals is conducting trials for plant-derived cannabinoid drugs like Sativex\u00ae for multiple sclerosis treatment. In 2014, FDA granted \"Fast Track\" designation to Sativex for cancer pain relief, but trials in 2015 showed no superiority over placebo. GW Pharmaceuticals seeks approval for Sativex and other cannabinoid products for various conditions. FDA and National Academies evaluations highlight challenges in meeting evidence standards for marijuana-based treatments. The FDA conducted an analysis of marijuana's therapeutic effects based on 11 published studies, including its use for neuropathic pain, HIV-related appetite stimulation, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis spasticity, and asthma. The evaluation also assessed potential risks of marijuana use through an eight-factor analysis requested by the DEA. The National Academies evaluated cannabis and drugs containing synthetic THC for 11 health topics, presenting nearly 100 conclusions. The report highlighted challenges in conducting research with cannabis and cannabinoids. Federal regulations for marijuana research are more stringent for Schedule I substances. Researchers must obtain a separate DEA registration for Schedule I substances, and production quotas are imposed by the DEA. Storage of Schedule I and II substances must meet specific requirements. Researchers conducting research involving Schedule III-V substances must store them in secure safes, steel cabinets, or vaults meeting specific standards. When applying for a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances research, researchers must comply with federal regulations on research protocols. The HHS Secretary delegates the responsibility of determining the applicant's qualifications and the protocol's merits to the FDA. No equivalent process is required for Schedule II-V controlled substances. The Attorney General registers manufacturers of Schedule I or II controlled substances based on public interest and international obligations. The National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi is the sole registered manufacturer of marijuana for research, leading to concerns about the quality and quantity of marijuana available for research purposes. The DEA announced a policy change in August 2016 to expand the number of DEA-registered marijuana manufacturers for research purposes. These new growers must agree to distribute marijuana with DEA approval and supply it only to researchers with scientifically meritorious protocols approved by HHS. This new approach aims to facilitate research by allowing more individuals to obtain a DEA cultivation registration. The DEA announced a policy change in August 2016 to expand the number of DEA-registered marijuana manufacturers for research purposes, allowing individuals to obtain a DEA cultivation registration for commercial endeavors aimed at drug product development. This change could contribute to future debate on rescheduling marijuana. In the mid-20th century, Commissioner Anslinger warned Congress about the dangers of marijuana, leading to the unofficial ban under the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. Subsequent legislation like the Boggs Act in 1951 imposed mandatory prison sentences for drug offenses, further criminalizing drug abuse. In 1951, mandatory prison sentences were established for some drug offenses, and in 1956, penalties for drug offenses were increased. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics merged with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control in 1968, shifting drug control to the Department of Justice. President Nixon declared a war on drugs, leading to the enactment of comprehensive federal drug laws in 1970, including the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 placed marijuana under federal jurisdiction as a Schedule I controlled substance, prohibiting its manufacture, distribution, and possession. The Shafer Commission was established to study marijuana use in the United States, evaluating existing laws and studying its effects. The Shafer Commission studied the effects of marijuana, including its physiological and psychological effects, relationship to aggressive behavior and crime, use of other drugs, and international control. They produced two reports, one discussing the perception of marijuana as a social problem and recommending a social control policy to discourage heavy use. The commission also questioned the application of criminal law for personal marijuana use. The Shafer Commission found the criminalization of personal marijuana use constitutionally suspect and recommended a social control policy instead. They also stated that aggressive behavior cannot be attributed to marijuana use and that its risk potential is low compared to other psychoactive substances. The Shafer Commission recommended against institutionalizing the availability of marijuana due to its low risk potential compared to other drugs. They suggested Congress launch a new commission to reexamine drug use and societal response."
