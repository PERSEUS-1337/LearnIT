    "content": "The United States' WTO obligations on government procurement are outlined in the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (AGP), which applies national treatment and most-favored-nation principles. The AGP, negotiated during the Uruguay Round of GATT, came into effect in the US on January 1, 1996. Unlike other WTO provisions, the AGP is a plurilateral agreement, with parties committed to applying it only to other AGP members. Currently, the AGP is accepted by the US, European Communities, Canada, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, Netherlands (Aruba), Norway, Singapore, and Switzerland. The AGP governs procurement by entities covered by the Agreement, including central and sub-central governmental entities, and other government-related entities designated by member Parties. Each Party must submit an Appendix with Annexes listing covered entities and products/services for AGP purposes. The Appendix is divided into five Annexes: central government entities, sub-central government entities, other entities procuring under the AGP, services, and products. The AGP applies to procurement contracts covered by a Party's commitments, with specific monetary thresholds. The U.S. sets thresholds in biennial notices by the USTR. The AGP also applies to non-listed enterprises in the context of covered procurement. The AGP requires enterprises to award contracts in accordance with specific requirements, including national treatment and non-discrimination. This rule prohibits favoring national suppliers and is crucial due to the increasing privatization of public services. The AGP also includes obligations related to tendering procedures, supplier qualification, offsets, transparency, and dispute resolution under WTO procedures. The AGP establishes rules for awarding contracts, including national treatment and non-discrimination. It also includes obligations related to tendering procedures, supplier qualification, offsets, transparency, and dispute resolution under WTO procedures. The AGP allows changes to its Schedule, subject to consultations with the WTO and negotiations with member states for significant changes. National treatment and most-favored nation obligations apply to goods, services, and suppliers, addressing issues related to the country of origin of goods and foreign ownership of services suppliers. The AGP establishes rules for awarding contracts, including national treatment and non-discrimination. Rules of Origin are defined in Annex 1A of the WTO to determine the country of origin of goods. The AGP does not contain discrimination against locally-established suppliers based on foreign ownership links or foreign supply. The AGP does not have separate rules of origin but prohibits implementing different rules for government procured products. Article IV allows for amendments based on WTO negotiations. Article VII establishes non-discriminatory tendering procedures for competitive bidding on contracts. Article VII of the AGP defines three types of tendering procedures: open, selective, and limited. Article VIII prohibits discrimination among suppliers and requires qualification procedures to be consistent with specific requirements. Article VIII of the AGP outlines requirements for participation in tendering procedures, emphasizing non-discrimination and fair treatment of suppliers. It states that participation conditions must be essential for contract fulfillment, not discriminate against foreign suppliers, consider global business activity, and allow exclusion based on bankruptcy or false declarations while maintaining national treatment and non-discrimination principles. Article X of the AGP ensures fair and non-discriminatory selection of suppliers for covered procurements, promoting international competition. Parties can establish qualification procedures and maintain lists of qualified suppliers. Suppliers meeting qualification procedures must be allowed to submit tenders unless it would make the procurement system inefficient. Limited tendering procedures under Article VII of the AGP are allowed in specific situations to ensure fair competition and prevent discrimination among suppliers. These situations include the absence of tenders under open procedures, collusive tenders, non-conformity with tender requirements, non-compliance with participation conditions, and when no reasonable alternative supplier exists. Limited tendering procedures under Article VII of the AGP are allowed in specific situations where no reasonable alternative supplier exists, such as in the case of exclusive rights arrangements. This includes situations where products or services cannot be obtained in time through open or selective tendering procedures, additional deliveries by the original supplier, prototypes, necessary additional construction, and new construction services repeating similar projects previously awarded. Contracts awarded under design contests must align with AGP principles, prohibiting offsets that favor local development or balance-of-payments adjustments. Developing countries can negotiate offset conditions within limits. The AGP requires suppliers to have access to challenge procedures for breaches in government procurement. Parties must encourage suppliers to resolve complaints with procuring entities first. The challenge procedures must be non-discriminatory and timely. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) applies to AGP consultations and disputes, with exceptions such as only AGP Parties participating in decisions. Cross-retaliation is not available for the AGP, preventing WTO Members from suspending AGP benefits in separate disputes. The AGP includes a national security exception similar to Article XXI of the 1994 GATT, allowing Parties to take actions for essential security interests related to arms procurement. The AGP contains exceptions similar to those in the GATT 1994, allowing for exemptions related to national security, public morals, order, safety, intellectual property, and philanthropic institutions. Parties can make changes to their AGP Appendix with approval from the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. The AGP allows for changes to be made to the Agreement, with minor changes becoming effective if there is no objection within 30 days. The Committee will convene to consider proposals and claims for compensatory adjustments to maintain a balance of rights and obligations. If an agreement is not reached, Parties can pursue the matter under WTO consultation and dispute settlement procedures. The U.S. Appendix to the Agreement outlines U.S. obligations, including covered agencies, procurement thresholds, and exceptions. The AGP applies to all federal agencies in the U.S., except for the Federal Aviation Administration and certain specified purchases by the Department of Defense. Additionally, there are exceptions for procurement related to agriculture support, national security, and foreign assistance. The United States has invoked the Article XXIII national security exception for federal procurements related to the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy, including safeguarding nuclear materials and oil purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 14 FSC categories are excluded from DOD procurements due to national security considerations. The United States has reserved the right to invoke Article XXIII, paragraph 1 for purchases by covered federal entities in 56 FSC categories, including state agencies. Thirty-seven states and their agencies are listed in the U.S. Annex II, with exceptions for certain procurement areas like construction-grade steel, motor vehicles, and coal. Additionally, preferences for distressed areas and businesses owned by minorities, disabled veterans, and women are exempt from the AGP. The AGP does not prevent state entities from implementing environmental quality restrictions as long as they are not trade barriers. It does not apply to procurement by covered entities on behalf of non-covered entities at a different level of government or to restrictions on Federal funds for mass transit and highway projects. The Annex III covers procurement by specific entities such as TVA, PMAs, Port Authorities, and Rural Electrification Administration Financing, with exceptions and specific notes outlined. The U.S. Annex excludes certain services from the Universal List of Services, including transportation services, dredging, services purchased in support of military forces overseas, management and operation contracts for government facilities, public utilities services, research and development, and printing. The U.S. Annex excludes transportation services, dredging, services for military forces overseas, management contracts for government facilities, public utilities, research and development, and printing. The Annex also covers enhanced telecommunications services, research and development, and printing for Annex II entities. The U.S. General Notes include a reciprocity requirement for services procurement, with the U.S. offering coverage in most sectors on the basis of reciprocal access from other signatories. Most Code members were willing to apply the 1996 Code to procurement of key services like computer, environmental, and telecommunications services. The U.S. General Notes provide exceptions for set-asides for small and minority businesses in construction services contracts. The General Notes also clarify that U.S. procurement coverage does not include non-contractual agreements or government assistance. The U.S. General Notes clarify that procurement coverage does not include non-contractual agreements or government assistance, such as grants, loans, and fiscal incentives. Additionally, there is a reciprocity requirement for services listed in Annex 4. The U.S. General Notes specify country-specific exclusions for procurement under the AGP, including limitations for Canada, Korea, and Japan. NAFTA, implemented in 1994, contains extensive procurement obligations following the GATT Procurement Code. Mexico is not currently a party to NAFTA. The procurement obligations between the United States and Mexico are governed by NAFTA, while those between the United States and Canada were previously outlined in the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. NAFTA, like the AGP, includes national security and general exceptions. Additionally, various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) that the United States has in effect also contain government procurement provisions. The U.S. has various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with provisions for government procurement, including exemptions for Department of Defense contracts and threshold requirements. Newer FTAs like the U.S.-Chile, U.S.-Singapore, U.S.-Morocco, and U.S.-Australia FTAs closely follow the Agreement on Government Procurement (AGP). Some FTAs have lower threshold requirements than the AGP, and there are \"essential security\" provisions in agreements with Chile and Singapore. Morocco and Australia agreements do not have a national security exception. The Morocco and Australia agreements, as well as the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), have provisions for government procurement. The Buy American Act governs federal procurement, requiring the purchase of domestic goods unless exceptions apply. The Buy American Act requires the purchase of goods made in the United States, with exceptions for certain cases like public interest, cost, products for use outside the US, or products not available domestically. The Act defines \"substantially all\" as domestic components costing more than 50% of all components. The Buy American Act requires purchases of US-made goods, with exceptions for public interest, cost, and availability. The Act allows the President to waive restrictions for international obligations, designating countries for reciprocal procurement opportunities. The NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 added a provision making the waiver authority inapplicable to small businesses or minority preferences. The Trade Agreements Act requires the President to prohibit procurement of products from foreign countries not designated by the President under the WTO AGP, unless there are no offers of US products or services to fulfill government requirements. The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) allows the President to waive the prohibition on procurement of products from non-Party countries under certain conditions. Amendments have been made over the years to implement procurement obligations. No statutory changes have been made to implement the procurement chapters of the U.S. FTAs with Jordan, Chile, or Singapore, despite specific amendments to the Trade Agreements Act (TAA) over the years to fulfill procurement obligations."
