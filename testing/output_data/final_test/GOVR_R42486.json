    "content": "Between FY1980 and FY2016, BOP's appropriations increased by nearly $7.149 billion, with FY2016 being the peak year. Despite a decrease of $340 million in FY2017, the average annual increase in appropriations was approximately $199 million. The funding generally correlated with the number of inmates under BOP's jurisdiction, but recent years saw an increase in appropriations even as the inmate population decreased. Inflation-adjusted, BOP's appropriations rose by 787% from FY1980 to FY2016. BOP's appropriations increased 787% from FY1980 to FY2016, with a 732% increase in inflation-adjusted dollars when accounting for the decrease in appropriations for FY2017. BOP's operations are funded through annual appropriations provided by Congress, with the budget divided between Salaries and Expenses (S&E) and Buildings and Facilities (B&F) accounts. The budget for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) covers inmate custody, facility maintenance, and operations. It also includes funding for inmate incarceration in various facilities. There has been a continuous increase in BOP's appropriations, mainly driven by rising funding for Salaries and Expenses (S&E) since FY1980, with a slight decrease in FY2013 due to sequestration. Appropriations for the Bureau of Prisons' Salaries and Expenses (S&E) account have increased over the years, even as the prison population has decreased. BOP continues to request more funding for S&E, citing the need to cover employee pay raises and benefits. Congress has generally approved appropriations below the requested levels. The Bureau of Prisons has requested additional funding to cover pay raises, benefits, inmate healthcare, and other growing costs. Despite a decrease in the inmate population, the federal prison system is still operating over capacity, preventing the closure of prisons and reduction of staff to lower costs. The Bureau of Prisons is seeking additional funding to cover various costs, including pay raises, benefits, and inmate healthcare. Funding for Buildings and Facilities account fluctuates due to the cyclical nature of expanding prison capacity. A $400 million decrease in funding for B&F account in FY2017 led to a decrease in BOP's total appropriation. Each of BOP's appropriations accounts are divided into decision units that fund specific aspects of the Bureau. The Bureau of Prisons seeks additional funding for various costs, including pay raises, benefits, and inmate healthcare. Appropriations accounts are divided into decision units that fund specific aspects of BOP operations. The S&E account is divided into four decision units covering inmate care, programs, institution security, and administration. The Bureau of Prisons seeks additional funding for various costs, including pay raises, benefits, and inmate healthcare. Appropriations accounts are divided into decision units that fund specific aspects of BOP operations. The S&E account covers costs associated with administrative functions, contract confinement, and management and administration. This includes funding for research, evaluation, financial management, safety, legal counsel, private prisons, Residential Reentry Centers, state and local facilities, home confinement, and the National Institute of Corrections. Approximately 80% of BOP's S&E funding has gone to Inmate Care and Programs and Institution Security and Administration decision units, with funding increasing by 141% and 123% respectively from FY1999 to FY2017. Funding for Contract Confinement increased by 295% during the same period due to more inmates being confined in contract facilities. Funding for the Management and Administration decision unit increased by 74% from FY1999 to FY2017. The B&F account includes two decision units: New Construction and Modernization and Repair, covering lease payments, staff salaries, construction projects, and facility rehabilitation. The B&F account includes funding for new prison construction, modernization, and repair projects. In 10 out of 19 fiscal years since FY1999, most funding was allocated to new prison construction. On average, Congress appropriated $333 million for the B&F account from FY1999 to FY2017. Years with more funding for modernization and repair projects had lower total B&F funding, usually less than $100 million. The data presented in Figure 3 shows that Congress has been more likely to fund the Administration's request for prison construction than for operating the federal prison system. From FY1980 to FY2017, Congress appropriated less than the Administration's request for the B&F account 16 times and for the S&E account 24 times. However, the S&E account received more funding than requested between FY2007 and FY2010. Congress has consistently provided additional funding for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to compensate for past underfunding, resulting in staffing shortages and program deficits. Despite the Administration's inadequate requests, Congress has not raised concerns in recent years. Appropriations for BOP have increased, even as the federal prison population has decreased, possibly due to rising incarceration costs. The per capita cost of incarceration has increased significantly from approximately $22,000 per inmate in FY2000 to almost $35,000 in FY2016, a 61% rise. This increase is partly due to inflationary pressures like healthcare, food, clothing, and utilities. Since FY2013, the per capita cost has outstripped inflation, coinciding with a decreasing prison population, leading to higher costs per inmate. The per capita cost of incarceration is not equivalent to marginal costs, as it reflects the total amount obligated by BOP divided by the average daily population. While some expenses would decrease with fewer inmates, items like staff salaries may not change until prisons can be closed. BOP's budget is a concern for policymakers as it consumes a larger share of the DOJ's annual appropriations. The trend shows a growing proportion of DOJ's budget dedicated to BOP since FY1980, with fluctuations due to changes in year-to-year appropriations. The spike in BOP's share of DOJ's annual appropriations in FY1990 was due to Congress appropriating over $1 billion for the B&F account. The decrease in BOP's share in FY2009 was a result of Congress allocating an additional $4 billion for DOJ under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009."
