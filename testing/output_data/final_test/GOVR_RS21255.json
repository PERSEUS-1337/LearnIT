    "content": "In the Senate, bills and resolutions are typically brought to the floor for consideration either by unanimous consent or through a motion to proceed. Measures brought up by motion are usually more controversial or contested than those considered by unanimous consent. Unanimous consent can be a simple request or a broader agreement that includes terms for consideration. If any Senator objects to unanimous consent, a motion to proceed may be offered. In the Senate, bills and resolutions are typically brought to the floor for consideration either by unanimous consent or through a motion to proceed. The majority leader usually files a cloture petition when objection is anticipated to a unanimous consent request. Senate Rule VIII, paragraph 2, allows anyone to offer the motion to proceed, but the majority leader often does so to manage the schedule effectively. In the Senate, motions to proceed are typically offered by the majority leader or the majority whip, sometimes by other Senators acting on behalf of the majority leader. The report highlights the small number of motions not made by direction of the majority leader, with a focus on maintaining majority party control. The Senator acting for the majority leader protects majority party control by objecting to unanimous consent requests and handling motions to proceed. Table 1 shows the number of motions offered by different Senators from 1979-2014. Majority whip motions are assumed to be coordinated with the majority leader. Other majority party Senators are presumed to act as designees of the majority leader unless proven otherwise. From 1979-2014, motions to proceed were often offered by Senators on behalf of the majority leader, as evidenced by explicit statements or actions aligning with the majority leader's directives. Table 1 displays the number of motions to consider legislative items in each Congress during this period. The data in Table 1 shows motions to proceed to consider legislation in various Congresses, obtained from sources like the Congressional Record and the Journal of the Senate. It includes debatable and non-debatable motions, excluding executive business motions. The Senate Rules allow for non-debatable motions to proceed, particularly for conference reports and measures under expedited procedures. A motion to proceed during the \"morning hour\" is also non-debatable, although this practice has been rare since the 1980s. Multiple motions to proceed can be made on a single measure if the first is rejected or if the Senate adjourns, causing the motion to \"fall.\" This allows for the possibility of taking up the measure again with a new motion to proceed. During the 96th to 113th Congress (1979-2014), a total of 628 motions to proceed were offered, with 86% by the majority leader. On average, 35 motions to proceed were made per Congress, with the 113th Congress having the highest number at 124. The increase in motions to proceed in the Senate may be due to the majority leader's strategy of offering these motions to prevent others from doing so. Another factor could be the shift in Senate practice regarding deference to the majority leader. Additionally, the distinction between recessing and adjourning at the end of the day may also play a role in this trend. The Senate's shift towards daily adjournments has led to a decrease in considering motions to proceed over several days. This change in practice may contribute to the increase in renewing motions to proceed more frequently. The Senate's shift towards daily adjournments has led to a decrease in considering motions to proceed over several days. Instead, the majority leader often files for cloture on the motion immediately after offering it, making it unnecessary to renew the motion on a following day. Most motions to proceed that are not adopted simply do not reach a final vote. During the 18 Congresses studied, 28 motions to proceed were identified as being offered other than by direction of the majority leader. Of these, 20 were offered by the minority leader, 7 by other minority party Senators, and 1 by a majority party Senator. Two of these motions were adopted by the Senate, while the remaining 26 were either defeated outright or tabled. In some cases, the Senate turned to other business after rejecting cloture on the motion.

In four cases, the Senate turned to other business after rejecting cloture on the motion to proceed. The final two motions were ruled out of order. Thirteen of these motions were debatable, while the remaining 15 were considered privileged.

The motions proposed to bring up a conference report or were offered pursuant to statutory expedited procedures, addressing budget resolutions, joint resolutions to disapprove regulations, and a disapproval resolution under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. During the last 3 Congresses, there has been an increase in motions to proceed not directed by the majority leader, indicating a possible decline in deference to leadership scheduling efforts. These motions include those offered by the minority leader and under unanimous consent agreements, suggesting some level of acquiescence by the majority leadership. The rise in non-debatable motions under expedited procedures also contributed to this trend. During the last 3 Congresses, there has been an increase in motions to proceed not directed by the majority leader, indicating a possible decline in deference to leadership scheduling efforts. This trend includes motions offered by the minority leader and under unanimous consent agreements, with a rise in non-debatable motions under expedited procedures contributing to this shift. During the 105th-110th Congresses (1997-2008), there was a notable increase in motions to proceed not directed by the majority leader, leading to changes in how the Senate handled these motions. The shift included more motions being defeated outright, with non-debatable motions under expedited procedures playing a significant role. This trend contrasts with previous Congresses (1979-2008) where motions were more likely to be tabled or adopted.
