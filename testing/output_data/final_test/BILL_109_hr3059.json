    "content": "The Act titled \"Alternative Fuel Utilization and Infrastructure Development Incentives Act of 2005\" amends the 1986 Code to provide incentives for the installation of alternative fuel refueling stations and the retail sale of alternative fuels as motor vehicle fuel. The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2. The Act aims to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil by promoting the use of E-85 gasoline blends with at least 85% domestically sourced ethanol, providing increased access to this alternative fuel for American drivers. Congress acknowledges the need to increase US refining capacity, domestic oil production, and use of alternative transportation fuels like E-85 gasoline blends with 85% domestically sourced ethanol. Market penetration of E-85 capable Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFVs) is growing rapidly. In response to production incentives, automakers are expected to add over 1,000,000 FFVs annually. However, the underutilization of E-85 fuel is due to the lack of refueling infrastructure, which can be addressed with tax credits to stimulate development. SEC. 4. Incentives for the installation of alternative fuel refueling stations. Amended by adding a new section for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit. The tax credit for qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property is 50% of the cost, with a limit of $30,000 for depreciable property and $1,000 for others. There is a phaseout reduction of 25% for properties placed in service after December 31, 2010. The tax credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property is 25% for 2011 and 50% for 2012. Qualified property must consist of at least 85% ethanol. The tax credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property is subject to certain limitations and rules. The credit amount allowed for a taxable year cannot exceed the excess of the regular tax reduced by certain credits over the tentative minimum tax. Any excess credit can be carried forward for up to 20 taxable years. Special rules apply to the credit carryforward for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property. The basis of the property is reduced by the cost taken into account for the credit. No double benefit is allowed for property eligible for both a deduction and a credit. Additionally, certain rules apply to property used by tax-exempt entities. No credit allowed for property used outside the United States or if taxpayer elects not to apply section. Recapture rules apply for the credit. The section provides recapture rules and regulations for the credit, with termination after December 31, 2013. Conforming amendments are made to various sections to align with section 30B. The table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 is amended by inserting a new item after section 30A. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the date of the enactment of this Act, in taxable years ending after such date. Incentives for the retail sale of alternative fuels as motor vehicle fuel include a new credit for retail sale of alternative fuels as motor vehicle fuel. The alternative fuel retail sales credit is 35 cents per gallon for fuel containing at least 85% ethanol sold at retail. The term 'sold at retail' refers to non-resale sales after manufacture, production, or importation. If alternative fuel is used to propel a qualified vehicle before being sold at retail, it is considered a sale. The alternative fuel retail sales credit is available for fuel sold at retail, with a credit of 35 cents per gallon for fuel containing at least 85% ethanol. A qualified alternative fuel motor vehicle is defined as a vehicle capable of operating on alternative fuel, acquired for personal use or lease, and made by a manufacturer. Retailers can elect to pass the credit to purchasers of alternative fuel. The alternative fuel retail sales credit allows for a credit of 35 cents per gallon for fuel containing at least 85% ethanol. Retailers can pass the credit to purchasers, or to the supplier if the purchaser is tax-exempt. The credit is treated as a business credit and will not apply to fuel sold at retail after December 31, 2010. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 is amended to include a new item after section 40A. The amendments made by this section apply to fuel sold at retail after the enactment date of this Act, in taxable years ending after such date."
