The \"Targeting Rogue and Opaque Letters Act of 2015\" prohibits deceptive practices in asserting US patents, specifically targeting false communications claiming patent infringement. Legal actions for patent infringement may be taken against recipients, other persons, or exclusive licensees of the asserted patent. Licenses purchased by persons other than the recipient must be disclosed if unrelated to the alleged infringement. The sender of deceptive patent infringement communications may face consequences if they have previously filed a civil action for infringement that was determined not to be valid, or if they seek compensation for unenforceable patent claims or activities after the patent expiration. The sender of deceptive patent infringement communications may face consequences if they fail to include the identity of the person asserting a right to license the patent or enforce it against the recipient, as well as an identification of at least one patent issued. The deceptive patent infringement communication must include the identification of a patent alleged to have been infringed, a description of how the recipient's product or service infringes the patent, and contact information for further inquiries. The affirmative defense for deceptive patent infringement communication states that mistakes made in good faith, not intentional violations, can be defended if proven by evidence. Violating acts declared unfair or deceptive are considered violations of this section. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT BY FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. Violations of section 2 are treated as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission enforces this Act with the same powers and penalties as under the FTC Act, without limiting its authority under other laws. SEC. 4. PREEMPTION OF STATE LAWS ON PATENT DEMAND LETTERS AND ENFORCEMENT BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL. This Act preempts any state laws related to the transmission of communications regarding patent rights, but does not affect other state laws such as consumer protection or fraud. State Attorneys General can enforce this Act if residents are adversely affected. State Attorneys General can bring civil actions in federal court to stop violations of the Act and impose civil penalties, with a maximum penalty of $5,000,000 for related violations. The Attorney General must notify the FTC before taking action. The FTC must be notified by the Attorney General before taking civil action under the Act. The Commission has the right to intervene, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal in the action. If the Commission has initiated a civil action for a violation of the Act, no State attorney general can bring a separate action. The attorney general may bring a civil action during the pendency of the FTC's action against any defendant named in the complaint for a violation of the Act. State attorney generals have the power to conduct investigations, administer oaths, and compel witnesses or evidence. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"bad faith\" refers to knowingly false or misleading statements, reckless indifference to the truth, or intentional avoidance of the truth. The \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Trade Commission. The term \"final determination\" refers to a court decision in the United States or the US Patent and Trademark Office that is unappealable or no longer open to appeal."
