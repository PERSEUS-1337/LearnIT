The \"Cruise Vessel Consumer Confidence Act of 2013\" under Chapter 807 of Title 46, United States Code addresses unfair practices and methods of competition related to the sale of cruise tickets. The Federal Maritime Commission can investigate actions by cruise vessel owners, enforce regulations, and address passenger complaints. The Federal Maritime Commission can enforce regulations on cruise vessel owners for unfair or deceptive practices, with penalties of up to $25,000 for violations. Each day of a continuing violation is considered a separate offense. The Federal Maritime Commission can penalize cruise vessel owners up to $25,000 for failing to disclose key information to passengers before offering a ticket, including the vessel's name, casualty history, and crime complaints. The Federal Maritime Commission can penalize cruise vessel owners for failing to disclose key information to passengers before offering a ticket, including crew, passenger, and minor involvement in incidents, gastric illness outbreaks, mechanical failures, vessel documentation country, and investigation locations. The Federal Maritime Commission can penalize cruise vessel owners for not disclosing key information to passengers before ticket purchase, including incident locations, taxes, fees, and complaint filing instructions. The Federal Maritime Commission requires cruise vessel owners to disclose key information to passengers before ticket purchase through an Internet Web site, including providing electronic tickets and prohibiting the requirement of a printed version for travel. The Federal Maritime Commission mandates that cruise vessel owners must reimburse passengers if there is a delay of more than 24 hours in the departure or disembarking of a cruise. The reimbursement amount varies based on the length of the delay, with exceptions for unforeseeable events not related to mechanical failures. The Federal Maritime Commission requires cruise vessel owners to reimburse passengers for delays exceeding 24 hours, with exceptions for unforeseeable events like inclement weather, political unrest, piracy, or actions to ensure passenger safety. Failure to reimburse may result in a civil penalty. Owners must also submit customer service plans outlining notification of delays, transparent cancellation policies, and prompt ticket refunds. The Federal Maritime Commission mandates cruise vessel owners to provide prompt ticket refunds after cancellations, accommodate passengers with disabilities, address passenger complaints, notify passengers of itinerary changes, and meet essential needs during delays. This includes access to food, water, restroom facilities, power, real-time updates, ventilation, temperature control, and medical treatment. The Federal Maritime Commission requires cruise vessel owners to incorporate a plan into ticket contracts, make contracts available online, and review submitted plans for completeness. Owners must submit plans for each vessel owned or operated. The Federal Maritime Commission mandates cruise vessel owners to submit plans for each vessel owned or operated within 120 days of enactment. The Commission will review the completeness of each plan within 120 days of receiving it and may require updates as necessary. Additionally, guidance must be provided within 90 days of enactment. The Commission will issue guidance within 90 days of enactment regarding plan elements, requirements, and filing procedures. Owners violating the section may face civil penalties up to $25,000 for each day of a continuing violation. The Federal Maritime Commission will establish a process for cruise passengers to report complaints, notify the public and cruise owners about this process, submit reports to Congress every 3 years, and may authorize fees. The Federal Maritime Commission may establish, adjust, and collect fees in cruise vessel ticket prices to fund the implementation of this chapter. Fees must be reasonably related to the costs incurred by the Commission. Judicial review is limited for fee establishment, cost determinations, and cost allocations by the Commission. The Federal Maritime Commission can set fees in cruise vessel ticket prices to support this chapter, with costs including operation, maintenance, leasing, and overhead expenses. Definitions in this chapter include a cruise vessel as a passenger vessel carrying at least 250 passengers with onboard sleeping facilities, used for voyages in the United States. The term 'mechanical failure' in relation to a cruise vessel refers to the failure of any machine or mechanical system to function within specified parameters. The term 'owner' in this context includes the owner, charterer, managing operator, master, or individual in charge of the vessel. The section 807 of Cruise Vessel Passenger Protections does not eliminate or replace authority provided to a department or agency under other Federal or State law."
