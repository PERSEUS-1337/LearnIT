    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act\". The Congress acknowledges immigration as a Federal responsibility and notes that not all unlawfully present aliens are detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Hospitals are required by law to provide emergency medical treatment to individuals, regardless of their immigration status. The Southwest border region is mentioned as being ill-equipped to handle the influx of immigrants. The Southwest border region struggles to afford healthcare for undocumented aliens due to low income levels and a shortage of health professionals. Unreimbursed costs for caring for these individuals are jeopardizing the financial stability of healthcare providers in Arizona. Reimbursement to health care providers for emergency medical care provided to certain aliens is addressed in Section 3. The Secretary will establish a 5-year pilot program to reimburse providers for services provided to aliens in Arizona and suppliers of emergency ambulance services. This program applies when payment cannot be made through other federal, state, or local programs. The Secretary will establish a 5-year pilot program to reimburse providers for services provided to aliens in Arizona and suppliers of emergency ambulance services. This program applies when payment cannot be made through other federal, state, or local programs. As part of the pilot program, funds will be used to reimburse hospitals in Arizona for transportation costs incurred in returning stabilized aliens to the United States border if the Attorney General denies a request to take custody within 24 hours. The pilot program reimburses providers for services to aliens in Arizona and emergency ambulance suppliers. It covers aliens not lawfully present in the US, not detained, or paroled for medical treatment. Hospitals can be reimbursed for transportation costs if the Attorney General doesn't respond within 24 hours and discharging the alien poses a health or safety threat. During the pilot program, the Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the operation, including the number and nationality of aliens assisted, average cost per alien, total amount paid to providers, and feasibility/cost of expanding the program. This subsection does not authorize any reduction in funds under other federal programs. The Border Hospital Survival and Illegal Immigrant Care Act allows the Attorney General to transfer funds to the Health Resources and Services Administration for enforcement and border affairs. The transfer is limited to $50,000,000 per year for five years following the enactment of the Act."
