    "content": "The Valle Grande/Valles Caldera Preservation bill is cited as the short title for this Act. The Congress of the United States recognizes the unique scientific, cultural, historic, recreational, ecological, and geothermal values of the lands managed by the Baca Land and Cattle Company in central New Mexico, including the Valles Caldera, one of the world's largest resurgent lava domes. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo confirmed private land claims in New Mexico, where the Dunigan family has carefully managed the land for generations. The property has historical significance with archaeological evidence of past use and film sets from the American West. The Dunigan family, current owners of the land, have preserved a mix of healthy range and timber land with significant species diversity. The land offers recreational opportunities like hiking, fishing, camping, skiing, and hunting. The owners are looking to sell the land, creating an opportunity for public ownership and access for the first time since 1860. The Baca Land and Cattle Company Lands, bordered by the Sante Fe National Forest and the Bandelier National Monument, contain the headwaters for the Jemez and San Antonio rivers. These lands should be acquired quickly to prevent potential subdivisions. Authorities are needed for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to jointly develop a mechanism for the best use and preservation of these lands. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Forest Service, is authorized to acquire the Baca Location No. 1 lands in New Mexico by purchase, exchange, or donation, using appropriated funds or funds from the sale of lands. Acquisition must be on a willing seller basis and mutually acceptable terms. The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior will develop a plan to adjust boundaries between Santa Fe National Forest and Bandelier National Monument to protect the monument's watershed. The plan will be submitted to Congress within 120 days of acquiring Baca Location No. 1."
