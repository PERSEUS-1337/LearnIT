    "content": "The Supreme Court Justices ruled that a United States Attorney General cannot be sued for damages due to a policy resulting in a valid arrest of a material witness for an improper purpose. The decision did not address the constitutionality of the material witness statute or the Fourth Amendment's role in such arrests. It also did not determine the immunity of prosecutors in such cases. In February 2003, an Idaho federal grand jury indicted Al-Hussayen for visa fraud and false statements. The United States Attorney's Office applied for a material arrest warrant for al-Kidd under 18 U.S.C. 3144, citing his association with Al-Hussayen and travel to Yemen. The then Attorney General was granted qualified immunity for alleged Fourth Amendment violations. Al-Kidd was arrested at Dulles International Airport in Virginia two days after a warrant was issued due to his contact with officials of the Islamic Assembly of North America. He was then transferred to Idaho and denied bail by a magistrate. The government proposed his release on the condition that he reside with his in-laws in Nevada and surrender his passport. Al-Kidd was arrested and had travel restrictions imposed on him. Al-Hussayen, also charged with supporting terrorists, was acquitted of terrorism charges but faced others. Al-Kidd sued federal officials for violating his rights. Al-Kidd alleges that Ashcroft implemented policies leading to wrongful arrests under insufficient evidence, violating \u00a73144, and imposing punitive conditions on material witnesses. Al-Kidd alleges that Ashcroft implemented policies leading to wrongful arrests under insufficient evidence and imposing punitive conditions on material witnesses, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Defendants sought dismissal based on absolute and qualified immunity, but the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decision on the Fifth Amendment claim. Al-Kidd's experience of being arrested as a material witness is not uncommon, with federal criminal cases often leading to detention until testimony is required. The constitutionality of detaining witnesses without bail has been upheld, with the Supreme Court noting the importance of disclosing knowledge of crimes. The federal material witness statute allows for the detention of individuals who may be witnesses or suspects in a crime, with concerns raised about its potential misuse for preventive detention. Critics argue that the statute has been used regularly, especially in immigration cases, with some pointing to post-9/11 arrests of mostly Muslim individuals. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, seventy mostly Muslim individuals were arrested and detained under the federal material witness statute, which allows for the arrest of individuals whose testimony is deemed crucial in a criminal proceeding. Detention is only permissible if securing the witness's testimony by deposition is impracticable, and release may be delayed until a deposition can be taken. An arrest warrant under 18 U.S.C. 3144 can be issued for a witness with material evidence in a federal criminal proceeding if it is impracticable to secure their attendance by subpoena. The definition of \"material\" evidence is not directly addressed, but it is generally understood as evidence that can influence a decision. Material evidence in a federal criminal proceeding can lead to an arrest warrant if a witness's attendance cannot be secured by subpoena. The definition of \"material\" evidence is not clearly defined but is generally understood as evidence that can influence a decision. The government can establish probable cause for material evidence through an affidavit at the grand jury level, which may not be a demanding standard due to the broad power of inquiry held by the grand jury. This was exemplified in the case of al-Kidd, where an affidavit provided probable cause to believe he had material evidence related to a grand jury inquiry that led to an indictment for providing material support to IANA. The affidavit must establish probable cause for material evidence in a federal criminal proceeding to warrant an arrest. Impracticality of securing a witness's appearance through a subpoena can be shown by evidence of possible flight or refusal to cooperate. Federal bail laws generally apply in such cases. Federal bail laws apply to material witnesses arrested under section 3144, allowing for the assistance of counsel during bail proceedings. Release is favored, followed by release with conditions, and detention as a last resort. A defendant is typically released on personal recognizance or bond unless assurances are deemed insufficient. Material witnesses need only satisfy the appearance standard to be released under adequate conditions for later testimony. The court may detain a material witness if word, bond, or conditions are inadequate to ensure their later testimony. Factors considered include deposition, character, health, and community ties. The government must justify holding witnesses periodically. Prosecutorial officials have absolute immunity from civil suits for their actions. Absolute immunity applies to prosecutors when they prepare for judicial proceedings, appear in court to present evidence, or train trial prosecutors on pre-trial obligations. It does not apply when prosecutors give advice to police, make statements to the press, or act as complaining witnesses. The Ninth Circuit ruled that seeking a material witness arrest warrant for investigative purposes does not carry absolute immunity. The Ninth Circuit ruled that prosecutors seeking a material witness warrant for investigative purposes are entitled to qualified, not absolute immunity. This doctrine protects government officials from civil liability if their conduct does not violate established rights. Al-Kidd claimed his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the Attorney General's use of the material witness statute to arrest suspects. The Ninth Circuit ruled that using a material witness statute pretextually to detain suspects without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment. Al-Kidd argued that officer's motives should be considered in Fourth Amendment violations, as the statute does not deal with ordinary probable cause. The Ninth Circuit ruled that using a material witness statute pretextually to detain suspects without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment. Official motives matter in some Fourth Amendment cases, as qualified immunity cannot be lost unless the constitutional right is \"clearly established.\" The Ninth Circuit ruled that using a material witness statute pretextually to detain suspects without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment. The court found that Al-Kidd's right not to be arrested as a material witness in order to be investigated or preemptively detained was clearly established at the time of his arrest. Ashcroft was found to be entitled to neither. The Ninth Circuit ruled that Ashcroft was not entitled to absolute or qualified immunity in the case. The Supreme Court reversed this decision, with Justice Scalia writing the opinion and Justice Kennedy concurring. Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor also concurred in the result. Justice Kagan did not participate in the case. The Solicitor argued that Ashcroft should have absolute immunity as applying for a material witness warrant is a prosecutorial function. They also argued that Ashcroft was entitled to qualified immunity as arrest under a valid warrant is not a Fourth Amendment violation. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling that Ashcroft was not entitled to absolute or qualified immunity. The Court determined that Ashcroft had qualified immunity as there was no clearly established constitutional violation at the time of the arrest. The Court found that al-Kidd's arrest met constitutional requirements, and therefore, Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law. The Court did not address the issue of absolute immunity. al-Kidd did not challenge the constitutionality of his arrest based on officers' motivation. The Court emphasized that the presence of a warrant made a significant difference in the case, unlike situations where motivation could impact Fourth Amendment reasonableness in other contexts. The Court emphasized that the presence of a warrant made a significant difference in the case, entitling the Attorney General to qualified immunity. Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor raised concerns about the Court's treatment of the material witness issue and the legality of the Government's use of the Material Witness Statute. Justice Kennedy suggested a different \"clearly established law\" standard for national officials, highlighting the challenges faced by officials with responsibilities in multiple jurisdictions. The Attorney General's national office sets policies implemented across the country, leading to potential ambiguity in decisional law. National officeholders should be given deference for qualified immunity when faced with inconsistent legal rules in different jurisdictions, as long as they implement policies consistent with the governing law of the jurisdiction where the action is taken. This issue was not the focus of the Court's opinion."
