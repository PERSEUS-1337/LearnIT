    "content": "The \"Bioenergy Act of 2015\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. It includes definitions for key terms used in the Act. The \"Bioenergy Act of 2015\" defines key terms such as bioheat, biopower, Initiative, Secretary, and State Wood Energy Team. The Bioheat and Biopower Initiative is established under section 3(a) of the Act. The Bioheat and Biopower Initiative, established under the \"Bioenergy Act of 2015\", is led by a Board of Directors consisting of representatives from the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, and Department of the Interior. The Bioheat and Biopower Initiative, established under the \"Bioenergy Act of 2015\", is led by a Board of Directors consisting of representatives from various federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Board shall meet at least once each quarter and coordinate research and development activities related to biopower and bioheat projects among different federal departments and agencies. The Board of Directors, consisting of representatives from federal departments and agencies, provides recommendations to the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy on the administration of the Bioenergy Act of 2015. They ensure open and competitive solicitations for annual grant awards with clearly stated objectives and evaluation criteria. The Bioenergy Act of 2015 is overseen by the Board of Directors, who recommend grant programs to the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy. The Secretary will establish a program to provide grants for projects in bioheat and biopower innovation and market development. Eligible projects must submit an application to receive a grant. The Secretary will allocate $15,000,000 to projects developing innovative biomass preprocessing techniques for cost reduction in heat and electricity generation. The Secretary will allocate $15,000,000 to innovative bioheat and biopower projects focusing on reducing costs of distributed preprocessing technologies, transportation, and logistics, while also maximizing environmental integrity by reducing emissions and promoting forest ecosystem health. The Secretary will allocate $15,000,000 to innovative bioheat and biopower demonstration projects, including district energy projects, transportation innovation, and retrofitting coal-fired electricity generation facilities to use biomass. Projects selected will have diverse geographical distribution, and the Federal share of project costs will be 50 percent. The owner or operator of a project receiving a grant under this subsection must participate in a working group, submit a report to the Secretary, and carry out additional activities as determined necessary. The Secretary will establish 2 working groups. The Secretary will establish 2 working groups to share best practices and collaborate in project implementation. One group will consist of feedstock project representatives, and the other will consist of demand and logistics project representatives. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 5 years, detailing the projects funded, findings, and market/technology development status. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a program to provide grants for thermally led wood energy technologies, with priority for projects proposed by State Wood Energy Teams. Applicants must submit an application with required information. The Secretary of Agriculture will allocate $10,000,000 for feasibility assessments, engineering designs, and construction of thermally led wood energy systems. Projects selected for grants must have diverse geographical distribution, and the Federal share of project costs will be 50 percent. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this section. The Secretary of Agriculture will allocate $30,000,000 for grants under subsection (a) and $10,000,000 for grants under subsection (b). SEC. 5. Loan programs; strategic analysis and research. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a low-interest loan program within the Rural Development Office to support the construction of wood energy systems. The program will be carried out according to set requirements and regulations, with an authorization of $50,000,000 for implementation. Additionally, wood energy systems are eligible for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Loan Program. The Department of Agriculture will establish a low-interest loan program to support wood energy systems. These systems are eligible for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Loan Program. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Forest Service Chief, will create a bioheat and biopower research program, with costs split between the Department of Energy and Agriculture. This program will be overseen by the Board of Directors of the Initiative to advance research and analysis. The curr_chunk discusses advancing research on the environmental, social, and economic aspects of biopower and bioheat industries, providing policy recommendations, and assessing the feasibility of district wood energy opportunities. The curr_chunk focuses on exploring wood energy opportunities in Forest Service regions through regional assessments, feasibility studies, and technical assistance to communities. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture: $2,000,000 for paragraph (1)(C)(i), $1,000,000 for paragraph (1)(C)(ii), and $1,000,000 for paragraph (1)(C)(iii) to support wood energy opportunities in Forest Service regions."
