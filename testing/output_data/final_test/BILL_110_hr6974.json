    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Idaho Efficient Vehicle Demonstration Act of 2008\". Congress acknowledges that Idaho faces a disadvantage in freight transportation due to lower weight limits on Interstate highways compared to surrounding states like Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. Idaho implemented a pilot project in 2003 allowing vehicle combinations up to 129,000 pounds to address this issue. The Idaho Transportation Department implemented a pilot project in 2003 allowing vehicle combinations up to 129,000 pounds on specific routes in the state. The program requires reports every 3 years on safety, bridges, and pavement impacts, with termination set for July 1, 2013 unless extended by the legislature. The pilot project in Idaho allowed vehicle combinations up to 129,000 pounds on specific routes, leading heavier vehicles to divert to smaller roads with higher weight limits. This diversion increases fuel costs due to longer travel times. With fuel costs rising over 80% between 2007 and 2008, allowing commercial vehicles on select Interstate highways at higher weight limits could result in significant transportation savings. The pilot project in Idaho allowed heavier vehicles on specific routes, leading to diversions to smaller roads with higher weight limits. Allowing commercial vehicles on select Interstate highways at higher weight limits could result in significant transportation savings. This would require substantial data and analysis of the impacts on bridges, highway safety, and pavements.

The Act defines terms such as \"covered Interstate System highway,\" \"Director,\" \"Interstate System,\" and \"pilot project.\" House Bill 395 of the State allows vehicle combinations weighing up to 129,000 pounds to operate on specific routes in Idaho. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Transportation. WAIVER OF HIGHWAY FUNDING REDUCTION for vehicles using Interstate System Highways. Prohibition on reducing funds for states allowing certain heavy vehicle combinations on Interstate highways. Vehicles weighing between 105,500 to 129,000 pounds with power units hauling multiple trailers can use covered Interstate System highways without fund reduction. The Act allows certain heavy vehicle combinations to travel on specific Interstate highways without fund reduction until July 1, 2013. The authorized routes include portions of Interstate Route 15, Route 86, and Route 84. The Act permits certain heavy vehicle combinations to operate on designated Interstate highways until July 1, 2013, with exceptions for safety concerns or data collection failures by the Director. The Secretary consults with the Director to make a determination under subsection (c)(2)(A)(i) and collects data as described in section 5(2). The determination is published in the Federal Register with the date of termination. The State must submit a plan to the Secretary and collect data on the safety effects of vehicles on covered highways as required by House Bill 395."
