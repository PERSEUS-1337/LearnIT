    "content": "Labor markets respond to economic influences, with changes in employment, job types, locations, and skills sought by employers. Recessions increase joblessness, impacting certain worker groups, while structural forces like production patterns and consumer preferences also affect employment. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows how the U.S. labor market has been impacted since 2007, analyzing indicators like employment, unemployment, job availability by industry and occupation, and outcomes for different demographic groups. The labor market has been influenced by factors like the Great Recession, technological innovation, and an aging workforce, leading to changes in job availability for U.S. workers. These trends are important for Congress to understand as they impact workforce planning, income support programs, and policy responses. The contribution of business cycles and ongoing structural changes to recent labor market developments is discussed, with recent patterns analyzed in this context. The report does not identify specific contributions of each force but examines the timing and intensity of labor market changes. Business cycles, such as economic recession and recovery, impact employment trends through various channels. During recessions, factors like declining demand for goods and services and increased uncertainty lead to reduced employer demand for workers, resulting in higher unemployment rates. Conversely, economic recovery sees an increase in job openings, hires, and overall employment as aggregate demand rises. Total employment follows predictable patterns over the business cycle, with the length and strength of expansions and recessions varying. The business cycle impacts employment trends, with varying peak and lowest unemployment rates across recessions and expansions. Deeper recessions, like the 2007-2009 one, can have long-lasting effects on employment outcomes for some workers, leading to outdated skills and limited prospects even in improving conditions. Employment composition can change significantly over time due to structural shifts in labor. Recent technological advancements in information and communications technologies (ICT) and automation have reshaped work processes in various sectors, leading to job losses in middle-skill positions and gains in higher-skill roles. This contrasts with historical instances like the industrial revolution, where technological innovations brought significant job growth for lower-skilled workers. Globalization and evolving consumer preferences also play a role in shaping employment trends. Structural changes like globalization and evolving consumer preferences impact employment by altering the types of jobs available in the US and overseas. Industry and occupational employment are influenced by imported/exported goods, multinational corporations' global supply chains, and changing consumer demands. Technological innovation further shapes employment by making global supply chains more efficient and introducing new products like streaming video. The impact of structural changes on the labor market, such as globalization and evolving consumer preferences, has led to shifts in employment across sectors and regions. The Great Recession also significantly affected job losses, with millions of private sector jobs lost during and after the recession. Failure to adapt to these changes can result in lower-wage work, unemployment, or labor force detachment. Between the end of the recession and February 2010, 1.2 million jobs were lost, with private employment declining by 6.6%. Long-tenured workers were among those displaced from their jobs due to company closures, relocations, or downsizing. Job growth did not consistently occur until March 2010, and it took until March 2014 to return to pre-recession employment levels. Despite recent low unemployment rates, labor force participation has decreased, leading to a lower employment-population ratio. The unemployment rate in the United States peaked at 10% after the Great Recession but has since fallen to 3.8% in May 2018, the lowest level in any economic expansion since 1970. Most labor market indicators suggest full employment has been reached, despite higher unemployment rates for minorities. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) in the United States has shown less improvement recently, dropping to 63% from 2008 to 2014, its lowest level since the 1970s. Some believe this low level may indicate latent slack in labor markets, suggesting there could be more available workers than the unemployment rate currently suggests. The Great Recession caused significant employment loss in certain industries and occupations, but as the economy recovers, these effects are diminishing. Structural changes have also impacted industries and occupations differently, leading to a shift in the job market since 2007. Despite the unemployment rate returning to pre-recession levels, the available jobs today are not the same as they were before. Private sector employment fell and then recovered from 2007 to 2018, with a net increase overall. Service-sector establishments saw net job growth, while the goods-producing sector, especially manufacturing, experienced declining employment due to technology adoption. The shift towards service-sector jobs in the U.S. has been driven by labor-saving technology and increased import competition. Service-sector jobs made up 81% of private sector jobs in 2007 and almost 84% in 2017. Innovations in service delivery, demographic shifts, and consumer demand have contributed to the rise in service employment. The decline in goods-producing firms' employment shares is evident, especially in manufacturing, as shown in Figure 4. Between 2007 and 2017, the largest employment shares were in education and health services and professional and business services, each gaining more than one percentage point. Retail trade fell to 12.8% of employment, while hospitality and leisure rose to 12.9%, switching ranks. Employment declined in all sectors except education and health services, which added about 1.3 million jobs. Between 2007 and 2017, all sectors saw a decline in employment except for education and health services, which added around 1.3 million jobs. The health care and social services industry accounted for much of the job growth, adding about 1.1 million jobs over the period. Additionally, the education services industry and health care and social services industry continued to see growth after 2010. Goods-producing sectors lost employment shares during this period. Between 2007 and 2010, employment levels in mining, logging, construction, and manufacturing fell due to the recession. While there was some rebound in employment between 2010 and 2017, it was not enough to reach 2007 levels. Despite the decline in employment, industries like mining and manufacturing became more productive, requiring less labor. Construction saw a decline in both employment and real value added. Occupations also shifted during this period, sometimes aligning with industry patterns. During the 2007-2009 recession, employment in production, transportation, and sales positions declined. Some occupations, like managers and maintenance workers, are more widely distributed across industries and can easily adapt to changing industry conditions. During the 2007-2009 recession, employment in production, transportation, and sales positions declined. Workers with cross-industry mobility can adapt to changing industry conditions. Changes in work organization and technology can impact demand for different occupations. Employment shifts from 2007 to 2017 show gains in lower-wage occupations like food preparation and higher-wage jobs like managers. The \"hollowing out\" of middle-skill jobs, known as job polarization, has led to concerns about the shrinking pool of good jobs for the average U.S. worker. Technological changes have driven growth in low-paying and high-paying jobs, with automation making manufacturing more capital intensive and increasing demand for high-skilled workers. Recent technological changes have made manufacturing more capital intensive and affected demand in certain support service positions and retail sales. Highly skilled workers performing complex, nonroutine tasks have seen increased labor demand, while low-skilled workers may not see the same benefits. Rising incomes among other workers can lead to increased demand for services supplied by low-skilled workers. The distribution of U.S. jobs is influenced by factors like import competition, technological changes, and economic trends. Manufacturing sector jobs declined due to import competition, while service-sector jobs less affected. The housing boom and bust impacted construction jobs. Part-time work increased from 16.5% to 19.5% of total workers from 2007 to 2017. Part-time work rose from 16.5% to 19.5% of total workers between 2007 and 2010, then decreased to 17% by 2017. Most part-time workers choose this schedule voluntarily. Part-time employment is more common in service occupations. The share of part-time workers varied across occupation groups, with some showing an increase from 2007 to 2017. The share of part-time positions varied across occupation groups from 2007 to 2017. Managers saw a slight increase in part-time positions, while construction and extraction jobs had a significant increase. Workers choose jobs based on skills, experience, and other factors. Employment growth differed among occupations and industries since 2007. The employment outcomes over the past decade vary across worker groups based on educational attainment, age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The employment-population ratio is used to analyze labor market performance by describing the proportion of the adult population in the labor force and their success in obtaining jobs. The employment outcomes over the past decade vary based on educational attainment, with employment opportunities changing for workers with different skill levels. Employment share gains are seen in managerial and professional occupations for those with at least a bachelor's degree, while losses are felt among office support staff and construction/production workers with lower education levels. Greater educational attainment leads to improved employment outcomes, as shown in Figure 8. Workers with higher educational attainment have better employment outcomes compared to those with lower education levels. In 2017, 72% of bachelor's degree holders were employed, while only 42% of those without a high school diploma had jobs. Unemployment rates also vary based on education level, with bachelor's degree holders having lower rates compared to those with lower education levels. Workers with varying education levels experienced job losses during the Great Recession, with the employment-population ratio declining for all groups. Workers with less than a high school diploma came closest to regaining their pre-recession ratio, while those with some college still lagged behind. Young workers aged 16-24 were most affected, with their employment-population ratio dropping sharply and remaining below pre-recession levels. During the Great Recession, the employment-population ratio for young workers aged 16-24 dropped sharply and remained below pre-recession levels at 51%. In contrast, older workers aged 55 and over saw their ratio fall during the recession but rise to about 39% in the subsequent expansion, attributed to a higher share of college-educated workers in this age group. The share of older workers with at least four years of college increased from 24% in 2007 to 30% in 2017, possibly causing some to defer retirement until their financial situations improved. The employment-population ratio for prime-age workers has slowly risen to 78.6% in 2017, still below its prerecession level. Despite a recovered unemployment rate, a lower labor force participation rate explains the difference. Prime-age men were more likely to be employed than women during the 2007 to 2017 period. Prime-age men were more likely to be employed than prime-age women over the 2007 to 2017 period. The employment-population ratios declined during the Great Recession for both sexes. The female ratio fully recovered by July 2018, while the male ratio remained below its prerecession level. The gap in employment rates narrowed over the period. The Great Recession caused a deterioration in the LFPR for both men and women, with a long-term decline in the LFPR for prime-age men. Since 2014, there has been some improvement in the prime-age male LFPR. The prime-age female LFPR declined during the Great Recession but has since improved, reaching the same rate as before the recession in July 2018. However, it remains below its peak in April 2000. The gap between LFPRs for men and women has narrowed since the 1990s, attributed to variations in work-family policies. Since the 1990s, the gap in unemployment rates between prime-age men and women has narrowed. Following the Great Recession, prime-age male unemployment peaked higher than females. Labor force participation losses were larger for men, who were exiting the labor force in large numbers. Women's higher educational attainment and differences in industry and occupation clustering may contribute to the employment outcome disparity since 2007. During the recession, industries like construction and durable goods manufacturing saw significant increases in unemployment rates for men, especially those without a college degree. In contrast, the health and education industry had the lowest unemployment rate. The drop in employment shares for construction workers and production jobs was evident, as well as the loss of office and administrative support positions typically held by women. These patterns highlight the challenging labor market conditions for certain groups of male and female workers. Recent patterns suggest that as construction and manufacturing jobs decline, some men have transitioned into occupations traditionally dominated by women. Employment outcomes vary by race and ethnicity, with non-Hispanic white workers having the highest employment-population ratios and non-Hispanic black workers experiencing sharp losses during the recession. Employment rates declined for Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Asian workers from 2007 to 2011. Non-Hispanic black workers saw a continued decline until 2011 but rebounded faster than other groups. Despite recovery, all groups remained below their pre-recession employment-population ratios in 2017. Differences in employment-population ratios can be attributed to variations in labor force participation and unemployment rates among different racial and ethnic groups. The employment-population ratio varied among different racial and ethnic groups from 2007 to 2017. Non-Hispanic white workers had high labor force participation rates and low unemployment rates, leading to high employment rates. Hispanic and nonwhite workers had similar participation rates but varied unemployment rates, affecting their employment-population ratios. In 2011, non-Hispanic black workers experienced a significant dip in their ratio due to a high unemployment rate. Despite comparable unemployment rates in 2017 to 2007, the labor force participation rate was lower for all groups. Among employed workers, the type of job held varies across ethnic and racial groups. Prime-age Hispanic workers are clustered in lower-paying jobs compared to non-Hispanic workers. For example, a higher percentage of Hispanic workers are in construction and extraction jobs. Among employed workers, Hispanic workers are more likely to hold lower-paying jobs such as construction and extraction (12% versus 4% of non-Hispanic employment). Non-Hispanic workers are more likely to hold management positions, with white and Asian workers having higher shares in management roles compared to black workers. Black workers are more concentrated in office and administrative support jobs and transportation and material moving jobs compared to white and Asian workers. Asian workers have higher employment shares in computer and math sciences and health practitioners and technicians compared to non-Asian workers. Black, white, and Asian workers have different occupational patterns, with black workers more concentrated in lower-paying jobs. The distribution of employment in various occupations may lead to different outcomes for these groups in the future. Administrative and office support jobs, which had a significant share of black employment in 2017, have declined, while computer and math sciences jobs and health practitioners and technicians, which had a considerable share of Asian employment, have increased. The labor market is expected to continue evolving in response to these trends. The labor market from 2007 to 2017 will continue to evolve in response to cyclical and structural developments, creating opportunities and challenges for U.S. workers. The unemployment rate briefly hit its lowest level since 1969 in May 2018, posing challenges for sustaining job growth without a return to recession. The LFPR is still low, suggesting the possibility of bringing more workers into the labor force. The current economic expansion is the second longest on record, but a new recession is inevitable. Certain industries, occupations, and demographic groups will be disproportionately affected by the rise in unemployment. The effects of the next recession could have long-lasting impacts on future earnings and employment. Cultural and demographic changes, along with the aging labor force, have shifted participation rates in the workforce. The participation rate of young workers has declined significantly since 1990, while the rising participation rate of women has reversed since 2001. If these trends continue without offsetting increases, labor supply growth will slow, impacting economic and income growth. Annual labor force growth has decreased over the years, and projections show a continued slow growth rate. Without an increase in the labor force participation rate of older workers, growth rates would be even lower. The labor market is undergoing structural changes, with the share of rural farm households decreasing significantly over the years. Innovations like artificial intelligence and automation may lead to a shift in occupations for workers. Concerns about a \"hollowing out\" of middle-wage jobs exist, especially for less-educated workers. Skill-biased technological change and globalization have sparked these concerns, but full employment has been maintained. The impact of these changes on the labor market is still unfolding, similar to the changes seen in farming over the years. The labor market is experiencing structural changes, with technology and globalization impacting future employment. Policy changes like immigration and trade wars can also influence job composition. Educational attainment will play a role in determining future job opportunities. The U.S. labor force is less dynamic in this expansion, making it harder for workers to adapt to changes and increasing the risk of displacement.
