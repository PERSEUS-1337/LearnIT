    "content": "In recent years, Congress has introduced legislation to allow importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs from cheaper foreign sources to reduce financial burden on U.S. consumers. Current law and proposed bills aim to balance availability and safety of imported drugs, requiring certification from the Secretary of HHS for importation. The MEDS Act of 2000 established a requirement for drug safety, which was later amended by the MMA in 2003. Proposed bills aim to eliminate this requirement and introduce other safeguards for drug safety. Three bill pairs are compared regarding prescription drug importation in current law. Several bills were introduced in 2005 regarding prescription drug importation, including the Vitter-Gutknecht, Gregg-Bradley, and Dorgan-Emerson bills. Senator Dorgan successfully added drug importation provisions as an amendment to the Federal Trade Commission reauthorization bill. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee ordered bill S. 1392 to be reported. Differences in approach across bills include ensuring safety and effectiveness of imported drugs, influencing industry behavior for cost savings to consumers, and administrative arrangements. Various bills propose different requirements for FDA approval of imported drugs. The Dorgan-Emerson bills require notification to the HHS Secretary when an imported drug differs from the FDA-approved version for sale in the U.S. The bills propose extensive information requirements for imported drugs, including whether a supplemental application to the FDA would be needed for differences from U.S. label drugs. The Vitter-Gutknecht bills are the most inclusive, allowing importation from various countries with equivalent regulatory requirements, while the Dorgan-Emerson bills exclude certain countries like Israel and South Africa. The Gregg-Bradley bills propose expanding eligibility for drug importation to include certain European countries and Canada, with a focus on preventing entry of adulterated or counterfeit drugs into the U.S. market. The bills also call for procedures to regulate the registration of exporters or importers. The bills propose procedures for registration of exporters or importers, chain-of-custody documentation, inspections of facilities, laboratory testing of drug samples, packaging, and labeling. Registration requirements include extensive recordkeeping, monitoring, inspections, and fees. Monitoring and testing involve laboratory testing of drug samples to verify content and potency. The proposed bills focus on monitoring the chain of custody for imported drugs, including registration requirements and onsite facility monitoring. Packaging and labeling measures aim to prevent counterfeiting and ensure the integrity of the drug from manufacturing to consumer. The bills also require over-optically variable packaging for all prescription drugs. The proposed bills require prescription drugs to incorporate counterfeit-resistant technologies in packaging and labeling, including over-optically variable features. Electronic track-and-trace technology is mandated at the case and pallet level to monitor the chain of custody. Exporters and importers must mark shipping containers to indicate compliance with registration conditions. The Vitter-Gutknecht, Gregg-Bradley, and Dorgan-Emerson bills address regulations for Internet pharmacies, including registration, prescriptions, and relationship to medical care. The Gregg-Bradley bills propose an extensive statutory and regulatory structure for Internet pharmacies within the FFDCA. The bills for Internet pharmacies require specific professional services, advance notice of commercial shipments, licensing fees, liability for accepting advertising from unlicensed pharmacies, and policies to prevent unlawful payments. The Dorgan-Emerson bills mandate detailed information on pharmacist credentials and contact details on the Internet site. The Vitter-Gutknecht and Dorgan-Emerson bills aim to regulate Internet pharmacies by requiring pharmacist credentials, contact information, and a valid U.S. prescription for drug dispensing. The bills also address the need for a \"qualifying medical relationship\" between the dispenser and the patient. Manufacturer resistance is anticipated if the drug importation section in the FFDCA is initiated. The Vitter-Gutknecht and Dorgan-Emerson bills aim to prevent discrimination against exporters, importers, or distributors of imported prescription drugs by manufacturers. They also prohibit manufacturers from producing drugs for sale in other countries that differ from those made for U.S. distribution to restrict importation. The bills involve the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general and include notification requirements for differences in drug production. The Vitter-Gutknecht and Dorgan-Emerson bills propose changes to the Patent and Trademark Act regarding the importation of prescription drugs. They aim to allow authorized foreign sales by U.S. patent holders to be imported into the United States without regard to the U.S. patent. The bills include provisions for funding importation activities through appropriations and exporter fees. The Gregg-Bradley, Dorgan-Emerson, and Vitter-Gutknecht bills propose fees for exporters and commercial importers to cover the costs of administering drug import provisions. Fees are limited to 1% of the total drug price, with flat and proportional registration fees collected from each exporter and importer. Fees must be used solely for administering the importation provisions added by the bills. The proposed bills outline time frames for drug importation, with varying requirements for commercial and personal use. The Vitter-Gutknecht bills mandate regulations for importation within 180 days, while the Gregg-Bradley bills have different effective dates for personal and commercial importation. The Dorgan-Emerson bills propose importation provisions that would take effect one year after enactment, allowing the importation of qualifying drugs without waiting for regulations to be promulgated. The bills require the Secretary to promulgate a final rule for implementation within one year after an interim rule is issued. Additionally, the importation provisions would permit drugs to be imported from registered exporters 90 days after enactment and from permitted countries by registered importers one year after enactment.
