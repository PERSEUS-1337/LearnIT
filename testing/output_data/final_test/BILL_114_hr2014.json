    "content": "The \"Healthy Kids Outdoors Act of 2015\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Key findings are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that children today are spending less time outdoors, leading to health risks such as the growing obesity crisis. This trend is impacting military readiness, with a significant number of applicants being rejected for being overweight or obese. Research has shown that military children and families are experiencing increased stress and mental challenges due to extended deployments. Military family service organizations lack resources to meet the growing demand for programs that provide positive outdoor experiences. Additionally, outdoor activities contribute to local economies and job creation. Urbanization and changing land use patterns are further limiting outdoor opportunities. Spending time in green spaces outside the home can improve concentration, self-discipline, and reduce stress. Children exposed to greener environments show less aggression and stress. Visitation to public lands has declined, yet connecting with nature in communities is crucial. Spending time outdoors in nature is crucial for fostering the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts. It benefits children's physical, mental, and emotional health, decreases symptoms of ADHD, stimulates brain development, improves motor skills, enhances sleep quality, reduces stress, boosts creativity, uplifts mood, and lowers the risk of myopia. Outdoor play encourages risk-taking, adventure-seeking, self-confidence, and respect for nature, leading to a long-term connection with the natural world. Conservation education and outdoor recreation experiences like camping, hiking, boating, hunting, fishing, and wildlife watching are crucial for engaging young people in nature. Hunters and anglers play a critical role in reconnecting youth with the natural world and fostering a lifelong understanding of conservation. Research shows that hunters who start at a young age are more active and interested in hunting as adults. Parks, recreation, and conservation organizations play a vital role in connecting children and families with nature. It is essential for the next generation to appreciate nature and be prepared to preserve America's natural resources. Service-learning opportunities use the environment as a context for learning. States nationwide lack resources and a comprehensive strategy to engage youth in environmental stewardship. Cross-sector collaboration involving public health, parks, transportation, and other sectors is needed to connect children and families with nature. To increase coordination and implementation of outdoor policy tools and programs for children and families, cross-sector collaboration is essential. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that provides definitions for terms used in the document. In this Act, \"eligible entity\" refers to a State or a consortium from one State that includes municipalities, local entities, schools, and nonprofit organizations. \"Local partners\" are defined as municipalities, local or tribal entities, schools, and nonprofits. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and \"State\" means any of the several states. The term \"State\" in this Act refers to any of the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, any other U.S. territory or possession, or any Indian tribe. SEC. 4. COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT OR IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTHY KIDS OUTDOORS STATE STRATEGIES. The Secretary can issue one cooperative agreement per State to develop a 5-year State strategy called \"Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategy\" to promote outdoor physical activity, especially for children. Applications must be submitted within 120 days of guidelines publication, including a strategy meeting requirements or a proposal for its development. Strategy approval and peer review must occur within 90 days. The Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategy must be approved or recommended for changes through a peer review process within 90 days of submission. Eligible entities must update their strategy every 5 years to continue receiving funding, including impact evaluation methods and lessons learned. The eligible entity must describe how they will promote physical activity in the outdoors through various public systems and partnerships with NGOs, state agencies, and tribal agencies. Collaboration among state agencies is also required for implementing the strategy. The eligible entity must detail how funding will be spent through local planning and implementation subgrants, evaluate the strategy's effectiveness, involve the public in its development, increase visitation to Federal public lands, and leverage private funds for implementation. A Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategy involves providing subgrants to local partners for implementing outdoor recreation and youth mentoring programs, connecting communities, and promoting lifelong participation in outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, and wildlife watching. Implementing programs to connect communities with safe parks, green spaces, and outdoor recreation areas through affordable public transportation and trail systems that encourage physical activity outdoors; school-based programs using outdoor learning environments and service learning to restore natural areas; education programs for parents and caregivers about the health benefits of outdoor activity to combat obesity and improve quality of life for Americans, especially children, youth, and families. The Secretary and recipients must prioritize entities serving individuals with limited access to nature, such as those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, disabled, or facing health challenges. Guidelines for implementing the Act, including strategies, evaluation methods, technical assistance, and dissemination of best practices, must be published within 180 days. The eligible entity receiving funds must report on the implementation of the Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategy, allocate funds with a minimum of 95% for subgrants to local partners, provide a 25% match, and limit administrative expenses to 5%. The National Strategy for Encouraging Americans to be Active Outdoors is outlined in Section 5. The President, in cooperation with federal departments, must develop a national strategy by September 30, 2016, to promote outdoor physical activity for Americans, especially children and families. This strategy includes identifying barriers, policy solutions, partnership opportunities, and coordinating efforts to address the impacts of less outdoor activity on public health. The national strategy aims to address attention deficit disorders, stress, conservation, and the economy. It also includes identifying ongoing research needs, coordinating with Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategies, and developing an action plan at the Federal level. Throughout the process, public participation and consideration of existing Federal plans are encouraged. The national strategy aims to connect Americans, especially children, youth, and families, with the outdoors. The President will update the strategy every 5 years, incorporating evaluation results. The Secretary will develop recommendations for a national study on the health impacts of strategies under the Act, provide technical assistance to grantees, and disseminate best practices. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to carry out the Act includes $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, and $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2018. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other available funds for activities promoting outdoor physical activity."
