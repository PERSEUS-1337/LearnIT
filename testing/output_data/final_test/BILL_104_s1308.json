The Block Grant Performance Standards Act of 1995 aims to enable efficient use of resources, establish accountability for block grant programs, and create partnerships to address public interest issues. It defines block grant programs as federal funds allocated to states and localities for their discretion and requires approved block grant strategic plans for payments. The Block Grant Performance Standards Act of 1995 requires eligible entities to submit and receive approval for a block grant strategic plan before receiving payment. The plan must include goals, objectives, and operational processes for each designated program activity for the first 6 fiscal years. The Block Grant Performance Standards Act of 1995 mandates eligible entities to submit a strategic plan with objectives, performance indicators, and program evaluation for approval within 90 days. Sec. 7326 of the Block Grant Performance Standards Act of 1995 requires entities applying for a block grant to establish a community advisory committee to provide advice on public hearings and receiving feedback from affected communities. The committee's membership should include individuals with leadership experience in business, voluntary organizations, and elected officials from jurisdictions included in the plan. The Block Grant Performance Standards Act of 1995 mandates the establishment of a community advisory committee for block grant applicants. The committee includes elected officials, representatives of qualified organizations, the general public, and community members to enhance local government leadership in plan development. Before submitting applications or reports for approval, the applicant must seek review and comments from the committee. Additionally, agencies administering block grant programs can offer technical assistance to applicants. The Block Grant Performance Standards Act of 1995 requires a community advisory committee for block grant applicants. Agencies can provide technical assistance to applicants for block grants in developing necessary information for plan design or implementation.

Penalties, including fund suspension or reallocation, can be imposed for not meeting plan goals. Sec. 7329 states that the provisions of this subchapter supersede any conflicting laws regarding block grant program administration. Chapter 73 of title 31, United States Code is amended to establish \"CHAPTER 73--ADMINISTERING BLOCK GRANTS\" with sections outlining block grant amounts, purposes, definitions, reporting requirements, and auditing standards. The text outlines the establishment of \"CHAPTER 73--ADMINISTERING BLOCK GRANTS\" in title 31 of the United States Code, covering purposes, definitions, strategic plans, community advisory committees, technical assistance, and administration of block grant programs. Amendments include changing references from \"chapter\" to \"subchapter\" for clarity. The effective date of these changes is specified in Section 4. The Act establishing \"CHAPTER 73--ADMINISTERING BLOCK GRANTS\" in title 31 of the United States Code will take effect on October 1, 1997, applying to payments under block grant programs from that date onwards."
