    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smart Technologies for Communities Act\". Congress finds that congestion on roadways is causing significant problems for Americans, including slowing down commerce, polluting the environment, wasting fuel, and costing billions annually. Additionally, despite a decrease in traffic fatalities, thousands of people are still killed on U.S. roads each year. The economic cost of traffic fatalities and injuries is estimated at $230 billion annually, with the transportation sector contributing one-third of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions. To address these issues, the United States must utilize intelligent transportation systems to improve safety, efficiency, and connectivity in the transportation network. Technology solutions are available to help cities and states reduce congestion, emissions, and improve transportation access. Transitioning to electric and alternative fueled vehicles requires integrating intelligent transportation systems with the Smart Grid. ITS technologies are cost-effective, with solutions like synchronized traffic signals yielding significant returns in time and fuel savings, reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and travel delays. The Government Accountability Office found that a nationwide real-time traffic information system could provide a benefit-cost ratio of 25 to 1, with a $1.2 billion investment returning over $30 billion in safety, mobility, and environmental benefits. Collision avoidance technologies could prevent or reduce the impact of 31% of traffic crashes. Transportation estimates that a comprehensive vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications network could prevent or reduce the impact of 81% of unimpaired vehicle crashes. A national coordinated deployment structure is crucial for ensuring uniform standards and regulations for ITS technologies to optimize capacity and meet system performance goals. Investing in ITS is crucial for effective transportation financing mechanisms, creating jobs and stimulating job creation across multiple sectors. ITS projects allocate 50% of spending to wages and salaries, compared to 20% for new highway construction. Researchers have found that investing in ITS creates a network effect throughout the economy. Investing in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is essential for boosting the economy and creating jobs in various sectors such as green jobs, high-tech, automotive, and information technology. The lack of national investment in ITS has caused the United States to fall behind other global innovation leaders like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. These countries have reaped significant benefits for their citizens and economy through the deployment of transportation technology. Investing in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is crucial for the United States to enhance economic competitiveness and quality of life. Encouraging the development and deployment of ITS solutions can generate significant benefits for citizens, the economy, and the environment. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" which indicates that the following text will provide definitions of terms. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"eligible entity,\" \"ITS,\" and \"multi-jurisdictional group\" in the context of the Smart Communities Technology Initiative. The curr_chunk defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Transportation for the Smart Communities Technology Initiative. The curr_chunk introduces the Smart Communities Technology Initiative under SEC. 4. The Secretary will establish a Smart Communities Technology Initiative to provide grants for pilot programs to deploy ITS for safety, efficiency, and improved transportation performance. Criteria for grant selection include cost reduction, environmental benefits, and operational performance enhancement. The Smart Communities Technology Initiative aims to improve transportation by reducing traffic collisions, increasing safety for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians, utilizing real-time traffic information to reduce congestion, monitoring transportation assets for infrastructure management, and delivering economic benefits through improved system performance and efficient movement of goods and services. The Secretary will request applications for grants within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will request applications for participation in the Smart Communities Technology Initiative within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Smart Communities Technology Initiative will include a grant program. The Smart Communities Technology Initiative grant program requires eligible entities to submit a deployment plan for intelligent transportation systems, including real-time traffic information, advanced traffic management, collision avoidance systems, and transit signal optimization. The Smart Communities Technology Initiative grant program requires eligible entities to submit a deployment plan for intelligent transportation systems, including preferential traffic signals, advanced infrastructure condition assessment technologies, and other technologies to improve system operations. The objectives include reducing traffic-related crashes, congestion, and costs, optimizing system efficiency, and improving access to transportation services. Results should include quantifiable safety, mobility, and environmental benefit projections. Additionally, partnerships with the private sector should be included in the plan. The Smart Communities Technology Initiative grant program requires eligible entities to partner with various stakeholders and leverage existing ITS investments. It also emphasizes interoperability with other transportation systems. The Secretary will award grants to up to 6 entities with funds available for 5 years, ensuring geographic diversity in the selection process. The Secretary will award grants to up to 6 entities over 5 years, ensuring geographic diversity in urban, suburban, and rural areas of the United States. SEC. 6. USES OF FUNDS. A grant recipient can use funds to deploy, operate, and maintain various ITS and ITS-enabled operational strategies, including advanced traveler information systems, transportation system performance data collection, advanced safety systems, integration with the Smart Grid, electronic pricing and tolling systems, and advanced mobility and access technologies. Advanced mobility and access technologies, like dynamic ridesharing and information systems, are supported for elderly and disabled Americans. SEC. 7. REPORTS. Each grant recipient must submit a report to the Secretary annually, detailing deployment and operational costs, benefits, savings, and meeting original expectations. This includes data on reducing traffic crashes, congestion, costs, improving transportation system performance, and the effectiveness of real-time information. The Secretary shall submit a report to Congress describing the effectiveness of grant recipients in meeting their deployment plan, including data on reducing traffic-related fatalities, congestion, emissions, and improving travel time reliability. The Secretary may redistribute remaining funds to eligible entities for pilot programs if a grant recipient fails to meet grant requirements. This aims to improve transportation reliability, reduce emissions, optimize system performance, enhance access to alternatives, and provide real-time travel information for informed decisions, resulting in cost savings and other benefits for transportation users and the public. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Funding of $100,000,000 to $200,000,000 annually from 2012 to 2017 is authorized from the Highway Trust Fund for this Act. The funds can be used without transferability or obligation limitations and remain available until expended. The Secretary can award up to 25% of the funds to a single grant recipient. Grant recipients can use up to 5% of the grant award for planning and reporting. The Secretary can allocate $3,000,000 each year for program reporting, evaluation, and administrative costs before awarding grants."
