    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act\". Congress finds that it is crucial for national security to secure reliable energy sources, with the United States heavily reliant on foreign oil, much of which comes from OPEC countries. These countries' oil revenues fund terrorism and anti-American propaganda, allowing them to manipulate US policy. The United States faces a growing dependence on foreign oil, with projections showing a 33 percent increase over the next 20 years. A 10-cent increase in gasoline prices could lead to an additional $18 billion outflow to oil-exporting nations. To safeguard economic and national security interests, the US should reduce reliance on nations that do not align with its values. The State of Israel has been a close ally of the United States since 1948, sharing democratic values and cooperating on projects like the Arrow Missile for mutual security benefits. Their special relationship is evident in jointly-funded scientific research programs. The United States and Israel have jointly funded scientific research programs like the BSF, BARD, and BIRD Foundations, leading to significant breakthroughs in various fields. In 1996, a key agreement was signed between the two countries. Infrastructure Gonen Segev signed an Agreement Between the Department of Energy of the United States and the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure of Israel Concerning Energy Cooperation, establishing a framework for collaboration in energy research and development activities. Israeli scientists are known for their expertise in alternative renewable energy sources, with top corporations recognizing Israel's technological and scientific capabilities by locating research facilities there. Israeli researchers have made significant technological breakthroughs in the field of alternative, renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources include the development of a cathode using hexavalent iron salts for rechargeable batteries, a technique to increase solar energy efficiency for hydrogen generation, and a novel membrane for direct-oxidant fuel cells. Collaboration between the United States and Israel in alternative renewable energy research and development is emphasized. Collaboration in the field of alternative renewable energy research and development between the United States and Israel is mutually beneficial. The grant program is established.

Recoupment for awarded grants will be proportional to the Federal share of project costs and derived from royalties or licensing fees. The Secretary may waive or defer recoupment requirements based on commercial competitiveness. The Secretary may accept private funds for the project and will utilize the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs. Recipients of grants must submit a report within 180 days, detailing fund usage and project success evaluation. The International Energy Advisory Board is established. The International Energy Advisory Board, established in the Department of Energy, advises the Secretary on grant criteria, total grant amounts, and membership composition including 2 Israeli citizens. The International Energy Advisory Board in the Department of Energy advises the Secretary on grant criteria, total grant amounts, and membership composition, including 2 Israeli citizens. The Advisory Board members are appointed by the Secretary of Energy, with 2 Israeli citizens appointed after consultation with Israeli officials. Initial appointments must be made within 60 days of the Act's enactment, each member serves a 4-year term, vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and members serve without pay but receive travel expenses.

The curr_chunk defines terms like \"eligible project\" and \"Secretary\" related to cooperation between the US and Israel on alternative energy projects. The grant program and Advisory Board will end after a 7-year period from the enactment of the Act. The Secretary can spend up to $20,000,000 annually from 2006 to 2012 for this Act. The Act's Constitutional authority is based on Congress's power to regulate commerce with foreign nations."
