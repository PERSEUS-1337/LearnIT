    "content": "The Children's Financial Security Act of 1996 may be cited as the Act. Federal contributions to child retirement accounts are addressed in the Act. The Children's Financial Security Act of 1996, also known as the Act, mandates the transfer of $1,000 from the general fund of the Treasury to the Child Retirement Account of eligible children under the age of 6 at the end of each calendar year. Eligible children are defined as U.S. citizens or resident aliens. Contributions may be reduced for children of high-income parents. If the excess amount for a taxable year exceeds the threshold, the $1,000 contribution to a child's retirement account will be reduced proportionally. The taxpayer can make up for the reduced contribution by transferring an equivalent amount to the child's account. For children below age 19 at the time of enactment, specific provisions apply. The Child Retirement Account allows taxpayers to contribute up to $6,000 or $1,000 multiplied by the child's age in 1996, for children under age 19 who are US citizens or resident aliens. Contributions can only be made in 1997 and 1998. High-income parents may have reduced contribution limits based on their adjusted gross income for the taxable year ending in 1997. For the taxable year ending in 1997, if a taxpayer's income exceeds the threshold amount, the calculated amount for the individual will be reduced based on the excess income ratio to the phaseout range. The phaseout range is $50,000 for joint returns, $33,000 for unmarried individuals, and $25,000 for married individuals filing separately. The threshold amount is $100,000 for joint returns. For the taxable year, the phaseout range is $67,000 for unmarried individuals and $50,000 for married individuals filing separately. The term \"applicable taxpayer\" refers to the taxpayer eligible for a deduction for the child or the child itself. SEC. 3. CHILD RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. This section adds a new part to the Internal Revenue Code regarding Child Retirement Accounts. Child Retirement Account refers to a trust in the US for the exclusive benefit of the account beneficiary. Contributions must be in cash and limited to specific amounts per year. A Child Retirement Account is a trust in the US for the exclusive benefit of the account beneficiary. Contributions must be in cash and limited to specific amounts per year. The assets of the trust are invested only in an approved mutual fund. The account is exempt from taxation unless it has ceased to be a Child Retirement Account, subject to taxes on unrelated business income. Rules similar to section 408(e) apply to account terminations. Paragraphs (2) and (4) of section 408(e) apply to Child Retirement Accounts, except paragraph (4) does not apply to qualified special purpose distributions. Distributions from a Child Retirement Account are subject to a 20% tax withholding, not included in gross income, and a credit is given for withheld amounts on qualified special purpose loan distributions that are repaid. The tax credit for a qualified special purpose distribution from a Child Retirement Account in the form of a loan is based on the amount repaid during the taxable year. If a distribution is not used for qualified purposes, a penalty may apply. The tax penalty for a non-qualified distribution from an account is 50% of the distribution amount. Qualified distributions include those made after age 59 1/2, to beneficiaries after the account holder's death, for disability reasons, or as a qualified special purpose distribution. A qualified special purpose distribution from a Child Retirement Account can be a qualified first-time homebuyer distribution or for qualified higher education expenses of the account beneficiary. Non-qualified distributions incur a 50% tax penalty. Qualified first-time homebuyer distributions are payments used for qualified acquisition costs for a first-time homebuyer's principal residence. Qualified acquisition costs for first-time homebuyers include the costs of acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a residence, along with settlement, financing, and closing costs. A first-time homebuyer is defined as an individual who had no ownership interest in a principal residence in the 3-year period before acquiring their current residence. The term 'principal residence' in this paragraph refers to the same meaning as in section 1034. The term 'date of acquisition' is defined as the date when a binding contract is entered into to acquire or construct a principal residence. Qualified higher education expenses are defined for this subsection. The term 'qualified higher education expenses' includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and living expenses while attending an eligible educational institution. These expenses are reduced by any amount according to savings bond provisions. Approved Mutual Fund is defined as any fund of a regulated investment company with an election under section 851(b)(1) in effect and designated by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. Trustee-to-trustee transfers from one Child Retirement Account to another are exempt from withholding tax and penalty. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board may designate a fund if at least 75 percent of its assets are equity securities. Certain rules apply, such as time of contributions and community property laws. The Secretary can require reports from the trustee of a Child Retirement Account.
