Generational accounting is an economic analysis that calculates the projected present value lifetime net Federal tax burden for each adult generation over 18 years old, as well as the tax burdens for current and future generations. Generational accounting calculates the present value lifetime net Federal tax burdens for current and future generations, covering future discretionary spending and debt payments. Generational accounting calculates the lifetime net Federal tax burden for generations 18 years and under, increasing with year of birth at the projected growth rate of labor productivity. The net Federal tax burden is defined as the difference between Federal taxes paid and transfer payments received. The Congressional Budget Office and the Comptroller General are required to produce annual fiscal gap and generational accounting analyses as part of their respective long-term budget and fiscal outlook reports.

The Federal tax burden is calculated for each living adult generation and current/future generations under 18 years old, covering future discretionary spending and debt payments. The lifetime net Federal tax burdens for living adult generations over 18 years old and generations 18 years old and under increase with year of birth at the projected growth rate of labor productivity.
