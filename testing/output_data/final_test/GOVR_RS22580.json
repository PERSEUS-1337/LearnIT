    "content": "The House Resolution 6 renamed several committees, including changing the names of the Committee on Education and the Workforce to the Committee on Education and Labor, the Committee on International Relations to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Resources to the Committee on Natural Resources, the Committee on Government Reform to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the Committee on Science to the Committee on Science and Technology. Additionally, the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence was updated to reflect changes in the intelligence community. The jurisdiction of the Committee on Small Business was reaffirmed to include the Small Business Administration and its programs, as well as small business matters related to the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Other programs and initiatives addressing small businesses were also mentioned. A memorandum of understanding between the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure regarding the Federal Emergency Management Agency and port security was inserted in the Congressional Record. House Rule X, clause 5(d) was waived for three committees, allowing the Armed Services Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee, and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to have more than the usual five subcommittees. The Rules Committee authorized the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to conduct depositions with an oath requirement and equitable treatment for the minority. Record votes during committee consideration could be published in reports and online. The Rules Committee report was protected from a point of order if filed without a complete list of record votes. Committees of jurisdiction must publish lists of earmarks, tax benefits, and tariff benefits in reported bills, amendments, or conference reports coming to the House floor."
