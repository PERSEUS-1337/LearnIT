    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Monument Creation and Protection Act\" or the \"National Monument CAP Act.\" It limits the size and clarifies eligible objects for national monuments. The National Monument Creation and Protection Act, also known as the National Monument CAP Act, amends Section 320301 of title 54, United States Code. It limits the size of national monuments to 640 acres, clarifies eligible objects as \"object or objects of antiquity,\" and outlines limitations for proper care and management. The National Monument Creation and Protection Act limits the size of national monuments to 640 acres and specifies criteria for exceptions based on acreage and proximity to other monuments. The National Monument Creation and Protection Act limits monument size to 640 acres, with exceptions for monuments between 5,000 and 10,000 acres located at least 50 miles from other monuments. These larger monuments require an environmental assessment or impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act. The National Monument Creation and Protection Act limits monument size to 640 acres, with exceptions for monuments between 5,000 and 10,000 acres located at least 50 miles from other monuments. The designation of a national monument between 10,000 and 85,000 acres requires approval from elected governing bodies and officials within the state boundaries where the monument will be located. The National Monument Creation and Protection Act allows for emergency designation of a national monument to prevent imminent harm to antiquities. The designation lasts for one year and can only be done once for a specific piece of land. The President has the authority to reduce the size of national monuments declared under the National Monument Creation and Protection Act. Reductions of 85,000 acres or less can be done without additional approvals, while reductions of more than 85,000 acres require approval from various governing bodies. After the President reduces the size of national monuments, approval is required from the legislature and Governor of the State where the monument is located. The National Environmental Policy Act must also be reviewed by the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture. Non-federally owned property cannot be included in the monument without the owners' written consent. No declaration under this section can increase federal funds. Water rights associated with a declaration must be acquired according to state laws. Definitions for \"declaration\" and \"declared\" only include creating or expanding a national monument. The term 'object or objects of antiquity' includes relics, artifacts, skeletal remains, fossils, and certain old buildings. It excludes natural features and objects not made by humans. The term 'object or objects of antiquity' includes relics, artifacts, fossils, and skeletal remains."
