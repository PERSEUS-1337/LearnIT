The Senate also passed the bill with a recommended level of $15.8 billion. A House-Senate conference agreement set the funding level at $18.8 billion, which was signed into law by President Clinton on October 11, 2000. The FY2001 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill (H.R. 4578) was signed into law on October 11, 2000. It includes funding for agencies in four federal departments, with a total budget of $16.32 billion. Title I covers the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Insular Affairs, while Title II includes the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture and research programs of the Department of Energy. The FY2001 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill (H.R. 4578) was signed into law on October 11, 2000, with a total budget of $16.32 billion. Title II includes various agencies such as the Smithsonian Institution, National Gallery of Art, and the National Endowment for the Arts. President Clinton's FY2001 budget request for Interior and Related Agencies was $16.49 billion, an increase of $1.41 billion from FY2000. The FY2001 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill had a total budget of $16.32 billion, with significant increases in various agencies like the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Forest Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service. The Clinton Administration requested $1.4 billion for the Lands Legacy Initiative in FY2001. The FY2001 Interior Appropriations bill includes $236 million for the U.S. Forest Service and $14.6 billion for the Department of Interior, with increases for National Park Operations and Bureau of Land Management. Controversial issues include funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service's Endangered Species program and the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities. The FY2001 Interior Appropriations bill includes funding increases for various agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, National Wildlife Refuges, Indian Health Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and weatherization grants. It also provides $350 million for emergency wildland firefighting. Major reductions include cuts for the Forest Service, land acquisition, and new construction for land management agencies. The bill was marked up by the House Appropriations Committee on May 25, 2000, with no changes to the funding levels adopted at the Subcommittee level. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up the FY2001 Interior bill with recommended funding levels higher than the House-passed mark. The Senate passed the bill with a recommended total budget authority of $15.8 billion, providing increases for agencies such as the Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of Energy, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Geological Survey. The Senate passed a bill with a total budget authority of $15.8 billion for FY2001, providing increases for agencies such as the Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of Energy, Fish and Wildlife Service, Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, and Smithsonian. Additionally, there were increases for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. A House-Senate conference agreed to a funding level of $18.8 billion, including $1.8 billion in emergency and supplemental funding. The conference report (H.Rept. 106-914) included supplemental funding of $300 million for firefighting and restoration of areas damaged by Western wildfires. It also implemented a modified version of the President's Lands Legacy Initiative over 6 years, with funding starting at $1.6 billion in FY2001 and rising to $2.4 billion in FY2006. Significant increases were provided for the Indian Health Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs programs, Energy Conservation programs, and Bureau of Land Management Operations. The House and Senate approved the conference report, which was signed by President Clinton as H.R. 4578. The Senate passed H.R. 4578 on October 5, 2000, with a vote of 83-13, and President Clinton signed it into law on October 11, 2000. Department of the Interior and Related Agencies appropriations increased from $11.7 billion in FY1991 to $14.9 billion in FY2000. Adjusting for inflation, Interior appropriations remained flat during this period. The Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 reduced FY1996 budget authority to $12.54 billion. The Department of the Interior and Related Agencies appropriations increased from $11.7 billion in FY1991 to $14.9 billion in FY2000. The Bureau of Land Management manages approximately 264 million acres of public land for various uses. For more information on the DOI budget and performance, visit their website at http://www.doi.gov. The Bureau of Land Management manages 264 million acres of public land for various uses, including mining, energy development, grazing, timber harvesting, recreation, wildlife habitat, and preservation. The agency also oversees federal mineral leases and operations on an additional 300 million acres, as well as wildfire control on 388 million acres. The conference agreement allocates $1.67 billion for the BLM in FY2001, with a significant increase for wildland fire management. Title I of the measure includes $625.5 million for wildland fire management, with an additional $353.7 million emergency supplemental appropriation for BLM. This totals $979.2 million for fire fighting on Interior Department lands, covering preparedness, suppression, rehabilitation, and fuel reduction. The increase in funds is in response to the severe 2000 fire season, aiming to improve preparedness, expand treatment programs, stabilize burned areas, and assist communities. Title I also allocates $709.7 million for land and resource management, with an extra $17.2 million emergency appropriation in Title V. Title V includes an additional $17.2 million emergency supplemental appropriation, bringing the total to $726.9 million. Title VIII also provides $25 million for BLM deferred maintenance needs. The funding level in the conference agreement surpasses the House and Senate approved amounts, as well as the figures for FY2000 and FY2001. The funds support various BLM land programs such as protection, improvement, development, and administration. Increases are allocated for managing noxious weeds, threatened species, conservation areas, historic trails, land use plans, and wild horses and burros. The President had requested widespread increases in funding. The conference agreement includes $200 million for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT), higher than previous amounts approved by the House and Senate. The PILT program compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions. Additionally, $104.3 million is allocated for the Oregon and California (O&C) Grant Lands, following the Senate's approval. The conference agreement includes $104.3 million for the Oregon and California (O&C) Grant Lands, higher than the House's approved amount. This funding is used for management, protection, and development of timber resources on 3 million acres of land. The increase sought by the President is mainly for conducting species surveys before offering timber for sale under the Northwest Forest Plan. Additionally, $31.1 million is allocated for land acquisition in the conference agreement. The joint explanatory statement identifies $130 million in additional funding for land acquisition for DOI agencies, with $19.0 million initially approved by the House and $10.6 million by the Senate, below the President's request of $60.9 million. The conference agreement includes $16.9 million for construction, exceeding the initial House and Senate approvals and the President's request for FY2001. The conference agreement for FY2001 includes funding for various construction projects like a science center in Utah, a visitor facility in Alaska, and administrative buildings in Wyoming and Nevada. It also allocates funds for hazardous materials, range improvements, trust funds, and service charges. The agreement does not address national monuments, a controversial issue in Interior funding. The Senate debated a bill that would allow agencies to use funds for planning and managing national monuments created by the President since 1999. An amendment to prohibit the President from creating or expanding national monuments without congressional approval was narrowly defeated. The Senate debated a bill regarding the authority to create national monuments, with opponents arguing against limiting presidential power. Section 332 of the conference agreement restricts funds for implementing the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project until a report is submitted evaluating the impact of wildfires in 2000. The conference agreement includes provisions limiting the use of funds for issuing decisions related to the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project unless evaluations on small businesses are completed. It also contains a provision on grazing permits and leases, automatically renewing them until the renewal process is completed under applicable laws. The renewal process for grazing permits and leases is completed under applicable laws and regulations. The terms and conditions in the expiring permit or lease would continue until the renewal process is finished. There was a Senate floor amendment to strike this section, but it was defeated. The provision allows for the renewal of permits and leases, with the possibility of changing terms and conditions during the renewal process to address heavy agency workload. The Senate-passed bill aimed to address delays in processing grazing permits and leases up for renewal, which threatened ranchers' bank loans. The Administration opposed the bill, citing concerns about possible detrimental terms or conditions in the permits. Additionally, the conference agreement included a moratorium on accepting and processing mining and mill site claims on federal lands filed before September 30, 1994. Applications meeting certain requirements filed on or before September 30, 1994, would be allowed to proceed, with third-party contractors authorized to process mineral examinations. The conference agreement prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from using funds to revise hardrock mining regulations, except to make changes consistent with NRC recommendations and law. This clarifies congressional intent regarding the FY2000 Interior appropriations law. The FY2000 language allows BLM regulations to address subjects beyond NRC recommendations if not contradicted. The committee disagrees with the Solicitor's opinion, limiting the Secretary to publishing final regulations on NRC-recommended subjects. Funding for FWS increased to $964.1 million, with Resource Management as the largest line item. For more information on BLM, visit http://www.blm.gov/. The FY2000 language allows BLM regulations to address subjects beyond NRC recommendations if not contradicted. Funding for FWS increased to $964.1 million, with Resource Management as the largest line item. The Endangered Species Program funding increased to $776.6 million, with a strict limit on funding for the listing function. The law includes language making listing decisions a zero-sum game at a fiscal level, impacting the listing of species and critical habitats. FWS supported this change to protect other program budgets. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund funding was proposed to increase to $65 million, but the Conference agreement only increased it to $26.9 million. The Administration proposed $10.0 million for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund. The FY2000 law provided $10.74 million for payments to local governments affected by federal land presence, with the Conference agreement approving $11.4 million. Controversy arises due to small land additions to the National Wildlife Refuge System, leading to calls for increased appropriations. PILT payments benefit counties with refuge lands, but acquired lands are not eligible. The President's proposal includes increasing land acquisition for the National Wildlife Refuge System from $50.5 million to $111.6 million. The Administration's proposals cover areas in Arizona, the lower Mississippi Delta, southern Florida, Hawaii, Maine, parts of the Lewis and Clark Trail, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Conference approved areas in multiple states with a total funding of $62.8 million, a 24.4% increase from the previous year. The Conference report approved a total funding of $62.8 million, a 24.4% increase from the previous year. The provision on California lands was not included in the conference report, and the House prohibition on establishing a new National Wildlife Refuge in the Kankakee River watershed was retained. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund funding was set at $2.5 million, lower than the President's request of $3.0 million. Funding in Title VIII will be directed towards existing or newly created FWS programs. Title VIII funding will be directed towards existing or newly created FWS programs, including land acquisition, endangered species conservation, wetlands conservation, state wildlife grants, and infrastructure improvement. This amounts to between $173 million and $303 million for FWS, bringing the total funding to between $1.0349 and $1.1649 billion. For more information on the Fish and Wildlife Service, visit http://www.fws.gov/. The National Park Service manages 379 units in the National Park System. The National Park Service manages 379 diverse units in the National Park System, covering over 83 million acres in the U.S. and territories. The mission is to protect and preserve the parks for public enjoyment. Annual park visits total nearly 290 million, with a focus on serving visitors while safeguarding natural and cultural resources. The National Park Service faces challenges in balancing the protection of parks with increasing visitation and limited budgets. Congress has restricted funding while expanding management responsibilities, leading to a backlog of deferred maintenance. However, there is now a higher priority on spending for the NPS, following public support for increased funding after temporary closures during a government shutdown in the late 1990s. The National Park Service has seen increased funding since FY1996, with the Administration requesting $2.04 billion in FY2001 to operate and protect parks. The House and Senate proposed $1.81 billion for FY2001, with the final conference agreement providing $1.94 billion in total NPS spending. The conference agreement provided $1.94 billion in total NPS spending, including additional funds for maintenance and infrastructure improvements through the Land Conservation, Preservation, and Infrastructure Improvement program (LCPII). Congressional overseers emphasized the importance of sound financial management practices for the National Park System. The FY2001 budget request for the National Park Service included $50 million for maintenance, $20 million for UPARR, and a portion of $229 million for land acquisition. Park Operations accounted for $1.38 billion, covering resource protection, visitor services, and park programs. An increase of $25.4 million was proposed to address specific needs at 77 park units, focusing on parks with severe threats to resources and high priority maintenance needs. The Senate proposed an increase of $25.5 million above base operations. The House and Senate-passed bills proposed $2 million for high priority projects within the NPS operations budget for the Youth Conservation Corps. The House-passed bill proposed $1.43 billion for NPS operations, $138 million more than FY2000 enacted. The Senate-passed bill proposed $1.37 billion for NPS operations, $80 million more than FY2000 enacted. The conference agreement provided $1.39 billion for NPS operations, $25.4 million above FY2000 enacted. Maintenance funding under the NPS operations line item was set at $469.7 million in the conference agreement. An FY2001 request of $48.6 million was proposed for National Recreation and Preservation. The FY2001 request for National Recreation and Preservation was $48.6 million, with additional funding for Urban Park and Recreation Recovery grants. The House proposed $48 million, the Senate proposed $61.2 million, and the final agreement allocated $58.4 million, including $297.5 million for NPS Land Acquisition and State Assistance. The FY2001 request for NPS Land Acquisition and State Assistance was $297.5 million, a significant increase from the previous year. The House proposed $104 million, the Senate proposed $87.1 million, and the final agreement allocated $110.5 million for land acquisition and state assistance. Additionally, the NPS will receive a portion of the new $229 million LCPII funding. The budget request seeks $18 million for the Natural Resources Challenge program within the NPS, aiming to identify and contain environmental hazards and regulate off-highway vehicle use, overflights, and watercraft activities. In FY2000, the administration requested $19.76 million for the program, with Congress approving $14.74 million. An amendment to block restrictions on snowmobile use in national parks was withdrawn during Senate Committee consideration. During a conference, language was offered to delay NPS enforcement of snowmobile limits, but it was quickly withdrawn due to veto probability. The Park System faces a significant maintenance backlog, with over $35 billion in assets that require upkeep to prevent deterioration. Congressional efforts have been made to address the multibillion dollar backlog of unmet maintenance needs in national parks. The FY2000 budget proposal aims to prioritize maintenance in national parks over a five-year period, with a focus on critical health and safety needs. Proposed funding for Construction and Major Maintenance programs for FY2001 is $180 million, representing a decrease of $46.2 million compared to FY2000. Additional funding from the Operations component and revenues from the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program are expected to help reduce the maintenance backlog. The Congress has increased construction appropriations for member projects near the end of the appropriations process. In a hearing, members warned the National Park Service Director not to underestimate maintenance needs, expecting \"Fee-Demo\" revenues to cover the shortfall. They emphasized using Fee-Demo funds to supplement, not replace, maintenance funds to reduce the backlog. Park Service officials agreed to provide an updated estimate of the maintenance backlog within two weeks. The National Park Service agreed to provide an updated estimate of the maintenance backlog within two weeks of a hearing. They reported a current maintenance backlog figure of $4.3 billion. The conference agreement required a comprehensive listing of deferred maintenance costs by April 2001. The House proposed $141 million for construction and maintenance, while the Senate proposed $204.5 million. The final agreement allocated $242.2 million for construction, including member \"earmarks.\" The agreement allocated $242.2 million for construction, including $2.2 million for Glen Echo park facilities. The Recreational Fee Demonstration Program allows higher entrance fees, with most fees retained by the collecting unit. Participants include NPS, BLM, FWS, and Forest Service. The Fee-Demo program participants include BLM, FWS, and the Forest Service, with supporters wanting the Corp of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation included. Interior Department agencies and the Forest Service collected $88 million in fees in FY1996, projected to increase to $185.65 million in FY2001. The Park Service is projected to bring in the most fee money at $148.4 million in FY2001. The Administration requested Congress to make the program permanent, but action was deferred to address perceived problems, extending the program for one more year. The Fee-Demo program was extended for one more year, with draft legislation circulating to further extend it through September 30, 2004. The Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program received $2 million in FY2000, the first new funding in five years. The program helps economically distressed urban governments rehabilitate various facilities. The Administration requested $4 million for UPARR in FY2000, but neither the House nor the Senate Appropriations Committee bills included funding for the program. The Appropriations Committee bills recommended focusing NPS funding increases on reducing operational shortfalls and maintenance backlogs. An amendment restored $4 million for the UPARR program, with the Senate voting $1.5 million. The FY2001 request for UPARR was $20 million, a significant $18 million increase. The House and Senate bills provided $2 million each for UPARR, included in the National Recreation and Preservation line item. The Senate-passed bill provided $2 million for the UPARR program, while the conference agreement allocated $10 million in a separate account. An additional $20 million from Title VIII brought the total UPARR funding to $30 million, a $28 million increase from the previous year. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA) proposed $125 million annually for UPARR, while the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 expedited funding for the program. The National Park Service underwent management reforms and concessions policy changes under the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998. Additionally, National Park roads received increased funding under the surface transportation law. For more information, visit http://www.nps.gov/. The Historic Preservation fund, administered by the National Park Service, provides grants to states for historic preservation. The Historic Preservation fund, administered by the National Park Service, provides grants to states, local governments, outlying areas, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Indian Tribes for preservation activities. The FY2001 budget request included $72.07 million for the fund, with $42.07 million for grants-in-aid and $30 million for the \"Save America's Treasures\" initiative to preserve nationally significant artifacts. Treasures grants are provided to preserve nationally significant intellectual and cultural artifacts, historic structures, monuments, historic sites, collections, artwork, documents, and more. The FY1999 appropriation was used for various restoration projects, including the Star Spangled Banner and the Declaration of Independence. The program faced criticism for lacking geographic diversity in grants. The FY2001 budget included $7.9 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities for preservation of historic buildings on their campuses. Funds from P.L.104-333 were earmarked for preservation projects at several Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, and Mississippi. Grants were awarded for repairs on HBCU buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Places. An appropriation of $7.9 million for FY2001 was allocated to fulfill this obligation. The House-reported FY2001 Interior Appropriations bill would have provided $41.3 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, $30.7 million below the enacted level for FY2000. The FY2001 Interior Appropriations bill included funding for state historic preservation offices, tribal grants, and historically black colleges and universities. The House bill directed funds for repair of historic buildings at Selma University. The Senate bill proposed a decrease in funding for the Historic Preservation Fund and an increase in Grants-in-Aid to States program. Funding for Save America's Treasures was not included in the House bill. The FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act allocated $94.3 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, including $15 million for a new Land Conservation, Preservation, and Infrastructure Improvement program. Funding was also restored for Save America's Treasures, Historically Black colleges, Tribal grants, and State Historic Preservation Offices. Projects like the Rosa Parks were designated to receive funding. The FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act allocated $94.3 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, including $15 million for Save America's Treasures projects like the Rosa Parks Museum and the Mark Twain House. Additional project recommendations require approval by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, with a 50% cost share and no single project receiving more than one grant. Last year's Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided funding for Historically Black Colleges restoration, tribal grants, state historic preservation offices, and Save America's Treasures, but no longer includes federal funding for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, chartered by Congress in 1949, aims to protect and preserve historic American sites without federal funding since FY1998. It offers financial assistance programs like the Preservation Services Fund and National Preservation Loan Fund to support preservation projects. The U.S. Geological Survey is the primary science agency providing information on natural hazards and the environment. The US Geological Survey (USGS) is the federal government's main mapping agency and provides data on natural hazards, the environment, and energy, mineral, water, and biological sciences. It focuses on providing scientific information and tools to assist managers and policymakers in the Department of the Interior, with research priorities determined through consultation with land and wildlife management bureaus. The Administration requested a significant budget increase of $82 million for the U.S. Geological Survey in FY2001, the largest in USGS history. This was intended to expand core programs for understanding Earth's ecosystems and provide information for decision-makers. The budget also included $18 million for uncontrollable costs like salary increases and decreased funding for projects nearing completion or lower priority projects. In FY2001, the USGS budget request included increases for six activities under Surveys, Investigations, and Research. The House approved $816.68 million, a decrease from the request but an increase from FY2000. The Senate approved $847.60 million, a decrease from the request. In FY2001, the USGS budget for Surveys, Investigations, and Research was $847.60 million, a decrease from the budget request but an increase from the FY2000 enacted level. The Committee of Conference recommended $862.05 million, a decrease from the FY2001 budget request but an increase from the FY2000 enacted level. Notable increases were proposed for the National Mapping Program activity to fund partnership arrangements with State and local governments and for USGS management of the LANDSAT-7 mission. The House approved $122.82 million for the National Mapping Program, a decrease from the budget request. The Senate approved $126.71 million, including increases for the National Atlas and geospatial data production. The Committee of Conference recommended and Congress approved $128.71 million for the National Mapping Program, which included increases for uncontrollable costs, the national atlas, Landsat operations, and a decrease for hyperspectral remote sensing. In the Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activity, the Administration requested $224.81 million for modernization of seismograph and strong motion detector networks in various cities. The House approved $211.27 million for Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes, a decrease from the budget request. The Senate approved $218.52 million for the program. The focus is on upgrading hazards monitoring networks and conducting quality hazards-related research. The Senate approved $218.52 million for the Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes program, which included increases for seismographic equipment, volcano hazards work, and geologic mapping. Restorations were made for various programs, and Congress approved $220.82 million for the program, focusing on upgrading hazards monitoring networks and conducting quality research. The Administration requested funding increases for various programs including $4.30 million for uncontrollable costs, $1.0 million for earthquake hazards, $250,000 for the Hawaiian volcano program, $1.53 million for minerals at risk, $475,000 for Yukon Flats geology surveys, $1.20 million for the Nevada gold study, $500,000 for geologic mapping, and $300,000 for Lake Mead/Mojave research. Additionally, $197.58 million was requested for Water Resources Investigations, with major increases proposed for hydrologic networks and real-time hazard analysis to enhance flood forecasting capabilities. The House approved $187.95 million for Water Resources Investigations, a decrease from the budget request. The Senate approved $196.66 million, including increases for stream gauging stations, groundwater studies, investigations on toxic materials, and water resource protection. The Committee of Conference recommended $197.16 million for Water Resources Investigations, with increases for uncontrollable costs, real-time hazards, toxic studies in Lake Champlain and Hawaii, ground water programs, and aquifer studies in Southern Maryland. Restorations totaling $6.39 million were entered for the Toxic Substances Hydrology program, Hydrologic Research and Development, and Hydrologic Networks and Analysis. The Administration requested $158.78 million for Biological Research, an increase of $21.89 million from the previous year. The increase would support research on Interior science priorities, including fish and wildlife disease and West Nile encephalitis virus. The House approved $140.42 million for Biological Research, a decrease of $18.37 million. The House approved $140.42 million for Biological Research, a decrease from the budget request but an increase from the previous year. The Senate approved $147.77 million, with additional funding for Science Centers and Cooperative Research Units. The conferees recommended $157.92 million for Biological Research, which was $858,000 under the budget request but $21.03 million above the FY2000 enacted level. Increases included funding for uncontrollable costs, cooperative research units, a Yukon River chum salmon study, science center funding, ballast water research, sea otter research, National Biological Information Infrastructure, and the Mark Twain National Forest mining study. The USGS budget presentation for FY2001 included Science Support at $70.90 million and Facilities at $88.04 million. The House approved $67.10 million for Science Support, while the Senate approved $69.90 million. Both activities showed small increases over FY2000 levels, mostly due to uncontrollable costs and technical adjustments. The Senate approved $69.90 million for Science Support, $1.0 million below the budget request but $2.79 million above the FY2000 enacted level. Congress approved $68.90 million for Science Support, $2.0 million under the budget request but $1.79 million above the FY2000 enacted level. The House approved $87.12 million for Facilities, a decrease from the budget request but $1.5 million above the FY2000 enacted level. The Senate approved $88.04 million for Facilities, meeting the budget request and $2.42 million above the FY2000 enacted level. The Leetown, West Virginia, Science Center received $920,000 for engineering and design work for an expansion. Congress approved $88.54 million for Facilities, $500,000 above the budget request. In Title VIII, Part A, the USGS received an additional $20.0 million for science programs, including funding for national mapping, water resources, and biological research. The USGS received an additional $20.0 million for science programs, including funding for national mapping, water resources, and biological research under the new Title VIII. This funding falls under the \"State and Other Conservation programs\" category and supports various USGS programs such as State Planning Partnership programs, Community/Federal Information Partnership, Urban Dynamics, and Decision Support for Resource Management. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) administers programs for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management. The Royalty Management Program ensures timely collection of revenues from mineral leases on federal and Indian lands. MMS anticipates collecting $6.0 billion in revenues in FY2001 from offshore and onshore federal leases. Revenues are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. The Administration's FY2001 request of $247.7 million for the Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management Program includes $6.1 million for oil spill research. The request is $7.4 million more than the FY2000 appropriation, with total appropriations increasing by $23.9 million. Offsets would decrease by $17 million, with an additional $10 million in user fees requested. The net amount of the administration's request is $140.2 million for FY2001. Leasing activity in the Gulf of Mexico has significantly declined from its FY1997 peak. Activity in the Gulf of Mexico has declined from its peak in FY1997 and is expected to remain flat in FY2001. The House approved funding for the Minerals Management Service at $133.3 million, while the Senate approved $140.1 million, closer to the Administration's request. Reported discrepancies in royalty valuation continue to be an issue, with the Administration claiming the U.S. Treasury is being underpaid by at least $60 million annually. MMS's final rule change for crude oil valuation is also a concern. For more information, visit http://www.mms.gov/. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) final rule change for crude oil valuation, implemented in March 2000, aimed to reflect fair market value by relying less on posted prices and more on an index price. Industry officials criticized the use of index prices as a benchmark and suggested alternative options. The MMS had a comment period for industry and congressional input, with ongoing concerns about the duty to market requirement. Industry representatives advocate for the royalty in kind (RIK) approach, allowing MMS to receive royalties in the form of oil produced. In the Senate FY2000 Interior appropriations bill, there was a debate over the valuation methods. In the Senate FY2000 Interior appropriations bill (S. 1292), a debate ensued over the implementation of the new oil valuation rule. Senator Domenici's amendment postponed the rule until June 30, 2001, while Senator Hutchison's amendment extended the moratorium through FY2000. A filibuster by Senator Boxer delayed the bill until a cloture vote limited debate. The Senate ultimately voted to extend the moratorium for up to six months pending a review by the General Accounting Office. The President threatened to veto the bill over the moratorium, but negotiators agreed on implementing the rule. Negotiators settled on implementing the new oil valuation rule on March 15, 2000, enacted into law in P.L. 106-113. An MMS RIK Feasibility Study found RIK could generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury. A pilot study on RIK process began in 1998, including natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, oil production in Wyoming, and Texas offshore natural gas. The House supported using MMS revenues for the RIK pilot program, but a floor amendment limited the use of funds for transportation and processing only. During FY1996, the OCS moratorium on leasing activity was debated and extended through FY1999. Legislation (P.L. 104-185) authorized states to collect royalties from federal oil and gas leases. MMS functions could be delegated to states, including reporting production and royalties. The moratoria was supported in FY2000, FY2001 spending bills, and previous appropriations since the early 1980s. In previous appropriations since the early 1980s, the moratoria on OCS leasing activity has been supported annually by Congress without extensive discussion. President Bush issued a directive in 1990 banning OCS leasing activity in areas other than Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. The moratoria only apply to environmentally sensitive areas, with little hydrocarbon production occurring in these regions. Lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico have declined recently, with robust sales in FY1996 and FY1997. The OCS leasing activities in the Gulf of Mexico have seen fluctuating results over the years. Record-breaking sales in FY1996 and FY1997 generated over $2.4 billion in bonuses. The Western Gulf auction in August 1997 set a new record with $680 million in bonuses, but the number of tracts leased decreased significantly in 1999. Despite this, deepwater oil and gas production has doubled between 1996 and 1999 due to advancements in technology and public policy, making the Gulf of Mexico a significant player in global drilling operations. The MMS proposes to increase efforts in environmental issues related to deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) was established to ensure mined land for coal is restored to its pre-mining condition. OSM oversees state regulatory programs to enforce minimum standards. The Administration's request for OSM for FY2001 is under consideration. The Administration's request for the Office of Surface Mining for FY2001 is $309.2 million, an increase of $17.5 million from FY2000. The increase is mainly for accelerating abandoned mine land reclamation. The request includes $98.0 million for Regulation and Technology programs and $211.2 million from the AML fund. Funding for Regulation and Technology programs is up by $2.2 million from FY2000. The AML request reflects a $15.3 million increase over adjusted FY2000 levels, with funding for the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative proposed to increase to $10 million in FY2001. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $197.9 million for AML, including $8 for ACSI, with an additional $2 million for anthracite mine issues in Pennsylvania. Funding for AML activities is based on states' coal production levels, with \"minimum program states\" receiving at least $2 million. Despite objections, Congress has allocated $1.5 million to these states since FY1996, while the Administration proposed restoring funding to $2 million for FY2001. The House Committee retained the $1.5 million level in its recommendation. The House Committee recommended $295.6 million for the Office of Surface Mining, with the Senate proposing $302.5 million. The conferees approved $303.5 million for OSM, including $202.4 million from the AML fund. The total recommended by the conferees was $1 million more than the Senate and nearly $8 million more than the House. For more information on OSM, visit its website. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides various services to federally recognized tribes and their members, including government operations, law enforcement, education, and economic development. The BIA's FY2000 direct appropriations were $1.869 billion, with a proposed increase to $2.2 billion for FY2001. This includes a 17.8% increase over FY2000, with a focus on Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA). For more information, visit http://www.osmre.gov/osm.htm. The FY2001 proposal included increases in Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA), BIA school operations, aid under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, and total BIA construction. Additionally, there was a proposed increase for the Indian country law enforcement initiative. The House approved $1.881 billion for FY2001 BIA direct appropriations, a 0.6% increase. The House approved $1.881 billion for FY2001 BIA direct appropriations, with increases in TPA, BIA school operations, aid under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, and a decrease in total BIA construction. The Senate approved $2.086 billion, with similar increases in TPA, BIA school operations, and aid. The conference committee approved $2.141 billion for FY2001 BIA direct appropriations, with increases in TPA, BIA school operations, aid under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, Indian country law enforcement initiative, and total BIA construction. The BIA received $2.141 billion for FY2001, with increases in various areas including education construction. Key issues include tribal influence on BIA programs, reorganization, funding distribution, trust asset management, law enforcement, and school building repairs. Tribal control over federal Indian programs has been a goal since the 1970s, with contracting under the Indian Self-Determination Act being a key aspect. In FY2000, tribes had increased control over BIA programs through various mechanisms like BIA programs under the Indian Self-Determination Act, tribal compacting under the Self-Governance program, and Tribal Priority Allocations. TPA accounted for a significant portion of BIA's operation of Indian programs and direct appropriations. Contract support costs funded non-operational and overhead costs for tribes administering programs under self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts. Issues surrounding contract support costs include consistent shortfall in appropriations, tribes' claim for full funding, programs included in funding base, and rate-setting methods. A 1997 court decision confirmed federal responsibility for unpaid costs from FY1989-1993, leading to a $82 million settlement. Congress prohibited BIA funds from FY1994-FY2000 to pay these costs, resulting in payment from the federal Judgment Fund with potential reimbursement by BIA and IHS. In FY2001, a Senate provision urged addressing these issues. The Senate urged the Secretary of the Interior to secure repayment to the fund from agencies other than the BIA and IHS. Congress imposed a one-year moratorium on self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts for FY1999 to address contract support costs. The GAO recommended funding methods and a standard policy. The moratorium was dropped for FY2000, restored for FY2001 by the House but dropped again by the Senate and conference committee. The BIA faced pressure to reorganize under the Clinton Administration's initiative, but proposals from tribes, administration, and Congress did not align. Despite plans for restructuring and downsizing, the Interior solicitor advised against the \"tribal shares\" process. Congress pushed for reorganization and consolidation plans, leading to a reduction in BIA agencies and employees. Congress approved a 1999 study of BIA administration by NAPA, highlighting the need for improvements in staffing, planning, budgeting, and resource management. Funding was allocated for BIA reorganization based on NAPA recommendations, with continued support in FY2001. The issue of equitable funding distribution, known as \"means-testing,\" was also addressed. The distribution of BIA funding, known as \"means-testing,\" involves two aspects: how funds are distributed and whether a tribe's non-BIA resources are considered. While most BIA funding is not distributed based on a national formula, tribes' own resources, like business revenues, may not always be taken into account. A 1998 GAO study found that TPA funds were distributed based on historical levels and varied widely per capita across BIA areas. Supporters of \"means-testing\" argue that funding distribution is inequitable, with poorer tribes not receiving enough support. Tribes claim BIA funding is inequitably distributed, with poorer tribes not receiving adequate support. Opponents argue that almost all tribes are in poverty and means-testing TPA funding would penalize tribes with severe needs. Congress debated proposals for reallocating TPA funding during FY1998-FY2001 appropriation bills. For FY1998-FY1999, a tribal-federal workgroup on TPA allocations and tribal needs assessment was authorized. The BIA/tribal workgroup's report in July 1999 highlighted challenges in distributing TPA funding equitably due to varying tribal circumstances. Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to redistribute TPA funds in FY2000 to address funding inequities, with a limit of 10% reduction for any tribe. Funding for BIA's post-secondary institutions was also based on a formula. The House and Senate retained provisions for FY2001, including post-secondary education funding. The conference committee also approved a provision transferring TPA funds from Alaska Native tribes with fewer than 25 members to regional non-profit corporations. The BIA and Office of Special Trustee are working on trust fund management reforms. Trust asset management involves various functions such as real estate services, transaction processing, surveys, and probate functions. The BIA contracted a private developer for a new trust asset and accounting management system (TAAMS), which was initially prohibited from deployment until meeting requirements. Law enforcement in Indian country faced challenges, leading to proposed initiatives for improvement in FY1999. The Administration proposed an initiative for law enforcement in Indian country for FY1999, with funds flowing through BIA and Department of Justice. This initiative aimed to provide additional law officers, police facilities, equipment, and jails. BIA funding focuses on ongoing operation and improvement of reservation law enforcement functions, while Justice funds go towards one-time improvement grants and construction of detention facilities. Additionally, BIA operates 185 schools with many old and dilapidated facilities, estimating an $802 million backlog in education facility repairs. The Administration proposed a 74% increase in education facility construction funding for FY2000, and another large increase for FY2001. The FY2001 BIA education construction budget includes a proposed school construction bond initiative to address the backlog in school construction. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the school bonding initiative until tax credit provisions are enacted. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not discuss the tribal bonding initiative. The Senate more than doubled BIA education construction funding, with a recommendation for even higher funding from the conference committee. Additionally, a $7 million funding recommendation was made for a new tribal school construction demonstration project, where a tribe and the BIA would each pay 50% of the replacement cost for a tribally-controlled school. Other Indian issues in congressional consideration include state taxation in Indian country, tribal sovereign immunity, and state-tribal gaming compact regulations. Past proposals to restrict land trust acquisitions for tribes and waive tribal immunity for TPA funds have been defeated by Congress. In 1998, controversial Indian gaming regulations were proposed by the Secretary, delayed by Congress until FY1999, and challenged in court by several states in April 1999. Congress considered prohibiting FY2000 funds for the regulations but dropped the provision after assurance from the Interior Secretary. In FY2001, the House defeated an amendment to prohibit the regulations, while the Senate approved a prohibition on funding for publication of necessary procedures. The conference committee eventually dropped the issue. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) oversees tribal regulation of bingo and gaming operations. It was established in 1988 and receives funding through fee assessments on tribes' operations. The FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act increased the amount of assessment fees the NIGC may collect. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) oversees tribal regulation of bingo and gaming operations, funded through fee assessments. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians, authorized by the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, manages Indian trust assets and funds. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians manages Indian trust funds, which were transferred from the BIA to the OST in 1996 due to inadequate management. The FY2001 budget proposal includes $82.63 million for trust programs and $12.5 million for the Indian land consolidation pilot project. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians manages Indian trust funds, including tribal funds and land consolidation. The FY2001 budget includes $91.63 million for federal trust programs and $9 million for land consolidation. Additionally, emergency supplemental appropriations of $27.6 million were recommended for trust fund reform and litigation costs. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians manages Indian trust funds, including tribal funds and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. There are 315 tribes with a total asset value of $2.6 billion and 287,000 IIM accounts with a total asset value of $480 million. A class-action suit was filed in 1996 against the federal government on behalf of all IIM account owners. The class-action suit filed in 1996 against the federal government on behalf of all IIM account owners sought an accounting of funds, establishment of management systems, and restitution for any lost money. The case was certified as a class action in February 1997. The Interior and Treasury departments were held in contempt of court in 1999 for failing to produce trust records. The trial in June 1999 found government mismanagement of IIM accounts, leading to a court order for system improvements. The government mismanaged the IIM accounts, leading to a court order for system improvements. The Department of Justice appealed the ruling in January 2000. $16.9 million was provided for emergency appropriations to address breaches of trust and prepare for trial. The OST submitted a Strategic Plan in April 1997 recommending the creation of a new agency for trust funds and assets. In response to mismanagement of IIM accounts, a Strategic Plan was proposed in April 1997 for a new agency to manage trust funds and assets. Congress directed the OST to focus on trust fund system improvements and settlement of financial claims before implementing the new agency. The Secretary of the Interior agreed to implement aspects of the Strategic Plan in August 1997, leading to a reorganization of the OST in January 1999. The Secretary ordered a reorganization of the OST in January 1999, creating a principal deputy special trustee. The Special Trustee, Paul Homan, resigned in protest. The FY1999 emergency supplemental appropriations bill did not include a provision prohibiting the reorganization, but expressed concern about the implementation of trust fund reform. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) receives funding from permanent and indefinite appropriations as well as discretionary and current mandatory funding. The FY2001 budget request for OIA is $324.6 million, an 8% increase from FY2000. Permanent and indefinite appropriations for FY2001 total $230.2 million, making up 71% of the OIA budget. The FY2001 permanent and indefinite appropriations for the Office of Insular Affairs total $230.2 million, with allocations to various divisions including the Virgin Islands, Guam, and three freely associated states. The amount exceeds previous years' funding and comprises roughly one-third of federal assistance to insular areas. The FY2001 funding request for the Office of Insular Affairs is $94.4 million, with the House approving $90.2 million and the Senate approving $89 million. Conferees settled on $96.2 million, including funds for technical assistance, representing a 6.3% increase over FY2000. A key issue is the allocation to mitigate the effects of immigration from the freely associated states, known as \"Compact impact.\" Advocates argue for assistance to Guam and other islands to handle the population influx from non-citizens relocating in search of job opportunities. Legislation reallocates funds for Compact impact needs, including hospital construction and social services. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee have rejected a $5.4 million increase in funding for Guam. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee rejected a $5.4 million increase in funding for Guam, arguing that funding levels for Compact impact aid should be determined during ongoing renegotiations. Instead, the House approved $7.6 million for technical assistance grants to implement financial and government reforms in the territories. The Senate committee recommended $6.6 million for the same purpose, citing concerns over the insular governments' financial condition. Despite past economic development initiatives, these entities still rely on federal assistance. The FY2001 budget request includes an advance appropriation of $10 million for the Virgin Islands, contingent on meeting financial controls and performance standards. American Samoa is set to receive a $19 million loan for economic development, to be repaid from the tobacco settlement agreement. Progress made by American Samoa in FY2000 led to the release of construction funds withheld in FY1999. Funding for brown tree snake control on Pacific islands is sought for FY2001. The Administration seeks to continue funding in FY2001 for brown treesnake control at the $2.35 million level approved for FY2000. Some Members of Congress have concerns about labor conditions and immigration laws in the CNMI, as well as support for extending federal minimum wage laws to the territory. Legislation was approved by the Senate on February 7, 2000, to restructure United States immigration policy as it applies to the CNMI.

The conference agreed to Forest Service appropriations for FY2001 of $3.612 billion, including emergency contingency funds for pest management and Wildland Fire Management. This is significantly more than what was passed by the House and Senate, as well as the Administration's request. The biggest change was in funding for wildland fire management, with a significant increase compared to previous years. The conference agreement for Forest Service appropriations in FY2001 allocated $3.612 billion, which is $557 million more than FY2000 and $495 million more than requested. This includes significant increases for fire preparedness, fire operations, and emergency appropriations. Additionally, Title IV of the agreement provided $619 million for wildfire programs, with allocations for fire suppression, reducing hazardous fuels, emergency rehabilitation, nonfederal fire assistance, and assistance to nonfederal entities affected by fire. Emergency supplemental appropriations were also included for wildfire management and disaster relief. The conference agreement for Forest Service appropriations in FY2001 allocated $3.612 billion, with increases for fire preparedness, fire operations, and emergency appropriations. State and Private Forestry received $251 million, $48 million more than FY2000. The National Forest System was funded at $1.281 billion, $133 million more than FY2000. All accounts were increased from FY2000 and either matched the higher of the House or the Senate, or exceeded both. The Forest Service appropriations for FY2001 allocated $3.612 billion, with increases for fire preparedness, operations, and emergency funding. State and Private Forestry received $251 million, $48 million more than FY2000. The National Forest System was funded at $1.281 billion, $133 million more than FY2000. Forest Service capital improvement and maintenance were set at $469 million, exceeding both the House and Senate allocations. Land acquisition from the Land and Water Conservation Fund was passed at $102 million, significantly higher than the House and Senate allocations. The Administration proposed a new budget structure for the Forest Service. The agency proposed changes to the budget structure, including consolidating budget line items for the National Forest System and Reconstruction and Maintenance. The House, Senate, and conference agreed to these modifications, reducing the National Forest System to 10 line items and combining certain operations under 'vegetation and watershed management.' The U.S. Forest Service proposed changes to its budget structure, including consolidating budget line items for the National Forest System and renaming 'reconstruction and construction' as 'capital improvements and maintenance.' The agency's budget request also included performance measures to inform Congress on appropriations. Concerns were raised about the agency's lack of strong performance measurement and evaluation. Timber sales, especially salvage timber related to forest health, have been a topic of debate in Forest Service budget and legislation. The FY2001 budget request proposes declines in salvage sales with dead and dying trees, new green sales, and sales under the Timber Sales Pipeline Restoration Fund. Despite the proposed decrease, total sale levels for FY2001 are higher than FY1999. The House and Senate express disappointment in the agency's failure to meet timber sale targets. Amendments to reallocate funds for fish and wildlife management and wildland fire management were defeated. The Senate and conference included $5 million for timber sales preparation in Alaska's national forests, emphasizing forest health and fire prevention. Debate on increasing timber sales' impact on forest health occurred, but no actions were taken. A provision was adopted after the Cerro Grande fire to halt prescribed burning until agencies implement all necessary measures. The Senate adopted a provision halting prescribed burning until agencies implement all measures. Senator Domenici's substitute passed, providing funds to reduce hazardous fuels in urban wildland interface areas and requiring reports on projects. The Administration proposed a new program in Managing the. The Administration proposed adding $1.6 billion to the FY2001 request for wildfire operations, fuels treatment, fire preparedness, and programs to assist local communities on BLM and Forest Service lands. The conference increased funding under Titles II and IV, and added provisions for expedited NEPA review procedures and Endangered Species Act consultations for hazardous fuel reduction and burned area treatments. Management of federal lands has been controversial for decades. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 were enacted to guide land management planning for national forests and BLM lands. Despite efforts to improve planning processes, bills have not been enacted to address issues such as forest health. The House and Senate bills aimed to continue management under existing plans but were met with challenges. Additionally, there were concerns about completing the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Plan. The Forest Service proposed new planning regulations emphasizing ecosystem management and biological diversity protection. The public comment period on these regulations is closed, and draft regulations are being revised. Forest Roads in national forests are controversial due to concerns about environmental degradation and corporate subsidies. Supporters argue that access roads are necessary for forest protection and timber harvesting. The budget structure change combines construction and maintenance funds, making it difficult to distinguish money for road construction. The Administration proposed a decrease in road funding, which was increased by the House and Senate. The House and Senate increased road funding by $10 million (+5%) and $17 million more (+8%) than the House, and $7 million more (+3%) than the Senate. The Administration announced a new approach to managing roadless areas, with a draft environmental impact statement released in May 2000. The Senate bill included a section to prohibit funding for roadless areas in the White Mountain National Forest. Senator Craig announced an amendment related to forest service funding on the Senate floor, which was debated but replaced by a substitute for additional funds for hazardous fuel treatment. The FY2001 Forest Service budget request includes proposals to change trust funds, with legislation passed in the House and pending in the Senate. A new trust fund, Healthy Investments in Rural Environments (HIRE), is being developed to address maintenance backlog and forest health projects. The FY2001 Forest Service budget request includes proposals for new trust funds for land acquisition and facility enhancement. Legislation for these funds has not been made available yet. Additionally, a new Title VI to the bill, the Cabin User Fee Fairness Act of 2000, was included in the conference report. The Cabin User Fee Fairness Act of 2000 proposes to keep the fee at 5% of the lot's market value, adjusted annually based on changes in land values. It also includes specific standards for appraisals and a right for cabin owners to a second appraisal. For more information on the Department of Energy, visit http://www.doe.gov/. The Clinton Administration's FY2001 budget request for fossil fuel research and development (R&D) focused on environmental issues related to electric power, particularly global climate change concerns. The Clean Coal Technology Program faced funding deferrals and rescissions totaling $326 million in FY2001. DOE anticipated that 32 out of its 40 active projects would be completed by the end of the fiscal year. Overall, the Administration's FY2001 request for fossil energy was $375.6 million, a 5% decline from the FY2000 appropriation. Funding for coal and power R&D projects would decrease by 8.8%, petroleum R&D by 8.2%, and natural gas R&D would increase by 22.6%. The House Committee supported funding at $410.5 million for FY2001 for fossil fuel R&D programs. The House approved a reduction in fossil energy R&D funding by $45 million to $365.4 million, while the Senate approved $401.3 million with a transfer of unobligated balances. The conference bill funded fossil energy R&D at $433.7 million for FY2001, focusing on new technology utilizing natural gas as a clean fuel. Critics question the narrow view of coal's potential for electric generation. The Administration's narrow view of coal's potential for electric generation and technology exports is being questioned for its impact on jobs and the economy. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, established in 1975, stores over 570 million barrels of crude oil in caverns in Louisiana and Texas for emergency use in case of oil supply interruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, established in 1975, stores over 570 million barrels of crude oil in caverns in Louisiana and Texas for emergency use in case of oil supply interruptions. Funding for the program has varied over the years, with appropriations ranging from $160.1 million in FY1999 to $157 million in FY2000 and FY2001. The Senate also recommended an additional $4 million for the establishment of a home heating oil reserve in the northeast. Maintenance and upgrades to the SPR facilities have been funded through sales of SPR oil. The Senate agreed to transfer $12 million from unobligated funds in the SPR petroleum account for oil technology research. They recommended $165 million for funding the regional heating oil reserve, including a $4 million transfer from the Petroleum Acquisition Account. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 authorized the sale of the federal interest in the Elk Hills oil field to Occidental Petroleum Corporation for $3.65 billion. The Department of Energy transferred most of two Naval Oil Shale Reserves to the Department of the Interior, leaving two small oil fields in California and Wyoming generating revenue. DOE proposed returning 84,000 acres, including an undeveloped oil shale reserve, to the Ute tribe. Congress did not appropriate new funds for FY2000, with expenses funded from a carryover balance. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a $7 million recission in carryover balances. In settlement of a dispute, the California Teachers' Retirement Fund will receive 9% of the sale of Elk Hills. The California Teachers' Retirement Fund is set to receive 9% of the sale proceeds from Elk Hills as \"school lands.\" The agreement between DOE and California included five annual payments of $36 million starting in FY1999, with the remaining balance to be paid in equal installments in FY2004 and FY2005. However, for FY2000, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no appropriations to the school lands fund due to \"fiscal constraints.\" The House Appropriations Committee provided for the second $36 million installment, but the Senate did not restore the cut funds. The conferees authorized the next payment to be made on October 1, 2000, effectively delaying it to FY2001. This was enacted into law, with an additional $36 million payment approved for October 1, 2001. The Administration requested and the House approved a payment to be made on October 1, 2001. The Senate and conferees also agreed. The Clinton Administration emphasizes energy efficiency and renewable energy for curbing air pollution and climate change, as well as boosting economic growth. The FY2001 budget request for the Department of Energy reflects this strategy. For more information on Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves, visit http://www.fe.doe.gov/nposr/index.html. The Administration's FY2001 request for DOE's Energy Efficiency Program aims to increase funding to $848.5 million, a 22% rise from FY2000. This includes $659.5 million for research and development programs, with increases allocated to various sectors such as Buildings Research, Federal Energy Management, Industry, and Transportation Programs. The FY2001 request for DOE's Energy Efficiency Program includes increases in funding for various programs, such as $18.1 million more for Transportation Programs and $3.5 million more for Policy and Management. The request also includes $191.0 million for grants programs, with a significant increase for the Weatherization Program. The House, Senate, and Conference Committee approved different funding amounts, with the final approved amount being $814.9 million for FY2001, representing a 13% increase from FY2000. The FY2001 DOE Energy Efficiency Program budget saw an increase of $94.7 million, with varying changes in funding for different sectors. The Conference appropriation resulted in a decrease of $33.6 million compared to the request, with reductions in funding for Community Partnerships and Energy Star Programs. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides health care services to approximately 1.49 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through federal, tribal, and urban Indian operated programs and facilities. IHS operates in 37 hospitals, 58 health centers, 4 school health centers, and 44 health stations. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates in 37 hospitals, 58 health centers, 4 school health centers, and 44 health stations. Additionally, tribes and tribal groups operate 12 hospitals, 160 health centers, 3 school health centers, and 236 health stations. IHS funding is divided into Indian Health Services and Indian Health Facilities, covering various healthcare programs and facility maintenance. The Indian Health Service (IHS) program is funded through federal appropriations and reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. For FY2001, IHS is estimated to collect $404.6 million in reimbursements. The FY 2001 appropriation level approved is $2.605 billion, with $2.241 billion allocated for health services and $364 million for health facilities. The population served by IHS has higher illness and mortality rates compared to other U.S. populations, although improvements have been seen in areas like infant and maternal mortality. In recent years, Indian Health Service (IHS) has seen increases in mortality rates for conditions like diabetes, accidents, and other health issues. Despite a per capita health spending of $1,397 in FY1997, compared to the U.S. average of $3,900, there has been a 27% increase in the population eligible for IHS services since 1990. Funding for the program has not kept pace with the growing population and inflation, leading to decreased access to healthcare for American Indians and Alaskan Natives. The Indian Health Service (IHS) has faced challenges with increasing mortality rates and inadequate funding. Despite a per capita health spending of $1,397 in FY1997, there has been a 27% increase in the population eligible for IHS services since 1990. In FY2001, the Conference approved a funding level of $2.241 billion for the health services program, including $1.770 billion for clinical services, $96 million for preventive health programs, and $375 million for other health services. This includes basic primary care, dental services, mental health services, and substance abuse treatment. Contract health services received $446.8 million for services not provided by IHS. Preventive health services funding for FY 2001 is $96 million, including public health nursing, health education, immunizations, and a community health representatives program. Other health services are funded at $375 million, covering contract support costs, direct operation costs, scholarships, and support for off-reservation urban centers. Total funding for the Indian Health Service program in FY2001 is $2.241 billion. The conferees allocated funding for various programs within the Indian Health Service for FY 2001, including preventive health services, other health services, and support for the Self-Governance Demonstration Project. They also addressed the issue of contract support costs and requested a report on strengthening the podiatric care program. The conferees allocated funding for various programs within the Indian Health Service for FY 2001, including contract support costs under the Indian Self-Determination Act. Congress aims to distribute funds fairly to ensure underfunded tribes receive equitable levels of support. $249 million was provided, with $10 million designated for new contracts and compacts. The report requires IHS to report to appropriations committees before finalizing any policy on fund distribution. The Conference agreement approved $364 million for health care facilities in FY 2001, including $122 million for facilities and environmental health support. An additional $94 million was allocated for personnel costs and construction of sanitation systems for housing provided by BIA, with $86 million for other purposes. The agreement approved $86 million for major construction projects, including hospitals, a health clinic, and staff quarters in various locations. $46 million was allocated for maintenance and improvements, and $16 million for medical equipment. For more information, visit the Department of Health and Human Services: Indian Health Service website at http://www.ihs.gov/. For details on the GAO report on Contract Support Costs, visit http://www.gao.gov/. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was reauthorized for FY1995-2000 by P.L. 104-301 due to a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over land partitioned in 1974. Most relocatees are Navajo, with some families still needing to complete relocation. Visit http://www.gao.gov/ for more information. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-301) approved a proposed settlement agreement between the United States, the Hopi Tribe, and Navajo families. Some Navajo families are still on Hopi partitioned land, with negotiations ongoing for replacement housing. Opposition to the agreements and leases remains. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 resolved some issues, but opposition to the agreements and leases remains strong among Navajo families. Most families on Hopi-partitioned land signed accommodation agreements by September 1999. The Hopi Tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against Navajo families without leases, but a proviso in the FY2001 Interior appropriations bill prevents ONHIR from evicting Navajo families without providing replacement homes. The settlement agreement allows the Hopi Tribe to take quiet-possession actions against the United States if Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land have not relocated or entered into leases. Congress has shown concern over slow relocation and low interest in moving to new lands. ONHIR received $8 million in appropriations for FY2000 and the administration proposed $15 million for FY2001, which was approved by the Senate and conference committee. The Senate and conference committee approved $15 million for FY2001 for federal government support for arts and culture programs and agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution with its 16 museums and galleries. The overarching issue is whether federal support is appropriate and what shape it should take. The Smithsonian Institution, with its 16 museums and galleries, is estimated to be 71% federally funded. In addition to federal appropriations, it also has private trust funds from contributions and revenues from business ventures. In FY1999, private contributions totaled $61 million and sales from business ventures totaled $144 million. The largest single private donation was $60 million for the NASM's Dulles Center, with an additional $20 million cash gift for the renovation of the Natural History Museum. A $20 million gift was given for the renovation of the Natural History Museum. The FY2001 Clinton Administration budget would have provided $463 million to the Smithsonian, with $396.8 million for Salaries and Expenses. No funds were requested for the construction of the National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall. The NMAI was initially controversial, with opponents arguing for renovation of existing museums instead. The National Museum of the American Indian received private donations totaling $36.7 million, with $15 million coming directly from the Indian community. The FY2000 Interior appropriations provided $19 million for construction. The FY2001 budget included $62.2 million for Smithsonian building repairs and alterations. The Smithsonian Institution's public space includes the National Museum of Natural History, American Art and Portrait Gallery, Castle building, and Arts and Industries building. Funding for repair and renewal has not kept pace, with a need for $50 million annually for the next decade. The National Zoo also requires $10 million per year for the next 5 years. The FY2001 budget requested $62.2 million for repair and renovation of Smithsonian buildings. The FY2001 budget included $52.2 million for repair and renovation of Smithsonian buildings, $10 million for the National Zoo, and advance appropriations of $17 million and $18 million for specific projects. The House-reported and House-passed FY2001 Interior appropriations bill allocated a total of $423.1 million for the Smithsonian, with $375.2 million for Salaries and Expenses. The FY2001 budget included a $4 million increase for Salaries and Expenses, with $2 million allocated for the National Museum of the American Indian collections move and $2 million for the Air and Space Museum's collections move. The Senate-passed bill would provide a total of $449.9 million for the Smithsonian, including $387.8 million for Salaries and Expenses, with $47.1 million for collections acquisition. The FY2001 budget allocated $47.1 million for collections acquisition, Museum Support Center equipment, exhibition reinstallation, National Museum of the American Indian, repatriation of skeletal remains program, Latino programming, and Council of American Overseas Research funding. The Senate-passed bill provided $57.6 million for facility repair and $4.5 million for construction. According to P.L. 106-291, the Smithsonian will receive $454.9 million for salaries, expenses, facility repair, and construction. The FY2001 budget allocated $47.1 million for collections acquisition, Museum Support Center equipment, exhibition reinstallation, National Museum of the American Indian, repatriation of skeletal remains program, Latino programming, and Council of American Overseas Research funding. The Senate-passed bill provided $57.6 million for facility repair and $4.5 million for construction. The Smithsonian indicated a 5-year strategic plan to increase and diversify visitor audience, particularly in rural communities hosting exhibitions through SITES program. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, including the NEA, NEH, and IMLS, has been operating on temporary authority since 1993. The 104th Congress established the IMLS under P.L. 104-208. The debate over federal funding for arts and humanities, including the NEA and NEH, questions the government's role in supporting cultural programs. Opponents argue for abolishing federal support, stating that culture can thrive through private funding. Proponents highlight the long tradition of federal support for the arts and argue that private sector support cannot fill the gap left by the loss of federal funds. Abolishing NEA and NEH could impact programs of national significance. The President's Committee on the Arts recommends restoring federal funding for NEA, NEH, and IMLS to adequate levels. The Administration's FY2001 budget proposed $150 million for the NEA, including a Challenge America program for arts access and education. State arts agencies would receive 40% of the funds, benefiting over 1,000 communities nationwide. The FY2001 budget proposed $150 million for NEH, with $107.8 million for grant programs in humanities education, research, preservation, and public programming. $12.5 million was allocated for Challenge Grants and $4 million for regional humanities centers. For IMLS, the budget included $33.4 million, with $15.5 million for General Operating Support for museums and the development of Museums Online. The OMS supports museum/school partnerships to bring educational and cultural significance to communities and schools, reaching over 20 million people. The House-reported FY2001 Interior Appropriations bill provided funding for NEA, NEH, and OMS at similar levels to FY2000. Representative Dicks introduced amendments to increase funding for NEA and NEH, but they failed. Rep. Dicks also motioned to increase funding by $15 million in the FY2001 Interior Appropriations bill. Rep. Dicks motioned to increase funding for NEA, NEH, and OMS in the FY2001 Interior Appropriations bill, but his motion failed. Amendments by Rep. Stearns and Rep. Slaughter were also unsuccessful. Rep. Slaughter's amendment to defer $22 million in clean coal technology funding for NEA, NEH, and OMS was later redirected to the Indian Health Service by Rep. Nethercutt. The House-passed appropriations for FY2001 did not change from the House-reported version, with $98 million for NEA, $115.3 million for NEH, and $24.3 million for OMS. The Senate-reported bill included increases for NEA, NEH, and OMS. The final appropriations act provided $98 million for NEA, $120.3 million for NEH, and $24.9 million for OMS. The House-passed appropriations for FY2001 remained the same as the Senate-passed amount. An additional $7 million was allocated for the Challenge America Arts Fund for arts education and community arts activities in rural and underserved areas. Previous controversies over questionable NEA grants resurface during congressional appropriations discussions. No NEA projects have been deemed obscene by the courts, with a federal appeals court ruling the \"general standards of decency\" clause unconstitutional. The NEA eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline, except for Literature fellowships, Jazz masters, and National Heritage fellowships. The Supreme Court reversed a federal appeals court decision, stating that the NEA can consider general standards of decency when judging grants. Congress enacted NEA reform measures in the FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act, including increases in funding allocations to states and under served populations. The legislation placed a 15% cap on NEA funds allocated to each state, exempting grants with a national impact. Three members from each chamber were added to the National Council on the Arts, reducing its size from 26 to 20 members. Both NEA and NEH were authorized to solicit and invest funds. In the 106th Congress, an amendment to increase NEA and NEH funding by $10 million each was rejected, as well as an amendment to reduce NEA funding by $2 million. During the consideration of H.R. 2466 in September 1999, the Senate adopted amendments to increase NEA appropriation to $103 million and NEH to $115.7 million. A Senate amendment to eliminate NEA funding was defeated. The final FY2000 appropriation for NEA was reduced to $98 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided $97.6 million for NEA, $115.3 million for NEH, and $24.3 million for OMS after an across-the-board rescission of .38% in discretionary spending.

The Lands Legacy Initiative, reintroduced by the Clinton Administration in the FY2001 budget proposal, would provide $1.4 billion in funding to 21 resource protection programs. Majority of the funding would support U.S. Forest Service activities under Title II of the Interior Appropriations. This initiative was initially announced on January 12, 1999, and proposed in the FY2000 budget submission. The Administration proposed $1.4 billion in funding for 21 resource protection programs in the FY2001 budget. Congress provided $727 million, with no new legislative language suggested for FY2000 and FY2001. The FY2001 proposal added 3 programs and deleted 3 programs. Bills for increased funding for resource protection activities have been introduced in both chambers. In the House, H.R. 701 (CARA) passed by a vote of 315-102, while the Senate combined parts of H.R. 701 with provisions in S. 2181. The House and Senate combined parts of H.R. 701 with provisions in S. 2181 to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) at $900 million. The Administration had requested $600 million for LWCF in its FY2001 budget, but the House and Senate approved smaller amounts for land acquisition. The conference committee provided $31 million for BLM instead of the requested $61 million. The conference committee provided reduced funding for various agencies under the Lands Legacy Initiative, including $31 million for BLM, $63 million for FWS, $111 million for NPS, and $102 million for FS. Other components of the initiative include grants for land acquisition, resource protection, land restoration, and smart growth partnerships. The conference committee added a new Title VIII, titled Land Conservation, Preservation, and Infrastructure Improvement, to fund the Lands Legacy proposal with $1.6 billion in FY2001, increasing to $2.4 billion in FY2006. Funding would come from Interior and Commerce appropriations, subject to annual appropriations. The Interior funding categories include $540 million for federal and state LWCF, $300 million for state conservation programs, $160 million for urban and historic preservation programs, $150 million for public land maintenance, and $50 million for the payment in lieu of taxes program. Unlike CARA proposals, this funding is not linked to federal revenues from offshore oil and gas development. The legislation uses a \"fencing structure\" to prevent shifting funds among categories. The FY2001 Lands Legacy Initiative proposal faced little recognition or support from Congress prior to the conference committee. The House Appropriations Committee provided minimal funding and did not comment directly on it. The Senate Appropriations Committee had a lengthy discussion on the initiative but no amendments were adopted. This process mirrors Congress's response to the proposal. The Senate adopted proposals similar to Congress's response to the FY2000 initiative, adding $197.5 million for Lands Legacy programs. Some funds were allocated for land acquisitions.
