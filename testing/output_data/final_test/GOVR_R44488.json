    "content": "A commercial or depository bank is a corporation that obtains a federal or state charter to accept insured deposits, make loans, provide check cashing services, and underwrite securities. Investment banks, on the other hand, do not accept insured deposits or make loans but receive commissions for facilitating corporate mergers and securities issuances. The activities of depository banks are regulated by the Glass-Steagall Act. The financial conditions of depository banks, known as the commercial banking system, have drawn Congressional interest due to economic challenges and regulatory changes. The Great Recession, starting in 2007 and ending in 2009, led to significant losses for banks, prompting increased prudential requirements. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision introduced the third Basel Accord to establish global banking regulatory standards. The banking industry faces challenges in determining sustainable financial risk-taking amidst increased regulatory standards like the third Basel Accord and the Dodd-Frank Act. This report provides an overview of how banks facilitate financial intermediation, manage risks, and operate within the market structure. The report discusses the market structure of the banking industry, focusing on asset distribution, profitability, and lending activity levels. It highlights the role of financial intermediation in matching savers and borrowers, with banks specializing in facilitating fund transfers. Commercial banks profit from the spread between the rates they charge borrowers and the rates they pay depositors, but face risks such as borrower default and funding liquidity. Variability in short-term interest rates can impact profit spreads, and sudden deposit withdrawals pose a risk to banks' ability to repay long-term loans. Bank profitability is closely tied to financial risk, as seen when depositors withdraw funds due to economic uncertainty. Financial intermediation can increase borrowers' vulnerability during economic downturns, leading to severe financial distress for banks. Lenders may become overly optimistic during booms, increasing credit availability but also raising the risk of distress if economic conditions worsen. Recessions are more challenging for heavily leveraged borrowers, especially if they experience income reductions. Assets in the banking industry are not evenly distributed, with different size categories of banks needing separate analysis for a more accurate assessment of financial conditions. Data from the FDIC shows the number of U.S. banks by size categories since 2000, ranging from less than $100 million to over $10 billion in assets. Community banks are traditionally considered institutions with assets at or below $1 billion, while large financial institutions have $10 billion or more in assets. The number of banks with over $10 billion in assets has remained relatively constant. The number of banking institutions with over $10 billion in assets has remained constant, while total industry assets were $15,967.92 billion in 2015. Smaller community banks, with less than $100 million in assets, have been the main drivers of industry consolidation. Banks with over $10 billion in assets collectively hold approximately 80% of all industry assets. This uneven distribution makes it challenging for industry analysts to determine if the banking industry should be seen as one competitive industry or as numerous. The banking industry is divided between large banks with over $10 billion in assets holding 80% of industry assets, and smaller community banks driving industry consolidation. It is unclear whether small banks compete with large banks or with each other, while large banks may focus on specialized financial services. Banking regulators require compliance with safety and soundness regulations to mitigate financial risks. Compliance with regulatory capital requirements is crucial for banks to avoid distress and potential shutdown. Maintaining sufficient capital reserves helps absorb losses from loan defaults, reducing the risk of insolvency. However, this may also limit lending activity, potentially impacting economic growth. Determining the optimal amount of financial intermediation risk for the banking system is a regulatory challenge. The number of bank failures increased during the financial crisis of 2008, with 489 bank failures occurring from 2008-2013. The FDIC maintains a problem bank list for banks at risk of failure due to falling below regulatory minimum capital reserves. The number of problem banks on the FDIC's list spiked in 2008, peaking at 888 in 2011. Most were small institutions based on their share of total banking assets. The banking industry has since returned to profitability, measured by metrics like return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE). RoA calculates the financial return of a bank's average assets or lending activities. Return on Equity (RoE) is a measure of financial return for shareholders, calculated with net income in the numerator and total common shareholder equity in the denominator. Unlike Return on Assets (RoA), RoE does not have a clear benchmark for \"acceptable\" performance. Double-digit RoE returns are generally more favorable for shareholders. During the 2007-2009 recession, both RoA and RoE in the banking industry declined as the numerators of these ratios fell faster than their denominators, coinciding with a wave of loan defaults. During the recession, RoA and RoE in the banking industry declined as loan defaults increased, leading to capital deterioration and bank failures. Noncurrent assets and charge-offs rose after 2007, affecting the allowance for loan and lease losses. Loan loss provisioning adjusted for default risks, impacting RoA and RoE movements. Bank regulators require banking organizations to hold capital for default risks, with capital requirements designed to buffer against losses. ALLL requirements change more frequently than capital requirements, and banks may need to increase provisions if borrowers show signs of repayment difficulties. Absorbing anticipated loan losses using current earnings can help banks preserve capital for unforeseen events. The ALLL indicator suggests that loan loss provisioning has covered net charge-offs since the recession, but noncurrent loans must decrease further relative to current ALLL provisioning levels. The coverage ratio is a commonly used metric to assess the ability to absorb losses from nonperforming assets. The coverage ratio below 100% indicates insufficient provisioning to cover weak loans that could worsen. Regulators have mandated increased loan-loss provisioning post-recession to align with problem loans. The asset growth rate of the banking industry is calculated using two methodologies, adjusting for seasonal lending activity fluctuations. The asset growth rate, calculated using a moving average smoothing technique, fell below negative 2% post-2009 recession. Banks became cautious about lending due to loan repayment problems, leading to an increase in the bank lending rate. Recent growth rates are below pre-recession levels, with negative asset growth in the second and fourth quarters of 2009. Figure 7 shows common types of asset holdings in the banking industry. Since the 2007-2009 recession, the banking system has seen changes in asset holdings, with larger shares of cash and smaller shares of residential mortgages. Cash holdings have more than doubled since 2000 to approximately 12% of the portfolio, while residential mortgage credit has declined by more than 33% to around 15%. Commercial and industrial lending has also decreased since 2000 but appears to be rising post-recession. Since the 2007-2009 recession, the banking system has experienced changes in asset holdings, with larger shares of cash and smaller shares of residential mortgages. Total asset shares in commercial real estate lending, consumer loans, and securities have returned to pre-recession levels. Banks typically borrow funds for shorter periods from depositors to fund loans that are repaid over longer periods. The share of assets for sale has fallen below pre-recession levels. When a loan is repaid, the bank funds the loan by using depositors' funds as short-term loans, making periodic interest payments. Smaller banks focus on relationship banking, serving local customers with higher net interest margins. Funding loans with deposits is cheaper than accessing short-term financial markets. Loans funded by deposits are cheaper for small institutions compared to short-term financial markets. Large banks rely less on deposits due to easier access to money markets. Large banks have lower spreads and generate fee income from various activities to cover borrowing costs. They earn revenue by originating and selling loans to nonbank institutions. Large banks generate a significant share of fees from traditional banking activities and daily purchase transactions. Transactional banking activities allow them to collect service fees from various transactions, creating a participation barrier for community banks. The composition of bank revenue streams, including net interest margins and fee income, varies by asset size categories. The net interest margins for small banks declined by 2009 but remained higher than larger banks. Large banks saw an increase in margins during the recession due to a surge in deposits, leading to lower funding costs. They relied less on short-term markets and benefited from cheaper funding. The future spread performance may be influenced by changes in asset holdings. Banks may adjust asset portfolios to increase liquid holdings, impacting spreads and profitability. Changes in deposits and economic strength make predicting future profitability challenging. Fee-income revenues show volatility in smaller institutions. There is more volatility in fee-income revenues of smaller institutions due to a greater reliance on fee income. However, this may not lead to greater stability of earnings streams as high-volume fee-generating transactions are still dependent on fluctuations in investor demand for securities. Regulatory costs may also reduce fee income, such as recent regulations on fees from debit transactions. Banks may seek new opportunities to provide financial services to generate new income streams. Banks are adapting their business models to the post-recession regulatory environment by seeking new opportunities to provide financial services and generate fee revenues. Despite exhibiting profitability since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the industry is still affected by financial market uncertainty. Profitability should not be seen as a return to previous lending patterns, as banks are accumulating reserves to cover noncurrent assets and adjusting to higher capital requirements. Asset growth rate has been positive since 2011 but remains below the average rate of growth observed over the past two decades. In the post-recession regulatory environment, banks are adjusting their business models to increase funding costs and change the financial assets held in portfolios. Large banks may rely less on traditional lending, generating fee income from various financial activities to maintain profitability. Profitability trends may vary based on bank size."
