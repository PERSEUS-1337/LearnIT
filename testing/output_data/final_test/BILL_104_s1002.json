    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Historic Homeownership Assistance Act\" and introduces a new section for the Historic Homeownership Rehabilitation Credit in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act introduces a new section for the Historic Homeownership Rehabilitation Credit in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit allows individuals to claim 20% of qualified rehabilitation expenditures made on a qualified historic home, with a maximum credit of $50,000 ($25,000 for married individuals filing separately). Unused credits can be carried forward to the following years. The term 'qualified rehabilitation expenditure' refers to amounts chargeable to capital account for certified rehabilitation of a qualified historic home, excluding certain exterior expenditures. The term 'certified rehabilitation' in this section refers to the rehabilitation of a building where at least 5 percent of total expenditures are allocated to the exterior. Rules similar to section 47(c)(2)(B) apply, and only qualified expenditures for the portion used as the taxpayer's principal residence are considered. The term 'certified rehabilitation' refers to the rehabilitation of a building with specific considerations for preserving architectural elements and preventing further deterioration or demolition. The term 'certified rehabilitation' includes preserving interior elements, effects on neighboring historic properties, and applies to buildings in targeted areas or enterprise zones, excluding those listed in the National Register. The term 'certified rehabilitation' allows State Historic Preservation Officers to certify the rehabilitation of buildings within their jurisdiction for tax purposes. A 'qualified historic home' is a certified historic structure that has been substantially rehabilitated and is owned by the taxpayer. The term 'certified historic structure' refers to a building owned by the taxpayer and used as their principal residence. The term 'substantially rehabilitated' is defined as per section 47(c)(1)(C), with certain exceptions for specific buildings. The term 'certified historic structure' includes buildings designated as historically significant under state or local statutes certified by the Secretary of the Interior. An 'enterprise or empowerment zone' is an area designated as an enterprise community or empowerment zone under section 1391. Rehabilitation is not considered complete before certification. For tax purposes, a taxpayer leasing their principal residence is treated as the owner if the lease term meets minimum requirements. Tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations are considered owners of the property they occupy. Expenditures for buildings are taken into account unless specified otherwise. Qualified rehabilitation expenditures for a building other than one specified in subsection (g) are treated as made upon completion of the rehabilitation or as specified by the Secretary. Regulations will include rules for recapture if the property no longer qualifies. In the case of a qualified purchased historic home, the taxpayer is deemed to have made the seller's rehabilitation expenditures on the date of purchase. The term 'qualified purchased historic home' refers to a certified historic structure purchased by the taxpayer within 5 years of completion of rehabilitation, to be used as their principal residence. The taxpayer must be the first purchaser after rehabilitation, no prior credit allowed to the seller, and must receive necessary information from the Secretary. The taxpayer may elect to receive a historic rehabilitation mortgage credit certificate instead of the credit allowable under this section. The certificate is issued to the taxpayer at the time of purchase for a building under subsection (g) or at the time rehabilitation is completed for any other case. The taxpayer may elect to receive a historic rehabilitation mortgage credit certificate instead of the credit allowable under this section. The certificate is issued to the taxpayer with a face amount equal to the allowable credit for the rehabilitation. It can only be transferred to a lending institution for a loan secured by the building and used solely for acquisition or rehabilitation purposes. The taxpayer may elect to receive a historic rehabilitation mortgage credit certificate instead of the credit allowable under this section. The certificate is issued with a face amount equal to the allowable credit for the rehabilitation and can only be transferred to a lending institution for a loan used for acquisition or rehabilitation purposes. The lender can use the certificate to offset their regular tax and carry forward any unused amounts until exhausted. If the taxpayer disposes of the building before the end of the 5-year period, recapture rules apply. If the taxpayer disposes of their interest in the building or the building is no longer used as their principal residence, the tax for that year will increase by the recapture percentage of the rehabilitation credit claimed in prior years. The recapture percentage is determined according to a specific table under section 50(a)(1)(B), with adjustments for disposition or cessation events. The tax credit for rehabilitation expenses will be adjusted if the property is disposed of or no longer used as the taxpayer's principal residence. The basis of the property will be reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. States cannot charge fees for processing rehabilitation certification applications unless the fees are used for processing expenses only.
