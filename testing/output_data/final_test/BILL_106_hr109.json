    "content": "Regulation of gun shows. Regulation of gun shows includes a requirement for individuals to be licensed and notify authorities before holding a gun show. Applicants must meet specific criteria and submit an application to the Secretary for approval. Regulation of gun shows requires individuals to obtain a license from the Secretary, meeting specific criteria and submitting an application for approval. The license must comply with state and local laws, include a photo and fingerprints of the applicant, and be in a form specified by regulations. Upon approval and payment of a fee, the Secretary issues the license, allowing the licensee to hold gun shows in accordance with the law. The licensee is entitled to hold gun shows in interstate or foreign commerce for a 3-year period after license issuance. The Secretary must approve or deny applications within 60 days, or the applicant can take legal action. Before a non-licensed person transfers a firearm at a gun show, they must provide written notice to the show holder. The licensee must provide detailed records of firearm transfers at gun shows to the Secretary within 30 days after the event. Gun shows are events sponsored by national, State, or local organizations where firearm transfers must comply with specific requirements. The text chunk discusses the requirements for gun shows sponsored by organizations dedicated to firearms use, where 50 or more firearms are present for sale or transfer, with at least one firearm transported across state lines. Penalties for non-compliance are also outlined. The text outlines penalties for knowingly violating specific sections related to firearms laws, including fines and imprisonment for up to 5 years. The amendments apply to conduct after a 1-year period from the enactment of the Act."
