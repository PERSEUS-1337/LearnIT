Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require permits, orders, and decrees for municipal combined sewer overflows to conform to the CSO control policy and develop long-term control plans to meet water quality standards. The Administrator will issue guidance by December 31, 2000, for water quality reviews of municipal combined sewer overflow receiving waters. A report on progress in implementing the CSO control policy must be submitted to Congress by September 1, 2001. SEC. 121. WET WEATHER WATERSHED PILOT PROJECTS. The Administrator, with State coordination, may provide technical assistance and grants for pilot projects on wet weather discharge control. This includes watershed management of wet weather discharges and stormwater best management practices to demonstrate effective approaches and innovative technologies. The Administrator, in coordination with States, will provide municipalities in pilot projects the ability to implement innovative practices for stormwater discharge control. Funding of $10,000,000 for 2002, $15,000,000 for 2003, and $20,000,000 for 2004 is authorized, with at least 20% allocated for stormwater purposes. Administrative expenses are also covered. The Administrator can retain up to 4% of appropriated funds for administrative expenses. A report on pilot project results must be submitted to Congress within 5 years of enactment. SEC. 4. SEWER OVERFLOW CONTROL GRANTS. A new section is added to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for sewer overflow control grants. In any fiscal year with at least $1,200,000,000 available, the Administrator can provide grants to States for municipalities to plan, design, and construct treatment works for sewer overflows. Priority is given to financially distressed communities. Financially distressed communities meeting affordability criteria can receive grants for sewer overflow control plans or projects listed on a State's intended use plan. Financially distressed communities meeting affordability criteria may receive grants for sewer overflow control plans or projects. States consider factors like slow tax base growth and potential water/sewer rate increases when determining distressed community status. The Federal share of grant costs must be at least 55 percent. The Administrator can provide information to assist States in setting affordability criteria. The non-Federal share of project costs can include public and private funds, in-kind services, and financial assistance from State water pollution control revolving funds. Projects receiving grant and loan assistance may follow State fund reporting requirements. $750,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 and 2003.

For fiscal year 2003, a portion of the funds will be allocated for grants to States. The Administrator will allocate funds to States based on a formula for municipal combined sewer overflow controls and sanitary sewer overflow controls. Administrative expenses are limited to 1% for administration costs and 4% for grants to municipalities. The Administrator will allocate funds to States based on a formula for municipal combined sewer overflow controls and sanitary sewer overflow controls. Administrative expenses are limited to 1% for administration costs and not to exceed 4% of any grant made to a municipality for administering the grant. Reports containing recommended funding levels for grants under this section must be transmitted to Congress by December 31, 2003, and periodically thereafter to ensure nationwide implementation of sewer overflow controls. SEC. 5. INFORMATION ON CSOS AND SSOS. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must report to Congress within 3 years of this Act on the impacts of municipal sewer overflows on human health and the environment, including discharge locations and pollutants. The report should also cover municipal spending on addressing these impacts and evaluate the technologies used. Additionally, the Administrator will maintain a clearinghouse of cost-effective technologies for mitigating these impacts. The curr_chunk discusses environmental impacts from municipal combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows."
