    "content": "Under the Constitution, war powers are divided between Congress and the President. Congress has the power to declare war and raise armed forces, while the President is Commander in Chief. There is debate over whether the President can send forces into hostile situations abroad without congressional authorization. Congressional concern over this issue grew after the Korean conflict and during the Vietnam War. The War Powers Resolution (P.L. 93-148) was passed on November 7, 1973, to establish procedures for both branches of government to share decisions involving the use of armed forces in circumstances that could lead to hostilities. It aimed to limit the President's authority to deploy forces abroad without congressional approval while allowing flexibility to respond to emergencies. The Resolution has been controversial and some believe it has restrained presidential use of armed forces, provided communication channels, and asserted Congress's war powers. The War Powers Resolution (P.L. 93-148) was passed in 1973 to establish procedures for sharing decisions on the use of armed forces between the branches of government. It aimed to limit the President's authority to deploy forces without congressional approval, while allowing flexibility for emergencies. The Resolution has been controversial, with some seeking amendments to ensure congressional voice in committing troops, while others argue for its repeal. This report examines the Resolution's provisions, its use from 1973 to 2015, and proposed amendments. Appendices list instances reported to Congress and those not reported. Some believe the time limitation in the Resolution is unconstitutional and impractical. The War Powers Resolution, also known as the War Powers Act, was passed in 1973 to establish procedures for sharing decisions on the use of armed forces between Congress and the President. It aims to ensure that both branches of government have a say in deploying troops and emphasizes the collective judgment of both. The Resolution's purpose is to regulate the introduction and continued use of US Armed Forces in hostilities or situations indicating imminent involvement in hostilities. It is based on the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution. The War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973, aims to regulate the deployment of US Armed Forces. It requires the President to consult with Congress before introducing troops into hostilities, emphasizing the need for a declaration of war, statutory authorization, or national emergency. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 mandates consultation between the President and Congress before deploying troops into hostilities. Consultation involves seeking advice, opinions, and approval from Members of Congress, with the President's active participation and full disclosure of relevant information. The House version called for specific consultation between the President, leadership, and committees, but the final wording was made more flexible in conference. Section 4 of the War Powers Resolution requires the President to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or situations indicating imminent involvement in hostilities. The term \"hostilities\" is defined broadly to include a state of confrontation even without actual fighting. The War Powers Resolution requires the President to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or situations indicating imminent involvement in hostilities. \"Imminent hostilities\" refer to a situation with a clear potential for armed conflict. The reporting includes the introduction of troops into foreign territory equipped for combat, except for certain deployments related to supply, replacement, repair, or training. This reporting is necessary even in situations where there is no actual fighting but a risk of forces being involved in hostilities. The War Powers Resolution requires the President to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or situations indicating imminent involvement in hostilities. Reports are not required for routine port supply calls, emergency aid measures, normal training exercises, and other noncombat military activities. The introduction of troops \"in numbers which substantially enlarge United States Armed Forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation\" necessitates reporting. The House report clarified that a 100% increase in Marine guards at an embassy or a thousand additional troops sent to Europe would not trigger a report. The dispatch of 1,000 men to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba would mean a 25% increase in troop strength, which is substantial. President Kennedy would have been required to report to Congress in 1962 when he raised the number of U.S. military advisers in Vietnam. Reports under the War Powers Resolution must include circumstances, authority, and scope of hostilities. Section 4(c) of the War Powers Resolution requires the President to report to Congress every six months when U.S. forces are introduced into hostilities. The objective is to ensure Congress has the necessary information for its constitutional responsibilities regarding committing the nation to war and the use of U.S. Armed Forces abroad. Section 5(a) outlines congressional procedures for receiving these reports during adjournment. Section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution requires the President to terminate the use of U.S. Armed Forces after 60 days unless Congress has declared war, authorized the action, extended the period by law, or is physically unable to meet due to an armed attack on the United States. The President can extend the 60-day period for 30 days if there is an unavoidable military necessity. Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution allows Congress to direct the President to remove forces at any time by concurrent resolution, but its effectiveness is uncertain due to a Supreme Court decision. Section 6 outlines expedited procedures for congressional consideration of authorizing the use of armed forces, including referral to committees and timelines for voting. The War Powers Resolution allows Congress to direct the President to remove forces by concurrent resolution. Expedited procedures for congressional consideration of authorizing the use of armed forces are outlined, including timelines for voting. The House and Senate have specific procedures for debate and voting on measures related to the use of armed forces. Section 8 of the War Powers Resolution clarifies that the authority to introduce armed forces must be specifically authorized by law or treaty, preventing broad resolutions from justifying hostilities abroad. The War Powers Resolution Section 8(b) allows US Armed Forces to participate in joint military operations with foreign countries without further authorization, clarifying that it does not restrict participation in military exercises with allied organizations like NATO. The \"high-level\" military commands mentioned are NATO, NORAD, and the United Nations command in Korea. Section 8(c) defines the introduction of armed forces to include assigning forces to accompany military forces of other countries in hostilities. The purpose is to prevent unauthorized military support activities and avoid controversial actions like those in Indochina. The deepening ground combat involvement in South Vietnam began with the assignment of U.S. forces. The ground combat involvement of the United States in South Vietnam and Laos began with the assignment of U.S. \"advisers\" to accompany local units on combat patrols. Section 8(d) of the Resolution clarifies that it does not alter the constitutional authority of Congress or the President, and specifies that no new troop introduction authority is granted. Section 9 ensures that if any provision is found invalid, the rest of the Resolution remains unaffected. The War Powers Resolution was controversial due to the division of national war powers between the President and Congress. President Nixon challenged its constitutionality, particularly the legislative veto provision and the provision requiring troop withdrawal after 60-90 days without congressional authorization. The War Powers Resolution has been a point of contention between the President and Congress, with Presidents arguing it infringes on their authority as Commander in Chief. The core issue lies in differing interpretations of war powers, with Congress believing it has the power to declare war while the President asserts authority to deploy forces without congressional approval. In the early 1970s, there was a debate over the balance of war powers between the President and Congress. Congress believed it had the authority to forbid or end military action, while the President argued for more power to lead U.S. forces. President Nixon vetoed the War Powers Resolution, stating it would restrict his authority and endanger national security. The War Powers Resolution in Section 2(c) recognized the President's constitutional powers as Commander in Chief to introduce forces into hostilities only under specific conditions. The executive branch argues for broader authority to use forces for various purposes. The Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the legislative veto provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act, casting doubt on any legislative veto not presented to the President for signature. This decision emphasized the need for legislative actions to follow the Constitution's prescribed procedures. The War Powers Resolution allows Congress to direct the President to remove forces by a concurrent resolution, which is constitutionally suspect. If both Houses voted to withdraw U.S. forces, the President would likely comply, or Congress could withhold funding. The Resolution's separability clause would protect the rest of the joint resolution if one section is deemed unconstitutional. Congress has taken action to address the potential unconstitutionality of the concurrent resolution mechanism for troop withdrawal by amending the War Powers Resolution. The Senate substituted a joint resolution for the concurrent resolution in Section 5(c) and established expedited procedures for handling it. A free-standing measure was adopted, becoming law, requiring any resolution or bill for troop removal without a declaration of war to be considered accordingly. The expedited procedures of Section 601(b) of the International Security and Arms Export Control Act of 1976 would apply to a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization, with limited debate on a veto. House Members used Section 5(c) to introduce a resolution directing the President to remove U.S. Armed Forces from Somalia by a specified date. The House adopted H.Con.Res. 170 on March 31, 1994, directing the President to withdraw U.S. forces from Somalia by that date. Despite constitutionality questions, the Foreign Affairs Committee acted based on expedited procedures. The resolution was considered nonbinding due to the Chadha decision. The withdrawal date was later enacted as Section 8151 of P.L. 103-139. The automatic withdrawal provision in the War Powers Resolution has been controversial. The War Powers Resolution includes a provision in Section 5(b) that requires the President to withdraw U.S. forces from hostilities within 60-90 days after a report is submitted. The time limit was included to give Congress more authority and restore the constitutional balance. The Resolution does not grant the President any new authority or freedom of action. The War Powers Resolution does not grant the President any new authority or freedom of action. Administration officials argue that imposing a deadline for withdrawal interferes with successful action and increases risk to U.S. forces. Perceptions of the Resolution were shaped during the Cold War, and the issue has not been addressed by the courts. During the Cold War, perceptions of the War Powers Resolution were established. In the 1970s, the focus was on consultation adequacy, while the 1980s raised concerns about presidential compliance and congressional willingness to use the Resolution. Congress invoked the Resolution for Lebanon in 1983 but chose not to do so during the Persian Gulf tanker war in 1987-1988. Major U.S. military actions from 1973 to August 1990, including President Ford's use of forces in Vietnam and the retaking of the SS Mayaguez, were reported to Congress. The Ford Administration reported the recapture of the SS Mayaguez to Congress under the War Powers Resolution, citing Section 4(a)(1). Differences in opinion between the branches arose regarding the meaning of consultation, with the Administration arguing notification sufficed, while Congress believed consultation required seeking and considering congressional opinion before committing armed forces. After an unsuccessful rescue attempt in Iran, President Carter did not consult Congress as he believed it was a rescue mission, not an act of force. Some members of Congress complained about the lack of consultation, especially since meetings had been ongoing since the Iranian crisis began. Just before the attempt, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee requested formal consultations under the War Powers Resolution. The President did not consult Congress before a rescue attempt in Iran, leading to complaints about lack of consultation. Senate Foreign Relations Committee emphasized the need for consultation under the War Powers Resolution. Controversy arose over the dispatch of military advisers to El Salvador, not reported under the War Powers Resolution. The Reagan Administration sent 54 military advisers to El Salvador, claiming they were armed by Soviet bloc countries. The President did not report the situation under the War Powers Resolution, stating that the advisers were not equipped for combat. The Reagan Administration sent 54 military advisers to El Salvador, armed for self-defense only. The State Department argued that no report was needed under the War Powers Resolution as the advisers were not expected to engage in combat. Members of Congress filed a lawsuit, alleging a violation of the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution. A group of Senators and Representatives intervened in a lawsuit regarding military assistance to El Salvador, arguing that Congress should decide on the matter. The District Court dismissed the suit, stating that the question of U.S. forces' involvement in hostilities should be resolved by Congress. A federal circuit court affirmed the dismissal, and the Supreme Court declined to consider the case. On June 8, 1984, the Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal regarding the dismissal of a lawsuit related to U.S. military involvement in El Salvador. Various legislative proposals were introduced concerning the War Powers Resolution and El Salvador, but none were adopted. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee emphasized the President's obligation to consult with Congress before committing combat forces to El Salvador. On July 26, 1983, the House rejected an amendment to limit the number of military advisers in El Salvador to 55. Despite this, the Administration kept the number of trainers at 55. President Reagan announced joint training exercises in Central America and the Caribbean on July 27, 1983. The first U.S. troops landed in Honduras on August 8, 1983, for ground and ocean exercises involving thousands of troops, warships, and fighter jets. The President conducted joint military exercises in Central America and the Caribbean involving ground troops, warships, and fighter planes. Some Members of Congress raised concerns that the exercises were supporting rebels in Nicaragua, potentially leading to U.S. military involvement in hostilities. Calls were made to report the actions under the War Powers Resolution, with the Boland amendment already prohibiting funds for overthrowing the Nicaraguan government. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1986 stated that U.S. Armed Forces should not be introduced into Nicaragua for combat. Congress prohibited U.S. personnel from assisting within 120 miles of the Nicaraguan border. The issue faded with peace agreements and the electoral defeat of the Sandinista regime in 1990. The War Powers Resolution faced a test when Marines were sent to participate in a Multinational. The War Powers Resolution was tested in 1983 when Marines in Lebanon faced hostile fire. President Reagan filed reports but did not mention hostilities, leading Congress to pass the Multinational Force in Lebanon Resolution. This authorized the Marines' continued participation for 18 months, marking a compromise between Congress and the President. In 1982, President Reagan sent U.S. troops to Lebanon for peacekeeping, leading to a compromise with Congress for troops to remain for 18 months. Marines left Lebanon after overseeing the departure of the PLO force. In September 1982, President Reagan announced the deployment of a multinational force to Lebanon following the assassination of President-elect Bashir Gemayel and other violent events. Despite initial assurances that the American force would not engage in combat, incidents led to controversy in Congress. In mid-1983, Congress passed the Lebanon Emergency Assistance Act of 1983, requiring authorization for any significant increase in US Armed Forces in Lebanon. President Reagan reported on the situation in Lebanon after fighting broke out and two Marines were killed, leading to calls in Congress for invoking the War Powers Resolution. Several Members of Congress introduced legislation related to the War Powers Resolution in response to the situation in Lebanon. Senator Charles Mathias proposed S.J.Res. 159 setting a time limit for forces to remain in Lebanon. Representative Thomas Downey introduced H.J.Res. 348 directing the President to report under the Resolution. Senator Robert Byrd introduced S.J.Res. 163 applying the Resolution to the circumstances in Lebanon. Additionally, an amendment to the FY1984 continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 367) restricted funds for peacekeeping activities in Lebanon after 60 days. After 60 days, funds could not be used for peacekeeping activities in Lebanon by US Armed Forces without a report from the President under the War Powers Resolution. A compromise resolution allowed Marines to stay for 18 months, passed by the House and Senate. The resolution included provisions to terminate the authorization early. The authorization to keep Marines in Lebanon for 18 months could be terminated early if foreign forces withdrew, the UN or Lebanon took over responsibilities, effective security arrangements were implemented, or other countries withdrew. After the bombing that killed 241 Marines in October 1983, President Reagan announced their redeployment and ended US participation in the Multinational Force in Lebanon by March 30, 1984. On October 25, 1983, President Reagan ordered a landing of 1,900 U.S. Army and Marine Corps personnel in Grenada in response to a request from the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. The House supported triggering the War Powers Resolution time limitation on November 1, 1983, but the Senate did not act on it. On November 17, 1983, the Senate and House both voted to invoke Section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution in response to President Reagan's invasion of Grenada. However, the legislation was not completed as the provision was deleted in the conference report on the debt limit bill. By December 15, 1983, all U.S. combat troops had been removed from Grenada. Eleven Members of Congress challenged the constitutionality of the invasion, but a district judge ruled that courts should not intervene unless Congress exhausts its institutional remedies. The use of U.S. forces against Libya in 1986 raised War Powers Resolution concerns due to escalating tensions with Col. Muammar Qadhafi. President Reagan cited terrorist acts backed by Qadhafi as armed aggression against the U.S. The War Powers issue arose when Libyan forces attacked U.S. aircraft in the Gulf of Sidra, leading to U.S. missile strikes in response. The United States fired missiles at Libyan vessels and a missile site in Sirte in response to Libyan forces attacking U.S. aircraft in the Gulf of Sidra. This action was seen as a response to terrorist activities. In April 1986, after a terrorist bombing in West Berlin, President Reagan announced evidence linking Libya to the attack. U.S. Air Force planes then conducted bombing strikes on Libyan headquarters, terrorist facilities, and military installations. The President reported these actions to Congress, but did not mention the War Powers Resolution. The War Powers Resolution was brought into question after an Iraqi aircraft attacked the USS Stark in the Persian Gulf, leading to bills being introduced to amend the resolution. One bill proposed establishing a consultative group in Congress, while others aimed to give the President more authority to combat terrorism. The incident raised concerns about the Persian Gulf being a zone of hostilities for U.S. forces. The deployment of U.S. Naval forces in the Persian Gulf raised concerns about potential war involvement without congressional authorization. The President did not report military incidents under the War Powers Resolution, despite increased presence of warships and patrol boats in the region. Reports were only submitted after incidents like the USS Stark attack and mine strikes on U.S. vessels. Texaco-Caribbean struck a mine on August 10 and a U.S. F-14 fighter plane fired two missiles at an Iranian aircraft perceived as threatening. Despite military incidents and congressional concern, the President began submitting reports related to the Persian Gulf. The Reagan administration argued that the incidents did not constitute hostilities or imminent hostilities as defined in the War Powers Resolution. \"Imminent danger\" pay for military personnel in the Persian Gulf was not seen as triggering Section 4(a)(1). On August 27, 1987, danger pay standards were broader than those of the War Powers Resolution. Some Members of Congress argued for a report under Section 4(a)(1) regarding the situation in the Persian Gulf, but no resolutions were passed. The Senate voted 50-41 to table an amendment to apply the War Powers Resolution provisions on September 18, 1987. The Senate used legislation to involve Congress in Persian Gulf policy without invoking the War Powers Resolution. Both Chambers passed measures for reports on U.S. military protection of Kuwaiti shipping. The Senate later passed a measure for a comprehensive report by the President and expedited procedures for a joint resolution. The House did not take action on the bill. Some Members took the War Powers issue to court regarding the consultation requirement for reflagging Kuwaiti ships. A lawsuit was filed in 1987 but was dismissed as a nonjusticiable political question. The Administration offered its reflagging plan to Kuwait before consulting with Congress, leading to ongoing consultations. After offering a reflagging plan to Kuwait without consulting Congress, consultations with Congress began but were ongoing. The President met with congressional leaders before taking retaliatory actions in April 1988. Some Members of Congress believed the War Powers Resolution was not being followed, while others saw it as a restraint on the President. Suggestions were made to amend the Resolution due to the Persian Gulf situation. In response to the Persian Gulf situation, committees in Congress assessed the War Powers Resolution. Interest waned after a cease-fire in August 1988. President George H.W. Bush sent troops to Panama in December 1989, citing the need to protect American citizens and restore democracy. In December 1989, President George H.W. Bush sent troops to Panama to apprehend General Manuel Noriega, accused of electoral fraud and drug trafficking. Noriega surrendered to U.S. military authorities on January 3, and by February 13, all combat forces had been withdrawn. The President did not consult with congressional leaders before the decision, but some Members of Congress had been discussing the issue of Noriega. Congress had called for unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral measures to address the situation. The Senate supported the President's use of diplomatic, economic, and military options to remove General Noriega from power in Panama. Congress did not extensively discuss the War Powers Resolution due to being out of session during the Panama operation. The first session of the 101st Congress ended on November 22, 1989, and the second session began on January 23, 1990, after the operation was essentially over. After the Panama operation, the President's actions were supported by Congress and the public. The end of the Cold War led to a shift towards U.N.-authorized military actions in Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, former Yugoslavia/Bosnia/Kosovo, and Haiti, raising questions about the applicability of the War Powers Resolution. The need for congressional authorization for U.S. participation in U.N. military operations remains a debated issue since 1945. The U.N. Participation Act, War Powers Resolution, and Constitution govern this requirement, with appropriations by Congress also playing a role. The President can negotiate special agreements with the Security Council for armed actions under certain U.N. Charter articles, subject to Congress approval. The U.N. Participation Act allows for agreements with the Security Council on armed forces and facilities, subject to Congress approval. Congressional authorization is not needed once agreements are in place, but none have been made yet. Section 7 of the Act permits up to 1,000 personnel for noncombatant roles in U.N. peacekeeping missions. Deployment of larger forces or combatant roles has sparked controversy. The War Powers Resolution requires specific legislative authorization for the introduction of U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities, even if it is based on a treaty. Congress has dealt with this issue on a case-by-case basis and has enacted measures to have more control over U.S. participation in peacekeeping actions. The Defense Appropriations Act for FY1994 and the Defense Authorization Act for FY1994 aimed to give Congress more control over U.S. participation in future peacekeeping actions, requiring consultation with Congress before deployment of U.S. Armed Forces under U.N. Security Council actions. Congress also sought to establish military agreements with the U.N. Security Council and address the applicability of the War Powers Resolution and the U.N. Participation Act. The House Republicans' Contract with America, H.R. 7, and Senator Dole's S. 5, The Peace Powers Act, aimed to limit presidential authority in committing U.S. forces to international peacekeeping operations. Funding restrictions and reporting requirements were imposed on ongoing and potential peacekeeping missions, leading to some presidential vetoes. In August 1990, Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait under President Saddam Hussein's direction, prompting action to repel the invasion. In August 1990, Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, leading to the largest war involving the United States since the War Powers Resolution. President George H.W. Bush worked with the United Nations to organize international support for military action against Iraq. A week after the invasion, President Bush deployed U.S. Armed Forces to deter Iraqi aggression, without consulting congressional leaders but with legislative support to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The U.S. Congress supported efforts to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait through economic sanctions and multilateral measures. The Senate urged the President to seek the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait using unilateral and multilateral actions. The House passed a resolution condemning the invasion and calling for an economic embargo against Iraq. The United Nations also imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. The United Nations imposed economic sanctions against Iraq on August 7, with the U.S. and UK organizing a naval interdiction effort. On August 25, the U.N. Security Council authorized measures to halt shipping to Iraq. The House passed a resolution supporting the action on October 1, citing the War Powers Resolution. Representative Fascell clarified that it did not grant open-ended authority to the President. On October 2, 1990, the Senate adopted S.Con.Res. 147 by a vote of 96-3, supporting the President's actions in accordance with the United Nations Security Council decisions and U.S. constitutional processes to deter Iraqi aggression. The resolution did not mention the War Powers Resolution and was not open-ended like the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. The House did not act on this resolution. Congress also appropriated funds for Operation Desert Shield. President Bush ordered additional troops to the Gulf without informing the consultation group, leading to criticism. U.S. forces numbering over 200,000 had been deployed by this time. President Bush sent a report to Congress on November 16, describing the increasing deployment of forces to the region, totaling 350,000 U.S. forces by the end of the year. Representative Ron Dellums and other Democratic Members of Congress sought a judicial order to prevent offensive military operations without congressional authorization. On December 13, Judge Harold Greene denied an injunction sought by Democratic Members of Congress to prevent offensive military operations without congressional authorization. The judge held that the controversy was not ripe for judicial resolution, but rejected the Administration's arguments for full presidential war powers. The American Civil Liberties Union and law professors supported the plaintiffs, arguing that Congress has the authority to declare war. President Bush indicated readiness to use force to implement U.N. resolutions if Iraq did not withdraw from Kuwait by January 15, 1991. He requested congressional support for all necessary means to enforce Resolution 678. President Bush requested congressional support for his actions in the Persian Gulf, emphasizing that he had the authority to implement United Nations resolutions without needing a specific resolution from Congress. On January 12, 1991, both houses passed the \"Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution\" (P.L. 102-1), authorizing the President to use U.S. Armed Forces to achieve compliance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 678. The resolution required the President to exhaust diplomatic efforts before military action and mandated reporting every 60 days on compliance efforts. President Bush signed the resolution into law, stating it constituted specific statutory authorization under the War Powers Resolution. President Bush signed H.J.Res. 77 into law, stating it did not change the executive branch's positions on the President's authority to use Armed Forces or the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution. He expressed satisfaction in uniting with Congress on a common objective. On January 16, he determined diplomatic efforts were ineffective in compelling Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, and on January 18, he reported to Congress that U.S. forces had commenced combat operations. President Bush initiated combat operations on January 16, 1991, and reported to Congress on March 19 that the military operations were successful, Kuwait had been liberated, and combat operations were suspended on February 28. The effectiveness of the War Powers Resolution was questioned before the passage of P.L. 102-1, but after its passage, Chairman Fascell stated that the resolution was still valid as the President had submitted reports to Congress. The President reported successful military operations in Kuwait, with combat operations suspended on February 28. Congress authorized the use of force in specific settings through P.L. 102-1. Speaker Foley explained that Congress did not declare war against Iraq to avoid domestic consequences like property seizure and censorship. After Operation Desert Storm, U.S. military forces were used in Iraq to address the repression of Kurdish and Shi'ite groups. President George H.W. Bush reported to Congress about the need for U.S. forces in northern Iraq for emergency relief. U.S. forces later withdrew but remained prepared to intervene as necessary. President George H.W. Bush reported to Congress about the need for U.S. forces in Iraq to ensure compliance with Security Council Resolution 687, which called for the destruction of weapons and international control of nuclear materials. Iraq's noncooperation with inspection teams led to concerns about compliance, with President Bush stating that the U.S. would take action as necessary. On September 16, 1992, President George H.W. Bush announced readiness to use force to assist the United Nations in addressing Iraq's weapons capabilities. Military exercises were initiated to deploy troops to Kuwait, and a \"no-fly\" zone was established in southern Iraq to address security concerns. On January 13, 1993, the Bush Administration announced airstrikes on missile bases in southern Iraq and deployed a battalion task force to Kuwait to support its independence. President Bush reported shooting down an Iraqi aircraft on December 27, 1992, and further military actions on January 13, 17, and 18. President Clinton affirmed the Iraq policy set by the Bush Administration on January 21, 1993. U.S. aircraft fired at Iraqi targets on various dates in 1993 due to perceived threats. President Clinton reported on September 23, 1993, that the Iraqi installation fired upon had not shown hostile intentions since August 19. President Clinton reported to Congress that U.S. naval forces launched a missile strike on the Iraqi Intelligence Service's command complex in Baghdad in response to a failed assassination attempt on former President Bush. The Authorization for the Use of Force in Iraq allowed military actions to achieve implementation of Security Council Resolutions. The U.S. launched a missile strike on Iraq in response to an assassination attempt on former President Bush. Congress supported military action to maintain the cease-fire agreement with Iraq. Congressional authorization for military action was debated in 1998. The House passed a Defense Department Appropriations bill with a provision banning the use of funds for offensive military operations without congressional authorization, but this provision was removed in the conference with the Senate. The Skaggs provision banning offensive military operations without congressional authorization was removed by the House-Senate conference committee on H.R. 4103. The United States conducted numerous air attacks against Iraqi targets in response to violations of \"no-fly zones\" without seeking congressional authorization. These activities ceased after the 2003 War with Iraq. In Somalia, U.S. military involvement in a U.N. operation to protect humanitarian aid became controversial due to escalating fighting and casualties. President George H.W. Bush ordered U.S. military forces to Somalia on December 4, 1992, to protect humanitarian relief from armed gangs. The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 794 on December 3, authorizing the use of all necessary means to establish a secure environment for humanitarian operations in Somalia. President Bush reported to Congress on December 10 that U.S. Armed Forces had entered Somalia on December 8 to secure the air. On December 8, U.S. Armed Forces entered Somalia to secure Mogadishu's airfield and port facility as part of U.N. Security Council Resolution 794 objectives. The forces aimed to establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations before transitioning responsibility to a U.N. peacekeeping force. The President emphasized that U.S. forces were prepared for self-defense and to carry out their humanitarian mission, with additional support if needed. By mid-January, there were 25,000 U.S. forces in Somalia. The 60-day time limit under the War Powers Resolution was not mentioned. By February, U.S. force strength in Somalia was being reduced as the responsibility for protecting humanitarian relief shipments was expected to be turned over to a U.N. force. On March 26, 1993, the Security Council adopted Resolution 814 expanding the mandate of the U.N. force to transition from a U.S.-led force to a U.N.-led force (UNOSOM II). By mid-May, the U.S. forces were down to approximately 4,000 troops, primarily logistics and communications support teams. Violence within Somalia increased, with attacks killing 23 Pakistani peacekeepers on June 5, 1993. On June 10, 1993, President Clinton reported military strikes to assist UNOSOM II in quelling violence in Somalia. On July 1, further military operations were conducted to secure General Aidid's compound and neutralize obstacles to humanitarian relief efforts. Congress debated authorizing U.S. action in Somalia. On February 4, 1993, the Senate passed S.J.Res. 45 authorizing the President to use U.S. Armed Forces under U.N. Security Council Resolution 794. The House amended the resolution on May 25, 1993, allowing U.S. forces to stay for one year. However, the Senate did not act on the measure. In response to escalating violence in Somalia, Congress amended the Defense Authorization Act for FY1994 in September 1993, requiring the President to consult with Congress on policy towards Somalia and report on the U.S. mission by October 15, 1993. In response to escalating violence in Somalia, Congress amended the Defense Authorization Act for FY1994 in September 1993, requiring the President to consult with Congress on policy towards Somalia and report on the U.S. mission by October 15, 1993. President Clinton sent a 33-page report to Congress on his Somalia policy and its objectives on October 13. Most U.S. forces were planned to be withdrawn from Somalia by March 31, 1994, with funds for military operations cut off after that date unless further spending authority was obtained from Congress. The Defense Authorization Act for FY1994 required U.S. combat forces in Somalia to remain under the command of U.S. commanders for security and logistical support. Congress debated the authorization of troops in Somalia due to concerns about hostilities, but previous Administrations did not consider intermittent military engagements as necessitating troop withdrawal. The War Powers Resolution was debated in Congress regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Somalia, with Representative Gilman introducing a resolution for withdrawal by January 31, 1994. The House amended the resolution for withdrawal by March 31, 1994, but the Senate did not act on it. The Defense Appropriations Act for FY1995 prohibited continuous presence of U.S. forces in Somalia after September 30, 1994. The U.N. Security Council decided to end the U.N. mission in Somalia by March 31, 1995. President Bush consulted with congressional leaders before troop deployment in Somalia, but no explicit authorization was given for military action. The issue of war powers and U.S. participation in United Nations actions was raised by efforts to halt fighting in former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia. U.S. action within a NATO framework in Bosnia also raised questions about whether NATO actions are exempt from the War Powers Resolution. The North Atlantic Treaty implies a role for Congress in the event of war, while the War Powers Resolution requires specific authorization for introducing U.S. forces into hostilities. On August 13, 1992, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 770 urging nations to facilitate humanitarian assistance to Sarajevo. Congress supported more aid for conflict victims, with the Senate passing S.Res. 330 on August 11, 1992, urging clear objectives before introducing U.S. military personnel into hostilities. In 1993, the United States participated in humanitarian efforts in Bosnia, including airlifts, naval monitoring, and enforcing a no-fly zone. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced plans to help enforce peace agreements with ground forces. The U.S. began airdrops of relief supplies to civilian populations, mainly Muslims, surrounded by fighting. The U.N. Security Council authorized member states to enforce the ban on military flights over Bosnia. NATO, including U.S. planes, started patrolling over Bosnia on April 12, 1993, to enforce the no-fly zone. President Clinton consulted with congressional leaders on potential further action, but consensus was not reached. On June 10, 1993, Secretary of State Christopher announced the deployment of 300 U.S. troops to join the effort. In 1993, Secretary of State Christopher announced the deployment of 300 U.S. troops to join a U.N. peacekeeping force in Macedonia to prevent the spill over of the war in Bosnia. President Clinton reported this action as consistent with the War Powers Resolution on July 9, 1993. There were discussions about the U.S. potentially supplying 25,000 NATO forces out of 50,000 to enforce U.N. decisions in Bosnia, leading to proposals for congressional approval. In 1993, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole proposed an amendment requiring Congress approval for introducing more U.S. forces into former Yugoslavia. The Clinton Administration promised to consult with Congress before committing troops to peace operations. Congress passed a provision in the Defense Appropriations Act stating funds should not be used for new missions in Bosnia without prior authorization. This was supported by Senate leaders Mitchell and Dole. At the NATO summit in Brussels in January 1994, President Clinton and other leaders threatened air strikes on Serb positions to save Sarajevo. In February, Clinton reported expanded US participation in UN and NATO efforts in former Yugoslavia. In March, US planes shot down 4 Serbian planes in the \"no-fly zone.\" In April, US planes bombed Bosnian Serbian nationalist positions around Gorazde after shelling of the \"safe area.\" In August and September 1994, U.S. and NATO forces conducted airstrikes on Bosnian Serbian nationalist positions in retaliation for attacks on U.N. peacekeepers. In November, a coalition of planes bombed a Serb airfield in Croatia. In Congress, there were calls for greater involvement in decisions regarding the conflict in Bosnia. Senator Dole introduced a bill to end the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Leader George Mitchell introduced an amendment authorizing NATO support for UNPROFOR forces in safe areas, use of airpower in Sarajevo, and air strikes against Serb weapons if attacked. The amendment favored lifting the arms embargo with no unilateral action and no deployment of U.S. ground troops in Bosnia without Congressional approval. The Senate passed both the Dole and Mitchell amendments on May 12, 1994, showing bipartisan support for aiding Bosnians in self-defense. The House did not act on the measure. The Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 (P.L. 103-337) provided the sense of Congress that if the Bosnian Serbs did not accept the Contact Group proposal by October 15, 1994, the President should introduce a U.N. Security Council resolution to end the arms embargo by December 1, 1994. The United States stopped enforcing the embargo as a result. Additionally, the Defense Appropriations Act, FY1995 (P.L. 103-335) stated that funds should not be used for deploying U.S. Armed Forces in Bosnia without specific purposes. President Clinton reported the deployment of U.S. combat-equipped aircraft in Bosnia to enforce the no-fly zone and support U.N. forces in Croatia. Approximately 500 U.S. soldiers were stationed in Macedonia as part of UNPREDEP. U.S. forces also assisted in refugee and embargo operations in the region. Clinton authorized the use of U.S. combat and support aircraft in NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb Army forces in Bosnia. During NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb Army forces threatening U.N.-declared safe areas, the House passed an amendment to the FY1996 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. The amendment required consultation with Congress before deploying U.S. forces to Bosnia, but the conference report was rejected by the House on September 29, 1995. The House rejected a conference report on H.R. 2126 in 1995, which did not include language on Bosnia due to the President's objections. The Senate passed a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to H.R. 2076, stating no funds should be used for U.S. combat troops in Bosnia without Congress approval. Secretary of State Christopher and Secretary of Defense faced criticism for the Administration's Bosnian policy in October 1995. In October 1995, Secretary of State Christopher, Secretary of Defense Perry, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Shalikashvili testified before House and Senate Committees on Bosnia policy. President Clinton considered deploying 20,000 American ground forces for a NATO peacekeeping operation. Secretary Christopher stated that the President would not be bound by a Congress resolution prohibiting sending U.S. forces into Bosnia without prior approval. However, President Clinton later expressed willingness to seek Congress support for the commitment of U.S. troops to a NATO implementation force in Bosnia. President Clinton expressed willingness to seek Congress support for the deployment of U.S. troops to a NATO implementation force in Bosnia after a peace agreement is reached. The House passed a resolution stating that no U.S. forces should be deployed in Bosnia without congressional approval. Clinton assured Congress that he would request support before sending American forces to Bosnia, while also asserting his constitutional prerogatives in the matter. On November 17, 1995, the House passed H.R. 2606 to restrict funds for deploying US Armed Forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina without specific appropriation. Secretary of Defense Perry announced the deployment of 1,400 US military personnel as part of the NATO Implementation Force in Bosnia. President Clinton ordered the deployment of 1,500 U.S. military personnel to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia as part of a NATO 'enabling force' to prepare for the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR). Additionally, roughly 3,000 other U.S. military personnel were deployed to Hungary, Italy, and Croatia to establish infrastructure for the enabling force and IFOR. Congress addressed the issue of U.S. ground troop deployments in Bosnia before the final peace agreement was signed in Paris on December 14, 1995. On December 13, 1995, the House debated H.R. 2770, which aimed to prevent the deployment of U.S. ground troops in Bosnia as part of a peacekeeping operation. The bill was defeated by a narrow margin of 210-218. Another nonbinding measure, H.Res. 302, expressing concerns about the deployment of ground troops to Bosnia, was approved by a vote of 287-141. It called for reliance on the judgment of the U.S. ground commander in Bosnia. The U.S. government should provide sufficient resources for the safety of troops in Bosnia. The House defeated a resolution supporting U.S. troops in Bosnia. The Senate also considered measures related to Bosnia and troop deployments, with one bill being defeated. The Senate defeated H.R. 2606, a bill prohibiting funds for U.S. participation in Bosnia peacekeeping. They also rejected S.Con.Res. 35 opposing Clinton's troop deployment but supporting troops sent. However, they passed S.J.Res. 44 supporting troops deployment for one year despite reservations about Clinton's decision. The President may deploy troops to Bosnia for one year if he determines that the mission is limited to implementing the military annex to the peace agreement and protecting the peacekeeping force. The US will lead an international effort to provide equipment and training to the Muslim-Croat Federation for self-defense. Clinton must submit a detailed report on the armament effort within 30 days and provide regular updates to Congress on the peace implementation. President Clinton deployed approximately 20,000 U.S. military personnel to participate in the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia, notifying Congress on December 21, 1995, in accordance with the War Powers Resolution. The House and Senate did not reconcile conflicting elements of Bosnia-related measures passed on December 13, 1995, as no final consensus was reached on a specific measure due to the deployment occurring before the Dayton Accords were formally signed. President Clinton deployed 20,000 U.S. military personnel to participate in the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia. Approximately 5,000 U.S. military personnel were deployed in other former Yugoslav states, primarily in Croatia. Additionally, about 7,000 U.S. support forces were deployed to various regional states in support of IFOR's mission. In December 1996, President Clinton agreed to provide up to 8,500 ground troops for a NATO-led follow-on force in Bosnia called the Stabilization Force (SFOR). President Clinton's deployment of U.S. military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina under the War Powers Resolution led to renewed controversy when he later committed forces to a NATO-led operation in Kosovo. This action sparked a major policy debate over the extent of U.S. military involvement in Kosovo and resulted in a lawsuit by Members of Congress alleging violations of the War Powers Resolution and the Constitution. President Clinton deployed U.S. military forces in Yugoslavia without Congress authorization, leading to the Kosovo controversy. Air strikes began on March 24, 1999, in response to violence against ethnic Albanians. The Senate passed a resolution authorizing military operations, and the House voted on U.S. participation in the NATO operation in Kosovo. On April 28, 1999, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1569, prohibiting the deployment of U.S. ground forces in Yugoslavia without specific authorization. They also defeated resolutions to remove U.S. forces and declare war on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On April 30, 1999, Representative Tom Campbell and 17 other members of the House filed suit in federal District Court seeking a ruling requiring the President to obtain authorization from Congress before continuing military action against Yugoslavia. The Senate, on May 4, 1999, tabled a joint resolution that would authorize the President to use force in Yugoslavia. On May 6, 1999, the House defeated an amendment to the defense appropriations bill that would have prohibited the use of U.S. ground forces to invade Yugoslavia. On May 20, 1999, Congress cleared an emergency appropriations bill for the existing U.S. Kosovo operation. The Senate also tabled amendments restricting military operations in Kosovo on May 24, 1999. The Specter amendment prohibited funds for deploying U.S. ground troops to Yugoslavia without authorization. A Senate amendment by Senator Bob Smith aimed to restrict military operations in Yugoslavia unless Congress approved specific authorization. Representative Campbell sued over the violation of the War Powers Resolution regarding U.S. forces in Kosovo after 60 days. On June 8, 1999, Federal District Judge Paul L. Friedman dismissed a suit by Representative Campbell and others challenging President Clinton's military activities in Yugoslavia. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing. Representative Campbell appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which agreed to hear the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia agreed to hear Representative Campbell's appeal challenging President Clinton's military activities in Yugoslavia. On February 18, 2000, the appeals court affirmed the District Court's opinion that Campbell lacked standing to sue the President. Campbell then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on October 2, 2000, refused to hear the case, upholding the appeals court's decision. Meanwhile, on June 10, 1999, Yugoslavia agreed to NATO conditions for a cease-fire in Kosovo. On June 10, 1999, the House of Representatives approved funding for military operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, while President Clinton directed the deployment of 7,000 U.S. military personnel to join the NATO-led security force in Kosovo. President Clinton directed the deployment of 1,500 U.S. military personnel to other countries in the region in support of the NATO-led security force (KFOR) in Kosovo in the summer of 1999. The Congress had not reached a consensus on actions in Yugoslavia, and a U.S. District Court dismissed a congressional lawsuit attempting to stop presidential military action in Yugoslavia without prior congressional authorization. President Aristide signed an agreement for his restoration on October 30, with the UN and OAS overseeing compliance. President Clinton offered troops to help retrain Haitian forces, but armed civilians resisted their landing on October 11. Due to Haiti's non-compliance, the UN Security Council reinstated sanctions on October 13, and U.S. ships began enforcing the embargo on October 20. Senator Dole proposed an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill requiring congressional authorization for U.S. military operations in Haiti, unless certain conditions were met. Section 8147 of P.L. 103-139 outlined the criteria for funds to be used for military operations in Haiti. President Clinton reported on the enforcement of the embargo in Haiti, with U.S. naval forces boarding 712 vessels. The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 917 to tighten the embargo, and President Clinton announced further steps to pressure Haiti's military leaders, including sealing the border with the Dominican Republic and detaining ships violating sanctions. As conditions in Haiti deteriorated, President Clinton mentioned the possibility of using force. On May 24, 1994, the House adopted the Goss amendment expressing the need for congressional authorization before any military action in Haiti. However, on June 9, the House reversed its decision and rejected the amendment. On June 27, a point of order was sustained against an amendment prohibiting funds for U.N. peacekeeping operations in Haiti. On June 29, 1994, the Senate repassed a provision related to U.N. peacekeeping operations in Haiti but rejected a measure for advance congressional authorization. On August 5, an amendment prohibiting the President from using U.S. Armed Forces in Haiti without prior authorization was rejected. President Clinton obtained U.N. Security Council authorization for an invasion on July 31. President Clinton ordered military reserve and two aircraft carriers into the region, warning military dictators to leave or face forced removal by the United States. President Clinton ordered military dictators to leave Haiti or face forced removal by the United States. A plan was outlined for military action to remove the dictators from power and restore Haiti's democratically elected government. A negotiating team led by former President Jimmy Carter was sent to Haiti, leading to an agreement for the military leaders to step down by October 15 and the introduction of troops from an international coalition. The international coalition agreement to restore democratic government in Haiti was made possible by the credible threat of multinational force. President Clinton reported to Congress on the deployment of U.S. forces in accordance with the War Powers Resolution, with a peak of 21,000 troops in Haiti. The mission still had risks, but efforts were made to minimize them, and the U.S. presence was not intended to be open-ended. The U.S. forces in Haiti, totaling 21,000 troops, were involved in hostilities, including a firefight where 10 Haitian resisters were killed. The House and Senate supported the prompt withdrawal of U.S. forces, with a plan for a UN peacekeeping force to replace them. The House debated on authorizing the forces until March 1, 1995, ultimately voting against the original contents in favor of the Dellums substitute. The House voted against the original contents and for the Dellums substitute on October 6, stating that the President should have sought congressional approval before deploying U.S. forces to Haiti. The Senate also adopted this language on October 6, and on October 7, the House passed the resolution. President Clinton signed the resolution on October 25, 1994. U.S. forces began to disarm Haitian military and paramilitary forces, and President Aristide returned on October 15, 1994. U.N. peacekeeping forces took over missions from U.S. military forces in Haiti on March 31, 1995. President Clinton reported 2,400 military personnel in Haiti by September 21, 1995. In February 1996, the U.S. Commander of the UNMIH was replaced, and U.S. forces stopped conducting security operations in Haiti, with the majority of military personnel withdrawn by mid-March 1996. A support unit of 300 to 500 troops, primarily engineers, remained in Haiti for public works. In December 1997, President Clinton ordered the Dept. of Defense to maintain hundreds of U.S. troops in Haiti indefinitely. In September 1999, the 106th Congress passed a bill prohibiting DOD funding for a continuous U.S. military presence in Haiti beyond May 31, 2000. Troops were withdrawn by January 2000. On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked planes, leading to devastating attacks in the U.S. with over three thousand casualties. President George W. Bush was in office at the time. After the devastating September 11 attacks in the United States, President George W. Bush declared them as acts of war and vowed to use all resources to conquer the enemy. A joint resolution was discussed with Congress to authorize military action against the responsible parties. The joint resolution titled \"Authorization for Use of Military Force\" was introduced and passed by Congress on September 14, 2001, and signed into law on September 18, 2001. It authorizes the President to use necessary force against nations involved in the September 11 attacks. The joint resolution authorizes the President to use force against nations, organizations, or persons involved in the September 11 attacks to prevent future terrorism. It is intended as specific statutory authorization under the War Powers Resolution and does not supersede its requirements. Notably, it allows military force against \"organizations and persons\" linked to the 2001 attacks. The authorization of military force against \"organizations and persons\" linked to the September 11, 2001 attacks is unprecedented in American history, with the scope of its reach yet to be determined. President George W. Bush praised Congress for passing the historic joint resolution swiftly and wisely. President Bush commended Congress for passing the historic joint resolution swiftly and noted consultations with members of Congress since September 11. He emphasized the President's authority under the Constitution to deter terrorism and maintain the executive branch's position on the use of force. There were concerns in Congress about adherence to reporting requirements under the War Powers Resolution before its enactment. President Bush reported to Congress on his deployment of combat forces in response to terrorist attacks, noting his commitment to consult with Congress. He mentioned the possibility of ordering additional forces to prevent terrorism in various regions. President Bush reported to Congress on October 9, 2001, about the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan to combat Al Qaida terrorists and their Taliban supporters in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks. This military action was part of the campaign against terrorism to disrupt Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations. President Bush and Congress agreed on legislative action after the September 11, 2001 attacks, using S.J.Res. 23 instead of the War Powers Resolution. Bush's military actions were deemed consistent with both resolutions, without formally triggering a withdrawal timetable. In summer 2002, the Bush Administration expressed concerns about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions. President George W. Bush sought congressional and U.N. support in 2002 to address Iraq's violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding its weapons programs. He highlighted Iraq's history of non-compliance since the Gulf War of 1991. President George W. Bush sought congressional and U.N. support in 2002 to address Iraq's violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions, emphasizing the need for disarmament since the Gulf War of 1991. The White House sent a draft joint resolution to key congressional leaders, authorizing the use of military force to enforce compliance with U.N. resolutions and restore peace in the region. This sparked a debate in the Senate over the necessity and scope of a new authorization for the use of force. The Senate debated and adopted H.J.Res. 114 as a modified version of the White House draft resolution on the use of military force in Iraq. The House considered a similar resolution, H.J.Res. 114, which was cosponsored by Speaker Hastert and Minority Leader Gephardt. The House International Relations Committee reported an amended version of the resolution, and the House adopted a rule for debate on October 8, 2002. On October 8, 2002, the House debated and passed H.J.Res. 114 by a vote of 296-133. The Senate also passed the resolution on October 11 by a vote of 77-23. President Bush signed the \"Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution of 2002\" into law on October 16, 2002, emphasizing the unified stance of the United States on the threat posed by Iraq. The President appreciated Congress's support for using force against Iraq but clarified that it did not change the executive branch's long-standing positions on the President's authority to use force. He emphasized that his views on the threat posed by Iraq aligned with Congress's and committed to regular consultations and reports to Congress on relevant matters. The central element of P.L. 107-243 is the authorization for the President to use force. The central element of P.L. 107-243 is the authorization for the President to use the armed forces of the United States as he determines necessary to defend national security against the threat posed by Iraq and enforce relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The statute requires the President to communicate to Congress his determination that diplomatic means will not suffice and that the use of force is consistent with the fight against terrorism. The War Powers Resolution authorizes the President to use force to defend national security against the threat posed by Iraq and enforce UN Security Council resolutions. Congress supports prompt action by the Security Council to ensure Iraq's compliance. The President must report periodically to Congress on relevant matters. P.L. 107-243 grants broad authority to the President to use force, not limited to existing resolutions but includes future ones as well. The President's authority to use force against Iraq under P.L. 107-243 is broader than P.L. 107-40, not requiring a direct link to 9/11. It is limited to Iraq and requires peaceful means to be exhausted first, consistent with the fight against terrorism. The force used must be deemed necessary and appropriate by the President. The President's authority to use force under P.L. 107-243 is not dependent on prior authorization by the U.N. Security Council. During U.S. military operations in Libya, President Obama argued that they did not constitute \"hostilities\" or a \"war\" under the War Powers Resolution and the Constitution. The President believed that statutory authorization from Congress was not needed for military operations in Libya under the War Powers Resolution. He complied with reporting requirements and transferred responsibility to NATO forces, assuming a supporting role in the operation. Since April 23, precision strikes by unmanned aerial vehicles have been conducted in Libya in support of the NATO-led coalition's efforts. The President asserted that these actions were in the national security interests of the United States and within his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. On June 15, 2011, the Obama Administration submitted a report detailing U.S. actions in Libya, including a legal analysis of the President's authority for these actions. The President's authority to take actions in Libya without congressional authorization was based on his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. The U.S. military operations in Libya were deemed consistent with the War Powers Resolution, as they were limited in nature and scope, and did not require further congressional approval. U.S. forces were part of a multinational coalition, playing a supporting role in constrained operations. The multinational coalition in Libya operates under a UN Security Council Resolution to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly zone. US operations involve no sustained fighting, ground troops, casualties, or escalation risks. Legal arguments support the use of UAVs for military actions against terrorists abroad. The President's use of UAVs for military attacks against terrorist targets abroad may not require congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution if it is limited in scope and duration, and does not involve introducing U.S. military forces directly into hostilities. This interpretation allows the President to act based on his Constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. Based on legal memos and reports, the use of UAVs for military attacks abroad may not need congressional approval under the War Powers Resolution if they are limited in scope and duration, and do not involve direct harm to U.S. military personnel. The technology allows for remote attacks, potentially exempting them from the Resolution's requirements. The President authorized the U.S. military to work with Yemen to eliminate the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula. Direct action has been taken against AQAP operatives in Yemen, with the use of UAVs strongly suggested. Similar actions may be taken in the future. The United States is committed to thwarting al-Qa'ida's efforts and will take additional measures to protect its citizens. A classified annex may provide more details on these actions and clarify the use of \"direct action.\" This aligns with the existing statutory language of the War Powers Resolution. The existing statutory language of the War Powers Resolution does not require congressional authorization for the President to use UAVs in military operations against terrorists abroad. The President may believe he should report the use of UAVs in military attacks against terrorists in his supplementary WPR report every six months. Private consultations with congressional leadership about their use may have occurred in individual cases. The President's minimal obligations under the War Powers Resolution regarding the military use of UAVs may require congressional authorization. The Islamic State rapidly expanded control in Iraq, causing concerns for U.S. safety. Congress may need to amend the statute or find alternative solutions with the President. President Obama ordered multiple deployments of U.S. troops to Iraq for security, intelligence gathering, and airstrikes against IS forces. Military operations expanded to Syria and Libya, with periodic reporting to Congress on anti-IS airstrikes. The Trump Administration plans to deploy 1,000 U.S. troops to Syria, expanding the anti-IS military campaign. Questions have been raised in Congress about the President's authority to use military force in Iraq and Syria, with proposals for a new authorization for use of military force targeting the Islamic State. The Administration continues to rely on existing authorizations for the use of military force. The Trump Administration has deployed 1,000 U.S. troops to Syria to expand the anti-IS military campaign. Congress is concerned about the President's authority to use military force in Iraq and Syria, with calls for a new authorization for use of military force against the Islamic State. President Obama began notifying Congress about the military response in Iraq to the Islamic State crisis in June 2014. President Obama made seven WPR notifications for deployments and actions in Iraq, including combat-equipped troop deployments and airstrikes against ISIL forces. Notifications were also made for the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces personnel to provide support and security for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, as well as additional personnel to assess and support Iraqi security forces in confronting the threat posed by ISIL. June 30, 2014: Increased Security Deployment with up to 200 additional U.S. Armed Forces personnel sent to Iraq for security reinforcement. August 8, 2014: Airstrikes and Humanitarian Assistance in Erbil and Mount Sinjar. August 17, 2014: Airstrikes to Assist Iraq in retaking Mosul Dam. September 1, 2014: Airstrikes near Amirli in northern Iraq targeting ISIL forces besieging the town for humanitarian assistance. September 5, 2014: Increased security deployment of 350 troops in Baghdad. September 8, 2014: Airstrikes near Haditha Dam to support Iraqi forces against ISIL. President Obama authorized military operations to address threats and protect U.S. personnel and Iraqi civilians without a war declaration or legislative authorization, relying on his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. The deployments and airstrikes announced in various notifications were conducted under this authority, potentially avoiding triggering the 60-day withdrawal requirement under the War Powers Resolution. President Obama's notifications of airstrikes in August and September 2014 raised questions about whether they triggered the War Powers Resolution (WPR) withdrawal requirement. Analysts and Congress members debated whether multiple notifications for short-term military actions against the same enemy should be considered separately or combined for the 60-day withdrawal period. The timing and characterization of these actions remained uncertain. The Obama Administration conducted airstrikes in August and September 2014, raising questions about the War Powers Resolution withdrawal requirement. The airstrikes in Mount Sinjar, Mosul Dam, and Amirli were short-term operations by U.S. Armed Forces to halt ISIL's advance and protect Iraqi citizens. These actions were completed within a few days, with troops not engaged in hostilities afterward. The Obama Administration conducted airstrikes in August and September 2014 to protect Iraqi citizens from ISIL. Some analysts questioned if the frequent notifications to Congress were to inform about ongoing military actions or to determine the 60-day deadline for termination of hostilities under the War Powers Resolution. Consideration of each operation under its own 60-day period could undermine the WPR's objective. The War Powers Resolution's goal of limiting prolonged military engagements without congressional approval may be compromised by small, isolated military actions that do not constitute a larger campaign against an enemy. Presidents have historically notified Congress of limited military deployments and operations, often involving individual strikes or defensive actions, under the War Powers Resolution. President Obama initially relied on Article II authority for military action against the Islamic State but later shifted to using existing authorizations for the military campaign. The 2001 and 2002 AUMFs were cited as providing legislative basis for U.S. military strikes in Iraq and Syria, including against the Islamic State and the Khorasan Group of Al Qaeda in Syria. President Obama initially used Article II authority for military action against the Islamic State but later relied on the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs as a legislative basis for U.S. military strikes in Iraq and Syria. The Trump Administration also argues that existing legislative authority covers military operations against the Islamic State. The executive branch has relied on the 2001 AUMF to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, authorizing limited U.S. military strikes against Al Qaeda in other countries. President Obama's use of the 2001 AUMF to target the Islamic State was seen as an expansion of its authority. The 2002 AUMF authorizes the President to use U.S. Armed Forces to defend national security against threats posed by Iraq. There are differing views on whether the 2002 AUMF is still necessary after the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011. Executive branch officials during the Obama Administration supported repealing the 2002 AUMF, while others argue that it is still relevant despite its focus on Saddam Hussein's regime and WMD programs. The 2002 AUMF's authorization language is broad, referring to a \"continuing threat\" from Iraq. It provided authority for the U.S. military presence in Iraq from the fall of Saddam Hussein to its 2011 withdrawal. The IS threat in Iraq could breathe new life into the 2002 AUMF authority. Former supporters of Saddam Hussein may be linked to the Islamic State. Legislative proposals have been introduced in response. Several legislative proposals have been introduced in response to presidential decisions to deploy U.S. Armed Forces against the Islamic State. Some Members of Congress have suggested restricting military action under the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, repealing these authorizations, and creating a new standalone AUMF for military force against the Islamic State. Additionally, proposals related to the War Powers Resolution have been introduced, possibly influenced by current U.S. military actions against the Islamic State. Some Members of Congress proposed legislation to require the President to withdraw troops from Iraq or seek a new authorization for the use of military force. A concurrent resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives, directing the President to remove US Armed Forces from Iraq within 30 days, except those needed to protect diplomatic facilities and personnel. H.Con.Res. 105 was amended to prohibit the deployment or maintenance of US Armed Forces in sustained combat roles in Iraq without specific statutory authorization. It passed the House with a vote of 370-40 and was referred to the Senate Committee on July 28, 2014. After President Obama ordered airstrikes against IS forces in Iraq in August 2014, Congress focused on crafting a new authorization for military force against the Islamic State (IS AUMF). Several proposed IS AUMFs were introduced in September 2014 with provisions to define and limit U.S. military engagement, reacting to the broad interpretation of the 2001 AUMF by the executive branch. Several proposed IS AUMFs were introduced in September 2014 with provisions to define and limit U.S. military engagement, including restrictions on the type of military action, geographic area, lawful targets, and duration of authority. One proposal, S.J.Res. 47 (113 th Congress), was debated and reported favorably to the Senate but no further action was taken. President Obama also presented a draft proposal for a new IS AUMF in February 2015. The proposed IS AUMF would authorize the use of U.S. Armed Forces against the Islamic State and associated persons or forces, with limitations on enduring offensive ground combat operations. The authorization would terminate three years after enactment, with the President required to report to Congress every six months on actions taken. Multiple new IS AUMFs have been introduced by Members of Congress, but many lack provisions limiting the authority granted. Several legislative proposals have been introduced regarding the President's authority to use military force against the Islamic State. Some proposals include a three-year sunset provision, while others aim to limit the President's use of force. For example, H.Con.Res. 55 (114th Congress) directed the President to remove U.S. Armed Forces deployed in Iraq and Syria after August 7, 2014, but failed to pass in the House. Additionally, an amendment was offered in the 114th Congress to limit military strikes in Libya. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017 included provisions prohibiting the use of funds for hostilities in Libya in violation of the War Powers Resolution. The House version of the Defense appropriations bill in the 115th Congress also included provisions restricting the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces in contravention of the War Powers Resolution. Various proposals to repeal or sunset the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs have been introduced in relation to the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic State. Proposed repeals of the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs have been introduced before and after President Obama's reliance on them for military actions against IS. The question of presidential reporting and use of military force authorities arose after casualties among U.S. Armed Forces in Niger in 2017. In western Niger, U.S. partners were ambushed during a reconnaissance patrol as part of counterterrorism operations in the Sahel region. The Islamic State in the Greater Sahel (ISGS) was responsible for the attack. A Department of Defense investigation found that U.S. forces were exposed to potential harm due to improper actions during the patrol. Another ISGS attack on U.S. and Nigerien troops was reported in December 2017. Presidential reporting to Congress regarding U.S. Armed Forces in Niger began years before the 2017 ambush. President Obama notified Congress of the deployment of U.S. forces to Niger in 2013. On February 22, 2013, President Obama notified Congress of the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces to Niger for intelligence support and sharing with French forces. The forces were armed for their own protection, deployed under the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. Subsequent notifications to Congress reflected an increase in troop numbers from around 40 in early 2013. The number of U.S. troops in Niger increased from around 40 in early 2013 to approximately 800 by June 2018. The mission expanded to include a wide variety of support for African partners in counterterrorism operations in the Sahel region. Congressional members were surprised by the deaths of U.S. troops in Niger and questioned the overall mission and activities of the U.S. Armed Forces in the region. Despite some reporting, there was still uncertainty about U.S. military operations in Niger and the Sahel region. Despite some reporting, there was uncertainty about U.S. military operations in Niger and the Sahel region. Congress had concerns about the lack of adequate information on the expanding scope and purpose of these operations, especially regarding the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces in combat-equipped missions to assist foreign militaries. There were questions about the notification and authorization process for using military force in situations like the one in Niger. The War Powers Resolution requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or situations indicating imminent involvement in hostilities. The definition of hostilities includes a state of confrontation without shots being fired. The War Powers Resolution mandates the President to inform Congress within 48 hours of deploying U.S. Armed Forces in situations indicating imminent involvement in hostilities, which can include a state of confrontation without shots being fired. Deployments to Niger in 2013 initially involved intelligence support but later expanded to include joint patrols with Nigerien forces, potentially leading to a new notification under Section 4(a)(1) if hostilities were to begin. The President did not provide timely notification to Congress under Section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution after the firefight between U.S. and Nigerien forces and ISGS elements in October 2017. However, information about the ambush in Niger was included in the President's December 2017 report. Concerns were raised about U.S. military activities in Niger and the potential for further hostilities in other foreign countries where U.S. Armed Forces were engaged. Hostilities in Niger and other foreign countries involving U.S. Armed Forces raised questions about the authorization under the 2001 AUMF. Initially, the Trump Administration claimed troops were operating under Title 10 authority, but later statements suggested otherwise. The attackers in Niger were identified as Islamic State elements. The Islamic State attackers in Niger were identified as ISGS, a force associated with ISIS. U.S. Special Operations Forces had authority to conduct counterterrorism operations with Nigerien partners targeting key ISIS-GS members. The Administration confirmed that the 2001 AUMF applied to the use of military force in Niger in response to attacks by ISIS elements. The 2001 AUMF was used to authorize the U.S. military force in Niger in response to ISIS attacks. The Department of Defense also cited the \"collective self-defense supplemental rule of engagement\" for military actions in Niger and other foreign countries. Some argue that concepts allowing ongoing military force without congressional authorization could complicate the War Powers Resolution. This may lead to more situations where presidential notifications report combat deployments without hostilities, making it harder for Congress to engage in a timely manner on the details of military force use. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have led a coalition in a military campaign in Yemen to restore the government and target Houthi forces. The US has provided support for these operations, focusing on Houthi missile force targets. The United States has provided support to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, including air-to-air refueling, intelligence support, and military advice. In November 2018, the US announced it would cease air-to-air refueling of Saudi and Emirati aircraft in the counter-Houthi campaign. Since 2015, U.S. refueling missions have supported Saudi and Emirati aircraft in the counter-Houthi campaign in Yemen. Saudi forces have imposed strict limits on vessel transit to Yemen to counter weapons proliferation to the Houthi, contributing to shortages of essential goods. These limits, along with ongoing conflict and infrastructure disruption, have led to a humanitarian emergency in Yemen, with U.N. officials warning of up to 14 million at risk. As of November 2018, U.N. officials have warned that 14 million Yemenis are at risk of famine due to the ongoing conflict and disruptions of shipments of food, fuel, and goods. Military operations by the KSA-led coalition have caused civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure. Saudi Arabia and the UAE pledge financial support to relief efforts while carrying out military campaigns in Yemen. In December 2018, parties in the Yemen conflict met in Stockholm for talks that led to a ceasefire agreement with UN assistance. Despite initial progress with troop withdrawals from Hodeidah, fighting has escalated in the north, raising doubts about the ceasefire's durability. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the Saudi military's actions and US involvement in the conflict. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about US involvement in the KSA-led campaign in Yemen, arguing that it requires a new authorization from Congress. A resolution introduced by Representative Ro Khanna aims to remove US Armed Forces from hostilities in Yemen, except for operations against Al Qaeda, within 30 days of adoption. The resolution H.Con.Res. 81 aims to end US involvement in the conflict between Saudi-led forces and the Houthi-Saleh alliance in Yemen by prohibiting the provision of mid-air refueling services to Saudi and UAE warplanes. The House adopted expedited procedures for the resolution, delaying its operation until November 2, 2017. The House adopted a motion stating that Section 7 of the WPR should not apply to H.Con.Res. 81, and agreed to consider a separate resolution on the situation in Yemen, H.Res. 599. The House later voted 366-30 to adopt H.Res. 599 on November 13, 2017. The Senate introduced S.J.Res. 54 on February 28, 2018, requiring the removal of U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Yemen, except for forces fighting Al Qaeda. The resolution relied on Section 1013 of the Department of State Authorization Act, rather than the War Powers Resolution. On March 20, 2018, Senator Sanders motioned to discharge S.J.Res. 54 from the Foreign Relations Committee, but Senator Corker moved to table the motion citing ongoing oversight over Yemen. The motion to table was adopted by a vote of 55-44. On September 26, 2018, H.Con.Res. 138 was introduced by Representative Khanna and 26 cosponsors to disapprove U.S. military activities in Yemen. H.Con.Res. 138 was introduced to disapprove U.S. military activities in Yemen, referencing the War Powers Resolution and the Authorization for Use of Military Force. The House Rules Committee voted to rescind the expedited consideration privilege for H.Con.Res. 138, which aimed to disapprove U.S. military activities in Yemen. The full House then adopted H.Res. 1142, effectively removing the privilege for H.Con.Res. 138. Khanna introduced H.Con.Res. 142, identical to H.Con.Res. 138. In the Senate, S.J.Res. 54 became pending business, with Senator Sanders motioning to discharge the disapproval resolution for debate. The Senate voted 63-37 to clear the way for debate on the measure. Senate consideration of S.J.Res. 54 proceeded in December 2018 under Section 601(b) procedure. Senator Sanders made a motion to proceed to consideration on December 12. Senator Sanders motioned to proceed to consideration on December 12, 2018, which the Senate adopted by a 60-39 vote. The Senate also agreed, by a vote of 96-3, that any amendments offered must be germane to the subject of U.S. involvement in Yemen. The debate on S.J.Res. 54 raised issues regarding U.S. military activities in support of the KSA-led campaign and the application of expedited consideration procedures. Supporters argued that these activities constituted \"hostilities\" under the War Powers Resolution. Supporters of the resolution argued that U.S. involvement in the Yemen war, without Congressional authorization, was unconstitutional and must end. Opponents contended that U.S. support to the KSA-led coalition did not constitute \"hostilities\" under the War Powers Resolution as U.S. forces were not directly engaged in military action against Houthi forces. Proponents of the resolution argued that U.S. support operations in the Yemen war were not considered hostilities under the War Powers Resolution. They believed that ending military assistance to the KSA-led campaign and shifting to diplomatic solutions would alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Some senators also criticized the Saudi regime's human rights violations. The Senate debated U.S. support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, with arguments for and against continued involvement. Proponents believed ending military assistance would help alleviate the humanitarian crisis, while opponents raised concerns about potential threats to U.S. interests and national security. Amendments to the resolution were also discussed and voted on. The Senate debated and voted on amendments to S.J.Res. 54 on December 13, 2018. Amendments included defining \"hostilities\" to include refueling of non-U.S. aircraft in the Yemen conflict, ensuring no disruption to U.S. military operations and cooperation with Israel, and requiring reporting on risks of ceasing support to the KSA-led coalition. Two amendments limiting the resolution's prohibitions were not adopted. The Senate passed S.J.Res. 54, calling for the removal of US Armed Forces from unauthorized hostilities in Yemen. In the House, H.J.Res. 37 with the same language was introduced but no action was taken before the end of the 115th Congress. The House Foreign Affairs Committee considered H.J.Res. 37, a resolution regarding U.S. policy in the Arabian peninsula. Opponents argued that U.S. support operations in Yemen were not \"hostilities,\" while supporters stated that U.S. actions in Yemen constituted direct involvement in an armed conflict. The committee voted 25-17 to report H.J.Res. 37 to the full House for passage. On February 11, 2019, the House Rules Committee reported on H.Res. 122, allowing for immediate consideration of H.J.Res. 37 in the House. The resolution sparked debate on U.S. military support for the KSA-led coalition in Yemen, with supporters arguing it was counter to American interests and values, while opponents believed removing support would embolden Iran and terrorist groups in Yemen. Members also disagreed on the interpretation of the War Powers Resolution and Section 1013. Members continued to debate the definition of hostilities and the use of expedited consideration procedures under the War Powers Resolution and Section 1013. An amendment was passed to ensure no hindrance to U.S. intelligence activities. A motion to recommit H.J.Res. 37 to the House Foreign Affairs Committee with an instruction to combat anti-Semitism globally was also approved unanimously. The House passed H.J.Res. 37 with a vote of 248 to 177 and transmitted it to the Senate. However, the Senate Parliamentarian ruled that certain provisions were not germane to the resolution's subject, removing its privileged status for expedited consideration. The Senate Parliamentarian ruled that provisions combating anti-Semitism in H.J.Res. 37 were not germane, leading Senators to push for consideration of their joint resolution, S.J.Res. 7, without the language. Disagreements between the executive branch and Congress over the definition of \"hostilities\" under the War Powers Resolution have arisen in the context of U.S. support for the KSA-led counter-Houthi campaign. The definition of \"hostilities\" under the War Powers Resolution is debated between Congress and the executive branch in the context of U.S. support for the KSA-led counter-Houthi campaign. Congress's intent suggests a broader definition of hostilities to include situations with a clear danger of armed conflict, not just active engagement in fire exchanges. The War Powers Resolution defines \"imminent hostilities\" as a situation with a clear potential for armed conflict, including scenarios like U.S. forces actively exchanging fire with enemy forces or being equipped for combat in a foreign country where conflict is expected. This definition is relevant to U.S. operations in the counter-Houthi campaign in Yemen. The War Powers Resolution defines \"imminent hostilities\" as a situation with a clear potential for armed conflict, including scenarios like U.S. forces actively exchanging fire with enemy forces or being equipped for combat in a foreign country where conflict is expected. This definition is relevant to U.S. operations in Yemen, but it does not clarify if U.S. Armed Forces in noncombat support roles with foreign partner military forces are considered engaged in active hostilities or imminent hostilities. The Trump Administration argues that \"hostilities\" may not include situations where U.S. forces are in noncombat support roles and not actively engaging in armed conflict or facing a clear and present danger of armed conflict. The Trump Administration argues that U.S. military operations in Yemen may not constitute \"hostilities\" if forces are in noncombat support roles. Proponents in Congress argue that U.S. support operations link to offensive strikes by Saudi and Emirati forces, potentially engaging U.S. Armed Forces in armed conflict. The Trump Administration argues that U.S. military operations in Yemen may not constitute \"hostilities\" if forces are in noncombat support roles. Proponents in Congress argue that U.S. support operations link to offensive strikes by Saudi and Emirati forces, potentially engaging U.S. Armed Forces in armed conflict under the interpretive provisions of Section 8 of the WPR. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee aims to prevent unauthorized military support activities and controversial actions in Indochina. The deepening involvement of U.S. forces in Vietnam and Laos without congressional authorization is highlighted. There is concern about the interpretation of introducing U.S. armed forces into active hostilities under Section 4(a)(1) and the confusion it may cause. The text discusses how the presence of U.S. Armed Forces alongside foreign military forces in hostilities may trigger reporting and termination provisions. It clarifies that while the introduction of U.S. forces may not always constitute \"hostilities,\" it can still fall under the definition of introducing U.S. Armed Forces. Section 8(c) of the War Powers Resolution addresses the assignment of U.S. armed forces to foreign forces in hostilities, distinguishing it from an introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities. The executive branch has informed Congress about U.S. military support for Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen in compliance with the Resolution. The Department of Defense argued in a letter to Congress that the limited military support to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen does not constitute U.S. forces being introduced into hostilities, as U.S. personnel were not directly engaged in combat or imminent hostilities. The War Powers Resolution, in existence for four decades, remains controversial regarding its effectiveness in maintaining congressional oversight of armed forces in conflict. Some believe it is sound and has improved communication between branches during crises, serving as a restraint on presidential use of military force. The threat of invoking the Resolution may have influenced decision-making in certain situations. The War Powers Resolution has been controversial for decades, with some seeing it as a tool to maintain congressional oversight of military actions. It has influenced decisions in conflicts like Grenada and Iraq. However, others argue it limits the President's foreign policy effectiveness and should be repealed for giving Congress too much control over military deployment. They believe the time limitation in the Resolution is unconstitutional and impractical. Some argue that Congress has always had the power to control the use of U.S. Armed Forces through appropriations and general lawmaking, with the War Powers Resolution complicating action and diverting attention from key policy questions. Others believe the Resolution has not been effective in limiting presidential actions without congressional consultation, leading to proposals for amendments to strengthen it. Various amendments to the War Powers Resolution have been proposed, including returning to the original Senate version, establishing a congressional consultation group, adding a cutoff of funds, and providing for judicial review. Senator Thomas Eagleton suggested reverting to the original language of the Senate version, requiring prior congressional authorization for deploying forces abroad without a declaration of war, except in certain circumstances. This would eliminate the President's ability to act militarily without authorization within a specific timeframe. Opponents are concerned about exceptions for preemptive attacks or rescuing American citizens. Some proposals aim to amend the War Powers Resolution by shortening the time period for presidential use of armed forces abroad without congressional authorization. Opponents argue that exceptions for preemptive attacks or rescuing American citizens could be abused, while proponents believe the current resolution allows too much leeway for presidential action. The original Senate version required specific congressional authorization for the use of armed forces in hostilities beyond 30 days, extendable by the President with certification of necessity. Some Members of Congress propose amending the War Powers Resolution to replace the automatic troop withdrawal requirement with expedited procedures for authorizing or requiring disengagement. The amendment aims to address concerns about triggering withdrawal by congressional inaction and adversaries waiting out the 60-day period. Additionally, it would deal with the provision for withdrawal by concurrent resolution, which is under scrutiny due to the Chadha decision. Some proposals suggest amending the War Powers Resolution to allow for expedited procedures for authorizing disengagement of U.S. Armed Forces. This would address concerns about triggering withdrawal by congressional inaction and the requirement for withdrawal by concurrent resolution, which is under scrutiny due to the Chadha decision. Some proposals call for new priority procedures for joint resolutions under the War Powers Resolution, including consultations with a specific group of Congress members. Senators Byrd, Nunn, Warner, and Mitchell have proposed regular consultations with a group of 6 members for military actions or veto overrides. Some proposals suggest establishing a Standing Consultative Group of 6 Members for military actions or veto overrides, with the President consulting a larger group of 18 Members. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Lee Hamilton introduced H.R. 3405 to create this group for improved interaction. A proposal suggests establishing a Standing Consultative Group to improve interaction between the executive branch and Congress on the use of U.S. military forces abroad. Members would be appointed by congressional leaders and include representatives from key committees. Another proposal aims to broaden instances requiring the President to consult with Congress. The legislation allows Members of Congress to sue the President or U.S. Armed Forces in court for non-compliance with the War Powers Resolution. Recent court decisions have typically rejected such lawsuits due to lack of standing. Various proposals aim to address this issue by expediting consideration and prescribing judicial remedies. Some proposals suggest creating a Hostilities Act or Use of Force Act to replace the War Powers Resolution. There are concerns about escalating international tension by invoking the Resolution. The question arises whether the Resolution should be amended to regulate the President's involvement in United Nations actions without congressional approval. Alternatively, new legislation could be enacted to clarify the President's authority in such situations. The War Powers Resolution may be amended or new legislation enacted to specify how it applies to United Nations actions, particularly for peacekeeping operations. Appendix A lists reports made to Congress by Presidents under the Resolution, citing their authority as Commander in Chief and any additional legislative authority for their actions. Several reports since 1991 pertain to ongoing operations. Reports since 1991 pertain to ongoing operations previously reported by the President, not new instances of military use overseas. In 1975, President Ford reported using naval vessels, helicopters, and Marines to transport refugees from Danang and other seaports in Vietnam. Monroe Leigh, Legal Adviser to the Department of State, testified that the President directed American naval transports to assist in evacuating refugees from coastal seaports in South Vietnam. President Ford utilized contract vessels to aid in the evacuation of refugees from coastal seaports in Cambodia and Vietnam. The operations involved ground combat Marines, helicopters, and tactical air elements. Congressional leaders were informed of the evacuation plans before the final orders were given. In Vietnam, naval vessels, helicopters, and Marines were used to transport refugees from Danang and other seaports. Monroe Leigh, Legal Adviser to the Department of State, testified about the assistance provided by American naval transports in evacuating refugees from South Vietnam. On April 28, President Ford notified congressional leaders about the final phase of the evacuation of Saigon by military forces. On May 15, he ordered U.S. military forces to rescue the crew of the ship Mayaguez seized by Cambodian naval patrol boats. Administration aides contacted members of Congress regarding the military measures. On April 26, 1980, President Carter reported using aircraft and helicopters in an unsuccessful rescue attempt of American hostages in Iran. The United States, Egypt, and Israel signed an agreement on August 3, 1981, for U.S. participation in a peacekeeping force in the Sinai. President Reagan requested congressional authorization for U.S. participation in a peacekeeping force in the Sinai after Israel withdrew its forces. Congress authorized the deployment of military personnel to the Sinai in the Multinational Force and Observers Participation Resolution. President Reagan reported the deployment of military personnel and equipment to the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai in March 1982. Additionally, President Reagan reported the dispatch of 800 Marines to assist in the withdrawal of members of the Palestine Liberation force from Lebanon in August 1982. President Reagan deployed 1,200 Marines to Lebanon in September 1982 to assist in the restoration of Lebanese government sovereignty, following negotiations with Congress. The deployment was reported in compliance with the War Powers Resolution. President Reagan deployed Marines to Lebanon in September 1982 to assist in restoring Lebanese government sovereignty. In August 1983, two AWACS planes and eight F-15 fighter planes were sent to Sudan to aid Chad against Libyan and rebel forces. The planes were later withdrawn. In response to Marines being fired upon in Lebanon, a report was submitted in accordance with the War Powers Resolution, leading to the authorization for forces to remain for 18 months in P.L. 98-119. On October 25, 1983, President Reagan reported U.S. Army and Marine personnel landing in Grenada to assist in restoring law and order and evacuating U.S. citizens. In March 1986, U.S. forces were attacked by Libyan missiles during freedom of navigation exercises in the Gulf of Sidra, leading to a U.S. missile response. On April 16, 1986, President Reagan reported U.S. bombing strikes on terrorist facilities and military installations in Libya in response to Libyan missile attacks on the Gulf of Sidra. President Reagan reported incidents in the Persian Gulf, including U.S. helicopters being fired upon by Iranian vessels, an attack on a U.S.-flag tanker by an Iranian missile, and the destruction of an Iranian armed platform. The reports were submitted in accordance with the War Powers Resolution. President Reagan reported incidents in the Persian Gulf, including U.S. Armed Forces attacking Iranian oil platforms and vessels in response to the U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts striking a mine. The President called the actions \"necessary and proportionate.\" Additionally, on July 4, 1988, the USS Vincennes and USS Elmer Montgomery fired upon Iranian small craft, sinking two and mistakenly shooting down an Iranian civilian airliner. President Reagan expressed deep regret for the incident. On July 12, two U.S. helicopters were fired at by Iranian boats after responding to a distress call from a tanker. President George H. W. Bush later reported providing combat air patrols to assist the Aquino government in the Philippines. Congressional leaders expressed concern over lack of consultation. President George H. W. Bush ordered U.S. military forces to Panama on December 21, 1989, to protect American citizens and capture General Noriega. Consultation with Congress was not possible due to the rapidly evolving situation. The invasion forces were withdrawn by February 13, 1990. President Bush informed congressional leaders of the impending invasion on December 19, 1989, after the decision was made but before the operation began on December 20 at 1:00 a.m. On August 6, 1990, President George H. W. Bush sent additional security to the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia and evacuated U.S. citizens from Liberia. On August 9, 1990, he deployed U.S. Armed Forces to the Persian Gulf region to defend Saudi Arabia after the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, in accordance with the War Powers Resolution. President Bush held meetings with congressional leaders after the deployment. President Bush deployed forces to the Persian Gulf region in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He held meetings with congressional leaders and relevant committees, but did not consult them in advance of a major buildup of forces. Combat operations against Iraqi forces began on January 16, 1991, as reported to Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution. On January 16, combat operations were initiated against Iraqi forces in Iraq and Kuwait following the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution passed by Congress on January 12 (P.L. 102-1). The President was required to submit reports to Congress every 60 days on efforts to obtain compliance by Iraq with U.N. Security Council resolutions, with exceptions such as the report submitted on June 28, 1993. Additionally, President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. Armed Forces to Somalia on December 8, 1992, in response to a humanitarian crisis and a U.N. Security Council Resolution. President Clinton deployed U.S. forces in Bosnia and Somalia in response to threats to international peace. He cited treaties, laws, and consultations with congressional leaders as authority for the actions. In Bosnia, U.S. forces participated in a NATO air action to enforce a U.N. ban on unauthorized military flights. In Somalia, U.S. forces were deployed in response to attacks against U.N. forces. President Clinton reported military actions in Somalia and Iraq in response to attacks on U.N. forces and an assassination attempt on former President Bush. The actions were in accordance with the War Powers Resolution and applicable treaties and laws. President Clinton reported the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces to Macedonia, Bosnia, and Haiti in accordance with the War Powers Resolution and United Nations Participation Act. Military actions were taken to support enforcement of the U.N. no-fly zone in Bosnia and to enforce a U.N. embargo against Haiti. On January 8, 1994, President Clinton reported the deployment of approximately 300 U.S. Army members to Macedonia as part of the United Nations Protection Force. In February and March 1994, the U.S. expanded its participation in United Nations and NATO efforts in Bosnia, including patrolling the \"no-fly zone\" and shooting down Serbian planes. On April 12, 1994, President Clinton reported U.S. warplanes under NATO command had fired against Bosnian Serb forces in Gorazde. Combat-equipped U.S. military forces were deployed to Burundi for possible evacuation operations in Rwanda. In Macedonia, a reinforced company of 200 personnel was added to the U.S. contingent. On September 21, 1994, President Clinton deployed 1,500 troops to Haiti to restore democracy, later increasing the troop level to 20,000. On November 21, 1994, U.S. combat aircraft were used under NATO to attack Serb bases targeting the town of Bihac in Bosnia. In December 1994, President Clinton reported the U.S. Army contingent in Macedonia continuing its peacekeeping mission. In March 1995, U.S. forces deployed to Somalia to assist in the withdrawal of U.N. forces, and in Haiti, U.S. military forces were also active.
