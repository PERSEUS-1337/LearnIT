    "content": "This report analyzes average Member tenure over time, historical patterns of congressional service, and factors affecting tenure in Congress. Average tenure remained steady in the 19th century but increased in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The average years of service for Members of the 116th Congress was 8.6 years for the House and 10.1 years for the Senate. Factors affecting tenure are also examined in the report. The report examines factors affecting average years of service in Congress, including reelection rates and success rates. Historical trends show that turnover was high in early congressional history, but decreased in the 20th century as careers lengthened. The report also discusses Member tenure distribution over time and cross-chamber experience. The report analyzes factors influencing average years of service in Congress, such as reelection rates and turnover trends. Data from the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress shows that many Representatives and Senators have served for six years or less. Additionally, a significant number of Senators have had previous House experience throughout congressional history. The report analyzes factors influencing average years of service in Congress, such as reelection rates and turnover trends. Data from the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress shows that many Representatives and Senators have served for six years or less. Additionally, a significant number of Senators have had previous House experience throughout congressional history. Member service in each Congress is calculated by dividing total days served by 365.25, with data aggregated to generate summary statistics. The average tenure of Senators and Representatives in each Congress is calculated based on total years of prior service in the chamber as of the first day of the Congress. Vacancies, replacements, and cross-chamber experience are not taken into account in these statistics. Freshman Members are considered to have zero years of prior chamber service. The average years of service for Members in both chambers has generally increased over time. Incoming Representatives had an average of 2.5 years of prior House service in the 19th century, increasing to 9.5 years in the 21st century. Incoming Senators averaged 4.8 years of prior chamber service in the 19th century, increasing to 11.2 years in the 21st century. The Congress with the lowest average years of service among Representatives in the last 50 years was the 1st Congress. In the last 50 years, the 97th Congress had the lowest average years of service among Representatives and Senators, with incoming Representatives averaging 7.4 years of prior service in the House and Senators averaging 7.5 years of prior service in the Senate. The average years of service for Representatives remained steady during the 19th century but began to increase around the turn of the 20th century. In the 116th Congress, the average years of prior service for Representatives was 8.6 years. Don Young is the longest-serving Member in the 116th Congress. In the 116th Congress, Don Young is the longest-serving Representative with approximately 46 years of service. The average years of service among Senators and Representatives have historically been similar, with a steady increase in service years starting in the late 19th and early 20th century. Senators' average prior service remained constant at about four years in the 19th century before steadily rising in the 1880s, tracking the increase in the House by about 20 years. At the start of the 116th Congress, incoming Senators averaged 10.1 years of prior service. At the start of the 116th Congress, incoming Senators averaged 10.1 years of prior service. The longest-serving Senator is Patrick Leahy with 44 years of service. Member seniority is influenced by decisions on seeking reelection, which can result in many first-term Members in the subsequent Congress. Members may choose not to seek reelection for various reasons. The rate of Representatives not seeking reelection has decreased significantly since the mid-19th century. Prior to the 1860s, it was common for over 40% of Representatives not to seek reelection. This trend continued until the late 19th century, and the rate has remained relatively steady at around 11.5% in the 20th and 21st centuries. The success rate of Members seeking reelection in Congress varied over time, with a notable increase in defeats during the 19th century followed by a decline in the 20th century. Short-term variations occurred in high-turnover elections, such as those in 1872, 1890, 1894, and 1932. This data aligns with scholarly assessments of congressional history, indicating turnover in membership during the early history of Congress. During the early history of Congress, turnover in membership was frequent, and resignations were common. Lawmakers in the 18th and early 19th centuries were often \"citizen legislators,\" holding nonpolitical jobs and serving part-time in Congress. In the pre-modern Congress, members came and went rapidly, with few senior members due to the lack of incentives to retain seats. Life in Washington was not pleasant, and power was fluid in the House. After the Civil War, careerism in Congress rose as legislative careers became professionalized, ending the era of the \"citizen legislator.\" Factors like party system strengthening, redistricting practices, and electoral reforms contributed to longer average tenures by the early 20th century. Scholars have noted institutional changes in congressional operations, such as the seniority system, committee system, and advantages of incumbency, which helped Members be effective legislators. Transportation technology also made travel between Washington and home districts easier, potentially increasing the appeal of a longer career. The emergence of national problems elevated the importance of a legislative career, as the federal government took on new responsibilities. This may have led many Members to view congressional office as more desirable than state office, contributing to their desire to remain in Congress. The distribution of service experience among individual Members in Congress is examined from the 1st through 116th Congresses. Figures show the percentage of Members in different categories based on their years of chamber service. In earlier Congresses, a significant portion of the House consisted of Members with no prior chamber experience. In earlier Congresses, a significant portion of the House consisted of Members with no prior chamber experience. Over time, the proportion of Representatives with more than 12 years of service increased, peaking at approximately 34% in the 111th Congress. As of the opening day of the 116th Congress, approximately 24% of the chamber was made up of Representatives with more than 12 years of House service. Despite an increase in longer-tenured Members, more than half the House had Members with six or fewer years of chamber experience in the last four Congresses. The Senate has a smaller proportion of Members with no prior chamber experience compared to the House. This is due to staggered terms and limited turnover from elections. Historically, the largest group of Senators had six years or fewer in the chamber. The percentage of Senators serving more than 12 years increased over time, reaching 10% in the 50th Congress. The percentage of Senators serving more than 12 years has generally increased over the 20th and 21st centuries. The 103rd Congress marked a high point with 47% of Senators serving more than 12 years, while the opening day of the 116th Congress saw this group make up 26% of the chamber. Throughout U.S. history, there has been a common trend of Representatives serving in the Senate after their time in the House. The proportion of Senators with previous House experience has fluctuated between 20% and 45% throughout congressional history. In recent times, over half of Senators in certain Congresses had prior House experience. Additionally, historically, a small number of Members have served in the House after the Senate. In congressional history, the proportion of Senators with previous House experience has varied. In recent times, over half of Senators in some Congresses had prior House experience. The last Representative to have served in the Senate was Claude Pepper, who also served in the House. Senators with prior House experience typically averaged between five and nine years in the House before serving in the Senate. In the 116th Congress, Senators with prior House experience spent an average of 9.3 years in the House before serving in the Senate. There is a variety of congressional service records among individual Members, with some having short tenures and others having longer careers that may end after reelection defeat. Despite longer average careers, there is still significant variation in the length of congressional careers. The institutional and policy contexts influencing Member decisions to seek reelection continue to evolve in the contemporary Congress. The patterns of congressional service tenure have evolved since the 19th century and are likely to continue changing due to institutional factors. The development of the institutional environment makes it unpredictable how service tenure patterns will change in the future."
