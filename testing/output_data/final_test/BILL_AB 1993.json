    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to streamline communication between law enforcement and electronic communication service providers through the addition of Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code, reducing investigation time. This section does not apply solely based on a person or entity being a subscriber or customer of such services. Section 1524.4 of the Penal Code in California requires service providers subject to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to maintain a law enforcement contact process meeting specific criteria for communication with law enforcement agencies. This aims to streamline communication and provide timely updates on requests for assistance. Service providers subject to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in California must file a statement with the Attorney General by July 1, 2017, describing their law enforcement contact process. Any material changes to this process must also be reported. The Attorney General will consolidate these statements into a record available to local law enforcement agencies. The exclusive remedy for a violation of this section is an action brought by the Attorney General for injunctive relief. Service providers in California must file a confidential statement with the Attorney General regarding their law enforcement contact process by July 1, 2017. Any changes to this process must be reported. The Legislature acknowledges that this requirement limits public access to government information, as outlined in the California Constitution. In California, service providers are required to file a confidential statement with the Attorney General regarding their law enforcement contact process by July 1, 2017. This requirement limits public access to government information, as outlined in the California Constitution. The Legislature finds that adding Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code furthers the right of public access to meetings and writings of local public bodies and officials. The bill facilitates communication between law enforcement and service providers to protect public health and safety while limiting access to internal business processes. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts as any costs incurred fall within the scope of the California Constitution."
