    "content": "The Capitol Power Plant Carbon Dioxide Emissions Demonstration Program is outlined in Section 1. Section 118 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include the Capitol Power Plant Carbon Dioxide Emissions Demonstration Program, defining terms like 'Capitol power plant' and 'carbon dioxide energy efficiency'. The Administrator will establish a competitive grant demonstration program for power equipment to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from the Capitol power plant. Eligible entities will receive grants to demonstrate the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal. The Administrator will provide grants on a competitive basis for projects that convert carbon dioxide into useful products, prioritize energy efficiency, and aim to reduce emissions by more than 1. The project aims to reduce air pollutants regulated under the Act by using technology that has been proven effective in at least 3 other facilities, including coal-fired power plants, on a large scale. The entity at the Capitol power plant may receive a grant 5 times the size of their proposed project and an incentive award of up to $50,000 for sustaining operation for 100 days. The program provides grants and incentive awards to entities at the Capitol power plant based on sustained operation periods. $20,000 is given after 200 days of operation, and $20,000 after 300 days. The program terminates 2 years after enactment, with $3,000,000 authorized for appropriations."
