    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Communities of Color Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Act of 2011\". Teenage pregnancy is a critical issue in the United States, with the highest rate among developed nations. Nearly 750,000 teenage girls aged 15-19 become pregnant each year, with 82% of those pregnancies unplanned. The teenage pregnancy rate rose by 3% between 2005 and 2006, after a decrease in the 1990s due to better contraceptive use. Teenage pregnancy costs taxpayers at least $10.9 billion annually and disproportionately affects communities of color. Teenage pregnancy is a significant issue in the United States, with high rates among Latinas, African-American, and Native American girls. Research shows that early parenthood can have negative impacts on education, employment, and financial stability. Additionally, teenage dating violence is a concern. Research indicates that teenage dating violence is linked to higher rates of teenage and unplanned pregnancies. Adolescent girls in abusive relationships are three times more likely to become pregnant. Promoting healthy relationships is crucial in preventing these pregnancies. Programs to reduce teenage pregnancies are being implemented through research and demonstration projects aimed at providing youth in minority communities with information and skills to prevent pregnancies and improve overall health and well-being. The Secretary awards competitive grants to eligible entities for programs in minority communities to prevent teen pregnancy and promote healthy relationships. Priority is given to applicants with a history of working effectively with these communities. Funds are used to provide information and skills as described in the program. The grants are used to provide information and skills through various settings like classroom-based, after-school, community-based, workforce development, health care, and collaboration with systems serving at-risk youth. Program requirements include age-appropriate and evidence-based information and skills. The grants aim to provide evidence-based, culturally sensitive information on contraceptives and healthy relationships to teens. Up to 10% of the funding is allocated for independent evaluations to assess the effectiveness of these activities in changing teen attitudes and behaviors. The Secretary reserves 5% of the total funding for grants to Indian tribes and tribal organizations. An eligible entity includes state, local, or tribal agencies, schools, nonprofits, and community organizations to prevent exclusion of smaller groups. The Secretary ensures grants under this section do not prevent community-based organizations with a history of working effectively with adolescents in minority or immigrant communities from receiving funding. \"SEC. 399OO-2.

The Secretary will provide grants for research on teenage pregnancies among youth in foster care or juvenile justice systems, investigating factors such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and environmental influences on the risk of teenage pregnancy or dating abuse. Research will focus on factors influencing teenage pregnancies and dating abuse among youth in foster care or juvenile justice systems, including acculturation, access to healthcare, history of violence or abuse, and strategies to address disparities in minority or immigrant communities. Effective interventions and media campaigns for healthy relationship development, dating violence prevention, and teenage pregnancy will also be explored. Research will prioritize strategies for addressing high rates of unintended teenage pregnancy through programs emphasizing healthy relationships and violence prevention. Priority will be given to research that incorporates interdisciplinary approaches, community-based participatory research, and translational research. The text chunk \"SEC. 399OO-4. ADOLESCENT HEALTH WORK GROUP\" is a section related to the establishment of a group focused on adolescent health. The Secretary must direct the Interagency Adolescent Health Work Group to include teen dating violence prevention and healthy teen relationship strategies, focusing on minority communities.
