    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to define terms related to telemedicine, including \"asynchronous store and forward,\" \"distant site,\" \"health care provider,\" and \"originating site.\" Telehealth is the delivery of healthcare services via technology to facilitate diagnosis, treatment, and patient education. It includes synchronous interactions like video calls and asynchronous store and forward transfers. Prior to delivering healthcare via telehealth, the provider must inform the patient and obtain consent. Patients can still receive in-person care if they agree to telehealth. Non-compliance is considered unprofessional conduct. This section does not change the scope of practice for healthcare providers. All laws on health information confidentiality apply to telehealth. Excludes patients under Department of Corrections. Hospitals can grant privileges based on medical staff recommendations. The Legislature authorizes hospitals to grant privileges for telehealth services, including telemedicine. Telehealth is recognized as a legitimate way to receive healthcare without in-person contact with providers. A health care service plan cannot require in-person contact before payment for telehealth services, and cannot limit the setting where services are provided before payment is made. This is subject to the terms of the contract between the enrollee, the plan, and the providers. The requirements of this section apply to health care service plan and Medi-Cal managed care plan contracts with the State Department of Health Care Services. It clarifies that telehealth cannot be mandated if deemed inappropriate by the provider or if the patient prefers in-person treatment. A health care service plan must provide coverage and reimbursement for telehealth services to the same extent as in-person services. Reimbursement rates for telehealth services should be at least as favorable as those for in-person services. Copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles for telehealth services can be applied, but must be as favorable to the patient as those for in-person services. The health care service plan must not restrict coverage or interfere with the provider-patient relationship in telehealth services. Utilization reviews of telehealth services are allowed, but must be conducted similarly to in-person services. This section does not change the scope of practice for healthcare providers or allow services in unauthorized settings. Telehealth services must adhere to laws on confidentiality and patient rights. The Legislature recognizes telehealth as a valid way to receive healthcare without in-person contact. No health insurer can require in-person contact between a healthcare provider and a patient before payment for telehealth services. Insurers cannot limit the setting where telehealth services are provided before payment is made. Telehealth services should be physician- or practitioner-guided and patient-preferred. Health insurers must cover telehealth services to the same extent as in-person services. Patients have the right to choose in-person care over telehealth if preferred. Health insurers must reimburse providers for telehealth services at a rate equal to in-person services. Copayments and deductibles for telehealth can be applied but must be favorable to the insured. Insurers cannot limit coverage based on telehealth or interfere with the provider-patient relationship. This section clarifies that health insurers can conduct utilization reviews for telehealth services, ensuring they are done in the same manner as reviews for in-person services. It also emphasizes that telehealth services must adhere to laws regarding patient confidentiality and medical information rights. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties within the meaning of the Government Code."
