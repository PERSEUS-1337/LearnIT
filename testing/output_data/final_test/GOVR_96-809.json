Charitable organizations can receive tax-deductible contributions but must not have lobbying as a substantial part of their activities. In 1976, a \"safe harbor\" was introduced for 501(c)(3) organizations to comply with specific percentage limitations on lobbying. The \"safe harbor\" introduced in 1976 allows 501(c)(3) organizations to elect specific percentage limitations on lobbying expenditures to maintain tax-exempt status. The expenditure test limits are as follows: 20% of the first $500,000, 15% of the next $500,000, 10% of the following $500,000, and 5% of expenditures over $1,500,000, with a total limit of $1,000,000 on lobbying activities. There is also a separate 25% limit for \"grass roots\" lobbying activities. The tax code limits lobbying by charitable organizations, covering both direct and grass roots lobbying. Direct lobbying involves direct communications to legislators, while grass roots lobbying involves advocacy to the public to contact legislators. Understanding the definitions and exemptions of lobbying is crucial to comply with expenditure limitations. The IRS distinguishes between different types of lobbying activities for organizations, noting that clear advocacy of specific legislation is not considered grass roots lobbying unless it includes an encouragement to action. Not all communications to legislators are classified as direct lobbying. The tax code exemptions for lobbying activities include nonpartisan analysis, technical advice at the request of a governmental body, and self-defense communications before governmental bodies. The IRS distinguishes between different types of lobbying activities for organizations, noting that advocacy of specific legislation is not considered grassroots lobbying unless it includes an encouragement to action. Tax-exempt organizations can engage in nonpartisan analysis, provide technical advice at the request of a governmental body, and communicate self-defense issues before governmental bodies without tax consequences. Organizations under section 501(c)(4) are described as civic leagues or social welfare organizations operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare. Lobbying or advocacy activities by these organizations are generally allowed as long as they relate to their exempt function. The Supreme Court upheld limitations on lobbying by 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, allowing them to establish a 501(c)(4) affiliate for unlimited lobbying and advocacy. The 501(c)(4) affiliate must be separately incorporated and funded independently from the tax-deductible contributions to the parent organization. While 501(c)(4) organizations have unrestricted lobbying activities, receiving federal funds imposes restrictions on lobbying. Labor and agricultural organizations are tax-exempt under section 501(c)(5), while business trade associations and chambers of commerce are also exempt. Veterans' organizations have unique lobbying privileges compared to other non-profits, allowing unlimited lobbying activities while benefiting from tax-deductible contributions. This special tax position is a congressional policy choice to support those who have served in the armed forces. Private foundations are generally restricted from lobbying due to tax penalties. Private foundations are generally restricted from lobbying due to tax penalties, which penalize expenditures for most lobbying activities. They receive funding from sources other than the general public or government, such as large bequests and investment income. Non-profit groups receiving federal grants and loans are also subject to restrictions on lobbying activities. The Simpson Amendment of 1995 places restrictions on lobbying activities of tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations receiving federal grants or loans. The provision prohibits these organizations from engaging in lobbying activities, even with their own funds, if they receive federal funding. The term \"contract\" was later removed from the provision, leaving the prohibition on lobbying activities with an organization's own funds as a condition to receive federal money. The Simpson Amendment of 1995 restricts lobbying activities of tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations receiving federal grants or loans. It prohibits these organizations from engaging in lobbying activities if they receive federal funding, allowing unlimited lobbying for 501(c)(4) contractors of the federal government. The provision aims to separate lobbying activities from organizations receiving federal funds. The Simpson Amendment of 1995 aims to separate lobbying activities from tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations receiving federal grants or loans. It allows unlimited lobbying for 501(c)(4) contractors of the federal government, while prohibiting lobbying activities for organizations receiving federal funding. Senator Simpson suggested splitting into two separate 501(c)(4) organizations to receive funds and lobby without limits. The term \"lobbying activities\" in the amendment refers to direct lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts. The Lobbying Disclosure Act defines \"lobbying contact\" as communication to government officials regarding legislation, rules, or policies. Organizations engaging in grassroots lobbying and public advocacy using private resources are not considered to be engaging in prohibited lobbying activities under this provision. The Lobbying Disclosure Act excludes \"grass roots\" lobbying and public advocacy from the definitions of \"lobbying activities\" and \"lobbying contacts.\" The act only applies to direct lobbying of covered federal officials, not state or local legislators. Testifying before Congress or submitting written testimony is considered a \"lobbying activity.\" Broad prohibitions on the use of federal funds for lobbying or political activities have been in place for years. Under current federal provisions, contractors and grantees cannot be reimbursed with federal money for lobbying or political activities. Federal contractors and grantees are prohibited from using federal funds for lobbying or political activities, unless authorized by Congress. These restrictions apply to influencing legislation through lobbying campaigns or political contributions, but exempt activities authorized by Congress or providing factual information in response to a documented request. Specific statutory limitations and prohibitions may also apply to certain federal funds or programs. Appropriation riders can further limit the use of federal money for lobbying or propaganda campaigns directed at Congress. Under the \"Byrd Amendment,\" federal contractors, grantees, and recipients of federal loans are prohibited from using federal funds for lobbying Congress or federal agencies. They must also report any lobbying expenditures from non-federal sources. The \"Byrd Amendment\" imposes restrictions on lobbying with federal funds, prohibiting communication or appearances before Congress or agencies with the intent to influence. Certain contacts are allowed based on timing and nature, with specific information requests always permissible. In 2002, a federal statute expanded the prohibition on lobbying with appropriated funds to include non-government individuals, replacing criminal penalties with civil fines for violations. The law at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913 prohibits the use of federal funds for activities intended to influence Members of Congress or officials at all levels of government. Originally enacted in 1919, it now applies to all recipients of federal funds and extends its prohibitions to lobbying activities. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 requires organizations engaging in lobbying activities to register and file disclosure reports, except for tax-exempt religious orders, churches, and their integrated auxiliaries. Non-profit organizations must comply with disclosure and registration requirements if they meet lobbying contact thresholds and overall expenditures. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 requires organizations with compensated employees engaging in lobbying activities to register and file disclosure reports electronically. Registration is done by the organization, not individual employees, and must be done when the organization meets specific conditions. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 requires organizations with compensated employees engaging in lobbying activities to register when they meet specific conditions. This includes having employees who make multiple lobbying contacts and spend at least 20% of their time on lobbying activities. Lobbying activities encompass direct communication with officials and supporting efforts related to influencing federal laws or policies. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 requires organizations to register their lobbyists/employees if they spend $10,000 or more on lobbying activities in a quarterly reporting period. Lobbyists must register within 45 days of making a lobbying contact. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 mandates organizations to register their lobbyists/employees if they spend $10,000 or more on lobbying activities in a quarterly reporting period. Registrations include details on the lobbyist, client, foreign entities, contributions over $5,000, and general issue areas for lobbying activities. Additionally, organizations contributing over $5,000 for lobbying activities must be identified if they actively participate in planning. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 requires organizations to register lobbyists who spend $10,000 or more in a quarterly reporting period. Quarterly reports must be filed within 20 days of the period end, detailing lobbyist information, clients, issues lobbied on, employees involved, contacts with Congress and federal agencies, foreign entity interests, and lobbying expenditures. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 mandates reporting lobbying expenditures exceeding $5,000, contributions to political committees, and funds disbursed for various purposes related to government officials. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 requires reporting lobbying expenditures over $5,000, contributions to political committees, and funds used for events involving government officials. Contributions of $200 or more to presidential library foundations and inaugural committees must be disclosed in semi-annual reports. Registrants must certify compliance with House and Senate rules on gifts and travel in their reports. The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires reporting lobbying expenditures, contributions to political committees, and funds used for events involving government officials. It also mandates disclosure of contributions to presidential library foundations and inaugural committees over $200 in semi-annual reports. The Act exempts \"grass roots\" lobbying activities from registration and disclosure requirements, focusing on direct lobbying communications with covered officials. Lobbying state or local legislators is also exempt from the definition of \"lobbying contacts.\" The Lobbying Disclosure Act defines \"lobbying contacts\" as activities involving state or local legislators or governmental bodies. Direct lobbying of Congress or high-level executive officials is covered, but testifying before committees or submitting written testimony is exempt. Certain public charities can choose to use Internal Revenue Code definitions for lobbying activities under the Act. Under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, organizations can choose to use the Internal Revenue Code definitions of \"influencing legislation\" for reporting purposes. This allows for consistency in record-keeping and standards. Non-profit organizations with annual gross receipts over $25,000 must file Form 990 with the IRS. Non-profit organizations with annual gross receipts over $25,000 must file Form 990 with the IRS, which is open to public inspection. Charitable 501(c)(3) organizations must also file Schedule A with Form 990, reporting lobbying expenditures for \"influencing legislation\" under the Internal Revenue Code definitions. \"Electing\" organizations must compute expenses for \"grassroots\" and \"direct\" lobbying, while non-electing organizations must provide a detailed description of their lobbying activities to the IRS.
