    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bottled Water Safety and Right to Know Act of 1999\". It includes provisions for consumer confidence reports. Section 410 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require the Secretary to identify contaminants for which the Administrator has established a national primary drinking water regulation but the Secretary has not established a standard of quality regulation or has established a less protective regulation. The Secretary must propose an interim standard of quality regulation for identified contaminants within 12 months, ensuring it is as protective of public health as the national primary drinking water regulation or standards set by the World Health Organization, European Union, or State of California. The Secretary is required to propose an interim standard of quality regulation for identified contaminants within 12 months, ensuring it is as protective of public health as national primary drinking water regulations or standards set by the World Health Organization, European Union, or State of California. The Secretary is also authorized to award grants to States for enforcement of the regulations and must publish final regulations in the Federal Register within 24 months of enactment. If the Secretary fails to publish the regulations, certain functions will be transferred. The Department of Health and Human Services' responsibilities regarding inspections and enforcement of bottled water will be transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency. References to the Secretary in certain paragraphs will now be to the Administrator. Assets, liabilities, grants, contracts, and other funds related to the transferred functions will also be transferred. The Environmental Protection Agency will receive transferred functions and unexpended funds for authorized purposes. All administrative actions issued by the President or Federal agencies related to the transferred functions will also be transferred. The transferred functions and unexpended funds will continue in effect until modified or terminated by authorized officials or by operation of law. This does not affect any ongoing proceedings or applications pending before the Secretary. The proceedings and applications pending before the Secretary will continue as if this subparagraph had not been enacted, with orders issued in such proceedings remaining in effect until modified, terminated, or revoked by authorized officials, a court, or by operation of law. The subparagraph does not affect ongoing suits, appeals, or judgments, and does not cause any administrative actions to cease due to its enactment. The enactment of the subparagraph allows for the continuation of administrative actions related to regulations by the Secretary, now to be carried out by the Administrator. References to the Secretary and the Department of Health and Human Services in other laws and documents are deemed to refer to the Administrator and the Environmental Protection Agency, respectively. The Environmental Protection Agency will require manufacturers of bottled water to submit reports and display information about the water source. Manufacturers must submit annual reports electronically to the Secretary, detailing the source of the water purveyed. The Environmental Protection Agency will require manufacturers of bottled water to submit reports detailing the source of the water purveyed, treatment type, contaminant levels (regulated and unregulated), and compliance with safety criteria. The Environmental Protection Agency will require manufacturers of bottled water to submit reports detailing the source of the water purveyed, treatment type, contaminant levels, and compliance with safety criteria, including notification requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and displaying contaminant levels on labels. The Environmental Protection Agency will require bottled water manufacturers to report the source of water, treatment type, detected contaminants subject to monitoring, and compliance with safety criteria. The Secretary will make an annual report available to the public on an Internet website and in paper form, in multiple languages, upon request through a toll-free telephone number. The manufacturer may submit a supplement to the Secretary with additional information for public education. The Secretary will make this supplement available to the public, along with definitions of terms and information on maximum contaminant levels. The manufacturer may provide additional information on maximum contaminant levels, health advisories, violations, and inspection dates for bottled water facilities. The presence of contaminants in bottled water does not necessarily pose a health risk. The manufacturer of bottled water must provide information on violations found during inspections, enforcement actions taken, recall dates, and reasons for recalls. They are also required to maintain records, make reports, conduct monitoring, and provide information as requested by the Secretary to ensure compliance with regulations and evaluate health risks of contaminants. The Secretary must annually release information on violations of bottled water regulations and enforcement actions taken. A grant program will be established to gather this information. Bottled water is defined as water for human consumption, sealed in containers, and may be still or carbonated without sweeteners or juices added. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to contaminants in water, including terms like maximum contaminant level and regulated/unregulated contaminants. The curr_chunk introduces a new amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding the submission of annual reports and labeling requirements for bottled water manufacturers."
