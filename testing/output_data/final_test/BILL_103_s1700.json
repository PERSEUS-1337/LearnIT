Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow special deductions for corporations in computing taxable income, specifically focusing on the Dividend Paid Deduction. The Dividend Paid Deduction under Subpart A includes sections on qualified dividend accounts, ineligible corporations, and special rules. SEC. 231 allows a deduction of 50% of dividends paid by a corporation in a taxable year, with a limitation based on the amount in the corporation's qualified dividend account. SEC. 232 defines the qualified dividend account. Each corporation must establish a qualified dividend account with an opening balance of zero. At the end of each taxable year, the account is increased by adjusted taxable income and reduced by dividends paid, subject to limitations. Adjusted taxable income is the taxable income adjusted as specified. Taxable income is adjusted by deductions allowed for qualifying dividends and tax credits. The deduction equivalent of nonrefundable credits reduces tax liability. The deduction equivalent of nonrefundable credits reduces tax liability for the taxable year. If tax is imposed by section 55 on the corporation, taxable income for the succeeding year will be increased by a certain percentage of the tax amount imposed. Taxable income for the succeeding year will be increased by a certain percentage of the tax amount imposed, without considering the deduction allowed under section 231. SEC. 233. INELIGIBLE CORPORATIONS. No deduction is allowed for dividends paid by regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, organizations taxable under subchapter T, FSCs, or DISCs. For foreign corporations, deductions for dividends are only allowed if the corporation meets certain requirements and is effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States. Any distribution shall be treated as made ratably out of income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and other income, and added to the qualified dividend account. SEC. 234. SPECIAL RULES. For tax purposes, certain distributions are not considered dividends, including those in redemption of stock, in liquidation, or in a reorganization. Additionally, dividends received on certain preferred stock are excluded. The deduction allowed under section 231 is not taken into account for certain limitations based on taxable income. Dividends received by 5-percent tax-exempt shareholders are subject to specific rules under part III of subchapter F. Any dividend received by a tax-exempt organization from a corporation in which it is a 5-percent shareholder is treated as unrelated business taxable income to the extent of the deduction allowable to the corporation. The definition of a 5-percent shareholder includes tax-exempt organizations owning a certain percentage of the corporation. A tax-exempt organization is defined as an organization exempt from certain taxes. Related entities are tax-exempt organizations with common purposes or control. For tax purposes, related entities with common control are treated as one tax-exempt organization. Adjustments affecting a corporation's taxable income are treated as made at the end of the taxable year. In corporate separations, reorganizations, and redemptions, adjustments are made to the qualified dividend account. Mutual life insurance companies have specific provisions. For mutual life insurance companies, 80 percent of the differential earnings amount is treated as a dividend paid to a shareholder. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for applying consistent rules to mutual life insurance companies, including adjustments to the recomputed differential earnings amount. \"Subpart B--Dividend Received Deduction\" Subpart B of the tax code discusses various sections related to dividends received by corporations, including rules for deductions, compensatory withholding tax on dividends paid to nonresidents, and specific provisions for dividends received on preferred stock and from foreign corporations.
