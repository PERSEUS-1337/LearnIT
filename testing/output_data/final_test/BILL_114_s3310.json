    "content": "The Act titled \"Environmental and Economic Benefits Restoration Act of 2016\" establishes a State and Private Forest Landscape-Scale Restoration Program under the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978. The purpose of this section is to establish a landscape-scale restoration program to support improvements to public benefits derived from State and private forest land. Private forest land is defined as land with existing tree cover or suitable for growing trees, owned by an Indian tribe. The Secretary, in consultation with State Foresters, will establish a landscape-scale restoration program to provide financial and technical assistance for projects on State, political subdivision, or private forest land that maintain or improve benefits from trees and forests. The landscape-scale restoration program established under subsection (c) aims to address national private forest conservation priorities, enhance public benefits from trees and forests, and have objectives such as protecting water quality, reducing wildfire risk, and enhancing wildlife habitat. The landscape-scale restoration program aims to improve forest health, address pests, and enhance wood product markets. The Secretary will establish a measurement system with State Foresters to measure project results and align with other Federal programs. Amounts for the program will be allocated accordingly. The Secretary will allocate 50 percent for a competitive process and 50 percent to States, in consultation with State Foresters, to achieve restoration objectives and address national priorities identified in State-wide assessments and forest resource strategies. The Secretary may provide amounts for multiyear projects and distribute funds through a competitive process for landscape-scale restoration projects to achieve specific objectives. To be eligible for funding, a State Forester or approved entity must submit landscape-scale restoration proposals. The Secretary may provide funding for landscape-scale restoration projects that aim to achieve specific objectives. Proposals must identify priorities from State-wide assessments and forest resource strategies, set measurable results, involve collaboration with other organizations and communities, and secure at least 50% of funding from non-Federal sources. The Secretary prioritizes projects that align with State-wide assessments and forest resource strategies, emphasizing public-private partnerships and cross-boundary activities. The Secretary prioritizes projects that involve partnerships, cross-boundary activities, protection of water quality, wildfire risk reduction, wildlife habitat enhancement, forest health improvement, and opportunities for new. The Secretary establishes a proposal review process that ranks each proposal based on achieving requirements and priorities, including strengthening local economies and addressing national forest conservation priorities. The Secretary may conduct regional reviews for landscape-scale restoration programs, with $30,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. SEC. 3. PROMOTING CROSS-BOUNDARY WILDFIRE MITIGATION. Section 103 of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to encourage the use of excess funds for projects with cross-boundary considerations and support hazardous fuel reduction projects on non-Federal land through grants to State Foresters. The Secretary is encouraged to use excess funds for cross-boundary fuels reduction projects on various types of land, as agreed upon by State and Regional Foresters. This includes treatments on Federal, State, county, tribal, private, and non-Federal land, prioritizing areas identified in State-wide forest assessments. The Secretary is authorized to use cooperation and assistance authorities for cross-boundary wildfire mitigation projects, including allocating funds for projects under specific sections. State Foresters, in consultation with the Secretary, are responsible for implementing these projects. State Forester, in consultation with the Secretary, must consult with landowners for hazardous fuels reduction projects on non-Federal land and cannot proceed without the owner's consent. Only laws and regulations applicable to non-Federal land apply to projects implemented under this subsection."
