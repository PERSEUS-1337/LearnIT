    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Non-Discrimination of Israel in Labeling Act\". Prior to Trade Directives 95-25 and 97-16, Customs required goods from the West Bank or Gaza to be marked with \"Israel.\" However, after the Oslo Accords, it was advised that goods from these areas could be marked differently under Palestinian self-government. The Oslo Accords established a Palestinian self-rule entity with authority over financial matters. President Clinton designated the West Bank and Gaza Strip as beneficiaries of a trade program in 1995. The US Customs guidance extended trade benefits to goods produced in these areas. The Presidential Proclamation applies to goods produced in areas for Palestinian interim self-government as outlined in the Declaration of Principles. The US opposes efforts to delegitimize Israel. The first US free trade agreement was established. The first free trade agreement between the United States and Israel was effective in 1985. The United States-Israel Strategic Partnership is crucial for US national, economic, and security interests, and any actions that delegitimize or discriminate against Israel will harm US economic interests. SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL MARKINGS OF IMPORTED ARTICLES AND CONTAINERS FROM THE WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP. Imported articles from the West Bank and Gaza Strip must be marked with specific labels according to section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 when imported into the United States. For the West Bank, articles not administered by Israel should be marked as \"West Bank\", while those from areas administered by Israel should be labeled as \"Israel\", \"Made in Israel\", or \"Product of Israel\". Similarly, articles from the Gaza Strip must also be marked accordingly. Imported articles from the West Bank and Gaza Strip must be marked with specific labels according to section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 when imported into the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury or any competent Federal official cannot prohibit the use of these markings for articles from the West Bank or Gaza Strip. This requirement will take effect upon the enactment of this Act and applies to articles imported into the United States thereafter."
