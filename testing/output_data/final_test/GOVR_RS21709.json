    "content": "In 2003, the United States exported 1.3 million metric tons of beef and beef products valued at $3.9 billion, equivalent to 10% of the farm value of U.S. cattle. U.S. beef exports grew rapidly from 1992 to 2003, increasing by 85%, while domestic consumption only grew by 14%. Following the 2003 BSE announcement, many countries banned or restricted U.S. beef imports, including Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Canada. By 2006, Japan and Korea had reopened their markets. The U.S. was the world's third-largest beef exporter in 2003, with Australia and Brazil leading in exports. In 2003, the United States was the world's third-largest beef exporter with 1.3 MMT in exports. By 2004, U.S. market share dropped to 3%. Brazil became the top beef/veal exporter in 2007 with 32% of the world market share. Imports represented about 13% of total beef consumption in the U.S., with Canada being a major source before its own BSE event in 2003. The OIE recommended the U.S. and Canada in 2007. The United States, along with other countries, was recognized as having \"controlled risk\" status for BSE in 2007. This status acknowledges effective regulatory controls for BSE. U.S. beef exports gradually recovered, reaching almost 9% market share in 2007. Exports of beef, veal, and beef variety meat exceeded 771,000 MT, valued at over $2.7 billion in 2007. Mexico was the largest importer, taking 47% of the total volume, followed by Canada at 17%. Japan and Korea combined imported 9% of U.S. beef exports. Korea lifted its prohibition on U.S. beef in 2006, accepting only boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age. Despite this, only 25,000 MT of U.S. beef has been exported to Korea since then. Korea rejected shipments due to finding small bone fragments and later for unacceptable dioxin levels. On April 18, 2008, the United States and Korea reached a new agreement to fully reopen Korea's market to all U.S. beef and beef products, including bone-in and boneless beef, offals, variety meats, and processed beef products. This agreement was dependent on the removal of specified risk materials from cattle, with a two-stage reopening plan. The U.S. FDA published final rules expanding restrictions on feeding SRMs to animals and pets, aiming to fully open the Korean market. Korea promised not to close its market due to violations by a single plant. Special labeling requirements and restrictions on beef from Canadian-sourced cattle were implemented. The market reopening was delayed despite the protocol expected to take effect on May 15, 2008. The Korean market reopening has been delayed due to backlash from consumers and opposition politicians. The Korean government requested that beef from cattle older than 30 months not be shipped, leading to disappointment from U.S. officials. The U.S. meat industry has lost billions in sales to Korea since December. The United States has lost billions in sales to Korea since December 2003. The U.S. is aiming to regain its historic share of Korean beef imports, but faces competition from Australia. Access to Korea's beef market is a key issue in the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement debate in Congress. The agreement could potentially increase U.S. beef exports by $600 million to $1.8 billion. The United States aims to regain its share of Korean beef imports, facing competition from Australia. Lawmakers support FTA contingent on Korea fully opening its market for U.S. beef. An interim U.S. marketing program was announced with stricter regulations for beef products from cattle of 20 months or younger. The U.S. agreed to permit Japanese beef into the market following rule-making. The USDA allowed imports of U.S. beef into Japan in 2005, but imports were halted in 2006 due to safety concerns. After a review, the market reopened in July 2006, with ongoing efforts to expand eligibility for more beef products. U.S. beef exports to Japan face challenges such as safety concerns, port scrutiny, supply uncertainties, competition from Australia, and a potential beef import safeguard. Australia dominates Japanese beef imports, and legislative actions in Congress depend on Japan's pace of resuming U.S. beef imports. The 110th Congress's legislative actions will be influenced by the resumption of U.S. beef imports by Japan. The U.S. border reopened to Canadian live cattle under 30 months old in July 2005, and USDA's Minimal Risk Rule 2 allowed for the importation of live cattle and other bovine species in September 2007. Additionally, meat imports from Canadian cattle older than 30 months were permitted starting November 19, 2007. The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockworkers of America (R-CALF USA) failed to block the border opening for Canadian cattle older than 30 months. Concerns about a flood of Canadian cull cattle exports to the U.S. were unlikely to occur due to factors such as increased Canadian slaughter capacity. The opening of the border for Canadian cattle older than 30 months raised concerns about competition and potential risks to the U.S. market. U.S. imports of Canadian cattle had fluctuated, with worries about undermining efforts to regain Japanese and Korean markets. However, some believed that following the Canada rules was necessary to demonstrate the safety of North American beef. In the 110th Congress, resolutions of disapproval of MRR2 have been introduced in both chambers. If passed, MRR2 would have no force or effect. Another bill, S. 1308, would prohibit imports of Canadian cattle over 30 months of age until mandatory country-of-origin labeling is implemented. Industry analysts believe the BSE experience has been less economically devastating in the United States compared to other countries. The United States implemented BSE safeguards before its first case, making the beef industry less reliant on exports compared to Canada. In 2003, the U.S. ban on Canadian beef led to increased U.S. beef prices. Despite a drop in cattle prices after a BSE case in December 2003, prices stabilized due to high demand and low cattle inventories in 2004. Average U.S. fed steer prices were nearly $85 per cwt. in 2004. In 2004, average U.S. fed steer prices were nearly $85 per cwt., reaching nearly $92 by 2007. A study by Kansas State University found that BSE had a significant impact on the U.S. beef industry, leading to lower wholesale boxed beef prices and estimated losses of $3.2 to $4.7 billion due to the loss of export markets."
