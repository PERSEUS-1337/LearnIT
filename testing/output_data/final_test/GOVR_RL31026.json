    "content": "The United States has two main antitrust laws - the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, enforced by various agencies. The Federal Trade Commission Act and the Robinson-Patman Act are also used to regulate economic activities. Specific industries may have additional statutes outlining antitrust consequences. This report summarizes the primary antitrust laws and prohibited activities. The antitrust laws in the United States prohibit unfair competition and activities that restrain trade. The laws focus on promoting competition in the marketplace, rather than protecting individual competitors. These laws include the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, and Robinson-Patman Act. The Sherman Act prohibits monopolization and unreasonable restraints of trade, with fines up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations. Violations can result in imprisonment of up to 10 years. The law allows for triple damages for those injured by antitrust violations. The Clayton Act amended in 1982 restricts foreign states' recovery of antitrust damages to \"actual damages sustained\" plus costs and attorneys' fees. The limitation to actual damages was also applicable to monetary injuries sustained by the United States until late 1990. The 101st Congress removed this limitation, allowing treble-damage recovery for the United States. This provision aims to prevent activity that may tend to restrain trade, complementing the Sherman Act's focus on prohibiting concerted activity that actually restrains trade. The Merger Guidelines issued by the Department of Justice provide a framework for analyzing mergers and acquisitions to prevent activities that restrain trade. The \"premerger notification\" provisions in the Clayton Act allow antitrust agencies to review potential mergers before completion. Enforcement is carried out by the Department of Justice and the FTC, with specific criteria for notification based on sales and assets. The premerger notification provisions in the Clayton Act allow antitrust agencies to review proposed mergers and acquisitions before completion. The reviewing agency has a specified time frame to review the transaction, with the focus on the consequences of the merger/acquisition when it involves holding assets or voting securities exceeding certain thresholds. The premerger notification provisions in the Clayton Act allow antitrust agencies to review proposed mergers and acquisitions before completion. It extends the review period for material submitted in response to a second request from 20 to 30 days and establishes a sliding scale of fees based on the size of the transaction. The penalty for non-compliance remains at $10,000 per day. The Robinson-Patman Act prohibits price discrimination among purchasers. The Clayton Act prohibits price discrimination among purchasers, with exceptions for unjustified differentiation. It applies to sales in interstate commerce and only to goods of like grade and quality sold within the United States. Nonprofit institutions are exempt if purchases are for their own use. The FTC's Section 5 is the key provision. The FTC Act prohibits \"unfair methods of competition\" and \"unfair or deceptive acts\" in commerce, with a focus on joint research and development projects to enhance international competitiveness. Research and development joint ventures will be examined individually. The FTC Act prohibits unfair competition and deceptive acts in commerce, focusing on joint research and development projects for international competitiveness. Joint ventures must notify the Department of Justice and the FTC, and litigants can only recover actual damages for antitrust injury. Export certificates of review are available for collective exporting efforts, with scrutiny by the Secretary of Commerce and the Attorney General to prevent competition or trade restraints. The Export Trade Act provides immunity from antitrust actions for recipients of certificates issued by the Secretary of Commerce and the Attorney General. The act exempts the \"business of insurance\" regulated by state laws from antitrust prohibitions. Additionally, the act allows owners of trademarked soft drinks to grant exclusive territorial franchises without violating antitrust laws. The antitrust laws prohibit price-fixing agreements and group boycotts, with per se offenses being those without justification. These activities are presumed to be illegal without further inquiry into their harm or business reasons. Per se antitrust offenses include horizontal and vertical price fixing, bid rigging, market division, boycotts, and tying arrangements. These activities are violations of the Sherman Act and are judged based on their reasonableness. Conduct that is not a per se offense is evaluated based on the balance between procompetitive and anticompetitive effects. The rule of reason in antitrust laws involves a balancing test to determine if actions have anticompetitive effects. There is no per se rule against monopolization, with determining factors including the reasonableness of actions. Most rule of reason offenses involve a single entity and do not usually violate section 1 of the Sherman Act."
