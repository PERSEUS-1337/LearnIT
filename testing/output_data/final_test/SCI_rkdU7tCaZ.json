    "content": "Dynamic evaluation methodology improves neural sequence models by adapting them to recent history through gradient descent. This results in higher probabilities for re-occurring sequential patterns, outperforming existing approaches. It enhances word-level perplexities on datasets like Penn Treebank and WikiText-2, as well as character-level cross-entropies on datasets like text8 and Hutter Prize. These models are versatile, applicable to tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, dialogue generation, forecasting, and music generation. Neural networks, including CNNs and RNNs like LSTM, have been successful in tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and music generation. However, these models struggle to adapt to recently observed parts of a sequence due to their limited ability to exploit repeated patterns. This paper discusses dynamic evaluation as a solution to the problem of neural networks struggling to exploit new patterns in sequences. The approach adapts models using gradient descent mechanisms and improves on past methods to achieve state-of-the-art results. A method is designed in Section 6 to reduce adaptation parameters, making dynamic evaluation practical in various situations. The performance of dynamically evaluated models over different time-scales and distribution shifts is analyzed in Section 7.4, showing the ability to generate conditional samples with repeated patterns from the conditioning data. Generative models assign probabilities to sequences by modeling each term in the factorization. Generative models assign probabilities to sequences by modeling each term in the factorization given by the product rule. Methods either use a fixed context or a recurrent hidden state to predict the next term in a sequence. Adapting model parameters based on the dataset can better approximate the generating distribution for specific sequences. During training, the goal is to find the best fixed model for the global distribution P g (x), while dynamic evaluation methods adapt model parameters \u03b8 g to infer the current local distribution P l (x) from recent history. Dynamic evaluation methods adapt model parameters during evaluation to learn adapted parameters that provide a better model of the local sequence distribution. The long test sequence is divided into shorter sequences, with adapted parameters updated for each segment using truncated back-propagation through time. Dynamic evaluation methods adapt model parameters during evaluation to learn adapted parameters that provide a better model of the local sequence distribution. Gradients for each loss L(s i ) are backpropagated to the beginning of each sequence segment, making computation linear in sequence length. Each update applies one maximum likelihood training step to approximate the current local distribution P l (x). The computational cost is one forward pass and one gradient computation through the data, with slight overhead for applying the update rule. Dynamic evaluation conditions on predicted sequence elements, providing a valid log-probability for each sequence. It can also be used for generating sequences, resulting in more consistent sequences. Dynamic evaluation for sequence generation aims to produce sequences with more consistent regularities by adapting to recent history. This approach has been applied to n-grams, neural cache models, and pointer sentinel-LSTM for adaptive language modeling. The neural cache model dynamically learns an output layer at test time to adjust output probabilities based on past observations. The neural cache model adjusts output probabilities based on past hidden states, using a non-parametric method. It closely relates to dynamic evaluation for adaptation at test time, with a focus on fitting recent history. The neural cache model adjusts output probabilities based on past hidden states using a non-parametric method. It has limitations in capturing information between successive sequence elements, crucial for adapting to sequences with little independent meaning. Fast weights involve dynamically changing weight matrices based on recent sequence history, similar to dynamic evaluation at test time. The neural cache model adjusts output probabilities based on past hidden states using a non-parametric method. It has limitations in capturing information between successive sequence elements. Dynamic evaluation involves automated weight changes via gradient descent at test time, improving generalization to unseen patterns. Previous work applied dynamic evaluation to language models at character and word levels. Proposed changes to BID20's dynamic evaluation method include reducing update frequency for more accurate gradient information and improved computational efficiency. Sequence segments of length 5 for word-level tasks and 20 for character-level tasks are used. A global decay prior is added to bias the model towards learned parameters \u03b8 g. Dynamic evaluation assumes the local generating distribution is constantly changing, weighting recent sequence history higher for adaptation. Adding a global decay prior in dynamic evaluation biases the model towards learned parameters and weights recent sequence history higher for adaptation. RMSprop, a potential alternative to SGD, uses a moving average of recent squared gradients to scale learning rates for each weight. However, at the start of a test sequence, RMSprop may not leverage updates effectively due to few gradients available, so mean squared gradients are collected on training data instead of recent test data. The update rule involves using mean squared gradients (MS g) on training data instead of recent test data. The mini-batch size becomes a hyper-parameter, with larger sizes resulting in smaller mean squared gradients. Parameters with high RMS gradient decay faster to affect network dynamics. RMS norm is normalized MS g with a mean of 1, clipped to not exceed 1/\u03bb for any parameter. The final update equation combines the learning and regularization components, referred to as RMS with an RMS global prior. Mini-batching over sequences is beneficial for test-time sequence modelling, allowing faster processing of multiple sequences in parallel. Sparse dynamic evaluation variant updates a smaller number of parameters using an adaptation matrix M initialized to zeros. In a stacked RNN, dynamic evaluation is propagated through the network via recurrent and feed-forward connections, reducing the number of adaptation parameters and making mini-batching less memory intensive. By transforming a subset of hidden units with matrix M, the number of adaptation parameters is significantly reduced. Sparse dynamic evaluation is experimented with for character-level language models, applied on top of a base model. In language modelling, dynamic evaluation is assessed on top of a base model by tuning hyper-parameters on the validation set and comparing static and dynamic versions on the test set. Experiments on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets compare dynamic evaluation with past approaches like neural cache, analyzing its performance across different models and datasets. PTB, derived from Wall Street Journal articles, is a common benchmark with limited vocab size. Two baseline models, including a standard LSTM, are considered for evaluation. The study used benchmarks in language modelling, comparing a standard LSTM model with a recent state-of-the-art AWD-LSTM model. The standard LSTM had two layers with 650 units each, trained with SGD and recurrent dropout. The final update rule (RMS + RMS global prior) was found to work best. Dynamic evaluation was applied on the AWD-LSTM model, which combines drop-connect on recurrent weights for regularization and a variant of ASGD. The model used drop-connect on recurrent weights for regularization and a variant of ASGD for optimization. Results showed significant improvements in dynamic evaluation compared to the neural cache on both standard LSTM and AWD-LSTM reimplementation, achieving state-of-the-art on PTB. WikiText-2 dataset is larger than PTB, with 2 million training tokens and a vocab size of 33k. Dynamic evaluation improves perplexity on WikiText-2 significantly more than neural caching for LSTM models. This suggests that dynamic evaluation effectively exploits regularities across articles. Dynamic evaluation is effective at exploiting regularities across non-shuffled documents. Performance is benchmarked against static evaluation and neural cache on the text8 dataset, derived from Wikipedia text. AWD-LSTM with 52M parameters was trained and compared for performance. The performance of dynamic evaluation, static evaluation, and neural caching was compared using AWD-LSTM with 52M parameters. Hyper-parameter tuning was conducted for both dynamic evaluation and neural caching to ensure a fair comparison. Results showed that the cache size had a negligible effect on performance, with optimal values found for the mixing and flatness parameters. Dynamic evaluation outperforms static evaluation and neural caching, even with a stronger model and more training data. The evaluation was done on character-level text8 and Hutter Prize datasets, with the latter containing Wikipedia text and non-Latin characters. The text8 dataset is a simplified version of the Hutter Prize dataset, focusing on English characters and spaces. The medium-scale word level language modelling experiments used a version of the text8 data with a standard 90-5-5 split for training, validation, and testing. The mLSTM model had 2800 hidden units, an embedding layer of 400 units, weight normalization, variational dropout, and ADAM for training. Sparse dynamic evaluation was also considered, with a subset of 500 hidden units and one adaptation matrix. Results for Hutter Prize and text8 datasets are provided. Results for Hutter Prize and text8 datasets are given in TAB7 and BID32 17M 1.44 HyperLSTM BID6 27M 1.34 Hierarchical multiscale LSTM BID3 1.32 Bytenet decoder BID10 1.31 LSTM + BB tuning BID17 46M 1.30 Recurrent highway networks BID34 46M 1.27 Fast-slow LSTM BID23 BID32 4M 1.44 LSTM BID3 1.43 Batch normalised LSTM BID3 1.36 Hierarchical multiscale LSTM BID3 1.29 Recurrent highway networks BID34. Dynamic evaluation shows improvements on base models and state-of-the-art results on both datasets. Sparse dynamic evaluation also improves Hutter Prize results with only 0.5% of adaptation parameters. Time-scales for dynamic evaluation advantage over static evaluation are measured. Performance of static and dynamic evaluation is plotted against the number of characters processed on sequences from the Hutter Prize test. The text discusses dynamic evaluation on sequences from the Hutter Prize test set and Spanish sequences from the European Parliament dataset BID12. The Hutter Prize data experiments show advantages of dynamic evaluation over static evaluation. Spanish experiments measure dynamic evaluation's handling of distribution shifts. Plots show average cross-entropy errors against the number of characters processed. The Spanish experiments used the same base model and dynamic evaluation settings as Hutter Prize. Dynamic evaluation showed a noticeable advantage on Spanish sequences compared to Hutter sequences. Conditional samples were drawn from the static and dynamic versions of the model after processing 10k characters of Spanish. The dynamic model generated data with Spanish and made-up words resembling Spanish characteristics. Dynamic evaluation methodology improves language modelling for speech recognition and machine translation. The evaluation method effectively exploits pattern re-occurrence in sequences. 300 character samples were generated from a dynamic model trained on Hutter Prize, conditioned on Spanish characters. The generated text includes Spanish-like words. The final sentence fragment of the 10k conditioning characters is given to the reader, with the generated text mentioning the importance of the commitment of the Commission as an organization. It also refers to a secret act in Cape Town and the closure of the eagle as imprints in a Dallas within the country. Allan Roth acquired the government in 1916."
