Any agreement violating this act is void, and enforcement is overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. The \"Ending Forced Arbitration for Victims of Data Breaches Act of 2018\" prohibits entities from requiring arbitration for security breach disputes. Violations are considered unfair and deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission enforces the Act with the same powers and rules as outlined in the FTC Act. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT BY STATES. The attorney general of a State can bring a civil action in federal court on behalf of residents if there is a violation of section 2. Before taking action, the attorney general must notify the Federal Trade Commission. The attorney general must provide a copy of the complaint before filing a civil action. If immediate notification is not possible, the attorney general must inform the Federal Trade Commission upon initiating the action. The Commission can intervene in state civil actions and be heard on all related matters. The attorney general of a State can file petitions for appeal in a civil action. The attorney general also has investigatory powers to conduct investigations and compel witnesses or evidence. If the Federal Trade Commission takes preemptive action on a violation, the State attorney general cannot bring a civil action against the same defendant during the FTC's action. Venue and service of process for actions brought under paragraph (1) can be in a district court meeting venue requirements or another court of competent jurisdiction. Process can be served where the defendant is located, does business, or where venue is proper under the law. SEC. 6. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. An individual injured by a violation of section 2 may bring a private right of action for rescission, restitution, damages, and injunctive relief. They can also recover litigation costs, attorney's fees, and expert witness fees. Those who control or aid in the violation are also liable. Private individuals can bring a legal action for various remedies, including rescission, restitution, damages, and injunctive relief for violations. Liability extends to those who control or assist in the violation. The statute of limitations for filing a claim is within 2 years of the violation or its discovery through reasonable diligence. The action can be brought in a district court of the United States or another court with jurisdiction. The private rights provided in this section are additional to, not a replacement for, other rights or remedies under Federal or State law. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.
