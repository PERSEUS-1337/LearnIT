    "content": "The Act titled \"Creating Jobs From Innovative Small Businesses Act of 2010\" introduces a new section 45R for a high technology investment tax credit in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The high technology investment tax credit under section 38 allows a 20% credit for acquiring a qualified equity investment in a qualified high technology small business. The maximum credit for the taxable year is $100,000, minus any prior year credits, with related persons treated as one entity. The dollar amount in paragraph (1)(A) is allocated among persons under regulations by the Secretary. Related persons are those whose relationship would disallow losses under certain sections. Definitions state that a qualified equity investment is an equity investment in a high technology small business acquired at original issue solely for cash. The term 'equity investment' refers to stock in a corporation or a capital interest in a partnership. A rule similar to section 1202(c)(3) applies for redemptions. A 'qualified high technology small business concern' is defined as a small business involved in high technology. The tax credit limitation for high technology investments is set at $500 million for 2010, $750 million for 2011 and 2012, and $1 billion for 2013 and 2014. The tax credit limitation for high technology investments is allocated among selected small businesses by the Secretary. Any excess limitation in one year can be carried over to the next year. Individuals who are employees of the small business are not eligible for the tax credit. The tax credit for high technology investments is allocated among small businesses by the Secretary. Employees or family members of employees of the small business are not eligible for the credit. The basis of qualified equity investments is reduced by the credit amount. Regulations will be prescribed to prevent abuse, impose reporting requirements, and apply the provisions to new entities. The tax credit for high technology investments is added to the general business credit under section 38 of the Code. A new high technology investment tax credit is included, and a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The high technology investment tax credit under section 38 of the Code applies to investments made after December 31, 2009, in taxable years ending after that date."
