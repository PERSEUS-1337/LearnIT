Elizabeth Warren criticized the lack of a coherent strategy from the federal government. The COP criticized the federal government for lacking a coherent strategy to address the financial crisis. Representative Jeb Hensarling did not sign the report, citing the need for resources and oversight rights. The Department of the Treasury responded to the COP's questions but the COP's second report found the responses lacking in transparency and accountability.

The Department of the Treasury agreed to monitor compliance but expressed concerns about monitoring individual institutions' use of funds. The Department of the Treasury agreed to set up a monitoring system to track how banks were spending TARP dollars, in response to concerns raised by Congress. Congress may decide on further funding based on banks demonstrating proper use of the funds. GAO will audit the financial statements as required by the TARP act.

Some have called for Congress to revisit EESA's reporting requirements as they may no longer be relevant. Concerns have been raised about funds being used for dividends, acquisitions, and executive compensation instead of increasing lending. Recipients of TARP funds are not currently required to report on the use of funds. The report highlighted that while EESA does not mandate TARP fund recipients to report on fund usage, Treasury has the authority to impose reporting conditions. This could enhance transparency and accountability to taxpayers, investors, and policymakers. Despite EESA's aim for public accountability, only one report is required to be made public, raising concerns about the continuity of this practice. Recommendations have been made to improve public accountability under EESA. One of the recommendations from a conference on public accountability under EESA is that Congress should ensure reports required under EESA are made public unless specified otherwise. Reporting deadlines vary, with some reports due quickly and others not for years. For example, OMB must report on TARP funds five years after EESA enactment. Some reporting requirements are recurring, such as COP's reports every 30 days. Reporting requirements under EESA vary in terms of frequency and deadlines.

Some reporting deadlines have clear starting points, but others, like reports from the Financial Stability Oversight Board and the Comptroller General, lack clarity on when they should begin. Some reporting requirements under EESA have varying deadlines and frequencies. While some reports are recurring, others are one-time submissions.
