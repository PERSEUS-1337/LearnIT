    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fitness Integrated with Teaching Kids Act\" or the \"FIT Kids Act\". Congress finds that childhood obesity is at epidemic levels in the United States, costing the economy over $117 billion annually. The prevalence of overweight children and adolescents has significantly increased over the years, with more than 9 million children considered overweight. If children do not become more active and healthy, a third of all children born in 2000 or later will suffer from obesity. A third of children born in 2000 or later will suffer from diabetes in their lifetime. Sedentary lifestyles in childhood contribute to 23% of US deaths from chronic diseases. Overweight adolescents have a high chance of becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk for chronic diseases. Children who are obese or have high cholesterol show plaque build-up in neck arteries similar to middle-aged adults. Decline in physical activity has led to a childhood obesity epidemic. Physical Activity Guidelines recommend 60 minutes of activity daily for children. In a 2005 report, increasing physical activity was highlighted as crucial in programs targeting childhood obesity. Physical education programs in schools have decreased over the past 2 decades. National standards recommend 150 minutes per week in elementary school and 225 minutes per week in middle and high school. However, only a small percentage of schools provide daily physical education, and some schools do not require students to take it. Research shows that a significant percentage of schools do not mandate physical education, leading to low participation rates in organized physical activities among children. Regular physical activity is linked to better health outcomes and academic performance. The majority of adults support the idea of daily physical education in schools. SEC. 3. REPORT CARDS.
