    "content": "Agricultural conservation became a significant policy focus in the Food Security Act of 1985 and has been a recurring issue in shaping omnibus farm bills. The 2008 farm bill continued to address concerns about funding, policy objectives, program effectiveness, and federal assistance structure. Conservation programs are well represented by small and mid-size farming operations and enjoy wider public support compared to commodity programs. In the debate leading to the 2008 farm bill, conservation groups and producers faced budget constraints and competition for resources. Key issues included funding priorities, payment structure, geographic targeting, program complexity, and measurement of costs and effectiveness. Questions arose about payment limits and their impact on participation and effectiveness of conservation programs. The impact of payment limits on conservation programs and the allocation of savings is influenced by the concentration of agricultural production in specific regions of the United States. Some areas show greater environmental impact from agricultural activities, such as pressures from urban sprawl on the East and West Coasts. Funding levels also affect the backlog of interest in program participation that cannot be met. The effectiveness of federal conservation spending in addressing environmental issues in different regions is questioned. Concerns are raised about targeting specific locations, producer groups, and types of agricultural production. The complexity of adhering to regulations governing conservation programs is also highlighted, with some producers managing acreage under multiple programs. The environmental management plan for retired acreage is being reviewed for potential inefficiencies and duplication. There are questions about combining existing programs to target specific resource issues and improve effectiveness. Additionally, concerns are raised about the delivery capacity of USDA agencies and the potential impact of a large number of staff retiring. The need for partnerships, relationships with other organizations, and expansion of technical assistance providers is also considered. Conservation programs could be more efficient if implemented at larger scales, such as regional or multistate levels. Concerns exist about declining participation if programs are too remote from local input. Using watersheds or river basins as policy targets could reduce local planning control. Federal conservation programs aim to improve environmental management of natural resources, but evaluating their effectiveness remains a challenge. Larger scale planning, such as targeting river basins, could enhance efficiencies by pooling resources and addressing common resource issues. Examples like the Chesapeake Bay region and the Great Lakes show advantages of this approach. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes and modifies conservation programs administered by USDA, focusing on land retirement, easement programs, and \"working lands\" programs. Research has advanced in establishing valid indicators for environmental management, making integration of findings into current programs more feasible. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes and modifies conservation programs administered by USDA, focusing on land retirement, easement programs, and \"working lands\" programs. Major programs include the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), and Farmland Protection Program (FPP). The CRP allows producers to enter into 10-15 year contracts for land conversion back into forests, grasslands, or wetlands. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows producers to enter into long-term contracts for annual rental payments and financial assistance to install conservation practices. Administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency, CRP aims to convert environmentally sensitive acreage to vegetative cover to conserve soil, water, and wildlife resources. It is the largest conservation program funded through the Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation. CRP also includes subprograms like the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) to support state and federal partnerships for specific conservation practices. The 2008 farm bill caps CRP enrollment at 32 million acres, down from 39.2 million acres, with changes allowing for state, regional, and national conservation initiatives. Incentives are provided for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers to purchase CRP land, and certain activities like managed haying and grazing are permitted on enrolled lands. Program participants must manage lands according to a conservation plan. The bill amends the CRP program by setting rental rates, requiring conservation plan management, surveying per-acre cash rents, clarifying alfalfa status, and establishing cost-sharing rates for conservation structures. It also expands the pilot program for wetland and buffer acres, allowing each state to enroll up to 100,000 acres. Managed haying and grazing conditions on CRP acreage have been modified. The farm bill allows managed harvesting and grazing on CRP acreage in response to drought and to control invasive species. State technical committees must coordinate for environmental management. Wind turbine installation on enrolled land is now permitted. Any authorized activity on CRP acreage will result in a rental payment reduction. Cost-share payments are permitted for land used for hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, and wildlife corridors. Funding of $100 million is authorized for tree thinning. The 2008 farm bill modifies evaluation criteria for CRP contract applications, giving preference to local landowners. It also incentivizes participation of beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, allowing for CRP contract modifications to assist in land leasing or purchasing. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for CRP contracts, prioritizing land transfers from retired or retiring farmers. Funding priority is given to watersheds draining into the Chesapeake Bay, with specific focus on the Susquehanna, Shenandoah, Potomac, and Patuxent Rivers. Retired or disabled farmers and ranchers can exclude CRP payments from self-employment taxes. The Wetlands Reserve Program offers assistance to landowners for wetland protection and wildlife practices. The 2008 farm bill expands the Wetlands Reserve Program, increasing the maximum enrollment cap and including private and tribal wetlands, croplands, and grasslands. It also authorizes a Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program and makes program changes such as adjusting payment schedules and limiting restoration payments. The 2008 farm bill expands the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) administered by USDA's Farm Services Agency, setting a new acreage enrollment goal and allowing for fire presuppression and grazing-related activities. The 2008 farm bill expands the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) by adding grazing-related activities and prioritizing certain expiring CRP lands and tribal lands for enrollment. The bill does not include a Grassland Reserve Enhancement provision as proposed in the House. The Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FFP) is a voluntary program that provides matching funds to help purchase development rights for eligible farmlands to keep them in agricultural use. The program's purpose is to protect the land's agricultural use by limiting nonagricultural uses and promoting state and local farmland protection. The Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FFP) is being restructured to emphasize longer term and renewable cooperative agreements. The bill also includes technical changes to the program's administrative requirements, appraisal methodology, and terms and conditions. The program's federal share of easement costs is capped at 50%, with the landowner contributing 25% of the costs. The bill provides additional budget authority for FPP of $743 million and does not rename the program. Major working lands programs include EQIP, CSP, AMA, and WHIP, with EQIP and CSP being the two largest programs. The 2008 farm bill allocated additional budget authority for EQIP and CSP, the two largest working lands programs, with $3.4 billion for EQIP and $1.1 billion for CSP over five years. The bill did not include a Senate proposal to coordinate CSP and EQIP under the Comprehensive Stewardship Incentives Program. EQIP, administered by USDA's NRCS, offers technical and cost-share assistance to farmers for promoting agricultural production and environmental quality through various subprograms. The 2008 farm bill expands the EQIP program to cover various land and natural resources, prioritizing cost-effectiveness and comprehensive treatment of resource issues. It sets aside funds for beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, tribal members, and producers transitioning to organic production. The bill also lowers the EQIP payment limit to $300,000 in any 6-year period per entity, except for special environmental projects. The 2008 farm bill expands the EQIP program to cover various land and natural resources, prioritizing cost-effectiveness and comprehensive treatment of resource issues. It sets aside funds for beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, tribal members, and producers transitioning to organic production. Projects involving methane digesters are capped at $20,000 annually or $80,000 in any six-year period. The bill reserves $37.5 million of annual EQIP funds for the Conservation Innovation Grants program, covering air quality concerns associated with agriculture. It also introduces the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) to address water quality and quantity concerns on agricultural land. The manager's report accompanying the farm bill prioritizes areas for programs like AWEP, including the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer region, Puget Sound, and the Everglades. AWEP focuses on assisting areas facing significant drought with a total funding of $280 million through FY2012. EQIP funding is authorized at increasing amounts from FY2008 to FY2012. The Conservation Security Program, administered by NRCS, promotes conservation on tribal and private working lands but is phased out by the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill phases out the Conservation Security Program and replaces it with the new Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) in 2009. The CSP encourages conservation practices on working lands with changes like 5-year contracts and direct payment attribution. Funding of over $2 billion is available for existing CSP contracts, with new contracts based on meeting a stewardship threshold for resource conservation. The new Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) replaces the Conservation Security Program in 2009. It requires meeting a stewardship threshold for resource conservation, with payments based on actual costs and environmental outcomes. The CSP reserves funds for beginning and disadvantaged farmers, aims to enroll 12.8 million acres annually, and limits individual payments to $200,000 in a 5-year period. Enrollment is continuous, and eligible lands now include priority resource concerns. The WHIP program expands eligible lands to include priority resource concerns identified by states, private agricultural and forested lands, and nonindustrial private forest lands (up to 10% of total annual acres). Technical assistance is provided to specialty crop and organic producers, with pilot testing for innovative technologies. Producers may receive supplemental payments for resource-conserving crop rotations. Program payments cannot be used for animal waste facilities. WHIP is a voluntary program for habitat development on private land. The WHIP program, designed for habitat development on private land, offers technical assistance and up to 75% cost-share assistance. Agreements are typically 5 to 10 years long. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes WHIP with current funding levels, focusing on wildlife habitat on private agricultural, nonindustrial private forest, and tribal lands. Priority is given to projects addressing state, regional, and national conservation initiatives. The 2008 farm bill provides funding for various wildlife initiatives at state and local levels, including the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program and the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The Grassroots program aims to prevent water pollution from affecting drinking water, while the Small Watershed program works to rehabilitate community dams. Funding limits and increases are specified in the bill. The 2008 farm bill provides funding for wildlife initiatives at state and local levels, including the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program and the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The bill also includes additional funding for the Agricultural Management Assistance Program (AMA) and amends the Resource Conservation and Development Program (RC&D) to emphasize locally led planning processes. The Farm Viability Program is reauthorized through FY2012. The Farm Viability Program, authorized in the 2002 farm bill, provides grants for farm viability programs. The Great Lakes Basin Program for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control is a federal-state partnership coordinated by the Great Lakes Commission. The program implements recommendations from the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy. Site-specific technical assistance is provided for producers and landowners in conservation and natural resource management technologies. The 2008 farm bill makes changes to the technical assistance component of conservation programs to better support producers in designing and implementing conservation strategies. It also includes provisions to ensure that specialty crops, organic producers, and precision agricultural producers receive adequate technical assistance. The bill authorizes a national certification process for third-party providers and creates an Agriculture Conservation Experienced Services (ACES) Program to utilize the skills of older, non-USDA employees. Additionally, state technical assistance committees are established to involve state conservation officials in the process. The bill establishes state TA committees with conservation officials and producers to assist in conservation programs. It authorizes a Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative targeting resources for conservation priorities on agricultural and forest land. Eligible programs include EQIP, CSP, WHIP, and others, with 6% of funding reserved for CCPI initiatives. The 2008 farm bill directs USDA to prepare statistical and evaluation reports on various conservation programs, including those with innovative methods. Reports include enrollments and payments over $250,000 for specific programs, implications of conservation easements, county cash rental rates, and appraisal of soil and water conservation programs. The 2008 farm bill expands USDA conservation activities with new programs, including one for the Chesapeake Bay region. It targets conserving the Bay and its tributaries, with priority given to specific rivers. The bill authorizes significant funding over several years for this program. The \"Open Fields\" program in the 2008 farm bill provides state grants for land-owners to allow public access for wildlife-dependent recreation. It includes a 25% reduction if migratory bird hunting opening dates are inconsistent for residents and non-residents. The bill allocates $50 million in mandatory funds for the program. Additionally, a provision makes producers planting an insurable crop on native sod ineligible for crop insurance and NAP for the first five years. This provision may apply to virgin prairie converted to cropland in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area. The farm bill directs USDA to establish standards for quantifying environmental services from agriculture and forestry sectors. Funding is available for resource management activities targeting salinity in the Colorado River Basin. Mandatory spending of $200 million is authorized for providing water to at-risk natural desert terminal lakes. The enacted bill allocates $175 million for desert terminal lakes and includes funding for land and water purchases in the Walker River Basin on California's eastern border with Nevada. A new loan program in the bill assists producers with financing conservation installations, prioritizing beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, those transitioning to organic systems, and producers needing conservation assistance for compliance. The 2008 farm bill's Conservation Title has received positive feedback from agriculture and farmland conservation groups, but some national wildlife groups have concerns about changes made during conference negotiations. These concerns include reductions in CRP acreage enrollment cap, easing of \"sodsaver\" provision requirements, limitations on eligible lands under Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, and the creation of a new permanent disaster fund that could encourage planting on marginal lands."
