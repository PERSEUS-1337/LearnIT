Factors for consideration include findings in a report, and entry into the memorandum is not required if certain conditions are met. The Secretary, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and tribal health program may jointly certify to Congress that a memorandum of understanding would impact the quality of healthcare for Indian veterans or individuals receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Service can cover costs according to the memorandum. The Service may cover copayments for eligible Indian veterans receiving medical care from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
