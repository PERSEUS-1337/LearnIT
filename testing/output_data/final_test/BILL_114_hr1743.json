Harriet Tubman, born into slavery as Araminta Harriet Ross, faced early hardships including family separation and physical violence, leading to permanent injuries. Her exact birth year and location are unknown, but historians estimate it to be around 1820. Harriet Tubman's mother, Rit, hid her younger brother Moses from a slave trader with the help of other slaves and free blacks. Despite her father Ben being technically freed at 45, he had little power to free his family. Harriet, who married a freedman named John Tubman, began planning her escape from slavery in 1844. Harriet Tubman escaped slavery in 1849, traveling 90 miles to Pennsylvania via the Underground Railroad. Despite the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, she risked her freedom to free her family and other slaves, earning her the nickname \"Moses\" for her leadership and courage. During the Civil War, Harriet Tubman played various roles for the Union Army, including acting as an armed scout and spy. She led an armed expedition during the Combahee River Raid, freeing over 700 slaves and earning the nickname \"General Tubman.\" After the war, she purchased land in Auburn, New York, where she lived with family and friends. Harriet Tubman's efforts for equality continued after the war, advocating for women's suffrage. Her death in 1913 was commemorated with military honors in Auburn, New York. In 2014, a Harriet Tubman National Historical Park was established by President Obama, and she was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for her work on civil rights. Harriet Tubman's selflessness and resilience during the Civil War saved hundreds of lives. Harriet Tubman's selflessness and resilience during the Civil War saved hundreds of lives. SEC. 3.
