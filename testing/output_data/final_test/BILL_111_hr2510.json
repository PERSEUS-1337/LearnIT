    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Absentee Ballot Track, Receive, and Confirm Act\" and includes provisions for reimbursing states for costs incurred in establishing a program to track and confirm receipt of absentee ballots. The Commission will reimburse states for costs incurred in establishing an absentee ballot tracking program for Federal elections. The program involves tracking and confirming the receipt of absentee ballots by state or local election officials. The absentee ballot tracking program for Federal elections involves procedures to track and confirm receipt of ballots, providing information on whether the vote was counted, and reasons if not. This information is made available to voters through online access or a toll-free telephone number if officials do not have an internet site. A State or local election official without an internet site can establish a toll-free telephone number for individuals who cast absentee ballots to track the receipt of their voted ballot. To receive payment, a State must certify the establishment of an absentee ballot tracking program for Federal elections and provide a statement of incurred costs. The State can receive a payment for establishing an absentee ballot tracking program for Federal elections. The payment amount is based on the costs incurred by the State, capped at $3,000 per jurisdiction. Each State can only receive one payment under this program. Authorization of appropriations for payments under this part to the Commission for fiscal year 2010 and beyond. Amounts appropriated will remain available until expended. Attest: LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
