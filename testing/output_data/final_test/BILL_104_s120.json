    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Violent Crime Control Act of 1995\". The Congress finds that there is a lack of reliable information on ammunition availability, importers and manufacturers are not required to report to the Federal Government, bullet-related deaths in the US are unacceptably high, three calibers of bullets are disproportionately used in crime, young males, especially young black males, are most affected by injury and death, epidemiology can help study bullet-related deaths, and increased stress on American families has resulted in increased welfare. The Congress acknowledges the impact of bullet-related deaths and injuries on Medicaid and supplemental security income benefits, and the need for a tax on bullet sales to control such incidents. Additionally, there is a lack of central agency for trauma research and inadequate laws and programs addressing bullet-related trauma. Increased research in bullet-related violence is necessary to understand the causes, develop control options, and overcome barriers to effective controls. The purpose of increased research in bullet-related violence is to understand causes, develop control options, and overcome barriers to effective controls. The Act aims to increase taxes on certain bullets to reduce bullet-related deaths and injuries. It also seeks to gather data on bullet-related incidents, educate the public, and assess changes in bullet-related deaths over time. The Act aims to reduce bullet-related deaths and injuries by increasing taxes on certain bullets, gathering data on incidents, educating the public, and assessing changes in bullet-related deaths over time. It also aims to expand the epidemiologic approach to evaluate efforts to control bullet-related deaths and injuries and other forms of violence, develop options for controlling bullet-related deaths and injuries, build capacity and encourage responsibility at various levels for control and elimination of bullet-related deaths and injuries, and promote a better understanding of the utility of the epidemiologic approach for evaluating options to control or reduce death and injury from nonbullet-related violence. TITLE I--BULLET DEATH AND INJURY CONTROL PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 101. BULLET DEATH AND INJURY CONTROL PROGRAM. Established within the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control is a Bullet Death and Injury Control Program. The Program aims to conduct research, provide leadership, and coordinate efforts to understand, prevent, and educate the public about bullet-related deaths and injuries in the United States. The Bullet Death and Injury Control Program, established within the CDC, aims to enhance knowledge, conduct research, and publish information on bullet-related deaths and injuries in the US. The Bullet Death and Injury Control Program, established within the CDC, aims to provide practical guides for epidemiological research on bullet-related deaths and injuries, identify areas in need of study, conduct research through various means, and make recommendations to Congress. The Bullet Death and Injury Control Program within the CDC aims to provide recommendations to Congress, ATF, and other agencies on data management for analyzing and controlling bullet-related deaths and injuries. It also offers guidance on actions to reduce this epidemic and provides training to relevant agencies. The Bullet Death and Injury Control Program within the CDC includes an advisory board with 13 members from various agencies and organizations to assist in setting policies and directing the program. The Bullet Death and Injury Control Program at the CDC has an advisory board with 13 members from different organizations, including criminologists, behavioral scientists, physicians, statisticians, engineers, and public communications experts. Members serve 5-year terms and may serve multiple terms. Compensation is provided to non-government members of the Commission. Non-government members of the Bullet Death and Injury Control Program's advisory board are compensated at a daily rate equivalent to level IV of the Executive Schedule. Government members serve without additional compensation. Non-government members may also receive travel expenses and per diem. The advisory board members of the Bullet Death and Injury Control Program are compensated at a daily rate equivalent to level IV of the Executive Schedule. The Center conducts the Program in consultation with relevant agencies and prepares an annual report to Congress on findings, progress, and challenges encountered. Authorization of appropriations is specified for fiscal years 1996 to 2000. The Bullet Death and Injury Control Program's annual report for December 31, 1996, will include options and recommendations for the Program's mission and funding levels for 1996-2000 and beyond. SEC. 201. INCREASE IN TAX ON CERTAIN BULLETS. SEC. 201. INCREASE IN TAX ON CERTAIN BULLETS.
