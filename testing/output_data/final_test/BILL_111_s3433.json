    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Coasts and Efficient Cars Act of 2010\". Opening all areas in the Pacific, Atlantic, Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and Central Gulf of Mexico Regions of the outer Continental Shelf to drilling would save consumers 3 cents per gallon of gas in 2030 and produce an estimated 500,000 barrels of oil per day by 2030. Increasing fuel economy to 55 miles per gallon by 2030 would save consumers $1.43 or more. The oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon incident led to loss of life, massive oil release, and costly cleanup. The risks of offshore drilling outweigh its limited benefits. Cleaner and safer alternatives exist to reduce gas prices. Alternative methods to reduce gasoline prices include strong fuel economy standards. China already achieves a fuel economy standard of 36.8 miles per gallon for new passenger vehicles and is increasing it to over 42 miles per gallon by 2015. Japan and Europe have fuel economy standards higher than 42 miles per gallon. The amendment prohibits oil and gas leasing in the Pacific, Atlantic, Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and Central Gulf of Mexico regions. The amendment prohibits oil and gas leasing in certain regions, while Section 4 addresses fuel economy and motor vehicle emission standards. The amendment addresses fuel economy standards for passenger and non-passenger automobiles from model years 2017 to 2030, aiming for a combined fuel economy average of at least 55 miles per gallon by 2030. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in collaboration with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and the State of California, will set motor vehicle emission and fuel economy standards for model year 2017 and beyond to improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA, NHTSA, and California will establish emission and fuel economy standards for model year 2017 onwards to enhance fuel efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions, considering costs and other relevant factors."
