    "title": "SB 1172",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 211 of the Statutes of 1919, as amended by Chapter 1223 of the Statutes of 1977, is repealed. Definitions for \"Act\" and \"Commission\" are provided in this section. The Public Trust Doctrine, as defined by relevant court decisions, grants the State Lands Commission authority over navigable waters, their underlying lands, and nonnavigable tributaries for the protection of commerce, navigation, fisheries, and preservation of natural lands. The State of California designates the City of Albany as trustee for trust lands in Alameda County. The City of Albany is granted trust revenues from trust lands and assets. A trust lands use plan and report are required to be submitted by the trustee. The City of Albany intends for the granted lands to be part of McLaughlin Eastshore State Park. The trust grant for trust lands in the City of Albany is subject to conditions including holding the lands for public benefit, conforming to an approved use plan from 2022 onwards, and not alienating the lands to any entity. The trustee may lease trust lands for up to 49 years for trust-consistent purposes, collecting fair rents. Leases must align with the approved use plan from 2022 and serve the state's best interest. The trustee must not discriminate in rates or services on trust lands based on various protected characteristics, in accordance with state antidiscrimination laws. The state has the right to use transportation, landing, or storage improvements on trust lands for vessels, watercraft, or railroads without charge. The trust lands can be used for highway purposes in the future without compensation, except for improvements placed on the property taken for highways, which require compensation. The state reserves the right for fishing and access to waters over trust lands. The state also reserves artifacts, minerals, and the right to prospect, mine, and remove deposits from the lands. Prior to entering into a lease, franchise, or agreement concerning trust lands, the trustee's governing body must adopt a resolution describing the subject of the lease and specifying terms. The trustee is responsible for reimbursing the commission for all expenses related to the administration of the act. The trustee must submit a trust lands use plan to the commission by January 1, 2022, detailing any proposed development, preservation, or use of the trust lands. Any changes or extensions to the plan must be approved by the commission. Extensions of time to meet the deadline may be requested and approved by the commission. The commission reviews the trustee's trust lands use plan for consistency with the public trust doctrine and act requirements. If disapproved, the trustee must submit a revised plan within 180 days. If the revised plan is still inconsistent, trustee's rights to the trust lands revert to the state. The plan must include a detailed program for development, preservation, or use of the trust lands. The trust lands use plan must include a description of planned land uses, statewide benefits, financing methods, implementation timetable, and measures to protect natural and manmade resources, including addressing impacts from sea level rise. The trustee must submit procedures, rules, and regulations for approval by the commission as part of the trust lands use plan. This includes lease rates, terms, renegotiation provisions, and submission of all leases and agreements to the commission upon request. Additionally, the trustee must submit a report on the utilization of trust lands every five years. The trustee must submit a report every five years detailing the uses of trust lands, including a list of lease holders, their uses of the land, consideration provided, and any restrictions imposed. The trustee must submit a report every five years detailing the uses of trust lands. If the land utilization has not changed, a new report is not required, but a letter stating so must be submitted to the commission. The trustee is also required to demonstrate good faith in implementing and amending the trust lands use plan as needed. The trustee must establish accounting procedures to track revenues and expenditures from trust lands. If the trustee fails to improve or maintain the trust lands as required, all rights revert to the state. Trust revenues from trust lands must be used only for purposes consistent with the act. The trustee must segregate these revenues from other city funds to ensure they are only spent on enhancing or maintaining the trust lands. Trust revenues can also be used to acquire upland properties that benefit the trust, subject to approval by the commission. The trustee must comply with Section 6306 of the Public Resources Code. Before spending trust revenues on a capital improvement exceeding $250,000, the trustee must submit a detailed description to the commission at least 120 days in advance. Compliance with Section 6306 of the Public Resources Code is required. The commission must determine if a capital improvement is in the statewide interest and consistent with certain regulations within 120 days of filing. If the improvement is not authorized, trust revenues cannot be used unless approved by a court order. The trustee has the authority to sue the state to obtain an order or judgment related to trust revenues. The suit takes precedence over other civil matters, and the Attorney General will defend the state. If the state loses the case, no costs can be recovered. The commission receives 20% of gross revenue from trust lands annually, allocating 80% to the General Fund and 20% to the Land Bank Fund. They can conduct inquiries to ensure compliance with the act and other laws regarding trust lands. The commission must approve any reimbursement for nontrust revenue expenditures on trust improvements, or they will be considered a gift. If the trustee violates the trust grant or public trust doctrine, they have 30 days to correct it; otherwise, the commission can take legal action to enforce the state and people's rights as beneficiaries. The Attorney General represents the state in actions related to the trust lands. No costs are recovered from the state if judgment is against it. Section 6359 requirements do not apply to the trust lands granted. Three parcels of tide and submerged lands in San Francisco Bay, Alameda County, are described. PARCEL 1: Starting at point \"A\" on the Map of the Grant to the City of Albany, recorded in 1963, with coordinates x = 1,469,703.82 feet and y = 511,851.40 feet. The parcel follows a specific boundary with ten courses before returning to the True Point of Beginning. PARCEL 2: Starting at Point \u201cJ\u201d with coordinates x = 1,474,154.14 feet and y = 510,458.00 feet, following specific courses before returning to the point of beginning. Coordinates based on California Coordinate System, Zone 2. \n\nPARCEL 3: Described as Parcel 1 in a deed to the City of Albany, recorded in 1942. No reimbursement required by this act as the costs incurred by local agencies or school districts are due to a program for which legislative authority was requested."
