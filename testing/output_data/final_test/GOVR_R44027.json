Users can search federal awards by state, congressional district, county, and zip code. Grant awards cover projects in various areas, while contract awards involve bids for goods and services. The site also offers tools to analyze federal spending by categories like budget function and agency. The federal government uses object class to categorize purchases for Medicare, national defense, grants, contracts, and personnel compensation. Congress passed laws like FFATA and ARRA to improve tracking of federal awards through USAspending.gov, replacing older data collection methods. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) mandated reporting of stimulus funding and expenditures data on USAspending.gov. The DATA Act aimed to standardize government data for better reporting accuracy, but challenges remain in accessing complete and precise federal funds information. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified ongoing data quality problems with federal funds reported by agencies under the DATA Act standards on USAspending.gov. The beta version of the website, now official since March 2018, had issues with data completeness, accuracy, and disclosure. Continuous improvements are being made, but users should be cautious of potentially incomplete or inaccurate search results. The DATA Act required the Department of the Treasury and OMB to develop government-wide data standardization to improve reporting on grant awards and contracts, addressing underreporting and inconsistencies identified by GAO. These requirements aimed to enhance transparency by disclosing direct agency expenditures and linking federal spending information to agency programs, establishing data standards for financial data, and simplifying reporting processes. The DATA Act mandated the Treasury and OMB to standardize government data for better grant and contract reporting, aiming to improve transparency and accuracy. Agencies must submit award transaction reports within 30 days to USAspending.gov, which displays awards but not recipient spending data. OMB must ensure all data on the site meets government-wide standards by spring 2018. USAspending.gov allows users to search for prime and subaward data back to FY2008 by various criteria. Users can filter by award type, agency, recipient, location, and more. Details on individual awards can be viewed by clicking on the Award ID. The site also allows users to compare Place of Performance versus Recipient Location. The Spending Explorer tool on USAspending.gov allows users to download results lists at the award or transaction level, providing details on federal spending obligations by budget function, agency, and object class. The tool offers interactive data visualization and breakdowns by categories such as Social Security, Medicare, and national defense. The Profiles Tab includes subtabs with data on each agency's total budgetary resources and obligated amounts. The advanced search feature is continuously being developed with new features becoming available. The Spending Explorer tool on USAspending.gov provides details on federal spending obligations, including breakdowns by object class and federal accounts. Users can track spending obligations through nearly 2,000 federal accounts, view data visually through graphs and infographics, and access breakdowns of awarded amounts to each state. Recipients profiles entities that have received federal awards, including contracts, grants, loans, and other financial assistance. The Download Center allows users to access data on award trends and top rankings in various categories. The Download Center on USAspending.gov provides bulk exporting of award data sets by agency, award type, and fiscal year. Custom download pages offer additional filtering options for large data sets. State and local governments may act as pass-throughs for federal grant funding, redistributing funds to localities through subgrants or subcontracts. Federal grant funding is often awarded to states, which then distribute the funds to subrecipients within the state. This can result in the project's place of performance differing from the initial recipient location. Funds may pass through multiple jurisdictions before reaching the final place of performance, leading to potential discrepancies in federal funding distribution across different areas. When analyzing federal grant funding distribution, it is important to search USAspending.gov data by place of performance to identify awards by project location. Procurement awards may involve corporations with headquarters in one state but manufacturing facilities in multiple states. The USAspending.gov advanced award search allows filtering by state and congressional district, but caution is advised when comparing data over time due to potential changes in district borders and numbers during redistricting. The USAspending.gov data can be searched by place of performance to track federal grant funding distribution. Comparing data over time should consider changes in district borders due to redistricting. State capitals may receive more federal funds due to block and formula grants distributed by State Administering Agencies. The General Services Administration maintains the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation for federal contracts information. The Federal Procurement Data System provides contracts data from FY2000 onwards, including contracts over $25,000 and summary data for procurements under $25,000. It offers search capabilities by state, contractor name, and product/service category. Entities receiving $750,000+ in federal grants must submit audits, with data posted on the Census Bureau's Federal Audit Clearinghouse site. No printed documents are produced, and the audit data corresponds to the filing agency's fiscal year. The Analytical Perspectives volume of the President's budget covers various topics, including \"Aid to State and Local Governments\" (Chapter 17 in the FY2020 report). Federal grants-in-aid to state and local governments, U.S. territories, and American Indian tribal governments are intended to support government operations or the provision of services to the public. Grants are most often awarded as direct cash assistance, but federal grants-in-aid also can include payments for grants-in-kind\u2014nonmonetary aid such as commodities purchased for the National School. The FY2020 budget proposes $751 billion in outlays for aid to state and local governments, with individual program tables showing state-by-state obligations for federal grants-in-aid programs. These grants can be categorical or block grants, awarded by formula, project, or matching funds. State and local governments may provide services directly as recipients of federal grant funding. The Census Bureau reports from FY1983 to FY2010 summarized the distribution of federal funds to states and counties, including grants, contracts, and appropriations. The termination of the Federal Financial Statistics program led to the last reports being issued in FY2010. Federal obligations data are now available on USAspending.gov. USAspending.gov is now the official source for federal awards data, covering government expenditures to state and local governments. The data includes payments to nongovernmental recipients and provides information at the state and county level for various categories such as grants, salaries, contracts, and loans. Congressional districts are indicated for each county, but separate data by CD is not provided. Some agencies, particularly those awarding research grants, also post data on federal grants and contracts awarded. Some agencies, especially those awarding research grants, post information on their websites. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Current Research Information System provides details on ongoing agricultural, food science, human nutrition, and forestry research funded by NIFA grant programs. Department of Education (ED) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also have systems for tracking funded research grants and contracts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System (TAGGS) database contains awards from HHS and its subsidiaries. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools RePORTER includes projects funded by various agencies. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) database features ongoing health services research projects. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides information on Public Assistance Grant Awards Activity. The curr_chunk provides links to various government agencies' grant award databases, including FEMA, DOJ, DOL, and EPA. It includes details such as FEMA region, state, disaster declaration number, obligated federal dollars, and date of obligation for Public Assistance Grant Awards. EPA's database contains nonconstruction grants awarded in the last 10 years. The curr_chunk provides links to government agencies' grant award databases, including IMLS, NEA, NEH, NSF, and Research.gov. It includes information on awarded grants and funded projects from these agencies. The SBIR/STTR program aims to promote technology innovation by supporting small businesses in federal research. 11 federal agencies participate in the program, including Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Transportation, EPA, NASA, and NSF. The Transportation Research Board's Research in Progress website allows viewing projects by subject, individuals, or organizations. Deloitte, Urban Institute, and U.S. Senate reports discuss federal agency compliance with the DATA Act and tracking federal funding to local governments. Deloitte's report focuses on changing technology and culture, while the U.S. Senate report details the failure of federal agencies to submit accurate data on spending taxpayer dollars. Urban Institute's report provides insights on how to track federal funding to local governments."
