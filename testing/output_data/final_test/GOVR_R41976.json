    "content": "Section 271(b) of the Patent Act provides indirect infringement liability for actively inducing patent infringement, as seen in the Supreme Court case Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A. The Court inferred that some intent is required for liability, as the adverb \"actively\" suggests affirmative steps must be taken to induce infringement. The Supreme Court ruled in Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A. that induced infringement under Section 271(b) requires actual knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement. The defendant must have known about the infringement or deliberately ignored the high probability of it. This knowledge standard can be met through \"willful blindness.\" The Supreme Court applied the \"willful blindness\" doctrine to a civil patent infringement case for the first time in Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A. This established a standard for proving knowing or willful conduct in patent infringement cases and federal criminal cases involving knowledge. The case analyzed the impact on patent holders' exclusive rights under the Patent Act. The Patent Act allows a patent holder to take legal action against someone who infringes on their patent rights. Liability extends to those who actively induce infringement by others, based on long-standing precedent. Direct patent infringement is a strict liability offense, regardless of the infringer's knowledge or intent. Indirect infringement under Section 271(b) requires evidence of actual infringement by a direct infringer, active steps taken by the defendant to encourage infringement, and proof of the defendant's mental state. The courts have struggled to define the necessary mental state for induced infringement, leading to confusion caused by conflicting decisions from the Federal Circuit. The plaintiff must prove that the defendant had specific intent to encourage infringement for liability under Section 271(b), as clarified by the Federal Circuit in various cases. The en banc court clarified that the plaintiff must show that the alleged infringer induced infringing acts and knew or should have known his actions would lead to infringement. Prior to the Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A. decision, the U.S. Supreme Court had not addressed the knowledge requirement for inducement liability under Section 271(b) of the Patent Act. SEB S.A., a French company, holds a U.S. patent for a \"cool-touch\" deep-fat fryer design. Pentalpha Enterprises, a Hong Kong corporation, copied the \"cool-touch\" design of a deep-fat fryer from SEB without informing their U.S. patent attorney. This fryer was later sold to Sunbeam Products in the United States, leading to a patent infringement case. Pentalpha copied the design of an SEB deep fryer without informing their attorney, who failed to find SEB's patent. Pentalpha sold the fryers to Sunbeam, leading to a patent infringement lawsuit where Sunbeam settled with SEB for $2 million. Pentalpha continued selling deep fryers to other resellers despite being sued for patent infringement by SEB. The jury found Pentalpha guilty of willful infringement and inducing others to infringe SEB's patent, awarding SEB $4.65 million. Pentalpha later asked the court to reduce the damages by $2 million due to Sunbeam's settlement with SEB, which was approved. The court approved SEB's request for enhanced damages and attorneys' fees due to Pentalpha's willful infringement. Pentalpha sought a new trial, arguing lack of proof for inducement under Section 271(b), but the court upheld the jury's finding. Pentalpha appealed to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the district court's judgment. The appellate court affirmed the district court's judgment on February 5, 2010, regarding induced infringement under Section 271(b). The court clarified the intent required for induced infringement and stated that a claim for inducement is viable even without direct evidence of knowledge of the patent-in-suit. Constructive knowledge of the patent could be shown by proof of the defendant's deliberate indifference to a known risk. The Federal Circuit found evidence that Pentalpha deliberately disregarded the known risk of SEB's patent, even without direct evidence of knowledge. This deliberate indifference was considered a form of actual knowledge, leading to a judgment of induced infringement under Section 271(b). Pentalpha and Global-Tech petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for writ of certiorari on June 23, 2010, which was accepted on October 12, 2010. In a 8-1 decision on May 31, 2011, the Court affirmed Pentalpha's liability for inducing infringement of SEB's patent. The Court rejected the \"deliberate indifference\" standard and adopted a higher \"willful blindness\" standard for proving intent under Section 271(b) without proof of actual knowledge of the patent. The Court inferred that intent is required for liability under Section 271(b) of the patent law, based on dictionary definitions of \"induce\" and \"actively.\" There are two possible interpretations of \"induces infringement\": either leading another to engage in conduct that amounts to infringement or persuading another to engage in conduct that the infringer knows is infringement. The Court resolved this ambiguity by relying on an analysis of the statutory text. The Court relied on legislative history and case law, specifically Aro II, to resolve ambiguity in the statutory text of Section 271(b) of the Patent Act of 1952. Justice Alito determined that Aro II decision \"resolves the question in this case\" regarding the requisite state of mind for contributory infringement under Section 271(c). The Court, in interpreting Section 271(b) of the Patent Act, addressed the ambiguity regarding the knowledge requirement for contributory infringement. The Aro II decision established that knowledge of the patent being infringed is necessary. Justice Alito emphasized the importance of stare decisis in statutory interpretation. The Supreme Court clarified that induced infringement under Section 271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement. The Court rejected the Federal Circuit's standard of \"deliberate indifference\" to a known risk of infringement, stating it does not require active efforts to avoid knowing about the infringing activities. Instead, the Court emphasized the need for a higher standard of knowledge. The Supreme Court established that for Section 271(b) inducement cases lacking direct evidence of knowledge, the appropriate standard is \"willful blindness.\" This doctrine holds individuals accountable for deliberately avoiding clear evidence of critical facts, effectively equating it to actual knowledge. This standard is widely used in criminal law cases and can substitute for a requirement of knowledge. The Supreme Court established the willful blindness doctrine for civil lawsuits involving induced patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b). The doctrine requires the defendant to believe in a high probability of a fact's existence and take deliberate actions to avoid confirming it. This standard surpasses recklessness and negligence, holding individuals accountable for avoiding clear evidence of wrongdoing. The Supreme Court established the willful blindness doctrine for civil lawsuits involving induced patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b). The doctrine surpasses recklessness and negligence, holding individuals accountable for avoiding clear evidence of wrongdoing. The Court affirmed the finding of inducement liability for Pentalpha based on evidence that showed deliberate steps to avoid knowing about the patent infringement. Justice Kennedy dissented on the first holding regarding defendant liability for inducing infringement. Justice Kennedy disagreed with the Court's holding that \"willful blindness will suffice\" for the statutory requirement of knowledge in inducing patent infringement under Section 271(b). He criticized the majority opinion for lacking Supreme Court precedent on this issue and argued that willful blindness should not be equated with knowledge. Kennedy warned that the Court's willful blindness test could lead to a problematic situation where one believes there is a high probability of patent infringement but still concludes there is none. The Supreme Court in Global-Tech held that Section 271(b) requires specific intent to induce acts that constitute patent infringement. The alleged inducer's actual knowledge of the patent is not necessarily required, as the knowledge requirement may be satisfied by the \"willful blindness\" doctrine. Justice Kennedy criticized the Court for endorsing the willful blindness doctrine without proper briefing or argument from the criminal defense bar. The Supreme Court's decision in Global-Tech raises the bar for proving active inducement of patent infringement under Section 271(b) by requiring specific intent. The ruling's impact extends beyond patent law to federal cases with knowledge requirements. Observers praise the narrow application of the \"willful blindness\" rule, which clarifies ambiguity in the previous \"deliberate indifference\" standard. Several questions remain unresolved after the Global-Tech case. Several questions remain following the Global-Tech case, including whether a defendant's \"willful blindness\" can extend to induced acts of infringement and the definition of \"knowledge of the patent.\" These issues are yet to be resolved by future litigation or Congress."
