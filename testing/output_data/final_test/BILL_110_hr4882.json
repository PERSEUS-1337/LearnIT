    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Broadcast Licensing in the Public Interest Act\". The Congress recognizes the broadcast airwaves as a valuable public resource, with television and radio spectrum potentially generating billions of dollars if auctioned. Broadcast licensees are obligated to serve the public interest, as stated in the Communications Act of 1934. The Supreme Court affirmed in 1969 that the First Amendment aims to protect free speech. Drastic media consolidation has reduced broadcast licensees' public interest obligations and diversity. Only 0.4% of TV programming focuses on local public affairs, while paid programming and entertainment dominate. Local public affairs programming airs mostly on weekend mornings when television viewership is lower. Independently produced programming now makes up less than one-fifth of prime time television, with major networks featuring even less. A survey of evening news broadcasts before the 2004 election found that only 8% covered local elections, while sports and weather received significantly more coverage. In 2006, politics and government news made up about 10% of local television news stories. Local television news coverage is dominated by crime and traffic stories, making up nearly 50 percent of the content. SEC. 3. BASIS FOR PUBLIC INTEREST DETERMINATIONS. Section 309(k) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include requirements for a station to demonstrate dedication to civic affairs, local news gathering, local production of programming, and commitment to providing the public interest, convenience, and necessity. The Communications Act of 1934 amendment requires stations to demonstrate commitment to civic affairs, local news, and educational programming for children through regulations set by the Commission. The amendment requires licensees to detail how they fulfill obligations, involve the public in compliance checks, and may have exemptions based on Commission decisions. SEC. 4. TERMS OF LICENSES amended to change license duration from 8 years to 3 years for licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission after the enactment of this Act."
