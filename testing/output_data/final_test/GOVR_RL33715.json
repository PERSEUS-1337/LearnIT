Despite efforts to enhance its intelligence program post-9/11, the Pentagon denies engaging in covert actions. In 1990, Congress tightened regulations on covert actions following the Iran-Contra scandal, where the Reagan Administration secretly sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to support the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance. This led to new restrictions and notification procedures for covert action programs. In 1991, Congress defined covert action as activities to influence conditions abroad without public acknowledgment. The legislative background dates back to 1974 when Congress asserted control over covert actions in response to revelations about military operations. The Hughes-Ryan Amendment required presidential approval for CIA funds for covert actions. In 1980, Congress replaced the Hughes-Ryan Amendment with a new statutory framework for oversight of covert actions, requiring the executive branch to report to the two intelligence committees and establish procedures for notifying Congress before implementing such operations. In 1984, the \"Gang of Eight\" was established for limited prior notice to key congressional leaders regarding covert actions. The \"Casey Accords\" in 1986 outlined procedures for reporting covert actions to Congress. In 1986, an addendum was signed by the committee's principals and the DCI, requiring prior notice to Congress before supplying significant military equipment in ongoing operations. This agreement followed President Reagan's authorization of secret missile transfers to Iran. President Reagan later issued a directive prohibiting retroactive findings and mandating written findings. The executive branch can modify or revoke such directives without congressional approval. In 1988, bipartisan legislation was approved by the Senate in response to the Iran-Contra revelations. In response to the Iran-Contra affair fallout, Congress attempted to tighten oversight of covert actions in 1990. The Senate approved legislation requiring the President to notify congressional intelligence committees within 48 hours of implementing a covert action if prior notice was not given. However, President George H. W. Bush vetoed the bill, citing concerns about the ambiguous language regarding notification timelines. In 1990, Congress attempted to tighten oversight of covert actions following the Iran-Contra affair fallout. Legislation was approved requiring the President to notify congressional intelligence committees within 48 hours of implementing a covert action if prior notice was not given. President George H. W. Bush vetoed the bill due to concerns about ambiguous language regarding notification timelines. In 1991, Congress approved new measures specifying that prior notice of a covert action must be provided within a few days, except in exigent circumstances. President Bush signed the revised provision into law, eliminating references to third-party covert action requests. These provisions remain in effect today. Since the 9/11 attacks, concerns have arisen about the Pentagon's expanded intelligence efforts, with lawmakers worried about creating a separate intelligence capability parallel to the CIA. The Pentagon argues that its increased intelligence operations are necessary to support ground troops post-9/11, focusing on gathering intelligence rather than conducting different activities. The Pentagon's expanded intelligence efforts post-9/11 have raised concerns about creating a separate intelligence capability parallel to the CIA. American troops are now more likely to work with indigenous forces in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan to combat terrorist organizations. The U.S. military has carried out secret attacks against militants in Syria, Pakistan, and elsewhere since 2004. The DOD has been paying private contractors in Iraq to produce media products to support U.S. objectives and the Iraqi government. The Pentagon's expanded intelligence efforts post-9/11 have raised concerns about creating a separate intelligence capability parallel to the CIA. According to then-Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair, there is often no clear distinction between traditional secret intelligence missions carried out by the military and the CIA. Operations must be considered on a case-by-case basis, with flexibility for design and execution by the President and relevant authorities. Former DNI Blair's views align with former CIA Director Michael Hayden's comments on the difficulty of distinguishing between military and intelligence missions. CIA Director Michael Hayden and General James R. Clapper Jr. discussed the challenges of distinguishing between military and CIA intelligence missions. Hayden mentioned the difficulty in differentiating between the two, while Clapper emphasized that covert activities are typically not carried out by uniformed military forces. Military forces are said to engage in clandestine activities rather than covert actions. General Clapper explained that clandestine activities involve secret intelligence gathering, while covert actions aim to induce change in a target's behavior. He distinguished between covert actions, which are unacknowledged by the government, and clandestine activities, which can be publicly acknowledged if discovered. This acknowledgment provides certain protections under the Geneva Conventions for military personnel involved. General Clapper emphasized the need for a clear distinction between clandestine and covert activities to ensure proper oversight and risk management. Some argue for increased congressional oversight of military activities that may not meet the definition of covert action. The Senate Intelligence Committee expressed concerns about the expansion of military source operations authority, allowing for clandestine HUMINT operations worldwide. The Senate Intelligence Committee raised concerns about Combatant Commands conducting clandestine HUMINT operations worldwide, noting that these activities could be considered covert actions. Department of Defense officials suggested updating the law to align with U.S. Special Operations Command's missions, but emphasized the flexibility granted to the President and Secretary of Defense in Section 167. The current statute on covert action remains largely unchanged. The current statute on covert action, established in 1991, codified elements of the \"Casey Accords\" and imposed new requirements. These include a written finding, no retroactive authorization, necessity to support US foreign policy objectives, specification of involved agencies, prohibition on influencing US political processes, and adherence to the Constitution. The 1991 statute on covert action requires a written finding before any funds can be spent on covert activities. Covert action is defined as activities to influence foreign conditions where the US role is not publicly acknowledged. Congressional leaders and intelligence committees must be notified of covert actions and any significant changes. The 1991 statute on covert action requires a written finding before funds can be spent on activities not publicly acknowledged. Congress defined covert action as influencing foreign conditions without public acknowledgment. Conferees clarified that misleading adversaries about U.S. military capabilities is not covert action. Congress also outlined four categories of activities that do not constitute covert action, including intelligence acquisition. The report addresses traditional military activities and routine support to those activities, including activities by military personnel under the direction of a United States military commander. The curr_chunk discusses activities under the direction of a US military commander preceding or related to hostilities involving US military forces. It distinguishes between activities under military control and those that are not considered \"traditional military activities.\" The curr_chunk discusses whether activities undertaken before a US military operation are considered \"covert action\" or \"routine support.\" Examples of routine support include providing logistical support for publicly acknowledged military operations. The committee defines \"other-than-routine\" support activities in another country as clandestine efforts to recruit or train foreign nationals, influence public opinion, and influence foreign officials without their government's knowledge in preparation for a US military operation. Timing of these activities does not determine their classification. The distinction between routine and \"other-than-routine\" support of military activities is based on whether the activity is unilateral or involves foreign nationals. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence expressed concern about the blurring line between CIA intelligence-gathering and DOD clandestine operations, urging the Defense Department to inform the committee of such activities labeled as \"Operational Preparation of the Environment\" (OPE). The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence raised concerns about the Defense Department's use of the term \"Operational Preparation of the Environment\" (OPE) for military intelligence-gathering operations, stating that it blurs the line between traditional military activities and intelligence functions. The committee highlighted the lack of clear guidelines for determining when OPE is appropriate, leading to potential diplomatic and national security risks. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence expressed concerns about the Defense Department's use of \"Operational Preparation of the Environment\" (OPE) blurring the line between military and intelligence activities. The lack of clear guidelines for OPE raises policy questions for Congress regarding oversight roles, committee involvement, and the potential need for foreign support in intelligence operations. The Pentagon's use of \"Operational Preparation of the Environment\" (OPE) blurs the line between military and intelligence activities, raising concerns about oversight and the need for foreign support in intelligence operations. The Defense Department's activities in combating terrorism may not fall under the statutory definition of covert action, but questions remain about its authority and compliance with covert action requirements. The Pentagon's use of \"Operational Preparation of the Environment\" blurs the line between military and intelligence activities, raising oversight concerns. President George H. W. Bush argued in 1991 that Congress's definition of \"covert action\" was unnecessary. Congress may need to update Section 167 of Title 10 to clarify Pentagon authorities and covert action guidelines. The Armed Forces protect the US and its interests, influence foreign capabilities, and prepare for operations."
