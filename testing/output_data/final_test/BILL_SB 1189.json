    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts the following. Section 27491.4 of the Government Code is amended to read: 27491.4. The coroner has the authority to take possession of the body, conduct postmortem examinations, autopsies, and analyze body fluids and tissues to determine the cause of death. The coroner has the authority to conduct postmortem examinations, autopsies, and analyze body fluids and tissues to determine the cause of death. The written opinions and conclusions of the examining physician will be included in the coroner's record, along with necessary tissues retained for verification. Only individuals directly involved in the investigation may be present during the autopsy. The coroner may not perform an autopsy if the deceased has made arrangements for body disposition unless the attending physician cannot be reached, in which case, notification must be given to specific family members or individuals with the right to control the remains. After attempting to contact the physician last in attendance and notifying responsible parties, the coroner may authorize an autopsy after 24 hours as required by law. The coroner has the discretion to conduct an autopsy on victims of sudden, unexpected, or unexplained deaths, accidents, suicides, or suspected criminal means. Section 27491.41 of the Government Code defines sudden infant death syndrome as the unexpected death of an infant with no clear cause after a thorough postmortem examination. The Legislature recognizes sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as a significant issue in California, leading to one out of every 500 infant deaths. To aid in research and understanding of SIDS, the coroner must conduct an autopsy within 24 hours of any sudden infant death, unless the attending physician certifies it as SIDS, in which case the coroner may still perform an autopsy. The autopsy for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) must follow a standardized protocol developed by the State Department of Public Health, exempt from procedural requirements for administrative rules and regulations. The protocol for conducting autopsies on sudden infant death syndrome cases must be followed by all coroners in the state. It includes guidelines for scene investigations, data requirements, cause of death determination, tissue sampling criteria, and the submission of samples to a central repository designated by the State Department of Public Health. The State Department of Public Health establishes procedures for researchers to access tissues and data for research with confidentiality requirements. Coroners can take tissue samples from infants for research without consent if it won't cause disfigurement. Liability protection is provided for compliance with this section, and consent is not required for autopsies. Section 27491.43 of the Government Code allows coroners to refrain from performing procedures on a decedent's body if a certificate of religious belief is provided. If informed before the procedure, the coroner will not order an autopsy if a certificate of religious belief is provided within 48 hours. Any person 18 years or older can execute this certificate stating that certain procedures would violate their religious convictions. The certificate must be signed in the presence of two witnesses. The coroner may order an autopsy or other procedure if there is suspicion of criminal act or public health hazard. If a certificate is produced, the coroner can petition the court to authorize the procedure or set aside the certificate if not properly executed. The court may order an autopsy despite a valid certificate if the cause of death is unclear and public interest outweighs religious beliefs. The procedure must be the least intrusive. If the petition is denied, the body is released immediately. If the cause of death remains undetermined, the coroner can note on the death certificate that an autopsy was not conducted due to legal provisions. The coroner is allowed to retain pituitary glands for research purposes if the body is unclaimed after an autopsy. The coroner is not liable for any actions taken in compliance with this provision. The coroner can remove the pituitary gland from a body during an autopsy for use in manufacturing hormones for hypopituitary dwarfs, if there is no objection from the deceased or specified individuals. There is no civil liability for the removal, and the coroner is not subject to criminal prosecution. The coroner can remove the pituitary gland from a body during an autopsy for manufacturing hormones for hypopituitary dwarfs, without objection or legal consequences. The coroner, under certain conditions, can authorize the removal and release of corneal eye tissue during an autopsy, as stated in Section 27491.47 of the Government Code. The consent for tissue donation can be obtained through a written form, recorded telephonic consent, or verbal telephonic consent, as specified in Section 7151 of the Health and Safety Code. The form of consent obtained for tissue donation must be kept on file for at least three years. The tissue removal process must not mutilate the body, be done by a licensed physician or trained technician, and the tissue will be used for transplant, therapeutic, or scientific purposes. Section 27520 of the Government Code states that neither the coroner nor medical examiner, nor any related entities, will be held liable for the removal of corneal tissue if the person did not object beforehand. This section does not affect a person's ability to make an anatomical gift under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. The Government Code is amended to allow the coroner to perform an autopsy on a decedent if requested in writing by the surviving spouse, child, parent, or next of kin, regardless of whether an autopsy has already been performed. A forensic autopsy, defined as an examination to determine the cause of death, must be conducted by a licensed physician and surgeon. The cost of the autopsy is the responsibility of the person requesting it. Additionally, a postmortem examination, which does not determine the cause of death, is also defined in the section. (d) The manner of death is determined by the county coroner or medical examiner. A forensic autopsy must be conducted by a licensed physician and surgeon, with consultation from the coroner or medical examiner. (e) All individuals in the autopsy suite must be informed of bloodborne pathogen risks and wear personal protective equipment. (f) Only those directly involved in the death investigation are allowed in the autopsy suite. If an individual dies in law enforcement activity, personnel involved cannot be present during the autopsy. Exceptions may be made for educational or research purposes. Police reports and other relevant information must be shared with the physician conducting the autopsy. Autopsies for educational or research purposes are not restricted by this section. Reimbursement for state-mandated costs in this act will be provided to local agencies and school districts by the Commission on State Mandates according to the Government Code."
