    "content": "The \"Reprocessed Single Use Medical Device Patient Safety Act of 1999\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by adding a section on reprocessed medical devices. The \"Reprocessed Single Use Medical Device Patient Safety Act of 1999\" amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by addressing concerns about reprocessed medical devices labeled for single use causing serious injury and being used without FDA approval. The purpose of this section is to require the FDA to have the knowledge and expertise to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of reprocessed medical devices labeled for single use, enforce provisions addressing device safety, and ensure all FDA-regulated devices are safe and effective with appropriate oversight. The FDA must enforce provisions of the Act for reprocessed medical devices, including registration, listing, and safety controls. Patients must give informed consent before using certain reprocessed medical devices. Reprocessing facilities must register with the FDA and provide necessary information annually. Every person or establishment engaged in reprocessing single-use medical devices must submit required information to the FDA annually. They must also provide necessary information for compliance to users of reprocessed devices. Safety and effectiveness requirements must be met within 6 months of the enactment of this section. Before introducing a reprocessed medical device labeled for single use into interstate commerce, every person or establishment must meet safety and effectiveness requirements to demonstrate to the Secretary. Informed patient consent is required for the use of class II, class III, or critical class I reprocessed medical devices in medical care, along with maintaining medical records. Before introducing a reprocessed medical device labeled for single use into interstate commerce, every person or establishment must meet safety and effectiveness requirements to demonstrate to the Secretary. Informed patient consent is required for the use of class II, class III, or critical class I reprocessed medical devices in medical care, along with maintaining medical records. Those using such devices must keep a record of use, including details of the reprocessor and original manufacturer, to be included in the individual's medical record. The Secretary is required to submit a report to the Committee within 9 months of the enactment of this section. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on FDA studies regarding the safety and efficacy of reprocessing single-use devices. MEDWATCH forms will be modified to include information on reprocessed medical devices. All regulations governing devices also apply to reprocessed medical devices. Definitions for critical class I medical devices are provided in this section. The term 'critical class I medical device' refers to a device that may breach the mucosal boundary, bloodstream, or other non-sterile areas of the body. A 'reprocessed medical device' is one labeled for single use but cleaned for reuse on another individual. Reprocessing is the procedure used to produce a reprocessed medical device."
