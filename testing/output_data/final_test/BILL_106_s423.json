    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Addiction Free Treatment Act of 1999\". It includes findings related to addiction treatment. Congress finds that heroin use in the United States is increasing, especially among teenagers and college-age students. There are an estimated 810,000 chronic heroin users in the country, with 115,000 currently in methadone programs. Methadone, a synthetic opiate used in heroin addiction treatment, can lead to addiction transfer. The Federal Government should implement a zero-tolerance, non-pharmacological policy to help methadone addicts detoxify like heroin addicts. The approach should address various needs contributing to relapse and aim to help former heroin addicts become drug-free, self-sufficient members of society. PROHIBITION ON MEDICAID FUNDS FOR CERTAIN METHADONE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS. Section 1903(i) of the Social Security Act is amended to prohibit Medicaid funds for drug treatment programs using methadone or Levo-Alpha Acetyl-Methadol unless the program aims to eliminate drug addiction within 6 months. Methadone treatment program must conduct frequent drug testing, provide documentation of results, require drug-free patients, and terminate treatment for those testing positive for illegal narcotics. Prohibition on the use of certain Public Health Service Act funds for methadone maintenance programs. Section 501 of the Public Health Service Act prohibits the use of funds for drug treatment programs using methadone or Levo-Alpha Acetyl-Methadol unless the program aims to eliminate drug addiction, sets a timetable for treatment termination within 6 months, and conducts regular drug testing. The Public Health Service Act requires drug treatment programs using methadone or Levo-Alpha Acetyl-Methadol to conduct regular drug testing, document results, ensure patients are drug-free during treatment, and terminate treatment for patients testing positive for illegal narcotics. The Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse will conduct a study on nonpharmacological heroin rehabilitation programs and methadone-to-abstinence programs within 3 years of the Act's enactment. Additionally, an annual report on the effectiveness of heroin rehabilitation programs will be required. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit an annual report to Congress on the effectiveness of heroin rehabilitation programs, focusing on nonpharmacological and methadone-to-abstinence approaches. This requirement will end after the 5th report. The amendments made by this Act will apply to expenditures 6 months after enactment."
