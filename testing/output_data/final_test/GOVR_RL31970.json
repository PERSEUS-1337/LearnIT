    "content": "U.S. farmers are increasingly using biotechnology to grow genetically engineered crops like corn, soybeans, and cotton to cut costs and reduce labor. In 2002, the U.S. accounted for 66% of global GE crop acreage. These crops heavily rely on export markets, with significant portions of soybeans, corn, and cotton production being exported. These exports, including both GE and non-GE varieties, contributed to a substantial portion of the total value of U.S. agricultural exports from 2000 to 2002. The U.S. regulatory system does not differentiate between GE and non-GE varieties, giving U.S. handlers a competitive advantage in global markets. The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology guides the regulation of biotech products based on their characteristics, not production methods. If a biotech food is deemed equivalent to conventional food, it is not subject to additional regulation. The U.S. regulatory system treats genetically engineered (GE) and non-GE foods equally, giving U.S. producers a competitive edge in global markets. The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology ensures that biotech products are regulated based on their traits, not how they are produced. GE foods approved as equivalent to conventional foods do not require additional labeling unless they differ significantly, such as containing allergens or altered nutritional content. However, concerns about the safety of GE crops and animals persist in some countries, like the European Union. The EU and other trading partners have divergent approaches to regulating biotechnology, causing barriers for U.S. exporters. The EU has a moratorium on approving new GE crop varieties since 1998. The U.S., Canada, and Argentina challenged the EU policy in the WTO in 2003, citing violations of trade agreements and unwarranted safety concerns about agricultural biotechnology. The EU defends its precautionary approach to protect consumers when scientific evidence is inconclusive. The approach of more vigorously regulating or prohibiting products with insufficient scientific evidence of potential dangers to health is being adopted in markets like Japan and South Korea. Countries like China are imposing their own approval and labeling regulations for GMOs, creating uncertainty for U.S. exporters. Some U.S. producers are hesitant about expanding genetically engineered (GE) wheat varieties due to uncertainties in foreign markets. While some growers are eager to plant new varieties, others want wider global acceptance before commercialization approvals. Wheat growers heavily rely on exports, with 56% of production exported, valued at $3.6 billion annually. Countries worldwide have varying approaches to regulating agricultural biotechnology, with critics noting a lack of coherent policies in many developing nations. Internationally, there is a lack of coherent policy on GMO regulation, with each country having its own system. Attempts to harmonize regulations are ongoing, but disparities still exist. Some argue that scientific knowledge on biotechnology's effects is incomplete, leading to a precautionary approach in regulation. National biotechnology regulations fall into two broad categories: approval for commercialization and the need for global acceptance before commercialization. Biotechnology regulation for agricultural products varies globally, with countries like the US, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Argentina, and South Africa having flexible approval processes. India and China are also increasing approvals, but may face import obstacles. In contrast, Australia, the EU, and New Zealand have seen slower approvals. Around 30 countries have developed policies on GE approvals, with some having labeling and traceability systems in place. In many countries, labeling of GMO products is voluntary, but the EU and over 20 other countries have mandatory labeling regulations in place. Countries like Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, and the UK have implemented mandatory labeling regimes, while others are still in the process of finalizing their proposals. Mandatory labeling also requires traceability to track GMO presence from farm to sale. The diversity in national approaches to GMO regulation is influenced by international factors. The range of national approaches to GMO regulation is influenced by the evolving international consensus on agricultural biotechnology regulation. Efforts are being made in multinational institutions to establish harmonized standards for the safety of GE crops and foods. The goal of international regulation is still unclear, with various international bodies playing a role in resolving these questions. There is no common view on the goal of international regulation in biotechnology. Various multinational bodies are involved in regulation and standard-setting, with differing priorities such as safety, trade, and ethical concerns. The Codex, created in 1963 by FAO and WHO, develops food standards to protect consumer health, ensure fair trade, and coordinate food standards work. It also addresses biotechnology with a task force focusing on health implications and developing standards. The task force developed Draft Principles for the Risk Analysis of Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Microorganisms, which were to be approved by the Commission in July 2003. Discussions were contentious, with the EU advocating for full traceability of GE products while the US argued for traceability only for food safety purposes. The US believed these issues should be addressed in other Codex committees as they are not unique to biotechnology. The 2000 Cartagena Biosafety Protocol focuses on safe transfer of bio-engineered products across borders. The US is not a party but participates to ensure trade in GM-derived products is not undermined. Agricultural biotechnology was not a major element in international trade negotiations, so it is not directly addressed in the 1994 Uruguay Round agreements. The US believes existing agreements provide adequate guidance for dealing with trade in GMOs. The US believes existing agreements provide guidance for trade in GMOs, focusing on reducing trade barriers and ensuring transparent, scientifically defensible measures. US officials aim for consistency with international standards but face challenges due to differing perspectives, particularly from the EU. The US, along with Canada, Argentina, and Egypt, filed a case against the EU's 5-year moratorium on approving new agricultural biotechnology products at the World Trade Organization. US agricultural interests argue that these policies hinder exports and raise safety concerns globally, while EU officials claim they are working to expedite biotechnology approvals. The EU is working to reinstate biotechnology approvals to address safety concerns and trade tensions with the US. Despite having an approval process in place, the EU has not approved any agricultural biotechnology products since 1998. Several EU states have blocked the release of new GE crops into the environment. Several EU countries are hesitant to implement EU-wide legislation for GM product approvals until stricter regulations for labeling and tracing are in place. This delay, along with the EU's moratorium on new corn varieties, has significantly decreased U.S. corn exports to the EU. The approval process for biotech products in the EU has been stalled since 1998, causing trade tensions with the US. The EU's moratorium on new corn varieties has led to a decline in U.S. corn exports to the EU. U.S. soybean exports to the EU have also decreased due to restrictions on GM products. The U.S. initiated a WTO case against the EU over its biotech product approval process. Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, and Uruguay support the case against the EU's moratorium on GM products. The USTR announced unsuccessful consultations, leading to WTO dispute settlement panel involvement. The U.S. argues the moratorium violates the WTO SPS Agreement, stating GM crops are safe. Resolution could take up to 18 months. The EU's moratorium on GM products has impacted U.S. exports and led to other countries shunning biotechnology. EU officials are working to restart the approval process but argue for cautious regulation to restore consumer confidence. Legal action may be taken against member states for not implementing GE approval legislation. The U.S.-EU dispute over GMOs could impact consumer confidence and trade agreements. A win for the U.S. could validate SPS principles but may not open EU markets to more GE imports. There are concerns about backlash from European public and governments against biotechnology. The U.S. is facing resistance from foreign markets over labeling GE products. The EU is proposing strict regulations requiring all GMO products to be labeled, even with trace amounts. There are tolerance levels set for unintentional presence of GE substances, with products containing more than 0.9% needing to be labeled as GM. The EU is proposing strict regulations for labeling GMO products, with a moratorium on assessments at 0.5% for 3 years before dropping to 0%. U.S. officials may challenge the labeling and traceability rules in the future, arguing they are unworkable and discriminatory against U.S. exports. Compliance with the EU labeling rule would require segregation of GE crops and foods throughout the processing and marketing chain. U.S. interests argue that accurate labeling of GE products could pose risks and liabilities for food companies. Implementing a system to track ingredients from source to final destination is deemed difficult and costly, as illustrated by Dr. Susan Harlander's example of a medium-sized food company with thousands of products and ingredients from numerous suppliers. Implementing a system to track ingredients from source to final destination is a daunting task that would cost billions of dollars and may not be infallible. Issues to be resolved on labeling and detection of GE material in crops and foods include scientific methods, sensitivity of detection systems, accountability for mislabeling, and management of testing. The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol, stemming from the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, will take effect this year after being ratified by 50 nations. The United States, not party to the CBD, has participated in negotiations over the Protocol text and countries' preparations for implementation. The Biosafety Protocol addresses concerns regarding the safe handling and movement of bio-engineered organisms. It allows countries to regulate these organisms and requires Advance Informed Agreements for the first transboundary movement of any GMO to assess environmental risks. The Biosafety Protocol regulates the importation of biotechnology products, requiring exporters to seek consent from importers before introducing GMOs into the environment. Declarations must accompany bulk shipments of GMO commodities, stating they \"may contain\" GMOs and are not for intentional environmental introduction. Lack of scientific certainty should not prevent a Party from making a decision regarding potential adverse effects on biodiversity and human health. Defenders of the precautionary principle argue that it allows time for scientific inquiry before making decisions on the import of LMOs. Critics fear that it may create false expectations of absolute safety and lead to protectionism. The EU has been accused of using the precautionary approach to block U.S. beef imports and delay approvals of new GMOs. The United States and other GMO exporters are concerned about delays in approvals of new GMOs and the implementation of AIAs. Government and industry officials are working to prevent disruptions in trade due to confusing requirements and paperwork. Six countries in southern Africa are facing severe food shortages, with the UN World Food Program appealing for aid to help 14 million people. The provision of food aid in southern Africa has been complicated by the debate over genetically modified corn in U.S. shipments. Some countries are reluctant to accept GE corn due to environmental and commercial risks. Zambia refused all GE corn shipments over health concerns. There is a fear that introducing GE corn could harm future trade with the EU and impact crops grown for export or livestock feed. The EU allows imports of genetically modified soybeans. The EU permits imports of genetically modified soybeans but not most varieties of genetically modified corn. African countries have concerns about labeling GE food products and fear rejection by EU consumers. Zimbabwe and Mozambique accept U.S. food aid shipments of milled corn, while Malawi allows distribution of whole grain corn due to limited milling capacity. Swaziland, Lesotho, and Zambia have reservations about GE corn in food aid shipments. The United States blames EU policies for southern Africa countries' concerns about GE corn in food aid. President Bush criticizes EU governments for hindering efforts to end hunger in Africa due to their stance on GE products. The US argues that GE crops are safe to eat and unlikely to enter African food supplies. Critics debate the benefits of biotechnology in developing countries. Critics argue that biotechnology in developing countries poses risks for agriculture, including health concerns for consumers and environmental risks. They believe that intellectual property rights hinder the development and dissemination of genetically engineered crops, giving multinational companies control over farmers. Proponents, on the other hand, see great promise in GE technology as a driving force for agricultural productivity in the 21st century, emphasizing the safety of GE foods and manageable environmental risks. Members of Congress closely monitor biotechnology developments and support agricultural biotechnology in international trade. Resolutions were passed in support of U.S. action against the EU, and a bill was introduced to establish a federal task force to promote biotechnology. A federal interagency task force was established to promote agricultural biotechnology. Congressional hearings discussed the EU's GMO moratorium and its impact on African countries. The 107th Congress included biotechnology provisions in the 2002 farm bill. Legislation in the 107th Congress addressed biotechnology regulations, including mandatory labeling of GE foods and legal issues related to GE plants. Bills introduced may reappear in the 108th Congress. Trade Promotion Authority also includes language on negotiating rules for biotechnology products. The 107th Congress addressed biotechnology regulations, including GE foods labeling and legal issues with GE plants. Responsibility for biotechnology trade is shared among federal agencies, who communicate regularly to coordinate efforts. Years of experience and established authorities guide agencies on handling problems and determining lead roles. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is considered the lead agency for biotechnology trade issues, coordinating with other agencies and representing the U.S. at WTO meetings. USTR convenes an interagency committee to address biotechnology matters. The USTR convenes an interagency committee to address biotechnology trade issues, including disputes with trading partners. Other agencies like the State Department and FDA lead on specific biotechnology matters, with thorny issues sometimes resolved at the White House level. The USTR leads an interagency committee on biotechnology trade issues, involving agencies like the State Department and FDA. The President's Special Assistant for Agricultural Trade and Food Aid, along with a biotechnology working group, discuss issues under the White House National Economic Council. Critics argue for a more coordinated and proactive U.S. response to biotechnology challenges. The Biotechnology Industry Organization reports USTR circulating a draft paper among interested agencies. The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) reported that USTR circulated a draft paper among interested agencies outlining a strategy for addressing biotechnology issues. USDA's Biotechnology Coordinating Committee and a higher-level Biotechnology Policy Group, led by the Secretary of Agriculture, are actively involved in discussing policy and planning for international meetings. Secretary Ann Veneman appointed 18 members to a new Advisory Committee on Biotechnology in April 2003. Ann Veneman appointed 18 members to a new Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture in April 2003. The committee includes representatives from agribusiness, academia, and consumer advocacy organizations. The 2002 farm bill created a Biotechnology and Trade Program to address barriers to U.S. agricultural exports related to biotechnology, food safety, and animal health. The program authorizes up to $6 million annually through FY2007, with a USDA FY2004 budget proposal recommending $6.6 million in new funding and 20 staff positions for trade-related and biotechnology activities. The USDA proposed funding of $2.1 million for GMO trade issues, $600,000 for the Foreign Agricultural Service's biotechnology unit, and $1.5 million for U.S. activities in other countries to address regulatory and trade barrier challenges related to biotechnology. The funds would be allocated by the Secretary among various agencies for flexibility in addressing these issues. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) facilitates agricultural trade, including biotechnology products, through education, training, and issue resolution. FAS programs focus on monitoring and addressing foreign regulatory policies on GMO products, with initiatives like an Overseas Biotech Training/Education Program and the Cochran Fellowship Program for Biotechnology Training. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) offers various programs to support biotechnology trade, including Biotechnology Short Courses, Capacity Building for the Seed Trade Industry, Biotechnology Research Capacity Building, and Biotechnology Activities With International Organizations. These programs aim to provide information on technology benefits, market access, trade in agricultural products, and global food security. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) established a new Biotechnology Office in 2002 to focus on biotechnology trade issues. The office aims to have 10 full-time staff members organized into four teams by August 2003, focusing on bilateral relations in Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, international organizations, and technical assistance. The USDA's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regulates the movement, testing, and commercialization of new GE crop varieties in the United States. They work to minimize trade disruptions caused by animal and plant health issues related to biotechnology, participate in U.S. negotiations with trading partners, and harmonize international standards to prevent unfair trade barriers. APHIS focuses on ensuring international biotechnology policies are science-based and promoting global credibility. In FY2002, APHIS consolidated its biotechnology personnel under a new office, Biotechnology Regulatory Services, covering domestic regulatory activities and international trade policy. The office was assigned 46 staff slots. GIPSA of USDA establishes grain quality standards, testing methodologies, and tests grain for a fee to ensure they meet standards. GIPSA has a biotechnology program to address the emergence of value-enhanced grains and oilseeds, niche markets for non-biotech commodities, and new regulatory requirements by U.S. trading partners. They evaluate tests for detecting GMOs, offer proficiency programs, and provide sampling guidelines for the industry. GIPSA does not routinely test for GMOs in shipments, except for StarLink TM corn as a voluntary fee-based service."
