This synchronization is crucial in various applications like smart agriculture and warehouse robotics. A proposed GNN implementation predicts swarm motion behaviors and demonstrates interaction dynamics through transfer learning. Challenges in scalability are addressed with layer-wise tuning and data mixing enabled by padding. Developing control strategies for groups of mobile agents in physical spaces is a complex challenge. Various formalisms, such as the Boids model by Reynolds (1987), have been proposed to support the design of multi-agent systems. Other approaches include graph theory, game theory, and formal languages, but they require significant modeling and coding efforts for practical implementation. In this paper, a new approach for learning multi-agent coordination through imitation is presented. Instead of extensive modeling efforts, designers only need to provide demonstrations of successful coordination behavior. This data is used to train a neural network representation of the system dynamics and rules of interaction, leveraging insights from graph neural networks. The paper presents a new approach for learning multi-agent coordination through imitation using graph neural networks. The GNN accurately captures complex multi-agent motion behaviors from demonstrations and addresses scaling issues with a refinement training procedure. The refinement procedure aids in tuning a learned model for scalability in multi-agent systems. Training involves recording agent trajectories as demonstrations, which are used to train a graph neural network to model group behavior. The graph neural network is trained using agent trajectories to model group behavior in a swarm. The network predicts future steps in the time series and minimizes prediction error by considering historical states and their relations with current states. One-dimensional convolutional layers process past states to capture velocity and acceleration information for accurate predictions. The graph neural network models group behavior in a swarm by predicting future steps based on historical states and their relations. It computes interactions between nodes in a graph, updates the graph's state, and aggregates interactions directed to each node. The evolution of graph dynamics in swarm behavior is described by applying procedures repeatedly. The input time series of motion states from a swarm simulation are structured as T \u00d7 N \u00d7 D, where T is time steps, N is agents, and D is the state vector dimension. The state vector includes position and velocity information for each agent. In swarm behavior simulations, agents live in a two-dimensional space with state vectors of dimension 4, consisting of position x i (t) and velocity \u1e8b i (t). Long term prediction is achieved by processing history states and using 1D convolutions to condense time sequences for each agent. The output after the last convolution layer is a 1 \u00d7 N \u00d7 C shaped tensor. This process requires at least (T \u2212 1)/(K \u2212 1) layers for a history window length of T w and a universal kernel size of K. In swarm behavior simulations, agents have state vectors with position and velocity. Long term prediction involves processing history states using 1D convolutions to condense time sequences. The interactions between agents are embedded in a directed graph, where nodes represent agents and edges represent influence through interaction. Interactions include pulling, pushing, and steering in swarm motion. The GNN module in swarm behavior simulations processes node states influenced by interactions like pulling, pushing, and steering. It uses 3 functions to pass information: \u03c6e computes influence between nodes, \u03c8\u0113 aggregates influences for each node, and \u03c6v predicts the next step based on total influence and historical states. The GNN module in swarm behavior simulations uses three functions to process node states influenced by interactions and predict the next step. These functions include \u03c6e for computing influence between nodes, \u03c8\u0113 for aggregating influences, and \u03c6v for predicting the next step based on total influence and historical states. The distinction between edges is taken care of by function \u03c6e, allowing for the creation of individual functions to cover different interactions based on edge labels. In swarm behavior simulations, the GNN module processes node states influenced by interactions using three functions: \u03c6e computes influence between nodes, \u03c8\u0113 aggregates influences, and \u03c6v predicts the next step based on total influence and historical states. The group of GNN operations can be stacked like layers of a multilayer perceptron, expanding the interaction horizon. However, this paper only employs one GNN layer for the physical settings of a swarm system. The output vector vi serves as hidden states, with only the output of the last layer considered the update for the next step. Despite both being the \"node state\" before and after GNN operations, vi and v i may carry different meanings semantically. In this paper, the output vi is treated as the predicted change between the current state vector si(t) and future state vector si(t + 1) of agent i. The core algorithm of the GNN involves processing node states influenced by interactions using three functions. Supervised training adjusts parameters to minimize prediction errors between predicted and ground truth states. Error normalization accounts for sample rate differences in motion data. The GNN algorithm involves processing node states using three functions and supervised training to minimize prediction errors. Multi-step prediction is enabled by appending predicted states back to the sequence, imposing higher demands on accuracy and encouraging learning of true mechanisms. Curriculum learning helps guide the model faster in the earlier stage for better long-term prediction power. The GNN algorithm operates locally on node neighborhoods, allowing it to be applied to different systems without modifying parameters. While some equations may not be directly transferable, the overall structure of the GNN remains unchanged. The number of edges connected to a node may be related to the number of nodes in the graph, as larger swarms may interact with more neighbors. The scalability issue in GNNs arises when transferring to swarms of different sizes due to poor extrapolation ability of MLPs. In realistic swarms, the neighborhood size and connectivity can dynamically change, affecting the accuracy of GNNs in trans-swarm applications. In an attempt to address the scalability issue of GNNs in trans-swarm applications, a layer-wise tuning method using data padding is proposed to reduce the difficulty of scaling. Adjusting edge aggregation and node update functions through transfer learning is suggested to improve responsiveness without causing catastrophic forgetting. The model can adapt to different numbers of nodes but struggles with mixed input data dimensions. To address this, \"ghost\" agents with 0 edges can be added to pad the input data, allowing for a uniform shape. The GNN works equally well on real agents, with \"ghost\" states initialized to zeros. This approach helps in handling swarms of different sizes effectively. During transfer learning, only \u03b8 3 is updated while w, \u03b8 1, and \u03b8 2 are locked. The model outperforms others in motion prediction on swarms of the same size it is trained on. Testing accuracy on simulated Boid and Vicsek data shows promising results. Models are trained on both datasets with 10 agents each and tested accordingly. Our GNN variant outperforms other models in long term prediction on swarms of different sizes. It has a cleaner structure, captures dynamics accurately, and shows better scalability on unseen data sizes. Predicted trajectories are shown in Fig. 2, supporting the hypothesis that GNN naturally scales. Following the discussion in Section 3, a simplistic swarm model called chaser was designed to test the hypothesis that GNN naturally scales with N. In the chaser swarm, each particle chases another with acceleration proportional to its displacement. The interaction graph has only one edge per agent, making update rules independent of N. The GNN was trained on motion data from a chaser swarm with N = 3 agents. The trained GNN showed perfect replication of ground truth trajectory on chaser swarms of various sizes without modification. However, accuracy degraded when each agent chased more than one target. The accuracy degradation in Table 2 shows a shift in input range for functions \u03c8\u0113 and \u03c6 v. The distribution of output vectors from preceding components indicates that functions with higher M values have a right-shifted summation distribution. Function \u03c6 e's output distributions are similar, suggesting transferability across swarms. Tuning Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 with padded data improves performance on larger neighborhoods in chaser swarms. After tuning Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 with padded data, the performance on larger neighborhoods in chaser swarms is enhanced. The model is trained on a dataset with 3 agents and 1 target, achieving similar performance on validation sets with different neighborhood sizes. Tuning the model with a mixed set of chasers with varying neighborhood sizes shows improved performance on larger swarms. The corrected distributions in Fig. 4 demonstrate the model's response to unseen ranges caused by aggregation on a higher number of edge messages. The chaser model's design results in similar changes regardless of M, with the prediction quality maintained even for larger unseen neighborhoods. Tuning only Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 is based on the premise that the network has already learned universal interaction rules. Locking function \u03c6 e after random initialization helps show its importance in determining performance. When training networks for Boid with various swarm and neighborhood sizes, tuning and padding with mixed data of 5 and 10 boids preserves good performance and avoids catastrophic forgetting. Improved performance is shown from untuned to tuned networks, with trajectories demonstrating the effectiveness of this method. In this study, improved performance is demonstrated in tuned networks compared to untuned ones, showcasing the prevention of catastrophic forgetting. The proposed GNN implementation predicts and imitates motion behaviors from swarm trajectory data, utilizing curriculum learning for accurate predictions. Transfer learning is used to capture interaction dynamics in swarms, with a focus on scalability challenges and proposed solutions such as layer-wise tuning and data mixing with padding."
