    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Endangered Cultural Heritage Act of 1996\". Congress recognizes the importance of cultural heritage to society and the world, acknowledging the threats it faces from natural disasters, environmental degradation, human actions, and global changes. Urgent action is needed to protect endangered cultural resources. The need for sustained funding to protect endangered cultural heritage on a national and international scale is crucial. The World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites highlights the urgent need for additional support and protection for threatened cultural heritage worldwide. Funding will help professionals in historic preservation address immediate peril situations and plan for long-term conservation efforts. The conservation work funded by this Act will provide direct and indirect benefits to communities by creating jobs, offering training opportunities, protecting resources for economic activity, and enhancing educational experiences. The American people have a shared responsibility to preserve cultural resources worldwide as a common trust. Participation in cultural heritage preservation is an international act of goodwill. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms such as administrative agency, endangered site, Fund, institution of higher education, and matching basis. The term \"matching basis\" refers to the requirement for grant recipients to provide equivalent financial support from other sources before funds are released by the Secretary of the Treasury. Establishment of the Endangered Cultural Heritage Fund in the Treasury of the United States, consisting of appropriated amounts and interest. Authorization of appropriations to the Fund for necessary expenses. Payments from the Fund and permitted uses of payments. The Secretary, in consultation with other agencies, designates a Federal agency to administer the Endangered Cultural Heritage Fund. Interest from the Fund is available for the agency's use as specified by appropriations. The agency supports activities for the preservation of at-risk cultural resources in the US and internationally. The administrative agency provides funding awards on a matching basis for stabilization and conservation of endangered cultural resources in the US. Awards are given competitively to entities meeting conservation standards set by the Secretary of the Interior. Qualified sites listed as endangered by recognized organizations are eligible for funding awards. The administrative agency also provides funding for endangered cultural resources outside the US on a competitive basis to entities demonstrating conservation capabilities. The administrative agency provides grants and fellowships for professionals and graduate-level students in historic preservation and conservation programs for endangered sites listed by recognized organizations. The administrative agency supports public education programs and grants for seminars and conferences to promote collaboration in conserving endangered cultural resources. Up to 10 percent of funds can be used for other expenditures. The administrative agency can use funds to award contracts for projects, disseminate information, and prepare documentation for supported projects. Projects are selected by a panel of expert advisors. The administrative agency can make payments for awards to various organizations, including the Council on Monuments and Sites, the National Park Service, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the College Art Association, and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation. Payments can be made promptly after approval of an application, in installments, in advance, or by reimbursement. Adjustments can be made for any overpayment or underpayment. The administrative agency must submit an application to the Secretary annually detailing grant purposes, fiscal controls, and accounting procedures. The Secretary will promptly approve applications meeting requirements. Management of the fund is outlined in Section 8. The Secretary manages investments of the Fund, investing in US interest-bearing obligations or guaranteed obligations. Special obligations can be issued exclusively to the Fund at par. Special obligations issued exclusively to the Fund bear interest at a rate based on the average rate of interest of marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Secretary must determine the purchase of other interest-bearing obligations before issuing special obligations. The Fund can sell or redeem obligations acquired at market price. Special obligations can be redeemed at par plus accrued interest. Proceeds and interest from the sale or redemption of obligations are credited to the Fund. The administrative agency must submit a report to the President and Congress every other fiscal year detailing its activities and recommendations."
