The Inspector General Act of 1978 is amended to allow Inspector General agents to carry firearms, make arrests without a warrant for offenses committed in their presence or felonies under US laws if they have reasonable grounds, and seek warrants for arrest, search, or seizure upon probable cause. The affected Office of Inspector General must demonstrate significant hindrance in their responsibilities, lack of assistance from other law enforcement agencies, and have internal safeguards in place for proper exercise of powers. The Attorney General exempts certain agencies from initial eligibility determinations. Guidelines for law enforcement powers are established and can be rescinded if requirements are not met. The Office of Inspector General must comply with guidelines set by the Attorney General for law enforcement powers. The Attorney General can rescind or suspend powers if guidelines are not followed. A determination by the Attorney General is not subject to court review. Offices of Inspector General must establish an external review process within 180 days to ensure proper exercise of law enforcement powers. The Office of Inspector General must establish an external review process to ensure proper exercise of law enforcement powers, in consultation with the Attorney General. The review process involves periodic evaluations by another Office of Inspector General or a committee of Inspectors General, with results communicated to the relevant parties. This does not limit law enforcement powers granted under other statutory authorities. Initial guidelines for this process must be promulgated. The Attorney General must promulgate guidelines for the agreements between the Department of Justice and Inspector General offices, allowing them to exercise similar authority as specified in the Inspector General Act within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The guidelines for agreements between the Department of Justice and Inspector General offices must include operational and training requirements, with existing agreements remaining in effect until new guidelines are implemented. Subsection (a) takes effect 180 days after the Act's enactment, while subsection (b) is effective immediately. The Act was passed by the Senate on October 17, 2002, with Jeri Thomson attesting as Secretary."
