Additionally, estate tax relief and reform after 2009 is addressed. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 is amended to make capital gains and dividends rate permanent. Estate tax relief and reform after 2009 are also addressed, including changes to the unified credit against gift and estate tax. The applicable exclusion amount for estate tax purposes is $3,500,000 and is subject to inflation adjustments for decedents dying after 2009. The estate and gift tax rates are adjusted to a flat rate of 15 percent. Any adjusted amount not a multiple of $10,000 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10,000. Additionally, a credit will be allowed against the tax imposed by section 2101 based on an applicable exclusion amount of $60,000. The credit allowed against the tax imposed by section 2101 is based on the applicable exclusion amount of $60,000. For nonresident decedents not citizens of the United States, the credit shall not be less than a proportion of the applicable credit amount if the exclusion amount were $175,000, based on the value of the decedent's gross estate situated in the United States. In computing the tentative tax under section 2001(c) for this subsection, 'the last day of the calendar year in which the gift was made' is substituted for 'the date of the decedent's death'. Amendments are made to the Estate tax section 2001(b)(2) to reflect differences in unified credit resulting from different tax rates. Amendments are made to the Estate tax section 2001(b)(2) by adding a new subsection (g) to reflect different tax rates for gift tax payable. The rates of tax at the decedent's death will be used to compute the tax imposed on gifts and the credit allowed against such tax. Amendments to the Estate tax section include changes to the unified credit against gift tax and the rates of tax in effect for determining credits. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 2009. Additional modifications to the Estate tax are also made. After December 31, 2009, gifts made are subject to changes in the Estate tax section, including repealing certain provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. Repeal of sections 2011, 2057, and 2604 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is enacted, removing outdated provisions."
