ENHANCED DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITAL (DSH) TREATMENT FOR RURAL HOSPITALS AND URBAN HOSPITALS WITH FEWER THAN 100 BEDS. In the context of rural health care improvements, there is a provision for enhanced disproportionate share hospital (DSH) treatment for rural hospitals and urban hospitals with fewer than 100 beds. This includes a blending of payment amounts for hospitals discharging patients in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 2002, with a cap of 10 percent for hospitals that are not large, urban hospitals. The provision allows for enhanced DSH treatment for rural and small urban hospitals, with a payment blending cap of 10 percent for non-large, urban hospitals. Amendments were made to Section 1886(d)(5)(F) to reflect these changes. The amendments made by this section apply to discharges on or after October 1, 2002, with changes to clauses (x), (xi), (xii), and (xiii). SEC. 303 outlines a 2-year phased-in increase in the standardized amount in rural and small urban areas to achieve a single, uniform standardized amount. Section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iv) is amended to increase the standardized amount for hospitals in non-large urban areas for fiscal year 2003 and onwards. For fiscal year 2004, the Secretary will calculate an average standardized amount for hospitals in different regions of the United States, adjusted by a percentage increase. SEC. 304 requires more frequent updates in weights used in the hospital market basket to reflect current data, with a report due by October 1, 2003. SEC. 305 focuses on improvements to the Critical Access Hospital Program. The amendment reinstates Periodic Interim Payment for inpatient critical access hospital services. Additionally, a condition for applying a special physician payment adjustment to critical access hospitals is specified.

The amendments made by subsections (a), (b), and (c) will be effective starting January 1, 2003. Subsection (c) provides flexibility in bed limitations for designated hospitals, excluding critical access hospitals designated before that date. SEC. 306 extends the temporary increase for home health services in rural areas from April 1, 2001, to January 1, 2005. SEC. 307 references a 10 percent increase in payment for hospice care in frontier areas and a rural hospice demonstration project. SEC. 308 provides priority for hospitals in rural or small urban areas in redistributing unused medical education residencies. SEC. 309 mandates a GAO study on geographic payment differences for physicians' services. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on payment differences in the physician fee schedule for services in different geographic areas. The study will assess the validity of geographic adjustment factors, evaluate adjustment measures, and review methods for determining professional liability insurance costs. The Comptroller General will update the geographic cost of practice index and malpractice component weights. A report with recommendations on using current data for indices and representative physician costs will be submitted to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 310. PROVIDING SAFE HARBOR FOR CERTAIN COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS BENEFITING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. SEC. 310 amends Section 1128B(b)(3) to include a new subparagraph allowing remuneration between public or nonprofit private health center entities and individuals/entities providing goods, services, donations, or loans to maintain or enhance availability of healthcare services.
