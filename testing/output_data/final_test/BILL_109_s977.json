Congress finds that 99% of I-131 in the US atmosphere came from nuclear tests in Nevada in the 1950s, leading to thyroid cancer. Montana counties had the heaviest I-131 doses, with Meagher county having the highest per capita dose at 16 rads, 800% higher than the national average. Thyroid cancer rates in Montana have steadily increased over the past 30 years, with exposure levels of I-131 being significantly higher than the national average. None of the counties in Montana have I-131 exposure levels below the national average, and the rate of reported thyroid cancer in Montana has been consistently higher than the national average since the 1980s. Thyroid cancer rates in Montana have steadily increased over the past 30 years, with the diagnosis rate in Montana being significantly higher than the national average. Between 1989 and 2003, the age-adjusted rate of thyroid cancer diagnosis in Montana increased by 127 percent, surpassing the national average. The thyroid cancer rate in Montana increased by 127 percent between 1989 and 2003, corresponding to exposure during nuclear testing in the 1950s. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act does not cover the 5 counties with the highest I-131 exposure in Montana and Idaho. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act covers only 3 out of the 25 counties with the highest I-131 exposure. No counties in Montana are currently covered, but 3 counties in Nevada with dosage rates close to the national average are included. Studies by the National Academy of Sciences found that individuals born in 1948 in Montana had a higher absorbed dose to the thyroid compared to counties in Utah eligible for compensation. Fallout from above-ground nuclear tests in Nevada also exposed individuals to radiation. The United States should recognize and assume responsibility for the harm done to individuals in Montana exposed to radiation from nuclear tests in Nevada. Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation to these individuals and their families for the involuntary increased risk of injury and disease they faced. The purpose of this Act is to establish a procedure for partial restitution to these individuals for the burdens they have borne for the Nation as a whole. The United States should recognize and assume responsibility for the harm done to individuals in Montana exposed to radiation from nuclear tests in Nevada, and their families, for the hardships they have endured. The United States should recognize and assume responsibility for the harm done to individuals in Montana exposed to radiation from nuclear tests in Nevada, and their families, for the hardships they have endured. Amendments to RECA. Amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act include expanding compensation to additional counties in Montana and providing additional relief for individuals who resided in regions not previously covered. The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, evaluates individuals for compensation under the Act on a case-by-case basis. Eligible individuals also receive compensation for screening, follow-up referrals, diagnosis, and treatment related to the specific disease contracted. Authorization of Appropriations for the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2005 includes $200,000,000 to be appropriated to the Fund, with at least 95 percent of the funds to be distributed directly to victims of radiation exposure. The Health Resources and Services Administration will conduct an enhanced education program on the health risks of radiation exposure from fallout of US nuclear-weapons testing."
