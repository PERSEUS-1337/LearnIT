    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 48645.3 of the Education Code is amended. Juvenile court schools must adhere to guidelines set by the county board of education, with a minimum schoolday of 240 minutes. Pupils in vocational education, work programs, and work experience programs have a minimum schoolday of 180 minutes. The county board of education is responsible for adopting a course of study and evaluating the program. Juvenile court schools must follow guidelines set by the county board of education, with specific requirements for minimum schoolday lengths. Juvenile court schools must adhere to county board of education guidelines, including minimum schoolday lengths. The county board may close schools for specific reasons. They can also enforce an enhanced course of study focusing on math and English language arts to improve academic literacy and reading fluency for students. The Legislature intends for juvenile court schools to provide a rigorous curriculum preparing students for graduation, career entry, and university admission. Section 48645.5 of the Education Code is amended to ensure that public schools accept coursework completed by students in various educational settings. Students in the juvenile justice system should not be denied enrollment based solely on their involvement with the system. Students in the juvenile justice system should be immediately enrolled in public school, even if they have had contact with the system. If a student completes graduation requirements while attending a juvenile court school, they will receive a diploma without needing to fulfill additional coursework. Section 51225.1 of the Education Code is amended to exempt certain students from additional coursework requirements if they are in foster care, homeless, or former juvenile court school pupils transferring between schools after their second year of high school. The school district must determine if the student can graduate by the end of their fourth year of high school. If a student in foster care, homeless, or a former juvenile court pupil can graduate within five years of high school, the school district must inform them of the option to stay for a fifth year. They should also be informed about the impact on postsecondary education admission and transfer opportunities at California Community Colleges. (4) A pupil in foster care, homeless, or a former juvenile court pupil can stay in school for a fifth year to complete graduation requirements if they are 18 years or older, or with agreement from the person making educational decisions if under 18. The exemption for third or fourth year status can be based on credits earned or length of school enrollment. Within 30 days of a foster care pupil transferring to a school, the district must notify them, their educational decision-maker, and social worker of the exemption from local graduation requirements. If the district fails to provide timely notice, the pupil is still eligible for the exemption once notified, even after court jurisdiction ends. Within 30 days of a homeless child or youth transferring to a school, the district must notify them, their educational decision-maker, and the liaison for homeless children and youth about the exemption from local graduation requirements. If the district fails to provide timely notice, the pupil is still eligible for the exemption once notified, even if they are no longer homeless. Within 30 days of a former juvenile court school pupil transferring to a school, the district must notify them, their educational decision-maker, and their social worker or probation officer about the exemption from local graduation requirements. If the district fails to provide timely notice, the pupil is still eligible for the exemption once notified, even if the court's jurisdiction over them has ended. If a pupil in foster care, homeless, or a former juvenile court school pupil completes statewide coursework requirements before the end of their fourth year of high school, the school cannot require them to graduate early if they would otherwise be entitled to remain in attendance. If a pupil in foster care, homeless, or a former juvenile court school pupil is exempted from local graduation requirements, the school district must inform them about the impact on their admission to postsecondary education and provide transfer opportunities through California Community Colleges. A pupil in foster care, homeless, or a former juvenile court school pupil can choose to be exempted from local graduation requirements without affecting enrollment in necessary courses, including those for higher education. If not initially exempted, the pupil can request exemption at any time if eligible. If a pupil in foster care, homeless, or a former juvenile court school pupil is exempted from local graduation requirements, the exemption shall not be revoked by the school district. The exemption continues even after the termination of court jurisdiction or when transferring to another school. If a former juvenile court school pupil is exempted from local graduation requirements, the exemption continues even after the court's jurisdiction ends or if the pupil transfers to another school. A school district cannot force a pupil in foster care, homeless, or a former juvenile court school pupil to switch schools to qualify for an exemption. (2) A homeless child or youth, a former juvenile court school pupil, or their educational decision-makers cannot request a transfer solely to qualify for an exemption. (3) A complaint of noncompliance with these requirements can be filed with the local educational agency. A complainant dissatisfied with a local educational agency decision can appeal to the department and receive a written decision within 60 days. If a complaint is found valid, the agency must provide a remedy. Information on these requirements must be included in annual notifications. Section 51225.2 of the Education Code is amended with specific definitions. In Section 51225.2 of the Education Code, definitions are provided for \"Pupil in foster care,\" \"Pupil who is a homeless child or youth,\" and \"Former juvenile court school pupil.\" School districts and county offices of education must accept coursework completed by students in foster care, homeless students, or former juvenile court school students from other public, juvenile court, or nonpublic schools. They must give full or partial credit for the completed coursework, which will be applied to the same or equivalent course if applicable. A school district or county office of education cannot require a student in foster care, homeless student, or former juvenile court school student to retake a course if they have completed it satisfactorily. If the student did not finish the course, they should not be required to retake the portion already completed unless it is determined they can graduate on time. When partial credit is given, the student will be enrolled in the same or equivalent course. Juvenile court school pupils must be enrolled in the same or equivalent course to complete it without having to retake portions already completed. A pupil in foster care, homeless child or youth, or former juvenile court school pupil can retake or take a course to meet admission requirements for California State University or University of California. Complaints of noncompliance can be filed with the local educational agency, and appeals can be made to the department within 60 days for a written decision. The local educational agency must provide a remedy if a complaint is found to have merit, and information about this requirement should be included in the annual notification. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
