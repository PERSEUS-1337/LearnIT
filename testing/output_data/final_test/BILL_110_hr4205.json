The National Health Service Corps is crucial for underserved communities, providing primary and preventive healthcare, dental care, mental health services, and improving health outcomes. The Scholarship Program ensures a steady supply of clinicians for underserved areas, who become employees in these communities after training. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program addresses healthcare professional shortages in underserved communities by paying off educational loans in exchange for service. A study highlighted high vacancies in family physician and OB-GYN positions at community health centers, recommending expansion of the program. Having an ample supply of primary care professionals is crucial for the growth of health centers, with over 20 percent relying on the National Health Service Corps. The National Health Service Corps plays a significant role in providing physicians for underserved areas, with health centers relying on it to address primary care vacancies. The Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs incentivize medical students to pursue careers in primary care, crucial as the number of new medical residents choosing this specialty is declining. The National Health Service Corps is vital for providing physicians to underserved areas, with health centers depending on it to fill primary care vacancies.

Additionally, there are amendments regarding the assignment of personnel to ensure non-discrimination against entities not receiving federal financial assistance. The Secretary gives preference to applications where nonprofit or public entities provide sites for Corps members, with highest preference for federally-qualified health centers, rural health clinics, and those serving health disparities. The amendment to the Public Health Service Act prioritizes applications from nonprofit or public entities that provide sites for Corps members, with a focus on federally-qualified health centers, rural health clinics, and those serving health disparities. The Public Health Service Act is amended to eliminate the 6-year demonstration requirement in section 332(a)(1) and make conforming amendments in section 338I(c)(3)(B)(ii)."
