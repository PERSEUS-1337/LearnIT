    "content": "The intelligence effort requires a balance between sharing information and protecting it. The Director of National Intelligence aims to find the \"sweet spot\" between the two. Maintaining secrecy is crucial to protect sources, but information must also reach those who need it. The U.S. Government's approach focuses on \"need-to-know\" for access to sensitive information. The U.S. Intelligence Community requires background investigations for individuals with access to classified information. Agencies determine who needs specific classified information. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and other agencies employ thousands of individuals. An organizational culture in many agencies encourages deep secrecy. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, there was a consensus that information sharing among intelligence agencies needed to improve, as organizational cultures and close ties to specific clients sometimes hindered the sharing of information. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, a consensus emerged that information sharing between intelligence offices and law enforcement officials had been deficient, contributing to the failure to detect the plot in advance. The U.S. Intelligence Community focused on counterterrorism, ensuring relevant information was shared widely. Senator Dianne Feinstein emphasized the importance of coordination during General Clapper's confirmation hearing as DNI in July 2010. President Obama nominated General David Petraeus to serve as Director of the CIA, emphasizing the need for better information sharing and coordination among intelligence agencies. Legislation post-9/11 has pushed for increased sharing of information, a priority for both the Executive Branch and Congress. The 9/11 Commission found that a major obstacle to preventing the attacks was the lack of information sharing among different agencies. Efforts to share information were hindered by bureaucratic inertia and a \"wall\" between law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The Federal Government traditionally restricts intelligence information to those with appropriate clearances. Individuals with security clearances must also have a \"need-to-know\" to access sensitive information. While most individuals with clearances are loyal and trustworthy, there is still a risk of mistakes or individuals being bribed or becoming disenchanted and illegally providing classified information. Individuals with security clearances must have a \"need-to-know\" to access sensitive information. There is a risk of mistakes, bribery, or individuals illegally providing classified information. Efforts to share more information among intelligence agencies increase the risk of information being compromised. Various technical approaches are used to maintain the security of shared information, as highlighted in the 2003 report of the Markle Foundation's Task Force on National Security in the Information Age. The Task Force emphasized the challenges in ensuring the security of shared information, noting that no smart cards or tokens are foolproof, biometrics are not completely reliable, and high-quality passwords are essential. Multifactor authentication is preferred due to the limitations of individual technologies like biometrics, passwords, and tokens. It combines various forms of authentication to enhance security, with information distributed between the user, token, and network. Credit card companies use a similar approach with tokens, passwords, challenge questions, and profile matching. Counterterrorism and intelligence missions involve piecing together various types of information like visa applications, flight manifests, and ties to hostile organizations. The need-to-know rule is challenged in a networked environment, where users must have access to all information within their clearance levels. The Bush Administration's 2007 National Strategy for Information Sharing emphasizes the importance of combining information from different sources to support counterterrorism efforts while respecting privacy and civil liberties. One challenge is handling information about U.S. persons when gathering intelligence, as many types of data may involve U.S. persons even if the target is a foreign national. The USA Patriot Act and related legislation addressed issues regarding information sharing for counterterrorism efforts, cybersecurity, and counterintelligence. The removal of the \"wall\" between intelligence and law enforcement agencies was a major outcome of the 9/11 investigations. The Justice Department also modified rules to allow the release of information related to counterintelligence and foreign intelligence. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the position of the DNI with statutory authorities to foster information sharing within the intelligence community. The DNI has principal authority to ensure maximum availability of intelligence information and establish uniform security standards and procedures. The DNI was given authority to establish security standards, information technology standards, and resolve conflicts in intelligence sharing. The National Counterterrorism Center was also established to access relevant terrorist information. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) analysts have access to all relevant information on terrorist plots from various intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Executive Order 13388 mandated sharing of terrorist information and established an Information Sharing Council. A National Strategy for Information Sharing in 2007 provided guidance on sharing information at all levels and with foreign partners. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act directed the establishment of an Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate information sharing on terrorism among all Federal agencies and state, local, and tribal entities. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act established the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate sharing of terrorism-related information among Federal agencies, state, local, and tribal entities. The ISE Program Manager oversees plans to improve information sharing and extends beyond the Intelligence Community to include other sectors like defense, homeland security, and law enforcement. Kshemendra Paul, the current ISE Program Manager, emphasized the role of his office in enhancing information sharing in various sectors. Kshemendra Paul, the ISE Program Manager, uses a highway construction analogy to explain his office's role in providing leadership and coordination for federal security practices. The goal is to normalize security practices and risk management methodologies for government-wide acceptance, leading to reciprocity between agencies. Paul does not control information sharing among agencies but focuses on fostering trust in each organization's protection processes and systems. The ISE Program Manager, Mr. Paul, issues government-wide procedures for the proper operation of the ISE. The IC ISE, under the DNI's direction, encourages information sharing among intelligence agencies. The IC ISE's strategy focuses on ensuring the right people have access to necessary information while maintaining security. The IC ISE focuses on the principle of \"Need to Know\" for information access, technical protection to prevent data misuse, and auditing and monitoring for proper use of classified information. Plans include implementing user authentication and an Enterprise Audit Framework by FY2012. During FY2012, plans are in place to enhance information sharing across the Intelligence Community using an Enterprise Audit Framework. The DNI issued Intelligence Community Directive 501, emphasizing the responsibility of IC elements to treat information as national assets. The Intelligence Community Directive 501 emphasizes the responsibility of IC elements to share information and make it available for discovery by authorized personnel. This framework prioritizes information sharing within the Intelligence Community, with strong congressional support. Representative Mike Rogers, Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has supported integrating information across the Intelligence Community. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 allowed the DNI to transfer funds to non-intelligence agencies for storing and sharing intelligence. DNI James Clapper signed a directive in 2011 for defending the intelligence information environment. The FY2011 Intelligence Authorization bill includes a provision for an automated insider threat detection program to be established by October 2013. Intelligence sharing has led to successful arrests of individuals involved in plots against the U.S. and its interests. The successful attack on Osama Bin Laden in May 2011 was credited to cooperation among the CIA, NSA, and NGA. Despite significant successes in identifying terrorist plots, impediments to information sharing have persisted. Unauthorized disclosures have jeopardized intelligence sources and undermined U.S. diplomacy, as seen in the Christmas bombing attempt in December 2009 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. The failed attempt to detonate an explosive on a plane approaching Detroit in December 2009 raised concerns about information sharing failures within the Intelligence Community. The bomber's father had warned U.S. embassy officers in Nigeria about his son's radicalization, but this information was not effectively disseminated. The Senate intelligence committee's report highlighted inconsistencies in distributing key intelligence reports, which may have contributed to the failure to identify Abdulmutallab as a potential threat. Reporting was not disseminated to all appropriate CIA elements, and some FBI counterterrorism analysts could not access relevant intelligence in a timely manner. The failed attempt to detonate an explosive on a plane in December 2009 raised concerns about information sharing failures within the Intelligence Community. President Obama described it as a failure to connect intelligence dots that could have revealed the attacker's plans. Senators highlighted technological issues hindering analysts from accessing and linking relevant reports on the attacker. The NCTC and CIA struggle with processing a large volume of terrorism-related intelligence due to the vast number of databases, leading to information sharing issues. The case of Army Major Nidal Hasan highlighted failures in sharing information about contacts with foreign terrorists. The committee report found that the FBI and DOD failed to link information about Army Major Nidal Hasan's contacts with foreign terrorists, despite advantages in recognizing the threat. Senators Lieberman and Collins emphasized the importance of information sharing, especially in the intelligence context where different perspectives can piece together crucial information. The report criticized the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces for not ensuring analysts collaborate effectively. The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) were criticized for failing to ensure analysts had access to all available information, especially for detailees from other agencies. This lack of information sharing hindered investigations, as seen in the Hasan case. The FBI itself struggled to connect Hasan's communications, leading to a failure to intervene before the attack. The report highlighted the need for improved access to databases and training for JTTF members. The FBI's failure to link Hasan's communications before the attack and the need for improved information sharing and analysis were highlighted. The WikiLeaks disclosures raised concerns about the risks of widespread information sharing, with a U.S. soldier leaking State Department cables. Damage to U.S. intelligence efforts from the leaks has not been publicly addressed. The WikiLeaks incident raised concerns about the risks of widespread information sharing within the Department of Defense and State Department. DOD officials testified about the potential for authorized users to access and publicize large amounts of information. State Department representatives indicated that the practice of making diplomatic cables available on SIPRNet has ended. The incident highlighted concerns about the potential damage caused by individuals with access to interconnected databases. The widespread use of computer databases increases access to individuals and documents. Intelligence officials must be cautious about information being shared with bloggers or journalists, as there are few legal restraints on making it public. Concerns have been raised about the advisability of increased information sharing among intelligence agencies following incidents like WikiLeaks. Representative Rogers highlighted the importance of \"need-to-know\" over \"need-to-share\" to prevent leaks of classified information. Contacts with foreign countries and governments, especially their intelligence services, could lead to severe consequences, including death for those aiding the U.S. Publicizing U.S. success in monitoring foreign communications may result in their discontinuation. Implementing greater restrictions on sensitive intelligence dissemination could reduce leaks. Technical measures like configuring computers to prevent large file downloads and tracking downloads by date, time, and user can help prevent unauthorized sharing. Some of these features have been available on government systems but were not activated. Congress may investigate the accuracy of these reports. Congress may wish to review the Information Sharing Environment to ensure proper boundaries and metrics for intelligence information sharing. HPSCI Chairman Rogers emphasized the need for \"smart access\" to address unauthorized information sharing dangers. Given the requirements of counterterrorism, it can be challenging to predict the exact information needed by analysts. Information can be categorized based on sensitivity, limiting access to certain individuals. Over-classification of documents can create administrative burdens and undermine the classification process. Measures can be taken to restrict dissemination, prevent mass downloading, and trace access to sensitive information. Security relies on the loyalty of cleared officials at all levels, as a clerk with the right access can transfer sensitive information as easily as a senior official. Information security must consider the interest in acquiring classified U.S. information from foreign countries, anti-American organizations, and major media outlets. Major media outlets freely publish classified information, creating a market for such data. Thousands of officials have access to classified information, posing a risk of leaks. The debate between \"need-to-know\" and \"need-to-share\" in the U.S. Intelligence Community is seen as a false choice. Congress may need to ensure thorough and efficient clearance procedures. Procedures for maintaining security may be improved through rigorous analyses of personnel transferring classified information. Technological advancements could enhance accountability for classified intelligence use. Intelligence efforts always involve risks, such as acquiring hazardous information or delays in analysis delivery. Congressional oversight can boost executive branch performance and prevent compromises of sensitive materials. Accepting the inevitability of some level of risk is crucial for government officials. Government officials must acknowledge the media's willingness to publish official secrets, despite the paradox of harsh punishment for leakers compared to praise for journalists. Upholding oaths is crucial for information security and national security."
