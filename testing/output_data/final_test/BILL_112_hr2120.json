FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that 99ers have increased six fold in the past 3 years, comprising nearly 10 percent of unemployment in the third quarter of 2010. Unemployment rate for those unemployed for more than 99 weeks rose from 0.1 percent to 1.0 percent, with an estimate of 1.4 million very long-term unemployed in October 2010. Before extended benefits expired on November 30, 2010, various States offered different lengths of unemployment benefits. In December 2010, the number of unemployed persons decreased to 14.5 million with a 9.4 percent unemployment rate. Mississippi offers the longest unemployment benefits at 79 weeks. SEC. 2. WORK OPPORTUNITY CREDIT FOR 99ERS. The text discusses amending the Internal Revenue Code to include a new category called \"99er\" for individuals who have exhausted emergency unemployment compensation. The text discusses eligibility criteria for receiving unemployment compensation under the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008, specifically focusing on exhaustion of rights for individuals who have received the maximum level of regular, extended, and emergency unemployment compensation within their State. The text outlines conditions where an individual's rights to compensation are terminated under specific sections of the Act, and when no extended compensation can be paid due to exhaustion of benefits within the State. The text defines when an individual's compensation rights are terminated because they have exhausted the maximum benefits within their State. It also provides definitions for terms like 'regular compensation', 'extended compensation', and 'employment'. The text discusses special rules for the work opportunity credit, including adjustments for individuals performing between 120 and 400 hours of service in their first year and the credit amount for the employment of a 99er in the second year. The section for the taxable year includes 25 percent of qualified second-year wages paid to a 99er for service rendered in the 1-year period after the previous year. Qualified second-year wages are limited for calculation purposes. The maximum yearly wages considered for an individual cannot exceed $10,000. Employers can receive additional credits under certain conditions without affecting other tax credits. Eligible employers are defined for this purpose. The term 'eligible employer' is defined as a State, political subdivision, or certain tax-exempt organizations. The amendments apply to new employees after the enactment of the Act."
