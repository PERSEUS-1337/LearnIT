The IRS Whistleblower Improvements Act of 2017 allows the Secretary to disclose information to whistleblowers regarding tax liability and enforcement provisions. Whistleblowers will receive updates on investigations within 30 days of referral for audit or examination, and after a taxpayer makes a payment based on their information.

Certain information may be withheld if it would harm Federal tax administration. Amendments were made to ensure confidentiality and penalties for unauthorized disclosure. The IRS Whistleblower Improvements Act of 2017 amended sections of the Internal Revenue Code to protect whistleblowers and provide anti-retaliation measures. Section 7213(a)(2) was amended to include (k)(13) in addition to (k)(10). Section 6103(k)(6) was also amended to exclude disclosures made under paragraph (13)(A) from certain restrictions. Additionally, a new subsection (c) was added to Section 7623 to protect employees from retaliation. Employees are protected from retaliation for reporting tax underpayment or violations of tax laws to the IRS. Employees are protected from retaliation for reporting tax underpayment or violations of tax laws to various authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service, the Secretary of the Treasury, and other relevant entities. This protection extends to participating in administrative or judicial actions related to tax fraud or underpayment. Employees who experience reprisal for reporting tax fraud can seek relief by filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor or bringing a legal action in court for review within 180 days if no decision is made. Employees who face reprisal for reporting tax fraud can file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor or take legal action in court within 180 days. The legal action is governed by specific rules and procedures outlined in section 42121(b) of title 49, United States Code, including notification requirements and burdens of proof.

Jury trial is also available for parties in certain actions. Employees facing reprisal for reporting tax fraud are entitled to remedies including back pay, lost benefits with interest, special damages, litigation costs, expert witness fees, and attorney fees. This section does not diminish the rights of employees under any Federal or State law or collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, certain provisions waiving rights and remedies or requiring arbitration of disputes are nonenforceable. The amendments made by this section ensure that remedies for reprisal against employees reporting tax fraud cannot be waived through agreements or arbitration. The effective date for these amendments varies, with disclosures falling under subsection (a) applying after the enactment date, and civil protection under subsection (b) taking effect immediately upon enactment."
