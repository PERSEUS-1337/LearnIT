    "content": "Since the early 1980s, the periodic debate over reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs has been primarily about money and its distribution. In 2009, driving declined significantly, leading to a decrease in fuel tax revenues. Congress has yet to enact a new authorization for federal surface transportation programs, which continue to operate on the basis of continuing resolutions and extension legislation. Reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs has been challenging in the last two decades, with no bill enacted on time since the 1970s. The most recent law, SAFETEA, was passed 22 months after the previous legislation expired, leading to controversies over funding parity among states. The bills have become increasingly complex as states and interest groups compete for federal transportation resources. The SAFETEA reauthorization debate has sparked controversies over funding parity among states, earmarks like the \"bridge to nowhere,\" and future funding issues. The complexity of surface transportation programs has made it challenging for the federal government to address intermodal transportation needs. Congress may need to make significant changes to these programs in the reauthorization. The language of transportation finance can be difficult to grasp for many, even those familiar with the congressional budget process. The federal-aid highway program, established in 1956, is financed through the highway trust fund and reauthorized periodically. States largely determine how the funds are spent within federal guidelines. Federal-aid highway funds are distributed to states at the beginning of each fiscal year for project development and construction. The federal-aid highway program distributes funds to states at the beginning of each fiscal year for road construction and maintenance. States submit vouchers to the Federal Highway Administration for reimbursement as work is completed. The program includes various construction project spending programs funded through apportioned or allocated methods. The core programs, along with the Equity Bonus Program, accounted for the majority of highway spending authorized for FY2005-FY2009 by SAFETEA. The core programs and the Equity Bonus Program accounted for 82.5% of highway spending authorized for FY2005-FY2009 by SAFETEA. The Equity Bonus Program provides additional funds for specific highway projects, making it the largest single highway program in SAFETEA. Funds for these programs are apportioned to states annually using formulas in SAFETEA. The core programs and smaller apportioned programs like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and Recreational Trails Program are detailed in Table 1. SAFETEA establishes formulas for programs like the Surface Transportation Program, with set-asides for transportation enhancements and sub-state distribution. Remaining highway programs are allocated based on criteria in laws or congressional earmarking. The High Priority Projects Program is the largest earmarked program with a five-year authorization of $14.8 billion. The High Priority Projects Program, with a five-year authorization of $14.8 billion, is part of the earmarked Projects Program under SAFETEA. Other earmarked programs like Projects of National and Regional Significance and Transportation Improvements received $1.78 billion and $2.55 billion, respectively. Various other allocated programs include the Federal Lands Program, National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement Program, and the Federal Transit Administration's transit programs with $10.3 billion in funding. In FY2011, $10.3 billion was allocated for transit programs, with the Urbanized Area Formula Program receiving 40% ($4.2 billion) and the Capital Investment Program receiving 41% ($4.2 billion). The Capital Investment Program includes the Bus and Bus Facilities Capital Program (20%), Rail Modernization Program (40%), and New Starts Program (40%). The remaining 18% ($1.9 billion) funds various other programs such as the Rural Formula Program, Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Formula Program, and Job Access and Reverse Commute Program, as well as state and metropolitan planning, research, and FTA operations. Federal funding for surface transportation has historically been linked to the revenue stream provided by the highway trust fund, which has separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The primary revenue sources are gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, providing about 90% of the income. Various transportation activities outside of highway and transit programs are also funded, including highway safety, motor carrier safety, transportation research, hazardous materials transportation, some elements of rail transportation, and transportation planning activities. The fuel taxes, primarily from gasoline and diesel, contribute about 90% of the income to the highway trust fund. Changes in federal gasohol taxation and other adjustments have increased trust fund revenues in recent years. SAFETEA aimed to provide the trust fund with an additional $4 billion annually through tax changes. However, revenue increases were modest and mainly came from cutting tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues. Financial estimates were overly optimistic, leading to three transfers totaling $29.7 billion from the general fund to the highway account. In late FY2008, $8 billion was transferred to the highway account for FY2009 (P.L. 110-318). In FY2009, $7 billion was transferred (P.L. 111-46). The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2010 transferred $14.7 billion more to the highway account. The trust fund revenue collection system used to be reliable but has changed under SAFETEA. The Congressional Budget Office projects a negative balance for the highway account by the end of FY2013. The Congressional Budget Office projects a negative balance for the highway account by the end of FY2013, with estimates showing a gap of $10 billion through FY2021. The mass transit account is also expected to remain above zero until FY2014, but will then experience a rapid increase in negative balance. Motor fuel tax receipts have seen unprecedented declines, with driving returning to a 2% average annual growth rate since the 1970s oil shocks. The economy has not returned to the 2% annual growth rate since 2007, despite fuel prices dropping. Gas prices have remained above $3.00 per gallon since December 2010. Increasing the federal fuels tax could provide the trust fund with $1.6 to $1.8 billion in new revenues annually. Without a tax increase, the trust fund may not be able to support increased transportation spending. Policymakers must find new revenue sources or settle for a smaller transportation program. Congress may need to explore alternatives to the motor fuels tax as a source of funding for the surface transportation program, as the outlook for motor fuel tax revenues is uncertain. This is due to the increasing popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles, which may lead to a decline in fuel consumption even as driving increases. Maintaining or increasing the size of the surface transportation program may require finding new revenue sources to address the funding issue in the short and long term. The past revenue growth enabled Congress to fund reauthorizations like TEA21 and SAFETEA, with the latter lacking strong financial backing. The upcoming reauthorization faces a challenge in finding funding for expansion, with concerns about the federal budget deficit potentially limiting spending on transportation infrastructure. The ARRA provided significant funding for activities typically funded through federal surface transportation. The ARRA allocated $27.5 billion for federal-aid highways, $8.4 billion for public transit, $1.5 billion for a new Surface Transportation Discretionary Grant Program, and $8 billion for high-speed rail. The funding came from the general fund without requiring state or local matching funds. This one-time infusion was nearly equivalent to one year's funding for existing surface transportation programs, distributed differently. High-speed rail received a significant portion of the funds. The SAFETEA debate focused on donor/donee issues and earmarking controversies, while the law's crafting was complex due to the need to satisfy various interest groups. The donor/donee debate revolves around states trying to maximize their share of federal highway funds, with donor states contributing more than they receive. This debate is driven by arguments of \"equity\" in fund distribution, but determining donor/donee status is complex due to the collection of federal fuel taxes not being at the state level. The donor/donee issue in federal highway funding revolves around states maximizing their share of funds. The Equity Bonus Program in SAFETEA aims to distribute funds based on revenue share, but its effectiveness is unclear due to complexity. Congress based distribution on FY2009 totals for FY2010 and FY2011. The transfer of $29.7 billion in general fund revenues to the highway account complicates the donor-donee framework for analyzing transportation funding. States received more federal highway funding than they contributed from FY2007 to FY2010. Earmarking for highway projects increased significantly over the years, with SAFETEA alone having over 5,600 earmarks totaling $21.7 billion. Following the 2010 congressional elections, proposals to abolish earmarking of individual projects became the policy of Republican leadership in the House. SAFETEA provided $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority for the six-year period FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase over the previous TEA-21 bill. However, SAFETEA was essentially a five-year bill by the time of its passage late in FY2005, providing $244 billion in spending authority. SAFETEA provided $244 billion in spending authority from FY2005 through FY2009, with all major programs receiving significant new funding. Total spending in FY2009 was almost 23% higher than in FY2005. For FY2010 and FY2011, total obligations were roughly $52.5 billion each year. The reauthorization process will involve detailed consideration of surface transportation program funding, organization, and management, with national goals and purposes influencing the eventual legislation. The interstate highway program and collapse of public transit systems in the 1950s and 1960s led to today's surface transportation programs. Federal funding is mainly granted to states and localities without clear ties to national needs. Changing decision-making processes could shift authority to the federal government. Federal officials lack understanding of program efficiency and effectiveness due to state and local control. Federal officials often lack understanding of program efficiency and effectiveness with federal funds. States and localities have robust internal processes to measure and analyze programs, but comparing performance nationwide is challenging. Implementing federal performance standards could help direct funding to the most efficient programs, but there is a risk of officials gaming the system. Enforcing performance measures with funding penalties may be counteracted by funding guarantees in the bill. Studies show that project delays can occur in any of the five main phases of delivering major highway and transit projects. Proposals to expedite the process include making the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Pilot Program permanent and delegating NEPA authority for highway projects to states. Reducing the number of steps in the public transit New Starts program is also suggested. The SAFETEA Act created commissions to study the structure and financing of surface transportation programs, leading to proposals for reorganizing federal programs into 10 new areas. Recommendations included expanding the role of market forces and the private sector in infrastructure provision. Numerous organizations have called for changes in the public transit New Starts program and the elimination of duplicative alternatives analysis. Numerous organizations have called for changes in federal surface transportation programs, including reducing program size and shifting some programs to general fund status. Congress may need to decide between continuing general fund expenditures or reducing program size if revenue into the highway trust fund is not increased. This could involve limiting funding to projected revenues and interest, shifting programs to general fund status, and adjusting matching ratios for federal funds. The federal government is considering spreading available funds more broadly by limiting surface transportation funding to programs fulfilling national needs and devolving other responsibilities to states. Alternative funding mechanisms like public-private partnerships and federal grants to state infrastructure banks are being encouraged to decrease reliance on the trust fund. The federal government is exploring alternative funding mechanisms such as Anticipation Revenue Vehicles (GARVEE Bonds) and private activity bonds for infrastructure projects. Tolling on interstate highways could be expanded to help fund reconstruction and public-private partnerships. There are obstacles to increasing tolling, including public opposition and political challenges. Two commissions recommended raising the motor fuel tax to meet funding needs for transportation programs. The donor-donee debate is a major hurdle during federal surface transportation program reauthorizations. The Equity Bonus Program resolves disagreements over equity by providing additional highway funding to states. User fees like VMT charges, tolls, and weight-distance taxes may be used to fund surface transportation programs. (CRS contacts: Bob Kirk and Will Mallett) The Equity Bonus Program allocates additional highway funding to states based on certain criteria to ensure a minimum share return on highway payments. Hold harmless provisions guarantee minimum state shares of funding, with thresholds including state population, density, fatality rates, income, and fuel tax rates. The program also sets a floor percentage relative to a state's TEA-21 average apportionment to prevent states from falling below a certain level. The Equity Bonus Program ensures a minimum share return on highway payments to states based on specific criteria. The distribution of the equity bonus has unintended consequences, particularly in its interaction with High Priority Program earmarks. States with small earmarks tend to receive larger equity bonus distributions, resulting in similar total amounts received regardless of earmark size. The Equity Bonus Program ensures a minimum share return on highway payments to states based on specific criteria. States with small earmarks tend to receive larger equity bonus distributions, resulting in similar total amounts received regardless of earmark size. This situation affects the availability of federal-aid highway core formula programs for state transportation plans. The equity bonus distribution also offsets penalties imposed on states for certain activities, such as transferring funds from the Highway Bridge Program. The Equity Bonus Program ensures a minimum share return on highway payments to states based on specific criteria. States with small earmarks tend to receive larger equity bonus distributions, offsetting penalties for fund transfers. Changes in equity provisions may impact achieving national transportation goals specified by Congress. Increasing the guaranteed share above 92% may require weakening \"hold harmless\" provisions. Expanding the scope of equity provisions may require program growth to fund a larger overlay. Eliminating the counteracting impact of equity bonus distribution on highway program penalties could affect states' guaranteed shares. One option is to eliminate the equity provision altogether and let program formulas determine fund distribution. The distribution of highway funds to states could be modified by weighting core formula programs based on states' annual contributions. Transit funding, largely fueled by highway user taxes, could also be guaranteed. However, including transit in an equity bonus scenario may face opposition from urbanized states and those with large transit systems. The equity debate is complex due to general fund money transfers to the highway trust fund. Funds have been transferred to the highway trust fund for various reasons, including interest payments on unexpended balances and compensation for lower ethanol tax rates. The debate over equity in federal highway spending is complicated by the general fund's share, raising questions about the Equity Bonus Program's inclusion in reauthorization bills. Earmarking was a significant feature of SAFETEA, but historically, earmarks only made up about 1% of federal-aid highway spending. The SAFETEA bill earmarked almost $22 billion, roughly 11% of the $199.5 billion highway construction title. Earmarking can reduce states' core transportation programs and lead to funding of low-priority projects. Proposals to abolish earmarking of special projects have gained interest post-2010 elections. Transportation groups are now advocating for controlled and limited earmarking. An earmark-free reauthorization could lead to increased focus on program structure, funding formulas, and eligibility criteria. According to the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, the federal government has 108 separate surface transportation programs, with 62 involving highways, 20 concerning transit, and the rest scattered among other activities. The commission recommended combining all programs into 10 broad intermodal programs, but Congress may find it challenging to consolidate to that extent due to competing organizing rationales and specific stakeholders associated with each program. The federal-aid highway program gives states significant control over transportation funds without earmarking. The federal-aid highway program provides states with control over federally funded projects, allowing flexibility in funding allocation. This flexibility includes transfers between highway and mass transit programs, which could be a point of contention during reauthorization. Congress may consider changes in project eligibility, such as broadening eligibility in the CMAQ Program to improve traffic flow. Interest may also arise in creating new programs. In December 2010, roughly 69,000 bridges were designated as \"structurally deficient\" by FHWA. The Highway Bridge Program is the primary federal program to fund the replacement or rehabilitation of deficient bridges. Funds are apportioned to states based on each state's share of the total cost. Congress may replace existing formula programs with block grants to reduce administrative overhead. The Highway Bridge Program allocates funds to states for repairing or replacing deficient bridges. Each state is guaranteed a minimum allocation, with a maximum limit of 10%. The federal share is 80%, increasing to 90% for interstate highway system bridges. Congress may address issues such as funding, bridge inspection standards, and program consolidation. Concerns include incentivizing states to keep deficiency rates high. A GAO report highlighted the program's lack of focus and sustainability. Program consolidation could merge the Highway Bridge Program's funding into a broader program dedicated to maintaining federal highways. Federal transit programs provide support for capital investments and operating costs, with most funding directed towards capital investment. The mass transit account of the highway trust fund is the main source of federal transit program funds, but the unexpended balance is projected to reach zero in FY2014. The transit account's revenue is insufficient to sustain Federal Transit Administration programs at current levels through the next authorization period due to funding and programmatic issues. Financial problems in the transit industry stem from flat government assistance, lower patronage, and declining system productivity, requiring increased government support. Fares and operating revenue only cover 26% of funding. Congress may need to consider modifying the federal transit program to increase ridership at a lower cost. The main issue in the upcoming reauthorization is how much to spend on transit. Various groups argue that the U.S. is under-investing in transportation infrastructure, including public transit. Both DOT and the Surface Commission estimate that more funding is needed to maintain and improve transit systems. Calls have been made for increased federal support for operating expenses due to budget problems faced by many transit agencies. Calls for increased federal support for transit operating expenses due to budget problems. Debate over proper transit spending levels relative to highway spending. Suggestions to increase transit funding by raising federal fuels tax or increasing general fund contributions. The potential solutions to address the budget problems in transit funding include raising the federal fuels tax by 10 cents per gallon and dedicating 20% of the increase to the transit account. Lowering the federal matching share could also help stretch federal transit dollars further, but it may lead to a preference for highway projects over public transit if the federal share is significantly lower. SAFETEA provides limited support for private participation in transit projects through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Congress may consider ways to increase private sector involvement in transit financing, but overall contribution is expected to be small. Restructuring federal transit programs may explore alternatives to PPPs for funding. One way to restructure federal public transit programs is to focus more on major capital investment for transit service in densely populated cities. This could involve expanding programs like the New Starts Program and Rail Modernization Program while reducing formula grants for smaller expenses. This shift may concentrate resources in large cities with high transit usage, leading to potential political challenges. Alternatively, Congress may opt for a different approach to modernizing transit systems. Congress may consider reducing spending on the New Starts Program and focusing on rehabilitating existing transit systems. Another option is to eliminate capital programs and replace them with a block grant based on transit ridership or population, giving more control to state and local governments. This restructuring could impact the distribution of funds among cities and localities. One option is to eliminate capital programs and replace them with a block grant based on transit ridership or population, giving more control to state and local governments in allocating transit funding. Another alternative is to fold transit programs into a broader \"metropolitan mobility\" program that distributes federal surface transportation funding to large urban areas on a mode-neutral basis. This could encourage states and localities to promote transit ridership and allocate funds to transit and highway infrastructure as needed. Transit ridership is concentrated in large cities, leading to most formula funding going to urbanized areas. The growth in demand and cost of paratransit has strained state and local transit budgets. Paratransit services cater to passengers with limited physical mobility and are mainly provided by vans. Federal transit programs exist to support paratransit services, but transit agencies may seek additional federal funding in reauthorization due to the social service nature of paratransit. The debate over whether the FTA should oversee paratransit funding arises due to the mismatch with regular transit services. Congress may consider incentivizing transit industry productivity through performance measures in distributing federal transit funds. This would reward agencies for delivering better service efficiently. Public transit services are typically monopolies, with local agencies selecting and subsidizing operators. Reauthorization could encourage improved efficiency in transit services. Reauthorization could promote competition in transit service provision by encouraging competitive bidding and allowing private operators to compete with public agencies. Barriers to competition, often found in state or local laws, could be eliminated as a condition of federal funding. Some suggest relaxing work rules in the transit industry to increase productivity, such as renegotiating union contracts. One way to boost productivity in transit service provision is by renegotiating union contracts and changing federal labor protections. Increasing fares to reflect the cost of service and implementing variable fares could also reduce the need for public assistance. Pricing automobile use during congested periods may further alleviate demand for transit services. One way to reduce the need for government assistance to public transit is by instituting highway tolls that vary based on traffic levels. This can encourage drivers to switch to transit and provide funds to enhance transit service, especially in congested regions with good transit options. Congress may want to consider comprehensive congestion management schemes that incorporate highway pricing and transit. Historically, intercity passenger rail transportation programs have been a minor part of surface transportation legislation. The High-Speed Rail Corridor Planning program was renamed the High-Speed Rail Corridor Development program, with acquisition of tracks and equipment now eligible expenses. Congress initially authorized $70 million annually for the program, but funding was not provided until FY2008. Federal initiatives in intercity passenger rail transportation expanded significantly since 2005. In 2008, Congress passed the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act, increasing funding for Amtrak and states developing intercity passenger rail service. The 2009 ARRA provided $8 billion in grants for intercity passenger rail service development, with an additional $2.5 billion in the FY2010 DOT appropriations act. In FY2010, $2.5 billion was allocated for intercity passenger rail improvements. The federal interest in rail has grown due to concerns over congestion, gas prices, and emissions, leading to a proposed $53 billion in grants for rail service enhancements. Funding would come from the highway trust fund, which may pose challenges as it is already oversubscribed. The House T&I Committee also included intercity passenger rail in a reauthorization initiative. In July 2011, the T&I Committee discussed issues such as Amtrak's role, private-sector involvement in intercity passenger rail, and funding. Congress did not provide funding for grants to states for intercity passenger rail in FY2011 and FY2012. A more predictable funding mechanism may be needed for passenger rail projects. Freight carriers and shippers were initially concerned about congestion before the world economy slowed in late 2007. The immediate concern of freight carriers and shippers in late 2007 was congestion at major ports and land gateways. Despite reduced freight volume, congestion persists, affecting reliable scheduling and increasing costs. The Department of Transportation projects a 68% increase in total tons transported by 2040, raising doubts about infrastructure keeping pace. Calls for stronger federal leadership in developing a systematic approach to address freight transportation needs have emerged, emphasizing the importance of a national transportation plan prioritizing key freight corridors for funding. A national transportation plan prioritizing key freight corridors for funding is needed to address congestion at major ports and land gateways. Current planning processes rely on state departments and metropolitan organizations, leading to challenges in addressing freight improvements that span multiple jurisdictions. Local actions to eliminate bottlenecks may just shift the problem elsewhere, impacting the reliability of travel time across the North American intermodal network. Some hub cities bear costs of improvements for national economic benefits. Land border ports, gateway seaports, and rail interchange points face negative effects of freight traffic serving distant locations. Local residents in major freight hubs like Los Angeles prioritize streamlining freight movement to reduce pollution and congestion. Freight issues vary by region and are best addressed at the state and local level. One way for Congress to promote a broader geographic perspective in planning freight-related transportation improvements is to tie funding for significant projects to state and local coordination. Different types of freight hubs face unique challenges, and local priorities such as job retention and quality of life can drive state and local transportation planners to address bottlenecks. Rural areas focus on maintaining rail access and upgrading roads for heavy trucks carrying agricultural products. The I-95 Corridor Coalition, consisting of state DOTs and transportation authorities from 16 states, explores rail and waterborne modes for freight transport to alleviate highway congestion. Suggestions for user charges like a container fee or freight waybill tax have been proposed to fund projects improving goods movement, with trade-offs in equity, efficiency, and administrative simplicity. Some freight interests support new user fees with conditions on fund allocation. Some freight interests condition support for new user fees on funding dedicated to new capacity on projects, especially in congested urban areas. Creating a separate funding program for freight transportation improvements could address inefficiencies in the national surface transportation network. FHWA highlights truck delays at urban freeway interchange points and other problem areas like steep grades and signalized intersections. Some states are considering segregating truck traffic from automobile traffic on highways with heavy truck traffic. Intermodal shipments, a rapidly growing segment of goods movement in the United States, involve higher-value goods and are closely linked to international trade. The roads connecting ports, airports, and rail terminals to the interstate highway system, known as \"intermodal connector\" roads, often face challenges such as poor pavement condition and substandard geometrics due to heavy truck traffic. Transfers between ports, railroads, and railroad networks may still require container transfers. Transfers between ports and railroads often require drayage, generating significant truck traffic in urban areas. On-dock rail terminals and logistics parks could reduce truck traffic on roads. Congress may consider supporting private efforts to limit wear on infrastructure. The federal government has supported private investments in freight rail infrastructure to reduce wear and congestion on urban roadways. Congress has authorized public investments in rail lines serving rural communities and large-scale projects in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. Rail users are pushing for more investment in passing sidings and double tracking to accommodate faster and more reliable freight trains. Options for Congress to consider include federal tax incentives or a dedicated trust fund for freight rail infrastructure. The federally supported expansion of commuter rail service may impact freight rail infrastructure funding. Congress may consider funding projects to address increased freight traffic, such as grade-separation projects. Highway safety has improved in the US, with a 25% decrease in traffic fatalities from 2005 to 2010. In 2010, the US saw a decrease in traffic fatalities to 32,885, the lowest since 1950. The fatality rate was 1.10 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, the lowest on record. Despite improvements, the goal of reducing the fatality rate to 1.0 by 2008 was not met. Other countries have surpassed the US in lowering fatality rates. Most fatalities occur among passenger car occupants, motorcyclists, and pedestrians. Highway safety improvements can be categorized into three groups. Countermeasures to improve highway safety can be divided into three general categories: changes to roadways, vehicles, and driver behavior. FHWA is responsible for roadway changes, distributing $1.2 billion to states in FY2011. NHTSA handles vehicle and driver-related changes, receiving $250 million for operations and research in FY2012. Driver behavior is a key factor in fatal crashes, with programs aimed at altering behavior considered most impactful. The most significant driver behaviors related to traffic fatalities are driving impaired, speeding, not wearing a seat belt, driver distraction, and not wearing a helmet for motorcyclists. Congress established programs in SAFETEA to promote seat belt use and reduce drunk driving, with some success in increasing states qualifying for grants. In the first year, the District of Columbia qualified for grants, but in the fourth year, four states and the District of Columbia lost eligibility due to increased measures. There are concerns about the eligibility criteria in SAFETEA, such as the exclusion of promoting motorcycle helmet use. Highway safety programs are less controversial than construction grants. Congress may need to consider significant changes to federal safety programs. Congress may be asked to consider consolidating or simplifying the five separate NHTSA incentive grant programs due to complaints about the difficult application process. Most programs have restrictions on how the funds can be used, with some being more limiting than others. For example, motorcycle safety program grants can only be used for safety training for motorcyclists. Officials in Montana want to use highway safety funds for motorcycle training sites, but the grant does not allow it. Congress may be asked for more flexibility in fund use. Sanctions are more effective than incentives in gaining state compliance with federal goals. The Governors Highway Safety Association opposes repealing a sanction on alcohol purchase for those under 21. The 1984 incentive program failed to induce states to change their laws on minimum purchase ages. Eligibility criteria for safety grants focus on actions rather than results, allowing states to receive grants without demonstrating improved highway safety. One possible reform is to tie grants more closely to a state's performance, but this may require data that are not currently available. Past transportation reauthorizations have included federal support for data collection related to highway safety. Congress tends to address commercial vehicle safety separately from passenger vehicle safety, with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration overseeing commercial vehicles. Proposals to increase size and weight limits for commercial trucks are controversial due to potential safety and roadway life impacts. Congress may consider in-vehicle technologies like driver-fatigue warning systems for safety. Inspections of commercial vehicles are crucial for ensuring compliance with safety regulations. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration oversees commercial vehicle safety, but there are concerns about limited resources for inspections leading to low compliance discovery. Commercial drivers can easily avoid detection for drug use, and some continue driving without proper testing. Congress may need to establish national measures to address these issues. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has requested legislative changes to enforce bus safety, including the establishment of a national database for drug testing and additional funding for inspectors. The federal surface transportation program supports research in various areas, with FHWA having the largest research budget among DOT agencies. Title V of SAFETEA authorized $411 million annually for research, with a significant portion allocated to surface transportation and intelligent transportation systems research. Congress is likely to face questions about the adequacy of transportation research funding, with advocates arguing for a higher share to reduce costs from crashes, congestion, and environmental damage. There are competing claims on how the funding should be used, as SAFETEA earmarked more funding than authorized, resulting in individual research programs receiving less funding to cover all designated programs. In 2008, Congress addressed funding shortfalls for FHWA projects by enacting the SAFETEA Technical Corrections Act (P.L. 110-224), adding additional funding to research programs. Concerns about the lack of peer review in research funding allocation have also been raised. Environmental requirements in past reauthorization debates have focused on the impact of transportation projects on the environment and compliance issues. Legislation addresses environmental compliance issues by funding projects to mitigate impacts and expedite compliance. FHWA and FTA must comply with NEPA requirements before highway or transit projects can proceed. NEPA mandates the preparation of an EIS to consider environmental impacts before final decisions are made. The NEPA requires an environmental impact statement (EIS) for federally funded projects that significantly affect the human environment. If a project's significance is unclear, an environmental assessment is conducted. Projects with no significant impact are processed as categorical exclusions. DOT regulations mandate compliance with all environmental laws for transportation projects. The NEPA process involves legal requirements such as the Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Clean Water Act, and Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act. Various agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the EPA may participate in the NEPA process by performing analysis or issuing permits. Legislative changes in SAFETEA and TEA-21 aimed to streamline the NEPA process, but debate continues on the impact of environmental compliance requirements on transportation project delivery. The NEPA process involves compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act, which applies to the use of certain resources for transportation projects. It requires a \"Section 4(f) evaluation\" to be prepared if a project would impact these resources. Debate may arise on provisions to expedite NEPA reviews in upcoming reauthorization processes. The NEPA process requires a \"4(f) evaluation\" to be included in the appropriate documentation, allowing for use of parks, refuges, and historic sites with \"de minimis impacts.\" Changes to Section 4(f) requirements may be debated during reauthorization. The CMAQ Program, created in 1991 and reauthorized in TEA-21 and SAFETEA, provides funds for transportation projects to reduce congestion and improve air quality in areas not meeting air quality standards. The CMAQ program, created in 1991 and reauthorized in TEA-21 and SAFETEA, authorizes funding for programs to reduce carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and ozone. Funding is based on population and pollution reduction needs, with debates expected during reauthorization on funding levels and eligible projects. From FY2005 to FY2009, over $8.6 billion was provided for projects like improved public transit, traffic flow improvements, and vehicle idling control. Priority is given to diesel engine retrofits and cost-effective emission reduction programs. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ funding eligibility for emission reduction projects and directed DOT to evaluate project impacts on air quality and congestion levels. FHWA released a report in 2008 studying the effectiveness of 67 CMAQ-funded projects. Under the Clean Air Act, areas not meeting air quality standards must develop State Implementation Plans. Quality Standards must develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to reach attainment for areas not meeting air quality standards. As of September 2010, 47 areas with 119 million people were subject to SIP requirements. Federal agencies are prohibited from funding projects in these areas unless they conform to SIPs. Transportation improvement programs must demonstrate that projects will not increase emissions that delay air quality standards attainment to receive federal funds. Exceptions include highway safety projects, transit facility rehabilitation, bus and rail car purchases, and noise attenuation. In surface transportation reauthorization, Congress may consider the benefits of conformity in achieving air quality goals against the burdens on proposed transportation projects. Legislation and regulations will need to mandate significant reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from transportation sources to address climate change. Transportation contributes significantly to U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide. Transportation sources contribute significantly to U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide being a major component. The key method to reduce CO2 emissions from transportation is to burn less fuel or use lower-carbon fuels like natural gas. Legislation like the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates improved fuel economy for vehicles and lower carbon content in renewable transportation fuels. The Obama Administration has accelerated the implementation of fuel economy standards, with full compliance expected by 2016 and more stringent standards proposed for 2017-2025. Surface transportation reauthorization could lead to systemic changes to reduce the carbon footprint of the transportation sector, including electrification of truck stops, congestion mitigation, funding for pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and incentives for lower carbon vehicles. (CRS contact: Jim McCarthy) Policy options for promoting \"smart growth\" include subsidies for alternative motor fuels. Current laws provide tax credits for ethanol blended into gasoline, with incentives for natural gas, hydrogen, biodiesel, and renewable diesel. These incentives, set to expire, may be extended through surface transportation reauthorization. Interest in environmental effects of alternative fuels is also growing. Interest is increasing in the environmental impact of alternative fuels, leading to discussions about modifying fuel credits to reflect their environmental performance. Various incentives, such as tax credits for alternative fuel vehicles and matching funds for transit agencies purchasing advanced technology buses, are in place to promote alternative fuels. Congress may consider adjusting these incentives in reauthorization to focus more on energy efficiency and environmental benefits. To promote alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, infrastructure support is crucial. Incentives like tax credits for retail stations to install refueling infrastructure are available, but may expire. Additional incentives, such as grants for tax-exempt entities like transit agencies, could be considered to expand refueling infrastructure accessibility."
