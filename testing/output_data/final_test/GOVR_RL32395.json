    "content": "The international law of armed conflict, including the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Regulations, applies in Iraq. Other relevant international laws pertain to human rights and the treatment of prisoners, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture. The Geneva Conventions aim to protect all individuals in the hands of a belligerent party, prohibiting torture and inhumane treatment. The Geneva Conventions prohibit torture and inhumane treatment in all circumstances, including for interrogation. Prisoners of War (POW) are entitled to the highest level of protection, including the right to be tried by court martial. They must be protected against violence, intimidation, insults, and public curiosity, and are entitled to respect for their persons and honor. No physical or mental torture is allowed. Article 17 of the Geneva Conventions prohibits torture and coercion on prisoners of war for information. Interrogators can ask questions, but POWs only need to provide their name and limited identifying information. Civilians in occupied territory are protected persons under the fourth Geneva Convention, entitled to respect for their persons, honor, family rights, religious beliefs, and customs. Protected persons in occupied territories must be treated humanely and protected from violence, threats, insults, and public curiosity. Any measures causing physical suffering or extermination, including murder, torture, and mutilation, are forbidden. Civilians can only be detained if absolutely necessary for security reasons, with internment being the most severe measure allowed. Protected civilians in occupied territories must be treated humanely and protected from harm. Internment or assigned residence is the most severe measure allowed for those posing a security threat, subject to regular review. No coercion is allowed to obtain information, and punitive imprisonment requires a fair trial. Collective penalties, intimidation, and forcible transfers are prohibited. Protected civilians in occupied territories must be treated humanely and protected from harm. Individual or mass forcible transfers, deportations, or unlawful confinement of protected persons are prohibited, except for temporary evacuations for security or military necessity. Relocation outside the occupied territory may be allowed if it benefits the individuals. Parties to the Geneva Conventions can make agreements for the accommodation of certain classes of internees in a neutral country. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency transferred detainees outside of Iraq for interrogation, leading to accusations of breaching international law. The Administration relies on a draft opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, stating that the prohibition applies to the expulsion of lawful residents but not to the deportation of illegal aliens or temporary removal of uncharged individuals for interrogation. The OLC memorandum interprets GC art. 49 as prohibiting forceful uprooting of residents, allowing temporary transfer of protected persons abroad. The status of \"unlawful combatants\" in Iraq remains debated, with the Department of Defense not classifying any detainees as such. The Geneva Conventions have been applied in Iraq since combat began. The Department of Defense maintains that the Geneva Conventions apply in Iraq, treating insurgents as protected civilians. However, non-Iraqi detainees are not considered \"protected persons.\" There is debate over the status of \"unlawful combatants\" in Iraq, with some arguing that this inconsistency has led to confusion over interrogation techniques. Exceptions exist for the treatment of protected persons deemed security risks in occupied territories. If detained as a spy or saboteur, they may forfeit communication rights for military security. However, they must still be treated with humanity and given fair trial rights. Delegates of the Protecting Power or ICRC should have unlimited access to prisoner of war camps and internment facilities. The Detaining Power may prevent ICRC access to detainees for security reasons, but only as an exceptional and temporary measure. Ghost detainees kept from ICRC view by CIA may be protected by Article 75 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, ensuring humane treatment in all circumstances. The Geneva Conventions ensure humane treatment of detainees, prohibiting violence, torture, corporal punishment, and outrages on personal dignity. Responsibility for the proper treatment of prisoners lies with the detaining power and individuals in charge. Mistreatment of prisoners of war can lead to individual liability under international norms and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Geneva Conventions prohibit mistreatment of detainees, including grave breaches such as wilful killing, torture, and inhuman treatment. Detaining powers are obligated to ensure fair and humane treatment of prisoners. The Geneva Conventions require detaining powers to enact legislation for penal sanctions against grave breaches and to search for and bring alleged perpetrators before their own courts, regardless of nationality. Parties must also suppress violative acts and educate military personnel on the Conventions' provisions. Detainees have the right to protest their treatment to the detaining power or a neutral organization like the International Committee of the Red Cross. U.S. Military Implementation of the Geneva Conventions is outlined in United States Army Regulation (AR) 190-8, which sets standards for the treatment of enemy prisoners of war, retained personnel, civilian internees, and other detainees in the custody of the U.S. Armed Forces. The policy regarding the treatment of EPW, CI, and RP in U.S. Armed Forces custody mandates humanitarian care, protection under the GPW, due process for serious offenses, and prohibits inhumane treatment. The policy mandates humane treatment of EPW, CI, and RP in U.S. Armed Forces custody, protecting them from violence, exploitation, and inhumane acts. Photographing and filming them for non-administrative purposes is strictly prohibited. The Geneva Conventions require humane treatment of protected persons in custody. The War Crimes Act of 1996 allows prosecution for war crimes committed by or against U.S. nationals, including grave breaches under the Geneva Conventions. The United Nations has a duty to promote universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction. The UDHR prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, exile, torture, and cruel treatment. Although non-binding, many UDHR provisions are considered customary law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights elaborates on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, prohibiting arbitrary detention and cruel treatment. It also allows for derogation in times of public emergency, with conditions to uphold other international obligations and avoid discrimination. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, language, religion, or social origin. Certain rules cannot be derogated from, including those related to the death sentence, cruel treatment, slavery, retroactive penal sanctions, and recognition of all persons by the law. The United States ratified the ICCPR in 1992 with reservations, including a declaration that it is non-self-executing. President Clinton established the Interagency Working Group on Human Rights Treaties. President Clinton established the Interagency Working Group on Human Rights Treaties to implement the ICCPR and other human rights treaties with the mandate to provide guidance, oversight, and coordination. In 2001, the responsibilities were transferred to the National Security Council Policy Coordination Committee on Democracy, Human Rights, and International Operations. The United States ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture in 1994, requiring measures to prevent torture within its jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention Against Torture prohibits torture in any circumstances, defining it as the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering for various purposes by a public official. Torture excludes pain from lawful sanctions or unintentional acts causing severe suffering. The United Nations Convention Against Torture prohibits intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering by public officials. States parties must criminalize and punish acts of torture, provide training to prevent torture and cruel treatment, and extradite offenders if necessary. The United Nations Convention Against Torture prohibits intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering by public officials. States parties must criminalize and punish acts of torture, provide training to prevent torture and cruel treatment, and extradite offenders if necessary. The U.S. implemented the CAT requirements in 1994 through legislation (18 U.S.C.\u00c2\u00a7 2340 et seq .), defining torture as acts intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain. Victims have the right to have their allegations investigated by impartial officers and seek fair compensation. The United Nations Convention Against Torture prohibits intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering by public officials. States parties must criminalize and punish acts of torture, provide training to prevent torture and cruel treatment, and extradite offenders if necessary. The U.S. implemented the CAT requirements in 1994 through legislation (18 U.S.C.\u00c2\u00a7 2340 et seq.), defining torture as acts intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain. Victims have the right to have their allegations investigated by impartial officers and seek fair compensation. Torture is defined as inflicting severe physical or mental pain or suffering on a person in custody or control, with violators facing imprisonment or the death penalty. The Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) was enacted in 1990 to provide redress for victims of torture overseas. It allows individuals to seek recovery for acts of torture committed under foreign law from those responsible. Only individuals with a certain level of personal responsibility can be sued under the TVPA, not entities. U.S. officials cannot be sued under the TVPA, but abused prisoners may be able to bring suit against them under the Alien Tort Statute. After World War II, individuals who commit war crimes or crimes against humanity can be held accountable, whether they are military members or civilians. Military personnel are subject to the laws of war and can be tried by international or national tribunals for violations. U.S. service members are not subject to Iraqi courts unless their immunity is waived. In international armed conflicts, armed forces members can be held liable for breaches of the law of war, including maltreatment of prisoners under their control. Service members are subject to military jurisdiction under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and may be tried for serious crimes by general court-martial. Commanders can be held vicariously liable for abuses committed by their subordinates, even without explicit orders, if they knew or should have known about the abuses. Mistreatment of prisoners can be punishable under article 93, UCMJ, which prohibits cruelty, oppression, or maltreatment. The UCMJ prohibits cruelty, oppression, and maltreatment of individuals, as well as ordinary crimes like assault, rape, murder, and maiming. Article 134 covers disorders, neglects, and conduct bringing discredit to the armed forces. Attempts, conspiracy, and solicitation to commit crimes are also punishable under U.S. Federal Law for service members. Service members are subject to federal statutes and may be tried in federal court. Soldiers accused of committing crimes overseas may be prosecuted by court-martial or under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. Former service members can also be prosecuted under MEJA for crimes committed overseas before their separation from military service. The status of contract personnel serving as part of an occupying or peacekeeping force is unclear under international law. Contractor personnel and civilian employees in Iraq can be prosecuted in U.S. courts under federal statutes, including the War Crimes Act of 1996 and the prohibition on torture. They may be liable for war crimes if they support U.S. forces and commit grave breaches under the Geneva Conventions. The War Crimes Act of 1996 and the federal prohibition on torture apply to acts outside the United States, regardless of the perpetrator's nationality. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 allows prosecution of persons employed by or accompanying the armed forces overseas for offenses punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. This includes civilian employees of the Department of Defense and DoD contractors. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 expanded the coverage of MEJA. The War Crimes Act of 1996 and federal prohibition on torture apply to acts outside the US, regardless of perpetrator's nationality. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 allows prosecution of persons employed by or accompanying armed forces overseas for offenses punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 expanded MEJA coverage to include civilian contractors and employees from other federal agencies supporting DoD missions overseas. This includes contract employees working alongside military personnel, but not civilian and contract employees of agencies engaged in their own operations overseas. The Department of Defense issued proposed regulations for implementing MEJA in February 2004, but they never went into effect. The Department of Defense issued proposed regulations for implementing MEJA, but those rules never went into effect and will likely need adjustments for the new scope of the law. It is unclear if contract personnel are subject to military prosecution under the UCMJ for conduct in Iraq, as military jurisdiction extends to persons serving with or accompanying armed forces in the field during a declared war. The Supreme Court has interpreted \"war\" to mean only wars declared by Congress, distinguishing cases of trials in enemy territory conquered by force of arms. In enemy territory conquered by force of arms, the Army commander can establish military or civilian commissions to try individuals, including contractors. If the US is considered an \"occupying power\" in Iraq, contractors may be subject to military jurisdiction. The validity of trying contractors under military law may have been undermined by later case law requiring a congressional declaration of war. Contractors in Iraq operate under the law of the interim government and are exempt from Iraqi laws for acts related to their contracts, as per CPA Order Number 17. They are also immune from Iraqi legal processes for acts performed under the contracts. Iraqi legal processes can proceed against contract personnel without Sending State permission, but the State's certification on conduct related to the contract is conclusive in Iraqi courts. Besides criminal punishment for torture, victims may have a right to compensation under international law. Conduct violating international obligations is attributed to a State if committed by its government, officials, or agents. The scope of authority of governments and State responsibility for breaches of obligations, including reparations for war crimes negotiated through peace treaties. Reparations may include monetary compensation, restitution, restoration, or specific performance. Individual victims may not be guaranteed compensation even if governments reach an agreement. The primary remedy for maltreatment of detainees is unclear. The primary remedy for a breach of State responsibility with respect to the maltreatment of detainees is the payment of reparations, which may include compensation for damage resulting from the unlawful act. The Red Cross commentary on the GPW implies that a State must make good the damage caused, either by restoring everything to the former condition or by paying damages. In cases where restoration is impossible, reparation is limited to the payment of damages, particularly for physical and mental injuries suffered by prisoners. However, individuals harmed may not always be able to seek redress directly. The State of an individual's nationality is typically responsible for seeking reparation for harm caused by breaches of international agreements. However, international law is evolving, with examples such as the Rome Statute providing for compensation of victims of international crimes. The U.N. Security Council also established a compensation commission for victims of war crimes. The United States generally cannot be sued in its own courts without waiving sovereign immunity. Congress has provided waivers for certain types of claims. Victims of injuries overseas may seek compensation through U.S. courts under certain laws like the Alien Tort Statute or the Torture Victim Protection Act. Congress can also provide compensation without waiving sovereign immunity through administrative procedures. The Military Claims Act allows for compensation for injuries caused by military personnel or civilian employees. The Military Claims Act (MCA) sets regulations for claim payments, with a $100,000 limit. Claims can include medical expenses, lost earnings, and pain and suffering. Enemy nationals and allies of countries at war with the US are generally ineligible for relief unless deemed friendly. The Foreign Claims Act compensates foreign nationals for injuries caused by US military personnel. The Foreign Claims Act (FCA) allows compensation for injury, death, or property damage to foreign nationals caused by the U.S. military in Iraq. Claims are processed by the Army and decided by a Foreign Claims Commission. Compensation is based on local law and is only available to claimants deemed friendly to the United States. Relief under the FCA is considered ex gratia and does not waive sovereign immunity. The Foreign Claims Act (FCA) allows compensation for injury, death, or property damage to foreign nationals caused by the U.S. military in Iraq. The FCA does not waive sovereign immunity and does not provide a cause of action in court. Congress has the authority to make rules regarding capture on land or water, define and punish violations of international law, and regulate the armed forces. The 108th Congress addressed issues related to the Abu Ghraib scandal and reaffirmed that torture is unlawful. Section 9011 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2005 states that the United States may pursue subrogation against individual U.S. tortfeasors to recoup funds expended. Section 9011 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2005 reaffirms that torture of prisoners of war and detainees is illegal, as stated by Congress during the 108th Congress. Resolutions condemning the abuses at Abu Ghraib were passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, calling for investigations. Several House resolutions of inquiry regarding the abuse of Iraqi prisoners were not voted on. Hearings were conducted by five committees to address these issues. During the 108th Congress, hearings were held by the Committee on Intelligence, House Armed Services Committee, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss the Abu Ghraib scandal. Testimonies were given by Department of Defense officials, including Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard B. Myers. General Taguba and Stephen Cambone were also interviewed. The Senate Armed Services Committee heard testimony from CENTCOM Commander General John Abizaid and Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez. During the 108th Congress, hearings were held to address the Abu Ghraib scandal, with testimonies from Department of Defense officials and general officers. Lieutenant General Paul Mikolashek was interviewed about his investigation, and the Senate and House Armed Services Committee held hearings on the allegations of abuse. The 108th Congress enacted laws addressing the treatment of prisoners in Iraq, including the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005, P.L.108-375. Congress addressed the detention issue in the Defense Authorization Act signed into law in 2004. The Act does not specifically prohibit torture or cruel treatment of detainees but states that the Constitution and laws of the United States prohibit such actions. The Defense Authorization Act of 2004 prohibits torture or cruel treatment of foreign prisoners held in custody by the United States. It requires the U.S. government to ensure detainees are not subjected to such treatment, investigate and prosecute abuse cases, and process detainees promptly. The military must implement a policy within 150 days to ensure detainees are treated according to obligations. The Defense Authorization Act of 2004 mandates that detainees are treated in accordance with international obligations. DOD regulations require educating personnel on the Geneva Convention, training for civilian contractors, informing detainees of their rights, conducting inspections of facilities, and ensuring same-sex guard-detainee contact. The Defense Authorization Act of 2004 mandates compliance with international obligations regarding detainee treatment. Section 1092 codifies Geneva Convention education requirements for military personnel and civilian contractors at DOD detention facilities. Same-sex guard-detainee contact is required, with reporting obligations under Section 1093 of PL 108-375. The Defense Authorization Act of 2004 mandates compliance with international obligations regarding detainee treatment, including Geneva Convention education requirements for military personnel and civilian contractors at DOD detention facilities. Section 1093 requires DOD to submit reports on detainee treatment, investigations into violations of laws, and aggregate data on detention operations. Section 1206 mandates reports on contractors supporting deployed forces in Iraq. The Defense Authorization Act of 2004 mandates compliance with international obligations regarding detainee treatment, including Geneva Convention education requirements for military personnel and civilian contractors at DOD detention facilities. Section 1093 requires DOD to submit reports on detainee treatment, investigations into violations of laws, and aggregate data on detention operations. Section 1206 mandates reports on contractors supporting deployed forces in Iraq. A report on command and oversight mechanisms in Iraq is to be submitted within 180 days of P.L. 108-375 enactment, including sanctions for misconduct and actions taken against contractor personnel. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 prohibits the use of funds by the Justice Department to support or justify torture. Calls for further congressional action and rigorous investigation into U.S. detention operations are expected to continue. The Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee held hearings on Detainees in June and July 2005. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also discussed interrogation in the Global War on Terror. Legislation such as the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005 was enacted into law on May 11, 2005. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005 (P.L. 109-13), enacted into law on May 11, 2005, includes a prohibition on torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of individuals in US custody. The administration's stance on the application of this prohibition to aliens held overseas remains unclear. The United States is uncertain if section 1031 will impose new restrictions on Defense spending. Bills propose an independent commission to investigate detainee abuse. H.R. 2863 reaffirms that torture of prisoners is illegal. H.R. 112 requires videotaping of detainee interrogations by military or civilian personnel. The Senate Defense Authorization bill (S. 1042) includes provisions for immediate access to detainees by international organizations. Amendments are being considered to ensure adherence to the Army's interrogation manual, prohibit cruel treatment of prisoners, authorize status review tribunals, and establish an independent commission to investigate detainee abuse. The Senate Defense Authorization bill includes provisions to ensure adherence to the Army's interrogation manual, prohibit cruel treatment of prisoners, authorize status review tribunals, and establish an independent commission to investigate detainee abuse. The Defense Department FY2006 Appropriations bill contains a provision introduced by Senator McCain to prohibit \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment\" of detainees and limit interrogation techniques to those defined in the U.S. Army Field Manual. The Senate Defense Authorization bill includes provisions to ensure adherence to the Army's interrogation manual, prohibit cruel treatment of prisoners, and establish an independent commission to investigate detainee abuse. Section 8155 of H.R. 2863 prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of all persons in U.S. custody, regardless of the agency, without geographic limitation. The Administration sought an exception for the CIA, citing the need for flexibility in the global war on terrorism, which Senator McCain criticized. The Targeting Terrorists More Effectively Act of 2005, S. 12, includes provisions to define U.S. policy on detainees in the war against terrorism. It mandates humane treatment for all foreign persons in U.S. custody, in accordance with U.S. and international law, prohibiting torture and cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment. Senator McCain has criticized the Administration's proposal for a CIA exemption, expressing concerns about potential abuse of detainees. The bill aims to establish U.S. policy on detainee treatment, ensuring compliance with legal obligations under U.S. and international law, including the Convention Against Torture and Geneva Conventions. It emphasizes that all U.S. officials are bound by prohibitions against torture, cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment. There is debate on whether Congress needs to provide additional prohibitions to enforce existing laws. The issue of detainee treatment continues to draw Congress's attention amid investigations into alleged abuse at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station."
