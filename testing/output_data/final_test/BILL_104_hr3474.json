Congress finds that alcohol is the most widely used and abused drug by young people in the US, despite being illegal for those under 21. An estimated 18 million adults and 4.5 million young people have alcohol-related problems. High school surveys show high rates of alcohol use among students. Among young people in the US, alcohol is widely used despite being illegal for those under 21. High school surveys reveal that 71% of tenth graders and 56% of eighth graders have tried alcohol. Additionally, 28% of high school seniors, 24% of tenth graders, and 15% of eighth graders have engaged in binge drinking. College students also report high rates of alcohol use, with 88% having used alcohol and 40% engaging in binge drinking. The average age of alcohol initiation is 13, with 30% of boys and 22% of girls identifying as drinkers by that age. By eighth grade, 14% of high school seniors have been drunk, increasing to 60% by tenth grade. Studies show that alcohol use among young people is prevalent, with 43% trying alcohol by ninth grade, 60% by twelfth grade. Early alcohol use predicts later heavy substance use. A national survey found that the average binge drinker is a 16-year-old male in tenth grade who started drinking at 12. Many youth underestimate the risks of alcohol, with a significant percentage not perceiving regular or binge drinking as risky. According to surveys, many students do not perceive the risks of alcohol consumption, with millions unaware of the dangers of overdose. Additionally, a significant number of students believe that wine coolers or beer are not as harmful as other alcoholic beverages. Healthy People 2000 reports that alcohol is a major factor in motor vehicle crashes and fatal intentional injuries. Alcohol-related problems are prevalent, with fatal intentional injuries like suicides and homicides. Victims are intoxicated in one-third of homicides, drownings, and boating deaths. Alcohol in combination with other drugs leads to emergency room drug abuse episodes. Chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, was the 11th leading cause of death in the US in 1995, with heavy alcohol use being a significant risk factor. Alcohol abuse is linked to various health issues, including hypertension, cancer (liver, esophagus, nasopharynx, larynx), and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) which is a leading cause of birth defects and mental retardation. Treatment costs for FAS and other alcohol-related birth defects in the US are estimated at nearly a third of a billion dollars. Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) which can result in mental retardation. The incidence of FAS is higher among children born to women who drink heavily, with the alcoholic-beverage industry spending billions on advertising in the US. Alcohol advertising is a significant source of alcohol education in the country. A study funded by the American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety found a link between exposure to beer advertising in youth and expectations of drinking as an adult. Additionally, sponsorships and promotions on college campuses by alcohol producers create a pro-drinking environment, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Musical groups in advertising contribute to a pro-drinking environment, with a survey showing that alcohol advertising influences underage youth to drink. The Surgeon General's Workshop on Drunk Driving in 1988 recommended balancing alcoholic beverage advertising with pro-health and pro-safety messages, as well as including health warning messages in all alcohol ads. The National Commission on Drug-Free Schools recommends additional health and safety messages on alcohol products and advertising, and suggests considering a ban on alcohol advertising if it continues to target youth and glamorize alcohol use. Over two-thirds of people surveyed in a 1989 poll support warnings about the dangers of drinking on alcoholic beverage containers and in alcohol advertisements. Nearly three-fourths of persons surveyed in a 1990 Gallup Poll support health warning messages in alcohol advertising. SEC. 3. HEALTH WARNINGS. After 6 months from enactment, advertising alcoholic beverages in the US without required health warnings is deemed unfair or deceptive under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The warnings must include information about the risks of drinking during pregnancy. The Surgeon General warns against the dangers of alcohol consumption, including addiction, impaired driving, and mixing alcohol with drugs. Toll-free numbers are provided for assistance. The Surgeon General warns about the dangers of alcohol consumption, including the risk of alcohol poisoning and health problems like high blood pressure, liver disease, and cancer. Toll-free numbers are provided for more information and assistance. Television broadcasting cannot advertise alcoholic beverages without including health warnings from the Surgeon General about the risks of drinking alcohol. The Surgeon General warns that drinking too much alcohol can lead to alcohol poisoning, high blood pressure, liver disease, and cancer. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for establishing toll-free numbers for health warnings and reporting to Congress annually on the calls received. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS. The health warnings for alcoholic beverage advertisements must be prominently displayed, in legible type, surrounded by a box, and visually distinct from other printed material. Regulations for these warnings must be in effect within 6 months of the enactment of the Act. The health warnings for alcoholic beverage advertisements must be prominently displayed, in legible type, surrounded by a box, and visually distinct from other printed material. The warnings must appear on the front of an advertisement as indicated by labeling of the manufacturer or importer, and be rotated in an alternating sequence on each advertisement of a brand style in accordance with a plan submitted to the Secretary. The plan must assure an equal distribution of each health warning on each sequence of the same or similar advertisement for a brand style. Rotation also applies to radio and television advertisements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will require beverage advertisements on radio or television to prominently display health warnings in a rotating sequence, ensuring equal distribution of each warning on each advertisement. Manufacturers or importers must submit a plan for approval to comply with these regulations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services mandates that beverage advertisements must include health warnings in a rotating sequence for equal distribution. Regulations require audible and clear delivery of the warning message, with a graphic representation on television. The Secretary of Health and Human Services mandates that beverage advertisements must include health warnings in a rotating sequence for equal distribution.

The term \"alcoholic beverage\" includes any liquid containing at least 0.5% alcohol by volume for human consumption. The term \"person\" includes states, agencies, officers, and employees. The term \"State\" includes various political subdivisions and territories. After 2 years, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will investigate and consult with the Surgeon General to determine if changes to health warnings are justified. If so, a report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress."
