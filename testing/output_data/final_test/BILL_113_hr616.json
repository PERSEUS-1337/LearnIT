    "content": "The Act titled \"Scaling Up Manufacturing Act of 2013\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a credit for manufacturing facility costs. This new section allows for manufacturing facility expenditures to be eligible for a tax credit. The \"Scaling Up Manufacturing Act of 2013\" introduces a manufacturing facility expenditure credit for eligible businesses. The credit is 25% of qualified facility construction expenditures for the taxable year. Eligible businesses must be actively engaged in trade or business, headquartered in the US, have management activities in the US, not have previously placed a dedicated commercial manufacturing facility in service, and have all debt obligations issued by them. The \"Scaling Up Manufacturing Act of 2013\" offers a manufacturing facility expenditure credit for eligible businesses. The credit is 25% of qualified facility construction expenditures for the taxable year. Qualified expenditures are for the construction of a facility in the US with a B minus rating or higher from a credit rating agency. The Secretary shall prescribe in the United States to manufacture a qualified product and for the purchase of specialized equipment for use at such facility. A qualified product is any product produced and sold to a purchaser before facility construction. Special rules apply for recapture events. If a recapture event occurs in a taxable year for a taxpayer's facility that received a credit under this section, the taxpayer's tax for that year will increase by the applicable recapture percentage multiplied by the decrease in credits allowed under section 38 for prior years if the facility's construction expenditures had been zero. The applicable recapture percentage is determined based on a table for recapture events in a taxable year for a taxpayer's facility that received a credit under this section. The recapture percentage for different years after a recapture event is as follows: Year 1 - 100%, Year 2 - 80%, Year 3 - 60%, Year 4 - 40%, Year 5 - 20%, Years 6 and thereafter - 0%. Year 1 starts on the first day of the taxable year when the facility receiving the credit was placed in service. A recapture event occurs if the taxpayer becomes insolvent or disposes of the facility to an ineligible business. If a facility doesn't start operations within 5 years of receiving the credit, special rules apply. If a facility fails to start operations within 5 years of receiving the credit, a recapture event occurs. The credit for qualified facility construction expenditures can be assigned to another person and will not be taken into account by the initial taxpayer. The credit for qualified facility construction expenditures can be assigned to another person and will not be taken into account by the initial taxpayer. Members of the same controlled group of corporations and persons under common control are treated as one person for tax purposes. References to corporations or partnerships in this section include predecessors. Double benefits are denied if a credit is allowed for any property expenditure. The amendment to the tax code reduces the basis of property by the amount of credit allowed and denies double benefits for manufacturing facility expenditures. The credit is included in the general business credit. The amendment reduces property basis by the credit amount, prevents double benefits for manufacturing facility expenses, and applies to expenses after enactment."
