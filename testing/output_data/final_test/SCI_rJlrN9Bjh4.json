    "content": "Good-Enough Model Spaces (GEMS) is a framework for learning a global satisficing model by combining local nodes' models in machine learning tasks with partitioned data. It outperforms traditional aggregation techniques in experiments on benchmark and medical datasets. There has been significant work in designing distributed optimization methods for large-scale learning applications. These methods aim to train a global model through communication rounds between distributed nodes. In contrast to most approaches that aim to reduce communication, few-shot model aggregation methods focus on maximizing accuracy with limited communication rounds. This approach is beneficial in settings with limited network infrastructure. Few-shot methods in distributed networks offer benefits such as increased privacy, data ephemerality, and reduced communication for learning aggregate models. These methods are particularly useful in settings with limited network infrastructure and where nodes may lose access to raw data. In distributed networks, few-shot methods offer benefits like increased privacy and reduced communication for learning aggregate models. Hospitals A and B want to jointly learn a model without sharing raw data, using distributed optimization. The goal is to learn a single aggregate model that performs well on each task. The proposed framework, good-enough model spaces (GEMS), allows for learning an aggregate model over distributed nodes in a few communication rounds. It leverages the idea that multiple hypotheses can yield 'good enough' performance locally, enabling the computation of a global model quickly. GEMS is simple, scalable, and modular, offering the operator control over the tradeoff between model size and performance. The GEMS framework presents a general formulation for learning an aggregate model over distributed nodes efficiently. Empirical validation on standard benchmarks and a health dataset shows significant accuracy improvements over local baselines, coming close to the global ideal. With fine-tuning, GEMS achieves even higher accuracy levels, demonstrating its effectiveness in distributed learning scenarios. In distributed learning, the focus is on minimizing communication while maximizing performance within a fixed budget. Various methods have been proposed for efficient communication and asynchronous optimization. One-shot/few-shot methods like model averaging have been explored in convex settings to achieve this goal. In distributed learning, one-shot schemes like model averaging and ensembles are used to minimize communication while maximizing performance. However, simple averaging can perform poorly in non-convex settings when local models converge to different optima. GEMs outperform these methods with fewer parameters. Meta-learning and transfer learning aim to share knowledge from one learning process onto others. Transfer learning focuses on optimizing the performance of a single target model, while meta-learning involves joint optimization between multiple models. GEMS draws inspiration from version space learning to characterize logical hypotheses consistent with available data. Our approach generalizes to explore imperfect, noisy hypotheses spaces, unlike previous works that assume perfect predictions. We aim to learn an aggregate model that approximates the optimal model's performance over a training set belonging to each node. The approach aims to develop an aggregate model that approximates the optimal model's performance over local data while minimizing communication rounds. Each node computes and communicates locally good models to a central server, which learns the aggregate model from the intersection of these sets. The proposed method, GEMS, formalizes model aggregation using model evaluation functions and thresholds. The GEMS approach involves each node computing and sending models to a central node, which selects the final aggregate model from the intersection of these sets. The model space for each learner is visualized as regions over the weight space, with the final model selected from the intersecting area. This process requires mechanisms for computing model spaces on each node and for model selection. In this work, methods are presented for two types of models: convex models and simple neural networks. For convex models, H k can be approximated as an R d -ball in the parameter space, requiring only one round of communication between nodes to learn h G. For neural networks, H k is computed as independent R d -balls for each neuron in a layer, with intersections identified between neurons. The radius for the ball is computed via binary search, with the goal of identifying the optimal local model on a device. The node samples a candidate hypothesis h and evaluates Q(h, S k) to identify the largest radius for good models in the R d ball. Algorithm 2 constructs H k. Node k computes H k according to a specified formula. Fine-tuning on a small sample of public data S public can improve the quality of the GEMS aggregate model, H G. The evaluation results for GEMS on three datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and HAM10000, a medical imaging dataset focusing on distinguishing between 7 types of skin lesions. Results are compared to global, local, and naive average baselines. Fine-tuning the GEMS model for 5 epochs on a random sample of 1000 images from the validation data significantly improves performance, outperforming local/average baselines. The tuned GEMS model consistently outperforms every baseline and remains stable as the number of nodes (K) increases. GEMS is shown to be more parameter efficient than ensemble baselines, achieving better accuracy with fewer parameters. Fine-tuning the GEMS model on a holdout set of samples has a significant impact on model performance, especially with smaller sample sizes. The model consistently outperforms baselines and shows improvements even with just 100 images. However, in complex tasks, GEMS may struggle to find intersections between nodes. In complex tasks, GEMS may struggle to find intersections between nodes due to the task complexity or high settings. The approach introduces a framework for learning an aggregated model across nodes within a few communication rounds, using R d balls as coarse approximations of the model space. Despite its simplicity, the approach outperforms baselines for effective model aggregation. The GEMS algorithm aims to aggregate models effectively by computing R d -balls for linear separators in convex settings. Each node's R d -ball is defined by a center and radius, ensuring a minimum accuracy threshold. The algorithm finds intersections between nodes to learn an aggregated model within a few communication rounds, outperforming baselines. The GEMS algorithm aims to aggregate models effectively by computing R d -balls for linear separators in convex settings. It finds intersections between nodes to learn an aggregated model within a few communication rounds, outperforming baselines. The algorithm picks a point in the intersection by solving DISPLAYFORM2, which can be improved by fine-tuning on a limited sample of 'public data'. The GEMS algorithm is further explained in detail, focusing on the challenges faced in neural networks, such as node-specific features and model isomorphisms in MLPs. The GEMS algorithm aggregates models effectively by computing R d-balls for linear separators in convex settings. It finds intersections between nodes to learn an aggregated model within a few communication rounds. The algorithm modifies the approach for constructing hidden layers by applying it to individual hidden units, optimizing neuron weights for each node. The GEMS algorithm aggregates models by finding intersections between nodes to learn an aggregated model within a few communication rounds. Neurons are inserted at each node's local model and retrained, incrementing the layer until all hidden layers are processed. The algorithm simplifies the process by clustering neurons and only looking for intersections within the same cluster. For clarity, the number of clusters in k-means is denoted as m. Preprocessing steps for empirical results include using the MNIST dataset and featurizing the CIFAR-10 dataset with a pretrained VGG-16 model. The HAM dataset contains 10015 skin lesion images classified into seven types. The dataset is highly skewed, with one class comprising almost 66% of the images. To balance the dataset, random transformations are applied to augment each class. In order to balance the dataset, random transformations are applied to augment each class by performing various random transformations using Keras. A custom feature extractor is constructed by training a convolutional network on 66% of the data, with 3 convolutional layers, 2 MaxPool layers, and a hidden layer with 512 neurons. Each dataset is partitioned to ensure that images of the same class belong to the same node. The label partitions for the datasets were broken down for different values of K. Training was done on the train split, with results reported on the test split. A logistic regression classifier was used for the convex model, while a two-layer neural network was used for the non-convex model with dropout applied to the hidden layer. Training details such as learning rate, batch size, and termination criteria were specified for each model. In a convex setting, GEMS often defaults to a weighted average of parameters, resembling naive averaging. Tuned GEMS remains consistent and outperforms other baselines as the number of agents increases. Different values of K were used for label partitions in the datasets. Logistic regression and neural network models were trained with specific details provided. GEMS offers a modular framework for neural networks, allowing a tradeoff between model size and performance by adjusting hyperparameters m and j. Results on CIFAR-10 show GEMS outperforms ensemble methods with fewer parameters, correlating performance with the number of hidden neurons. Model size is described in terms of hidden neurons, and results are averaged over 5 trials. In the context of GEMS framework for neural networks, a grid search is conducted over different values to find intersections, with results averaged over 5 trials and standard deviations reported. The need to set conservatively for GEMs to identify intersections is illustrated in the study."
