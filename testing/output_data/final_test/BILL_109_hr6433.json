    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lebanon Reconstruction and Stabilization Act of 2006\". Congress finds that on July 25, 2006, a humanitarian emergency was declared in Lebanon due to ongoing insecurity and humanitarian needs. On August 11, 2006, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1701 calling for an end to hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. This resolution emphasized the importance of achieving a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. On August 14, 2006, a ceasefire was brokered between Hezbollah and Israel. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 welcomes the Lebanese government's commitment to extend its authority over its territory and calls for international assistance in providing financial and humanitarian aid to the Lebanese people. It also urges the safe return of displaced persons and the reopening of airports and harbors under the government's authority. The Lebanese government seeks international assistance for reconstruction and development, estimating $3.6 billion in damages and 8,500 unexploded ordnance in the region. The economy, particularly tourism, has been severely impacted, affecting 15% of GDP. A functioning Lebanese government is crucial for national security interests of the United States, Israel, and the region. SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY. Congress declares that assisting failed states emerging from violent conflict is a complex and long-term task, with a high risk of relapse into violence. The United States Government recognizes the national security threat posed by failed and failing states, implementing directives for stabilization and reconstruction operations. The United States Government aims to assist the Lebanese Government in long-term reconstruction and stabilization to promote peace and stability in Lebanon and the Middle East region. Assistance will align with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, focusing on building local community and government capacities for long-term development. Authorization of assistance for the reconstruction and stabilization of Lebanon. The President is authorized to provide assistance for the reconstruction and stabilization of Lebanon through the Department of State's Office of Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization. Assistance shall be used to rebuild infrastructure and encourage support from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for housing and economic assistance. The fund aims to provide housing and economic assistance through grants and micro-lending plans to revive small businesses in Lebanon. It also includes programs for peace, reconciliation, and conflict resolution within Lebanon and with Israel, as well as support for civic engagement, democratization, and education improvements for Lebanese youth. Funding for counseling services to address post-traumatic stress disorders is also emphasized. Increase assistance for cross-sectarian educational experiences of Lebanese youth, support demining and mine awareness campaigns in Lebanon, authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2007 through 2011, and allocate at least $15,000,000 annually for subsection (b)(4) activities."
