    "content": "If a sitting Member of Congress is indicted for a felony, their status and service are not directly affected by federal statute or House rules. However, internal party rules require indicted leaders to temporarily step aside. Conviction of a felony may have consequences for their status as a Member of the House, but they do not automatically forfeit their office. Members of Congress do not automatically lose their offices upon felony conviction, but may face restrictions on voting and committee participation. Party rules may result in loss of chairmanships or ranking member status. Conviction can lead to internal disciplinary proceedings, including expulsion with approval of two-thirds of Members. Expulsion from Congress does not affect federal pension, but conviction of certain crimes may lead to pension forfeiture. Indictment or conviction of a felony does not disqualify one from being a Member of Congress, except for treasonous conduct. Congressional office qualifications are age, citizenship, and inhabitancy in the state when elected, as per the US Constitution. The constitutional qualifications for being a Member of Congress are age, citizenship, and inhabitancy in the state when elected. Indictment or conviction of a felony does not disqualify one from serving in Congress, but may result in temporary loss of leadership positions. The Republican Conference Rules state that a member of the leadership must step aside if indicted for a felony carrying a sentence of two or more years imprisonment. Similar provisions exist in the Rules of the Democratic Caucus for committee positions. In 2005, the Democratic Caucus adopted a provision requiring a member of the Democratic leadership of the House to step aside temporarily when indicted for a felony with a potential sentence of two or more years imprisonment. Rules in both Democratic and Republican parties state that a Member convicted of a felony with a potential two-year sentence loses their committee chairmanship. House Rules XXIII (10) suggest that a sitting Member convicted of a felony with a potential two-year sentence should refrain from office. The House Rules state that a Member convicted of a felony with a potential two-year sentence may face imprisonment and should refrain from committee participation and voting until their presumption of innocence is restored or they are reelected. Members are advised to follow the Rules, as emphasized by the House Ethics Committee in a 2002 letter to a convicted Member awaiting sentencing. The House Rules advise that a Member convicted of a felony should refrain from committee participation and voting until their presumption of innocence is restored or they are reelected. The House Ethics Committee warned a convicted Member awaiting sentencing of potential disciplinary action for violating this provision. Each House of Congress has the authority to punish a Member for disorderly behavior and expel them with a two-thirds majority. The House traditionally waits to impose discipline on a Member until their guilt is resolved through the judicial system. Congressional inquiries can run concurrently with criminal proceedings. Certain internal congressional inquiries have been postponed or deferred at the request of the Department of Justice. The House Ethics Committee must initiate an inquiry by an investigative subcommittee whenever a Member of the House is indicted or charged with criminal conduct. The committee must empanel the investigative subcommittee within 30 days of the indictment or provide reasons for not doing so. The House Ethics Committee must initiate an inquiry when a Member of the House is indicted for criminal conduct. Members of Congress cannot be suspended from voting or participating in proceedings like appointed government officials or private professionals. The authority of either House to suspend a Member from congressional business has been questioned as it could disenfranchise the Member's constituency. In the past, Members have refrained from participating while under indictment, but this is not common practice. Conviction of a crime may lead to disciplinary action, including expulsion from Congress with a two-thirds vote. The House of Representatives can expel a Member with a two-thirds vote for crimes related to official misconduct, even before all appeals are exhausted. The House Ethics Committee automatically investigates when a Member is convicted of a felony, with each House having discretion to discipline its Members for misconduct. The House of Representatives has the authority to discipline its Members for misconduct, including expulsion with a two-thirds vote for crimes related to official misconduct. Historically, expulsion has been rare and typically involved disloyalty to the United States or criminal law violations, such as bribery. Only five Members have been expelled, with the most recent being Representative Michael J. (Ozzie) Myers in 1980 for bribery in the ABSCAM \"sting operation\" conducted by the FBI. In 1980, Representative Michael J. (Ozzie) Myers was expelled for bribery in the ABSCAM \"sting operation\" by the FBI. In 2002, Representative James A. Traficant, Jr. was expelled for federal convictions related to favors, gifts, and salary kickbacks. Some Members resigned before facing expulsion despite serious misconduct findings. Other Members recommended for expulsion for offenses like bribery and obstruction of justice also resigned. The House of Representatives has the authority to take disciplinary actions against Members for offenses like bribery and obstruction of justice, including expulsion, censure, reprimand, and fines. The House may censure or reprimand Members for conduct deemed reprehensible or discrediting to the institution, even if it does not violate any specific law or House rule. This includes cases where a Member is indicted or convicted of a felony. The United States Constitution does not allow for the recall of Members of Congress, including Senators and Representatives. Their services can be ended by resignation, death, expulsion, or finding that holding another public office is incompatible with congressional office. Recall of Members of Congress was considered during the drafting of the Constitution but was not included. The drafting of the federal Constitution did not include provisions for the recall of Members of Congress, indicating a clear intent that no such right or power existed under the Constitution. The idea of a recall provision in the Constitution was rejected, and the Supreme Court has not directly addressed the subject of recalling Members of Congress. The right to remove a Member of Congress before their term expires is exclusively held by each House of Congress as per the expulsion clause of the Constitution. State rulings have consistently found that there is no power for an electorate to recall a federal officer like a Senator or Representative. No law or rule allows for such recall. There is no law or rule allowing for the recall of a federal officer like a Member of Congress. If a Member is convicted of a crime and incarcerated, they may have to forfeit their congressional salary for the period of their absence from the House. Conviction of a felony does not disqualify a Member from being elected or reelected, except for treasonous conduct after taking an oath. A Member of Congress, other than for treasonous conduct after taking an oath, can still hold office despite censure or expulsion. Indictment or being a convicted felon does not prevent running for or being reelected to Congress if constitutional qualifications are met. Once seated, a Member may face discipline by the House but can regain full voting privileges if reelected after a conviction. The United States Constitution allows individuals under indictment or convicted felons to be elected to Congress. State legislatures cannot bar candidates based on indictment or felony convictions as the Constitution sets the qualifications for federal office. The framers intentionally kept qualifications minimal to give voters the freedom to choose their representatives. The people have the discretion to choose their representatives in Congress, with federal pensions of Members of Congress being affected if convicted of certain crimes related to national security or public corruption. Members may forfeit their federal retirement annuities upon conviction. Members of Congress may lose their federal retirement annuities if convicted of federal crimes related to national security or public corruption. Additionally, they will lose all \"creditable service\" for federal pension purposes if convicted of public corruption, fraud, or campaign finance violations while serving as a Member of Congress. The pension forfeiture provisions apply to individuals who engaged in criminal misconduct while serving as a Member of Congress, President, Vice President, or elected official at any level of government. Offenses that directly relate to official duties, such as bribery, conflicts of interest, and fraud, can result in the loss of federal retirement annuities and creditable service for pension purposes. The forfeiture provisions apply to individuals involved in criminal activities while in office, including obstruction of justice, intimidation of witnesses, RICO offenses, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and perjury. Loss of federal pension annuity and creditable service for retirement purposes is determined by the nature of the offense, regardless of resignation, indictment, conviction, or expulsion from office."
