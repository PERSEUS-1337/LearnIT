FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that the National Park Service administers Federal parks to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife for future generations. The Federal Aviation Administration manages safe airspace use, and National Park Service lands in Hawaii include historical parks. National Historical Park, Pu'u Kohola Heiau National Historic Site, Haleakala National Park, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park are managed for wilderness preservation, protecting natural, cultural, historical, and wildlife resources, and promoting public enjoyment. Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes National Parks are designated as International Biosphere Reserves by the United Nations for their significant scenery and plant and animal communities. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is also a World Heritage Site for the importance of Mauna Loa and Kilauea Volcanoes. A minimum altitude of 1,500 feet above ground level is established for aircraft flying over certain lands managed by the National Park Service to reduce auditory and visual intrusion, potential hazards to wildlife, and safety risks to pilots and passengers. Cooperation between the Federal Aviation Administration and National Park Service is required to address these issues. The National Park Service requires aircraft to fly at a minimum altitude of 1,500 feet above ground level over their lands to reduce disturbances and safety risks. Aircraft must also avoid noise-sensitive areas and maintain a distance from primary visitor use areas. The National Park Service mandates aircraft to fly at least 1,500 feet above ground level to minimize disruptions and ensure safety. Aircraft should steer clear of noise-sensitive areas and keep a distance from primary visitor use areas. The Director of the National Park Service is responsible for identifying specific areas where low-flying aircraft may impact resources and developing a reporting system for instances of low-flying aircraft over National Park Service lands. This information is then conveyed to the Federal Aviation Administration for appropriate action. The National Park Service is developing training programs and materials with the Federal Aviation Administration to recognize and report low-flying aircraft. They will also hold quarterly meetings with affected pilots to discuss resource management objectives. SEC. 3. FEDERAL AVIATION RESPONSIBILITIES. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for communicating with pilots about low-flying aircraft in specified areas and investigating instances of pilot deviations from requested minimum altitudes. The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for communicating with pilots about low-flying aircraft in designated areas, including National Park Service-administered lands. They also assist in communicating with the Department of Defense regarding military aircraft operations and provide investigation results to the National Park Service. Enlisting aviation groups' support to disseminate information on low-flying aircraft issues over National Park Service areas and participating in meetings to address these problems. SEC. 4. FLIGHT RESTRICTION DESIGNATIONS. In order to protect historical, cultural, and religious values, Kaloko Honokohau, Pu'u honua o Honaunau, Pu'u kohola Heiau, and Kalaupapa National Historical Parks are designated as noise-sensitive areas and shall not be overflown by commercial tour aircraft. Haleakala National Park is mandated to protect natural and cultural resources, including rare and endangered species, and scenic beauty. The Crater District and Kipahulu Valley in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, along with designated wilderness areas, are considered noise-sensitive due to rare and endangered species and scenic beauty. A two-mile stand-off distance is required near the Sliding Sands trailhead for visitor safety. In Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, certain areas like the coastal region between Ka'aha and Kamoamoa are noise-sensitive and should not be overflown. A 2-mile standoff distance is required around the Kilauea summit, Chain of Craters corridor, and Kamoamoa village sites where visitors gather. Additionally, aircraft flying under visual flight rules must maintain a minimum altitude of 1,500 feet over National Park System lands in Hawaii. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration will provide public notice of restrictions in appropriate publications to inform pilots. SEC. 5. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND NATIONAL PARK SERVICE JOINT RESPONSIBILITY. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Director of the National Park Service are jointly responsible for assessing impacts of aircraft operations on human, cultural, or natural resources beyond those specified in section 4. They also prepare informational materials for pilots to understand National Park Service concerns. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Park Service collaborate to understand the impact of aircraft operations on resources. They define procedures for addressing overflight issues over public land areas. SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN REGULATIONS TO CERTAIN SIGHTSEEING FLIGHTS: Parts 91 and 135 of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations apply to nonstop sightseeing flights within a 25-mile radius of the airport."
