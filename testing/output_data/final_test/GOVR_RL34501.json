    "content": "Statutory proscriptions against illegal importation of aliens into the United States date back to 1875. The modern statute prohibiting alien smuggling was first enacted in 1917 and can be found in INA \u00a7 274. It covers a broad range of activities, including smuggling aliens across the border and harboring them within the U.S. Recent legislative proposals have addressed criminal penalties for alien smuggling. In the 110th Congress, bills addressing criminal penalties for alien smuggling were considered but not enacted into law. The proposed legislation would have amended statutory provisions in the INA and Title 18 of the United States Code. Similar legislation may be considered in the 111th Congress. INA \u00a7 274 prohibits various activities related to alien smuggling, with broad language potentially criminalizing a wide range of actions. The recent legislative proposals aimed to change the current law structurally and substantively. The provisions on alien smuggling require a defendant to act with \"reckless disregard\" for the fact that an alien is in the US illegally, which involves consciously disregarding a substantial risk. This does not require actual knowledge but a gross deviation from reasonable care. A violation occurs if a defendant assists an alien when they \"should have known\" they were in the US illegally. The alien smuggling statute does not require the defendant to know that their actions violate the law, only that they know or recklessly disregard the fact that the alien is unlawfully present in the US. Bringing an alien into the US without official authorization is an offense under INA \u00a7 274(a)(2), regardless of any later official action. The term \"bringing\" is not clearly defined in the statute. The term \"bringing\" an alien into the United States is not clearly defined in the INA and has been subject to interpretation by federal courts. The Ninth Circuit has ruled that it can include activities beyond physical transport, while the Sixth Circuit has a narrower interpretation. The statute makes it an offense to bring an alien into the US at a place other than a designated port of entry, regardless of the alien's eligibility for asylum or relief from removal. The statute INA \u00a7 274(a)(1)(A)(ii) imposes criminal liability for knowingly assisting an alien in evading inspection at a port of entry, regardless of the alien's legal status. The defendant must assist the alien in furtherance of the violation against the law. The Ninth and Eighth Circuits have differing views on what constitutes a violation of transporting an alien \"in furtherance\" of their unlawful entry or presence. The Ninth Circuit considers factors like time, place, distance, and impact on the alien's violation, while the Sixth Circuit focuses on the intent of the person transporting the alien. Transporting friends, relatives, or co-workers who are unlawfully present may not necessarily be considered a violation if the intent was not to further the immigration violation. The Ninth and Eighth Circuits have differing views on what constitutes a violation of transporting an alien \"in furtherance\" of their unlawful entry or presence. The Sixth Circuit focuses on the intent of the person transporting the alien, while the Fifth Circuit has interpreted the provision broadly. The Fifth Circuit interprets the provision on \"shielding of aliens from detection\" to prohibit warning unauthorized aliens of immigration officers. Courts have also interpreted the harboring provision to include sheltering aliens with knowledge of their unlawful status, regardless of secrecy. INA \u00a7 274(a)(1)(A)(iv) criminalizes encouraging aliens to enter or reside in the US unlawfully. Providing material support for an alien's unlawful presence is considered inducement. Providing material support for an alien's unlawful presence is considered inducement, which can lead to liability. The Seventh Circuit has ruled that knowingly helping or advising an alien can be grounds for liability. INA \u00a7 274(a)(1)(A)(v)(I) criminalizes conspiracies related to bringing aliens into the US illegally or concealing them. The federal conspiracy offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7371 is not limited to the offenses enumerated in INA \u00a7 274(a)(1). It includes a provision requiring an overt act to effect the underlying offense for a violation. INA \u00a7 274(a)(1)(A)(v)(II) makes it an offense to aid and abet the acts proscribed by INA \u00a7 274(a)(1). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, a person may be punished for aiding in the commission of an offense against the United States. INA \u00a7 274(a)(3) prohibits knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens or those brought into the US in violation of the law. Despite INA \u00a7 274's broad scope, there is an exemption for religious denominations. The penalties for offenses under INA \u00a7 274 vary depending on the circumstances, such as alien smuggling in furtherance of commercial activity or causing serious injury. One exemption is for religious denominations that allow aliens to serve as ministers or missionaries as uncompensated volunteers if they have been members for at least one year. Transporting, moving, concealing, harboring, shielding, or encouraging aliens to enter the United States for financial gain can result in fines, imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both under INA \u00a7 274. Encouraging or inducing an alien to enter the United States for purposes other than financial gain, or aiding and abetting such acts, can result in fines, imprisonment for up to 20 years, or both. Knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens for employment can lead to fines, imprisonment for up to five years, or both. In cases where serious bodily injury, jeopardy to life, or death occurs during these violations, harsher penalties such as life imprisonment or death may be imposed. In cases of bringing or attempting to bring an alien into the United States, penalties include fines and imprisonment for up to one year per alien. Harsher penalties apply if the offense is committed with intent for the alien to commit a serious offense or for commercial gain, with imprisonment ranging from three to 15 years. Imprisonment for bringing aliens into the United States in violation of INA \u00a7 274(a) can range from 5 to 15 years per violation. Enhanced sentences of up to 10 years can apply in certain circumstances, such as when the offense is part of a commercial organization, or when the aliens are transported in a dangerous manner. The 110th Congress considered proposals to modify penalties for alien smuggling, with several legislative proposals receiving significant interest. Bills such as the SAVE Act and H.R. 2830 aimed to amend the INA and U.S. Code, expanding the scope of INA \u00a7 274 and adding provisions related to alien smuggling. In the 110th Congress, bills aimed to amend INA \u00a7 274 and U.S. Code, expanding its scope and adding alien smuggling provisions in Title 18. The proposed legislation would have consolidated proscribed acts into paragraphs (a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B) of INA \u00a7 274, leaving out the proscription against employing unauthorized aliens. Cross-referencing issues were not addressed in the bills. The proposed legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to amend INA \u00a7 274 and U.S. Code by expanding its scope and adding alien smuggling provisions in Title 18. The bills would have restructured the penalty provisions under INA \u00a7 274, potentially removing certain offenses from being classified as aggravated felonies. This restructuring would have also affected sentencing provisions, excluding enhancements and penalties for employing unauthorized aliens. The proposed legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to amend INA \u00a7 274 and U.S. Code by expanding its scope and adding alien smuggling provisions in Title 18. The bills would have altered the current sentencing schema in several ways, including fines, imprisonment for various durations, and penalties for specific offenses related to alien recruitment, transportation, and harboring for profit. The proposed legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to amend INA \u00a7 274 and U.S. Code by expanding its scope and adding alien smuggling provisions in Title 18.

Additionally, the legislation would affirmatively assert extraterritorial jurisdiction for acts of alien smuggling occurring outside the United States. The proposed legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to amend INA \u00a7 274 and U.S. Code by expanding its scope and adding alien smuggling provisions in Title 18. It would clarify that the full reach of the statute extends to acts committed by alien smuggling networks on the high seas and in foreign countries. Additionally, it would alter the religious denomination exemption by making it an affirmative defense, shifting the burden of proof to the defendant religious denomination.
