    "content": "Congress is considering whether to allow drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) or designate it as wilderness. Current law prohibits production in the Refuge, but high oil and gas prices have sparked debate. The House passed a bill in 2005 opening the Refuge to development, and a budget resolution may require drilling to meet targets. Land ownership and relevant laws are key to potential development. The debate over drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is complex and controversial due to land ownership, laws, and environmental protections. The focus is on the potential effects of oil and gas development on the Refuge and its wildlife. Legal issues and proposals for leasing in ANWR are discussed in this report, which will be updated as needed. The Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, spans approximately 19 million acres in Alaska. The coastal plain, rich in wildlife like caribou, polar bears, and eagles, is a focal point for potential oil drilling, sparking controversy. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1960 to protect the area's wildlife and migratory birds. The initial segregation of lands before Alaska's statehood prevented the passage of ownership of certain submerged lands within the Refuge to the State of Alaska. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971 resolved Native claims against the United States by providing land conveyance to Native groups. Regional Corporations could receive subsurface lands, but pre-1971 refuges were excluded, and in-lieu lands were substituted. Surface lands conveyed in refuges were subject to refuge-specific regulations. In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act renamed the Range to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and expanded it by 9.2 million acres. The Act designated much of the original Range as a wilderness area but postponed decisions on the development or protection of the coastal plain. Section 1002 of the Act directed a study of all resources in the coastal plain, also known as the \"1002 area.\" The Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation's three townships were excluded from the 1002 area, despite being geographically located on the coast of ANWR. In 1983, the United States and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) executed an agreement for an exchange of lands, allowing ASRC to receive the subsurface estate beneath Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation's surface lands in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This agreement was made possible by Section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which prohibited oil and gas development in the Refuge without authorization from Congress. The 1983 Agreement between the United States and ASRC allows for potential oil development on Native lands within ANWR if Congress opens the area for oil development. This could impact over 100,000 acres of Native lands, including ASRC lands and individually owned Native allotments, subject to environmental constraints and federal regulations. The 1983 Agreement between the United States and ASRC allows for potential oil development on Native lands within ANWR, subject to environmental constraints and federal regulations. ASRC agreed to be bound by regulations on federal leases to protect the environment of the coastal plain. The environmental effects of leasing in the Refuge are a key concern, with debates on the protective nature of proposed bills. Critical elements include the agency administering the leasing program and the compatibility of leasing with the Refuge's purposes. The curr_chunk discusses key considerations for administering the leasing program in the Refuge, including environmental protection standards, technology requirements, wildlife resource protections, and judicial review. It also mentions the 2,000 acre \"footprint\" limitation and compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. This section focuses on environmental constraints on federal lands, with Native lands discussed separately. The Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act clarifies that the Secretary of the Interior administers Refuge lands through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Provisions in the Act address management of refuges in Alaska, with planning governed by ANILCA. Approval of activities in refuges is subject to compatibility evaluation by the Director of the FWS. The Secretary of the Interior administers Refuge lands through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Approval of activities in refuges is subject to compatibility evaluation with major purposes of the System and the particular unit. Section 304 of ANILCA allows cooperative management agreements with Native Corporations, the state, or political subdivisions for lands near national wildlife refuges. Public lands in Alaska are generally withdrawn from federal ownership under ANILCA, but not from mineral leasing laws. The Refuge Administration Act does not withdraw non-Alaskan refuges from oil and gas leasing, but individual units are often withdrawn. In Alaska, resource management on refuge lands is supervised by the Fish and Wildlife Service, even if managed by other federal agencies through cooperative agreements. The Bureau of Land Management is also involved in managing federal lands. The Mineral Leasing Act does not specify that the Secretary of the Interior administers leasing through the Bureau of Land Management. The Fish and Wildlife Service has sole jurisdiction over wildlife conservation on refuge lands, including authority over oil and gas leasing. Drilling or prospecting on lands within a wildlife refuge requires the consent and approval of the Secretary. The Secretary's approval is required for drilling or prospecting on lands within a wildlife refuge to protect wildlife populations and habitat. Leases must adhere to stipulations set by the Fish and Wildlife Service to minimize impacts on refuge resources. The Fish and Wildlife Service sets stipulations for leasing on refuges in Alaska to ensure compatibility with refuge missions. New regulations effective from November 17, 2000, define \"compatible use\" as activities that do not interfere with refuge purposes. Native lands in Alaskan refuges are subject to special regulations on compatibility. The current bill would authorize oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge under the Mineral Leasing Act, administered by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management. The Secretary would impose environmental constraints through new leasing regulations. The Secretary would impose environmental constraints through new leasing regulations under H.R. 6, with the role of the FWS not yet clear. The assignment of responsibility for studying the coastal plain area under ANILCA to the USGS was found unlawful in 1981, as the Refuge Administration Act requires administration through FWS. H.R. 6 assigns leasing responsibilities to the BLM \"in consultation with the Director of FWS,\" potentially divorcing mineral development from wildlife purposes and expertise of FWS personnel. This may result in less protection for the coastal plain of ANWR compared to other lands. The bill assigns leasing responsibilities to the BLM, potentially reducing protection for the coastal plain of ANWR compared to other lands. FWS retains authority to manage and protect Refuge resources, but the legislation's intent is unclear. Clarification on jurisdiction between BLM and FWS may come as the bill evolves. The leasing program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is deemed compatible with refuge purposes, eliminating the need for further compatibility determinations. However, questions remain about regulating impacts on federal and Native lands. H.R. 6 uses \"no significant adverse effect\" as the standard for guiding leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, similar to the standard used in the National Environmental Policy Act. This phrase has been used in past legislation and agreements related to leasing in the area. The standard of \"significant adverse effects\" in leasing decisions for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge may allow considerable environmental harm before crossing the threshold. Congress has used different, more protective language in other legislation, such as ensuring maximum protection of surface values in environmentally sensitive areas. In the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Congress may authorize new leasing with a protective standard requiring the use of the best commercially available technology for oil and gas operations. This standard would not infringe upon existing mining rights and aims to preserve and manage the area effectively. The best commercially available technology standard for oil and gas operations in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not currently used in the U.S. Code and lacks judicial interpretation. It may be a more lenient standard compared to other technology standards in the Clean Water Act. Section 2203(a)(2) directs that this standard should ensure fair market value for mineral resources to be leased, but the impact of this requirement is unclear. H.R. 6 provides specific environmental protections but leaves much to the discretion of the Secretary. The Secretary's environmental choices may be difficult to overturn due to stringent provisions on judicial review. Section 2207(a)(3) of H.R. 6 imposes a 2,000 acre limitation on surface area for production and support facilities on the Coastal Plain, excluding elevated structures like pipes. The 2,000 acre limitation on surface area for production and support facilities on the Coastal Plain may need to be changed if a greater footprint is necessary for oil development. Facilities could be scattered over a larger area and connected by pipelines and roads, impacting a much larger area. Oil and gas facilities could also be constructed on Native lands in the Refuge, free of the 2,000 acre limitation. The Secretary, in consultation with Alaska, Kaktovik, and North Slope Borough, can designate up to 45,000 acres of the Coastal Plain as \"Special Areas\" for special management and protection. Closure to leasing is discretionary, with the option to allow leasing without surface occupancy. Consultation with FWS is not required, allowing state and local entities to advise on designation and protection. A 45,000-acre limit is set for Special Areas out of 1.5 million coastal plain acres. The Secretary is directed to designate the Sadlerochit Spring area (approximately 4,000 acres) as a Special Area for protection of its unique wildlife and resources. The closure authority in the bill is the sole source of closure authority, potentially affecting closures under the Refuge Administration Act. Seasonal closures may be implemented at the Secretary's discretion. The Secretary may use lease terms to close portions of the Coastal Plain on a seasonal basis to protect wildlife, including caribou calving areas. It is unclear what would justify seasonal closures or if they would count towards acreage limitations. Environmental regulations under H.R. 6 are also discussed. The Secretary may use lease terms to close portions of the Coastal Plain on a seasonal basis to protect wildlife, including caribou calving areas. Environmental regulations under H.R. 6 require regulations for leasing the coastal plain within 15 months of enactment, with the first lease sale to be held within 22 months. The regulations must include protections for fish, wildlife, habitat, subsistence resources, and the environment. Terms and conditions on leases will address environmental concerns, but the overall impact of these provisions is unclear. The provisions in H.R. 6 include environmental protections for leasing the coastal plain, with requirements for reclamation to support prior land uses or higher economic uses. Compliance with all applicable environmental laws is also mandated. The legislation requires compliance with Federal and State environmental laws, with protective standards as effective as those set forth in the 1987 Environmental Impact Statement for the Coastal Plain. Some measures may condone certain activities, but the new leasing standards must be at least as effective as the 1987 measures. The legislation mandates compliance with Federal and State environmental laws, with standards as stringent as those in the 1987 Environmental Impact Statement for the Coastal Plain. Additional guidance may clarify infrastructure topics and guide development on federal and Native Lands in the Refuge. Site-specific analyses are required to assess the effects of drilling on fish and wildlife, with a preference for avoiding adverse effects. Plans to mitigate any significant adverse effects must be developed in consultation with relevant agencies. The legislation mandates compliance with Federal and State environmental laws, with stringent standards similar to those in the 1987 Environmental Impact Statement for the Coastal Plain. Plans to mitigate significant adverse effects must be developed in consultation with relevant agencies, such as the FWS. Exploration activities are limited to winter and supported by ice roads, with the Secretary having the authority to allow other exploration if no significant adverse effects are found. Specific controls for roads, transportation, and air traffic disturbance are not specified, relying on the Secretary's interpretation and wording of any prohibitions. The regulations depend on the Secretary's interpretation and wording of prohibitions, including requirements for \"appropriate\" controls on explosives, sand and gravel extraction. H.R. 6 does not specifically address penalties for lease violations, but the MLA allows for cancellation of leases and civil/criminal penalties for violations. Fines and imprisonment may apply for infractions on refuge lands. Beginning in the sixties, concern grew regarding the protection of marine mammals, including the polar bear. In 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was enacted. In 1973, an international agreement on polar bear conservation was developed by the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Agreement, ratified by the United States in 1976, prohibits the \"take\" of polar bears, defined as \"hunting, killing, and capturing.\" Five exceptions to this prohibition are outlined in Article III, including traditional take by nationals, scientific purposes, and conservation purposes. The Agreement on polar bear conservation prohibits the \"take\" of polar bears, with exceptions for traditional, scientific, and conservation purposes. Parties must protect polar bear habitat and manage populations based on sound conservation practices. Critics raise concerns about oil and gas development in the Arctic potentially violating the Agreement by causing harm to polar bears. The MMPA allows unintentional taking of polar bears incidental to lawful activities. The draft report questions compliance with the Agreement if lethal take occurs under incidental take authority. However, the Agreement only refers to intentional take, so regulating incidental take may not be inconsistent with the Agreement. The State Department presented the Agreement to the President for transmission to the Senate, stating that the MMPA could implement its terms. However, opening ANWR to leasing and development could potentially violate the pledge to protect the bear ecosystem, leading to a policy argument against such activities. The commentator suggests that leasing in the polar bear protection zone may conflict with the Agreement or the MMPA, requiring amendments. The Agreement does not allow incidental take, which is authorized under the MMPA. Amendments are needed to prohibit lethal takes from activities like oil and gas operations to align with the Agreement. Takes by harassment could still be permitted under the MMPA. There are no specific environmental requirements in H.R. 6. H.R. 6 includes specific environmental requirements for activities like port facilities, disposal of wastes, and water sources. The FWS role is unclear, with decisions left to the Secretary and BLM Director. Judicial review of their choices may be challenging due to strict standards. Penalties under the MLA would be relied upon, but it is uncertain how violations in refuges would be addressed. Section 2203(b) of H.R. 6 would repeal \u00c2\u00a7 1003 of ANILCA, allowing oil and gas development on federal Refuge lands and Native lands within the Refuge. Native lands in the Refuge, totaling over 100,000 acres, have not been extensively discussed in terms of leasing impacts. Separate environmental controls would apply to Native oil exploration under a 1983 Agreement. Under a 1983 Agreement, separate environmental controls would apply to Native oil exploration activities in ANWR. Statutory and regulatory leasing requirements designed to protect wildlife and the coastal plain would apply to development and production of ASRC oil. Native individuals and Native Village and Regional Corporations have various interests relevant to the issue of oil drilling in ANWR, stemming from the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) enacted in 1971. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) granted selection rights to surface estate to lands near villages, allowing villages in or near refuges to select surface lands to maintain traditional ways of life. The Kakovik Inupiat Corporation (KIC) received selection rights to three townships in the Refuge. ANCSA also created Regional Corporations with subsurface rights to some lands and either surface rights or full title to others, typically beneath Village Corporation lands. Subsurface rights in pre-1971 National Wildlife Refuges were not available, but in-lieu selection rights were provided as substitutes. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) granted selection rights to surface estate to lands near villages, allowing villages in or near refuges to select surface lands to maintain traditional ways of life. Wildlife Refuges did not offer subsurface rights, but in-lieu selection rights were provided as substitutes. The interests of Regional Corporations in economic development may conflict with Village Corporations' use of surface estate for traditional activities. ANILCA followed up on ANCSA, designating the \"coastal plain\" of the Refuge for specific purposes. The boundaries of the KIC lands within the Refuge were depicted on a map without clear explanation, raising questions about their significance. The map also showed the designated \"wilderness\" area of the Refuge, but has since disappeared. Another map from 1980 showed the KIC land boundaries crossed out by hand, without clarification on the authority or purpose of these markings. Section 103(b) of ANILCA authorized the publication of a map and legal description of each change in land management status, with only minor boundary adjustments allowed. The map published with the notice of the legal description of the boundaries of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge shows the wilderness area, coastal plain, but not the native lands. The coastal plain, published on April 19, 1983, excludes the three ANCSA-authorized townships of KIC lands. The KIC lands are geographically on the coastal plain and important to the wildlife of the area. The subsurface was still federal and subject to federal regulation, even though the surface estate had been conveyed to Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation. Under ANILCA, KIC obtained rights to a fourth township in the 1002 area, totaling approximately 92,160 acres. These lands are subject to restrictions on oil and gas development and laws governing the Refuge. Under ANILCA, KIC obtained rights to a fourth township in the 1002 area, totaling approximately 92,160 acres, subject to restrictions on oil and gas development. Section 1431(o) of ANILCA authorized ASRC to obtain subsurface rights beneath the KIC lands in ANWR upon certain events, with regulations governing any oil and gas development. Under the 1983 Agreement, ASRC received subsurface rights beneath the KIC lands in ANWR, with regulations governing oil and gas development. The 1983 Agreement granted ASRC subsurface rights under KIC lands in ANWR for oil and gas development, subject to specific regulations and environmental protections. The agreement did not fall under ANILCA regulations but included detailed provisions on exploration and environmental issues, governed by contract law. ASRC agreed to abide by Refugeregulations with additional terms specified in the agreement. The Chandler Lake Agreement granted ASRC the right to drill up to three exploratory wells on KIC lands outside the 1002 area, with results kept confidential. Full oil and gas development was prohibited until Congress opened the coastal plain. The Barrow Gas Field Transfer Act of 1984 addressed North Slope issues and exchange agreements involving Point Barrow gas fields. The 1984 agreement refers to the ASRC/ANWR Agreement and ratifies land exchanges and agreements. Lands received by ASRC are considered obtained through an ANCSA exchange. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that lands and interests received by Arctic Slope Regional Corporation are treated as lands received under section 22(f) exchanges, allowing for the applicability of certain provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The floor debates in Congress focused on Barrow gas provisions and exchange agreements related to ASRC lands received under the 1983 Agreement. The Department of the Interior negotiated with Native corporations and oil company partners for exchanges in ANWR, raising questions about the validity of such exchanges and their impact on Congress' authority to decide on leasing oil and gas resources in the coastal plain. In 1988, Congress amended the general exchange authority in ANILCA to prevent any more exchanges related to the oil and gas resources of the coastal plain of ANWR without prior approval by Act of Congress. The House Report emphasized Congress' control over the decision to open the Refuge for oil and gas development. The House Report emphasized Congress' control over the decision to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and gas development, stating that the Secretary of the Interior does not have the authority to exchange lands within the coastal plain of ANWR without Congressional approval. Congress reserved the sole prerogative to decide if ANWR would be opened for oil and gas development, as stated in Section 1003 of ANILCA. The 96th Congress did not intend for the Secretary's general exchange authority to apply to the coastal plain of ANWR. The House Report emphasized Congress' control over the decision to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and gas development, stating that the Secretary of the Interior does not have the authority to exchange lands within the coastal plain of ANWR without Congressional approval. The Report discussed the Department's assertion of complete authority to trade away oil and gas rights, conduct exploratory drilling, and waive rights without Congressional approval. It mentioned negotiations with Alaska Native groups for exchanges and a conditional auction for oil and gas rights in the coastal plain of ANWR. The new provision, Title II and section 201, aims to maintain the status quo and allow Congress to decide the future of the coastal plain. The House Report emphasized Congress' control over the decision to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and gas development, stating that any exchanges or conveyances involving lands in the coastal plain require Congressional review and approval. Congress has reserved the right to decide on oil and gas leasing in ANWR, as reiterated in both the House and Senate reports. The 1988 amendment to ANILCA emphasized Congress' control over opening ANWR for oil and gas development, ensuring Congressional review and approval for any exchanges or conveyances in the coastal plain. The amendment's direction that no more lands could be conveyed in the coastal plain reflects a balance between different interpretive choices in statutory construction. The 1988 amendment to ANILCA emphasized Congress' control over opening ANWR for oil and gas development, ensuring Congressional review and approval for any exchanges or conveyances in the coastal plain. Congress reserved the authority to make decisions regarding oil and gas development in the area, leading to the legislation that no further conveyances could occur without Congressional authorization to preserve its view of \u00a71003 of ANILCA. This later enactment and its reasons are important in interpreting any modification of the reservation of authority for Congress to decide on oil and gas development in the coastal plain. Public Land Order 6959 withdrew lands to allow KIC to complete its selections in the Refuge, providing flexibility in choices. A larger quantity of lands than KIC's entitlement was made available, based on an agreement prior to the Order. KIC was required to file a selection application and prioritize land choices for conveyances. In addition to KIC and ASRC Native lands, there are individual Native \"allotments\" in the Refuge, with some approvals and conveyances completed while others are pending approval. BLM has completed many allotments and applications for lands in vital wildlife areas along the coast and near Sadlerochit Spring. Allotments range up to 160 acres each, with 9,797 acres conveyed and 1,719.66 acres pending approval. Mineral estate status needs to be checked for previous statute conveyances. Nonmineral lands are not available for selection. The Alaska Native Allotment Subdivision Act authorizes the subdivision and dedication of \"restricted lands\" with the same effect as if held in unrestricted fee simple title, facilitating development once the Refuge is opened. H.R. 6 would authorize the conveyance of final land selections to KIC, in accordance with the 1993 Agreement. The 1993 Agreement directs the conveyance of selected lands to ASRC, with environmental constraints on Native lands being a key concern for oil development activities in the coastal plain/1002 area. It is unclear how these constraints will apply to Native lands within the Refuge, raising questions about the overall effects of oil development on the Refuge. The Native property interests in the coastal plain and Refuge include KIC's surface estate, ASRC's subsurface rights, and individual allotments. ASRC has rights to the subsurface beneath KIC lands and allotments, governed by the 1983 Agreement. The 1983 Agreement governs the rights to the subsurface estate on ASRC lands, allowing for the use of surface as necessary for mineral extraction. Development activities on ASRC lands must comply with statutory and regulatory requirements to protect wildlife and the environment. The 1983 Agreement governs the rights to the subsurface estate on ASRC lands, allowing for the use of surface as necessary for mineral extraction while complying with environmental protection requirements. The agreement also includes provisions to protect wildlife, habitats, and the environment of the coastal plain and ASRC lands. The 1983 Agreement governs the rights to the subsurface estate on ASRC lands, allowing for the use of surface as necessary for mineral extraction while complying with environmental protection requirements. H.R. 6 leaves much to be fleshed out by the Secretary of the Interior in new leasing regulations for the Refuge, potentially superseding provisions in the 1983 Agreement on oil exploration. The 1983 Agreement governs the rights to the subsurface estate on ASRC lands for mineral extraction while complying with environmental protection requirements. H.R. 6 may potentially supersede provisions in the Agreement on oil exploration, specifically regarding the approval process for a \"plan of operations\" for ASRC exploration. This process involves resolving disagreements between the Regional Director of Fish and Wildlife Service and ASRC, with the possibility of obtaining a court order restraining implementation of the plan. The 1983 Agreement governs mineral extraction rights on ASRC lands while complying with environmental protection requirements. H.R. 6 may supersede provisions in the Agreement on oil exploration, specifically regarding the approval process for a \"plan of operations.\" ASRC will have the right to implement the plan unless the United States obtains a court order restraining it. This could impose a burden on the US to control adverse effects of oil and gas exploration on Native lands. Some Agreement provisions may be outdated, such as those regarding waste disposal in reserve pits and ponds. The 1983 Agreement addresses mineral extraction rights on ASRC lands, including provisions on oil exploration and waste disposal. H.R. 6 may supersede some Agreement provisions, potentially allowing practices that are not acceptable today, such as pollution and facility siting. The Agreement also covers the use of explosives, aircraft, fires, disposal of gray water, incineration, and extraction of sand and gravel. The relationship between H.R. 6 and the 1983 Agreement with ASRC is not clarified. H.R. 6 does not clarify how it relates to the 1983 Agreement with ASRC regarding environmental constraints on oil and gas exploration activities. Specific issues, like the 2,000 acre surface footprint limitation on the Coastal Plain, are unclear. ASRC agreed to abide by statutory and regulatory requirements to protect wildlife and habitat in the Agreement. The 2,000 acre surface footprint limitation on the Coastal Plain is unclear in relation to ASRC lands. Development on ASRC lands may be subject to this limit, but it may not apply to Native lands outside the defined Coastal Plain. Previous Congresses have addressed oil development in the Coastal Plain. Some bills in previous Congresses have addressed oil development-related activities on Native lands within the Refuge, setting out development limitations and specifications. Section 22(g) constraints apply to both KIC and ASRC lands, subjecting them to laws and regulations governing ANWR. In 1973, analysis of how \u00a722(g) might apply to Native lands in a refuge concluded that separate regulations were appropriate for public lands and Native lands. The latter regulations should reflect the conveyance of Native lands under ANCSA to meet the economic and social needs of Natives with their maximum participation. This interpretation was confirmed by certain aspects of ANILCA, specifically in \u00a7103(c). The Department of the Interior concluded that special regulations for Native lands in refuges were appropriate before the enactment of the Barrow statute in 1984. Separate compatibility regulations for lands subject to \u00a7 22(g) were developed, including land-use stipulations in exchanges like the ASRC exchange. The ASRC exchange and other exchanges had land-use stipulations to clarify activities on Native lands. Compliance with laws and regulations could impose constraints on Native lands, with special regulations developed. Regulations permit uses that do not impair refuge values. Compatibility regulations for \u00a722(g) lands require determinations in compliance with stated requirements. The regulations require refuge managers to work with landowners on \u00a722(g) lands for compatibility determinations within 90 days of a request. If a finding of not compatible is likely, the landowner will be notified. Refuge managers will notify landowners if a finding of not compatible is likely and encourage dialog for modifications. Uses proposed by landowners will be allowed if deemed compatible with refuge purposes. Compatibility determinations focus on how the proposed use impacts refuge purposes, excluding the National Wildlife Refuge System mission. Conflicts between pre-ANILCA and ANILCA purposes will prioritize the latter. Landowners can appeal a determination of not compatibility to the Regional Director within 45 days. The appeal must be submitted in writing within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the determination. Compatibility determinations for proposed uses of 22(g) lands will only evaluate the effects on adjacent refuge lands, not on the 22(g) lands themselves. Determinations for compatible uses of 22(g) lands are not subject to re-evaluation unless there are significant changes or new information, or if requested by the landowner. Refuge comprehensive conservation plans will not include 22(g) lands, and special use permits will not be required for compatible uses of 22(g) lands. Special use permits are not required for compatible uses of 22(g) lands. Compatibility determinations for existing uses will be re-evaluated when conditions change significantly or every 10 years. Refuge managers can re-evaluate the compatibility of a use at any time. For uses authorized for longer than 10 years, compliance will be examined during compatibility re-evaluation. After November 17, 2000, no uses will be permitted or re-authorized for longer than 10 years unless modifications to terms and conditions are allowed for compatibility. The Service will request changes if necessary to ensure compatibility and will make new determinations before extending long-term permits. The 1983 Agreement and regulations allow for a wide range of development on KIC and ASRC lands unless new leasing provisions supersede them. H.R. 6 states oil and gas leasing in the Refuge is compatible with its purposes, potentially impacting regulation under \u00a722(g). Allotments are lands with Native American ownership, with the U.S. typically retaining mineral rights beneath them. The surface of allotments in the Refuge is non-federally owned and can be developed for oil and gas. ASRC received the subsurface beneath most allotments in the Refuge and agreed to comply with regulations for development. The size and location of allotments are important in assessing the potential impacts of oil development on the coastal plain and the Refuge. BLM advises on conveyed and approved allotment acres in the Refuge, with regulations for valid existing rights and inholdings in environmentally sensitive federal conservation units. Congress authorizes mineral leasing and regulations for existing mining rights in national parks. P.L. 108-337 allows subdivision and virtual management. H.R. 6 does not address allotments within the Refuge, and does not place time limitations on activities on Native lands leading to oil and gas development. It is unclear if ASRC must wait for federal leasing regulations before moving forward with the 1983 Agreement. The 1983 Agreement allows for oil companies to potentially start development on Native lands immediately. H.R. 6 exempts certain provisions of ANILCA for rights-of-way for oil and gas transportation across the Coastal Plain. However, the legislation does not explicitly address access for oil and gas development. Terms and conditions must ensure minimal impact on fish and wildlife during transportation. The rights of way language in H.R. 6 only addresses oil and gas transportation via pipelines, not access to areas or other forms of rights of way needed for oil development. The bill does not cover situations like drilling pads or other oil structures requiring a right of way or easement. The bill H.R. 6 only addresses oil and gas transportation via pipelines, not access to areas or other forms of rights of way needed for oil development. Ambiguities remain regarding managing/permitting authority for non-pipeline rights of ways used in leasing activities. Provisions in ANILCA and the Refuge Administration Act may come into play depending on the interpretation of management division between BLM and FWS. The management division between BLM and FWS may impact rights of way regulations. H.R. 6 does not address access to Native inholdings in the Refuge, but ANILCA grants access rights to inholders. The Secretary can provide permits or easements in the Refuge System, subject to regulations. The ANILCA access provision may not apply to access easements within the RefugeSystem. Oil from ANWR could be exported through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, but ANWR leases would prohibit the export of oil produced under the lease. Questions arise about the adequacy of the existing environmental impact statement for development in ANWR. A court ruling in 1991 determined that a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) or a new EIS should be prepared before development in the 1002 area of ANWR. Congress has found the 1987 EIS adequate for the leasing program, eliminating the need for an update. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to prepare an EIS for other actions. The Secretary is directed to prepare an EIS for actions other than regulations, focusing on leasing limitations and preferred alternatives. Public comments on the preferred action must be submitted within 20 days, with analysis to be completed within 18 months for the first lease sale. The analysis for the first lease sale must be completed within 18 months of enactment, with compliance satisfying all requirements for consideration and analysis of environmental effects. Section 2207(b)(1) of H.R. 6 requires a site-specific analysis for drilling activities, potentially necessitating an EIS. H.R. 6 aims for prompt leasing program implementation and expedites judicial review, with a requirement to seek review within 90 days of the challenged action. Section 2208 of H.R. 6 outlines the procedures for challenging actions of the Secretary related to leasing titles. It specifies the courts where challenges can be filed and limits the scope of review to ensure compliance with the act. The Secretary's identification of a preferred course of leasing action and analysis of environmental effects are presumed correct unless proven otherwise by clear and convincing evidence. Debates over leasing in the ANWR also involve the disposition of revenues, with questions about Congress providing for a different split than the 90/10 percent mentioned in the Alaska Statehood Act. Certain western states receive 50% of revenues directly under the Mineral Leasing Act. Certain western states receive 50% of revenues directly under the Mineral Leasing Act. An additional 40% goes to those states indirectly through irrigation projects. Alaska initially received only 37.5% of federal leasing revenues but later received an additional 52.5% share, totaling 90% of revenues. Amendments were made to the MLA to include Alaska and direct payment of 90% of revenues to the state. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1976 was amended to direct 90% of revenues to Alaska, clarifying that the state should always receive this amount. There is a debate over whether this provision can be changed, with Alaska arguing it is a compact with the federal government. Alaska sued the United States, claiming breach of contract under the Statehood Act regarding mineral leasing and revenue sharing. The court ruled that Congress could amend the Mineral Leasing Act, affecting Alaska as well. The court ruled that the United States did not promise in the Statehood Act to make federal mineral lands productive of royalty revenues for Alaska, granting the government's motion for summary judgment on the takings claim. This case addressed the power of the United States to pay administrative costs before dividing MLA revenues with Alaska, suggesting that Congress may legislate specially as to ANWR and prescribe changes to revenue shares under a particular statutory leasing regime. Congress has the flexibility to prescribe different revenue-sharing provisions for oil and gas leasing in ANWR. Revenues could be divided as currently provided under the MLA or go to the U.S. Treasury, or be divided in another way specified by Congress. Issues may arise due to the wording of current bills. The current bills regarding oil and gas leasing in ANWR raise questions about revenue sharing. Section 2203(a) of H.R. 6 places the leasing program under the MLA, but \u00a7 2209 mandates that 50% of revenues go to Alaska. The validity of this revenue splitting language overriding the Alaska Statehood Act is unclear. If struck down, severability issues could arise, potentially affecting the entire bill. Section 2212 of H.R. 6 establishes a Local Government Impact Aid and Community Service Assistance Fund capped at $11 million, with $5 million authorized for appropriation each fiscal year. If Congress deems this provision invalid, the entire title could be at risk."
