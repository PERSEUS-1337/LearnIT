    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Supercomputer Post-shipment Verification Act of 1999\". The Congress finds that the Secretary of Commerce must verify digital computers with a theoretical performance over 2,000 MTOPS exported from the US to specified countries. These countries are identified as \"Computer Tier 3\" eligible countries in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Secretary of Commerce verifies high-performance computers exported to Computer Tier 3 countries for national security reasons. A report identified 390 high-performance computers exported between November 1997 and November 1998. The report identified 286 supercomputer exports requiring post-shipment verification, with 190 involving exports to China where verifications were not allowed. This lack of verification raises concerns about the potential military or proliferation use of these computers. SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998. The Secretary of Commerce must submit an annual report on post-shipment verifications for exports, including details such as destination country, date of export, intended end use, and verification results. Moratorium on Export of Supercomputers Until Post-Shipment Verifications Have Been Conducted for specified time periods and performance thresholds. The export of digital computers with a theoretical performance of over 2,000 MTOPS is prohibited to countries that have not undergone post-shipment verification for specified time periods and performance thresholds. SEC. 4. REPORTS. The Secretary of Commerce must submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services regarding the results of post-shipment verifications conducted to fulfill specific requirements. The report should include a list of items exported to the country in question, along with details such as date of export, intended end use, and results of the verification. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services regarding the impact on national security of exporting digital computers with a theoretical performance of over 2,000 MTOPS to Computer Tier 3 eligible countries. The report is due within 120 days of the enactment of the Act and must be submitted in both classified and unclassified form."
