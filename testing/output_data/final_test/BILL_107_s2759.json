    "content": "The \"Seafood Safety Enforcement Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings of the Act are also outlined. Chloramphenicol, a potent antibiotic, can have severe toxic effects in humans, including irreversible and fatal hypo-aplastic anemia. It is only used in life-threatening situations when other drugs are not effective. Despite not being approved for food-producing animals in the US due to health concerns, countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and China use it in aquaculture. The US imports a large amount of shrimp annually, with Thailand and Vietnam being top exporters, and China being the fifth largest. In 2002, the European Union and Canada restricted seafood imports from nations with chloramphenicol detection. The US FDA inspects only 2% of seafood imports and cannot detect chloramphenicol below 1 part per billion. Independent testing in Louisiana found chloramphenicol in crawfish from China at over 2 parts per billion. Imports of seafood from nations using banned substances pose threats to US consumers. Denial of contaminated products by EU and Canada may redirect them to the US. Immediate action needed to enforce import restrictions and protect consumers. SEC. 3. CONTAMINATED SEAFOOD. Section 801 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include provisions for refusing admission of seafood containing certain substances or originating from specific exporters or countries. Section 801 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to allow the Secretary to permit individual shipments of seafood into the United States if evidence shows it does not contain certain substances listed in regulations. Countries or exporters can be removed from the list if they prove the substances are no longer in use. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to allow the Secretary to permit individual shipments of seafood into the United States if evidence shows it does not contain substances that could contaminate food-producing animals in the country at issue. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE FOR REFUSING ENTRY OF SEAFOOD FROM A COUNTRY OR EXPORTER. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue guidance if an exporter or country is identified as a source of articles subject to refusal under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Criteria for this determination may include substance detection by the Secretary or authorized individuals. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue guidance based on findings from inspections, detection of substances in seafood shipments, and other evidence. An annual report will be provided to Congress listing countries and exporters subject to the guidance. This Act does not limit the existing authority of the Secretaries. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services or Treasury can refuse admission of any article under section 801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF TOLERANCES: The Secretary of Health and Human Services must notify specific committees before issuing a tolerance for certain substances. SEC. 6. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Section 801 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended by redesignating subsections and inserting new subsections in various paragraphs.
