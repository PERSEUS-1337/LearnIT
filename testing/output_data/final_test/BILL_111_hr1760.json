    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Black Carbon Emissions Reduction Act of 2009\" and pertains to black carbon emissions. The Congress finds that black carbon is a significant contributor to global warming, especially impacting snow and ice-covered surfaces like the Arctic and Tibetan Plateau. It is a pollutant with a short atmospheric residence, making it crucial for immediate policy action to mitigate global warming and abrupt climate change. Black carbon is not explicitly regulated as a global warming agent under US law or international agreements. The US has reduced black carbon emissions, but more action is needed. Governments should support technological innovation to reduce black carbon emissions from industrial activities, vehicles, agriculture, and residential sources. Black carbon exposure poses a serious health threat globally. Immediate and significant public health benefits can be achieved by reducing black carbon emissions. Taking cost-effective actions to reduce emissions will help protect areas threatened by warming, such as the Arctic. The purposes of this Act include reducing black carbon emissions, identifying ways to achieve further reductions, and protecting areas affected by black carbon, like the Arctic. The Administrator, in consultation with other Federal agencies, must submit a report to Congress on black carbon emissions within a year of this Act's enactment. The report will include an inventory of major sources of black carbon emissions in the US and globally, estimating current and future emissions. The report to Congress on black carbon emissions will cover major sources, current and future emissions, net climate forcing, control technologies, and potential metrics for quantifying climatic effects. The report to Congress will include recommendations on emissions monitoring techniques, technologies to reduce black carbon emissions, and additional actions to address public health and environmental benefits. The Administrator will propose regulations under the Clean Air Act to reduce black carbon emissions within one year of the Act's enactment, considering public health and environmental impacts. Final regulations must be promulgated within two years. The Administrator will propose regulations under the Clean Air Act to reduce black carbon emissions within one year of the Act's enactment, considering public health and environmental impacts. Final regulations must be promulgated within two years. Additionally, a report on US assistance to foreign countries for black carbon mitigation will be transmitted to Congress, along with recommendations for emission reductions. To reduce black carbon emissions in foreign countries, promote sustainable solutions by providing clean, efficient stoves and fuels to residents of developing countries reliant on solid fuels. Key regions and partners will be identified for large-scale demonstration efforts. Developing large-scale implementation strategies in key regions to reach 20,000,000 homes over 5 years. Goals include increasing stove efficiency by over 50%, reducing black carbon emissions by over 60%, and decreasing severe pneumonia in children under 5 by over 30%. The curr_chunk discusses various strategies to reduce black carbon emissions, including technological improvements to diesel engines, reducing biomass and fossil fuel burning, and improving compliance with existing laws. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. Authorization of appropriations is authorized to carry out this Act."
