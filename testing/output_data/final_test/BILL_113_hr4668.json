The Secretary of the Interior shall convey lands to BSNC for potential lease to the Coast Guard at no cost, as charged against BSNC's entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Secretary of the Interior may convey lands to BSNC for potential lease to the State, allowing the State to choose between receiving the surface and subsurface estates of tract 2 and tract 6 or leasing them at no cost. The State must notify the Secretary of its choice. The State must notify the Secretary of its choice in writing, relinquishing its selection of lands in tract 2 and tract 6. Upon meeting all conditions, the Secretary will convey the surface and subsurface estates of tract 2 and tract 6 to the State if chosen.

The State will determine the location of the right-of-way in consultation with the Coast Guard and BSNC to ensure compatibility with infrastructure development on Point Spencer. Upon meeting conditions, Tract 5 will be conveyed to the BSNC. Upon meeting all conditions and certification of clean-up and remediation of tract 5, the Secretary of the Interior will convey all rights to the BSNC for the surface and subsurface estates of tract 5.

No public access easements will be reserved by the United States for the conveyed land. The United States will retain authority over archaeological resources in the conveyed land, including enforcing the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The BSNC must submit a map to the Secretary of the Interior indicating areas where the Secretary will enforce certain Acts. Upon receiving the map, the Secretary will cease enforcing these Acts on land outside of the specified areas in tract 5. The BSNC must provide a corporate resolution to the Secretary of the Interior within 120 days for any land leased or conveyed to them under the Act.

Upon completion of the conveyances, the portion of the Parcel conveyed to BSNC will be charged against the remaining entitlement. The conveyance of tracts 2 and 6 to BSNC and the State will be charged against their remaining entitlements under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska Statehood Act, respectively. Clean-up and remediation of hazardous materials on the Point Spencer Parcel will be performed as required by law. The Point Spencer Parcel will undergo clean-up and remediation according to Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation standards for industrial land. Any non-threatening contamination will be monitored regularly. Tidelands and submerged lands near Point Spencer were likely transferred to the State of Alaska under specific acts. The Statehood Act of 1958 authorizes the Secretary to install structures in Point Spencer's tidelands and submerged lands. The Act does not affect the ownership of these lands by the State. A Joint Management Plan will be developed by the Secretary, the State, and the BSNC for the use and management of the lands. The Joint Management Plan, required under the Statehood Act of 1958, will be updated annually for the first 5 years and biennially thereafter."
