    "content": "The \"Regulatory Time-Out Act of 2011\" aims to ensure regulations protect public health, welfare, safety, and the environment while promoting economic growth and job creation. Congress must ensure regulations reflect this balance. The \"Regulatory Time-Out Act of 2011\" defines key terms like \"agency,\" \"time-out period,\" and \"covered regulation\" which focus on the impact of regulations on businesses and the economy. The \"Regulatory Time-Out Act of 2011\" outlines criteria for regulations that have a significant impact on the economy, environment, public health, safety, or government budgets. The \"Regulatory Time-Out Act of 2011\" defines a proposed regulation as a regulation that has not taken effect before September 1, 2011, and does not apply to regulations required by law. The Act does not apply to covered regulations or proposed regulations required by law. During the time-out period, covered regulations that were in effect before the Act are treated as if they never took effect, and prospective regulations cannot take effect. Proposed regulations published before the Act with open comment periods are treated as if they were never published, and no new proposed regulations can be published during the time-out period. The head of an agency may exempt a covered regulation from certain provisions if necessary for health or safety, law enforcement, job creation, economic growth, or regulatory streamlining. The agency head can exempt regulations for health, safety, law enforcement, job creation, economic growth, or regulatory streamlining. Any exempted regulation must be submitted to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget within 10 days. The agency head cannot delegate this exemption authority. The agency head has the authority to exempt regulations for various reasons, but cannot delegate this exemption authority."
