SEC. 503 of the \"Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993\" establishes a uniform indoor air policy for public facilities. SEC. 503 of the \"Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993\" mandates a uniform indoor air policy for public facilities, requiring the prohibition of environmental tobacco smoke emissions within the facility and on facility property near the entrance, along with clear signage of the prohibition. The \"Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993\" mandates a uniform indoor air policy for public facilities, prohibiting environmental tobacco smoke emissions within the facility and on facility property near the entrance, with exceptions for specially designated smoking areas that meet ventilation requirements. The \"Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993\" requires public facilities to have designated smoking areas that meet ventilation standards to prevent air recirculation and protect nonsmoking individuals. Responsible entities can request waivers from compliance under unusual circumstances. The Administrator may grant a waiver for facilities unable to comply with smoking regulations, requiring them to protect nonsmokers to the maximum extent possible for up to 1 year. Petitions for waivers and actions taken will be published in the Federal Register, and an annual report on granted waivers will be submitted to Congress. \"SEC. 504.

Legal actions can be brought in a district court where the defendant resides or does business, with jurisdiction to enforce section 503 and impose civil penalties. In a legal action under this section, a court may award costs of litigation, including attorney and expert witness fees, to a prevailing plaintiff if deemed appropriate. SEC. 505 states that this title does not override any other laws protecting from environmental tobacco smoke. SEC. 506 allows the Administrator to issue necessary regulations.
