    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act\" aims to prevent unconscionable pricing of gasoline and other petroleum distillates during emergencies. The Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act prohibits selling gasoline or petroleum distillates at unconscionably excessive prices during an energy emergency, indicating unfair advantage. The President can issue an energy emergency proclamation for specific areas where this prohibition applies. The President can issue an energy emergency proclamation specifying the geographic area, type of fuel, and duration of the proclamation, not exceeding 30 days but renewable. Factors considered in determining violations include selling gasoline or petroleum distillates at excessive prices during an energy emergency. During an energy emergency proclamation, violations may occur if a seller charges significantly higher prices for gasoline or petroleum distillates compared to their usual prices or prices offered by competitors in the same area. During an energy emergency proclamation, violations may occur if a seller charges significantly higher prices for gasoline or petroleum distillates compared to their usual prices or prices offered by competitors in the same area. The pricing should reasonably reflect additional costs or risks incurred and be substantially influenced by market conditions. Additionally, the quantity of fuel produced, distributed, or sold in the affected area during a 30-day period following the proclamation is also a factor to consider. During an energy emergency proclamation, it is unlawful to report false pricing information related to gasoline or petroleum distillates to a Federal agency. The term \"wholesale\" refers to truckload or smaller sales of gasoline or petroleum distillates. During an energy emergency proclamation, reporting false pricing information for gasoline or petroleum distillates to a Federal agency is prohibited. The term \"wholesale\" refers to truckload or smaller sales of gasoline or petroleum distillates, excluding transactions on futures markets. \"Retail\" sales include end users like motorists, agriculture, industry, residential, and commercial consumers. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. Enforcement of section 2 of the Act by the FTC includes treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts, with enforcement actions prioritizing companies with significant sales of gasoline and petroleum distillates. Civil penalties apply to those who violate the Act with actual or implied knowledge. Any person who violates section 2 of the Act with actual or implied knowledge shall be subject to penalties, including fines of up to 3 times the profits gained or $3,000,000 for price gouging, and a civil penalty of up to $1,000,000 for providing false information. Penalties will be obtained in a similar manner as civil penalties under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, penalties for violations include fines up to 3 times the profits gained or $3,000,000 for price gouging, and a civil penalty of up to $1,000,000 for providing false information. Each day of a continuing violation is considered a separate offense, and the seriousness of the violation and efforts to remedy the harm caused are taken into account when assessing penalties. SEC. 4 outlines criminal penalties for violating section 2, with fines up to $150,000,000 for corporations and up to $2,000,000 for individuals, along with possible imprisonment for up to 10 years. Enforcement can only be done through a criminal action brought by the Attorney General or other Department of Justice officer. A State can bring a civil action in federal court to enforce the Act's provisions or impose civil penalties when residents' interests are threatened by violations involving retail sales. The State must notify the Federal Trade Commission before initiating the action, providing a copy of the complaint if feasible. If not, notice must be given immediately upon filing the action. The Federal Trade Commission can intervene in a civil action brought by a State under the Act, allowing them to be heard on all matters and file petitions for appeal. The attorney general of a State can still conduct investigations and compel witnesses in such actions. In a civil action under the Act, venue is determined by where the defendant operates, is authorized to do business, or is found. Process serving is not limited by district or state boundaries. Individuals involved in the alleged violation can be joined in the action regardless of their residence. State actions are limited if the Federal Trade Commission has initiated a civil or administrative action for Act violations. (g) Enforcement of State Law: An authorized State official can enforce civil or criminal statutes of the State in State court, regardless of any ongoing actions by the Federal Trade Commission or other agencies. SEC. 6. LOW INCOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE.\n\nFines and penalties collected under this Act will go into the Consumer Relief Trust Fund for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n\nSEC. 7. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\n\nThis Act does not limit the Federal Trade Commission's authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act or preempt State laws. Attest: LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
