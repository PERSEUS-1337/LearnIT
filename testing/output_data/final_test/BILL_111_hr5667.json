    "content": "The \"Firearms Microstamping Evaluation and Study Act of 2010\" aims to conduct a study on microstamping technology in firearms to determine its feasibility as a cost-effective law enforcement tool. The study will also assess the costs of implementing this technology and its reliability when non-metallic materials are used in cartridge cases. The Attorney General will arrange a study with the National Research Council to examine the design parameters and costs of implementing microstamping technology in firearms. The study will investigate the feasibility of implementing microstamping technology in firearms to identify make, model, and serial numbers on cartridge casings when a semiautomatic pistol is discharged. It will also assess how repeated firing affects the quality and legibility of microstamping impressions on cartridge cases. The study aims to determine the feasibility and cost of implementing microstamping technology in firearms to imprint legible markings on cartridge casings. It will also investigate casing recovery methods, the additional manufacturing cost, and the effectiveness of microstamping in different countries. The study focuses on microstamped firearms and the effectiveness of microstamping in investigating crimes. It includes data on the types of firearms sold in the US annually, the percentage of crimes committed with different types of firearms, and the recovery of spent shell casings at crime scenes. It also explores whether microstamping would lead to a shift in firearm use to avoid identification. The curr_chunk discusses factors that can alter identifying marks on cartridge cases, database management improvements needed for microstamped firearms, and legal issues at Federal and State levels. The curr_chunk discusses the storage, retrieval procedures, cost, and resources needed for a national microstamping identification program, including retrofitting firearms with microstamped parts. The curr_chunk focuses on the cost and feasibility of implementing microstamping technology in firearms, including the potential expenses for firearm owners and law enforcement agencies. It also considers the effectiveness of state-based or centralized microstamping systems in creating a database of firearms owners. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison between federal and state law enforcement methods for identifying spent projectiles, specifically looking at NIBIN versus State-based microstamping initiatives. SEC. 4. CONSULTATION. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences shall consult with various officials and experts in budgeting, administering, and using ballistic imaging systems, law enforcement officials, entities affected by microstamping technology, and experts in ballistics imaging and microstamping. Experts in ballistics imaging, microstamping, and related fields, including the Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners, projectile recovery system manufacturers, and universities like the University of California at Davis, are consulted by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences will submit a report to the Attorney General on the study results within 30 days. Federal funds for microstamping technology cannot be used by a State until the report is completed and transmitted to Congress, with waiver authority granted by the Attorney General for national interest purposes. The Act defines \"microstamping technology\" as imprinting unique identifiers on firearm parts, \"handgun\" and \"rifle\" are defined as per Title 18, US Code. The Act defines terms related to firearms, such as \"cartridge case,\" \"manually operated handgun,\" \"manually operated rifle,\" \"semiautomatic handgun,\" and \"semiautomatic rifle\" as per section 921(a)(7) of title 18, United States Code. The term \"projectile\" refers to the part of ammunition expelled through a firearm barrel by an explosive. A \"revolver\" is a firearm with a rotating cylinder containing chambers discharged successively through a common barrel."
