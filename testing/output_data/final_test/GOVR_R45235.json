    "content": "The U.S. Virgin Islands, located east of Puerto Rico, consist of three main islands - St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John. St. Thomas is the capital and center for tourism, while St. John is mostly covered by the Virgin Islands National Park. St. Croix serves as the agricultural and manufacturing hub. Water Island is a smaller fourth island in the USVI. The British Virgin Islands are located east and slightly north of the USVI. The Virgin Islands, including Tortola and St. John, were discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493. Columbus named St. Croix as Santa Ursula and the surrounding islands as \"las once mil V\u00edrgenes,\" which later became known as the Virgin Islands. The Spanish crown controlled trade in the Caribbean until the mid-1500s. By the mid-1500s, merchants and privateers from France, England, and Holland traded with colonists in the Caribbean who were unhappy with Spanish rules. Spanish galleons carrying goods and gold attracted privateers and pirates. The Spanish focused on the South American mainland and larger Caribbean islands, leaving the Lesser Antilles to others. Control of islands like the Virgin Islands shifted among European powers due to peace treaties that didn't always apply in the New World. In 1672, the Royal Danish West Indian Company took control of St. Thomas and established plantations. The Danish West Indian Company took control of St. Thomas, expanded to St. John and purchased St. Croix. Sugar production was the main economic sector during Danish colonial rule. A free trading policy was established in 1754, but economic conditions slowed in the 1830s. A slave revolt in 1848 led to the abolition of slavery, causing the Virgin Islands' economy to decline due to competition from other Caribbean ports and lower sugar prices. The U.S. government purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917 for strategic reasons, just before entering World War I. Naval officers administered the islands and made improvements in public health, water supply, and education. In 1931, governance responsibilities were transferred to the U.S. Department of the Interior. Efforts to revive sugar production and convert failing plantations into smallholder homesteads were largely unsuccessful. Rum distilling became a growing source of manufacturing employment after the end of Prohibition in 1933. Manufacturing employment has declined in recent years, with the closure of watch assembly plants and a bauxite processing plant on St. Croix. A large bauxite processing plant was built on St. Croix in the early 1960s but closed in 2000. Hess Oil partnered with a Venezuelan oil company to build a major oil refinery, known as HOVENSA, which closed in 2012. Tourism became a major economic activity in the U.S. Virgin Islands after the 1959 Cuban Revolution. The cover over of federal taxes on rum has been a significant revenue source. Median household income in the USVI is lower than on the U.S. mainland, with higher poverty rates. In 2009, median household income in the US Virgin Islands was $37,254, 75% of the mainland estimate. Household income distribution skewed towards lower brackets compared to the US total. GDP per capita is another measure of economic activity. The US Virgin Islands' GDP may not accurately reflect local incomes due to large flows of repatriated earnings, leading to its inclusion on the EU's list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions. Despite objections from the USVI government, the European Council has kept the USVI on the list. Per capita GDP trends from 2004 to 2015 are shown in Figure 1, with Florida and Louisiana also impacted by major hurricanes. The US Virgin Islands' economy heavily relies on tourism, with a significant number of cruise and airplane passengers visiting each year. However, the tourism sector faced challenges after the 2017 hurricanes, which caused damage to many hotels and resorts. Despite this, there are signs of recovery in the tourism sector, although it may take time to fully rebound. The tourism sector in the US Virgin Islands is showing signs of rebounding after the 2017 hurricanes, but it may take years to fully recover. Manufacturing in the islands has declined, with only two rum distilleries playing a significant economic role, employing around 600 people. The Cruzan distillery has been present since the 18th century and was sold to Fortune Brands in 2008, while the Diageo distillery was built in 2008 as part of an agreement with the territorial government. In 2012, the USVI government modified the agreement with Cruzan to increase subsidies and marketing expenses. The agreements with the Virgin Islands Government, Diageo, and Fortune Brands included $3.7 billion in subsidies and tax exemptions over 30 years, funded through bonds securitizing excise taxes on rum sales. The USVI government committed to ongoing production and marketing subsidies from these revenues, with a bar on seeking reductions in rum subsidies. Federal excise taxes on rum imported into the US from the USVI and Puerto Rico are rebated to the respective governments. The HOVENSA oil refinery in the US Virgin Islands shut down in 2012 due to large losses. It was a joint venture between Hess Oil and Petr\u00c3\u00b3leos de Venezuela. The USVI government received $220 million from the bankruptcy agreement, used to cover the budget deficit. Limetree Bay purchased some HOVENSA facilities to build an oil storage facility employing about 80 people initially. The HOVENSA oil refinery in the US Virgin Islands shut down in 2012, leading to a renovation of the complex that is three-quarters complete. The island's economy has shifted away from agriculture, with most food and molasses for rum production being imported. High electricity costs hinder economic development, with residential customers paying 40 cents per kWh and commercial rates at $0.47/kWh. Island power systems face higher costs due to the lack of gas pipelines or extensive electric grids. The U.S. Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (VIWAPA) supplies electricity and water, primarily using oil and diesel for power generation. Efforts to transition to propane and natural gas are underway, with some units modified to use these fuels. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar account for 8% of VIWAPA's peak demand capacity. The USVI government faces fiscal challenges, with public debts totaling about $2 billion, significantly high compared to other U.S. subnational governments. The U.S. Virgin Islands government faces fiscal challenges with high public debts totaling about $4 billion, leading to concerns about solvency, growth prospects, federal tax law changes, and Medicaid funding. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded the islands' debts, suggesting a need for restructuring. The government has been shut out of capital markets since 2017, affecting its ability to roll over maturing debt. The U.S. Virgin Islands government faces fiscal challenges with high public debts totaling about $4 billion. In August 2017, then-Governor Mapp suspended communications with credit ratings agencies, leading to a drop in USVI's credit ratings. The closure of the HOVENSA refinery in 2012 also impacted the economy. The closure of the HOVENSA refinery in 2012 led to job losses and a contraction of the USVI tax base. Governor Mapp proposed fiscal measures to address structural deficits, including issuing bonds to cover budget shortfalls. However, the bond issue was postponed and then cancelled, leaving the government with limited liquidity resources. In January 2017, Governor Mapp suggested tax increases, revenue collection enhancements, and public spending reductions to strengthen public finances. The governor proposed tax increases, revenue collection enhancements, and public spending reductions to address structural deficits. A package of tax measures, including higher taxes on various items, was enacted in March 2017. However, doubts were expressed about the effectiveness of these fiscal measures in restoring access to capital markets and addressing funding shortfalls. Governor Mapp also announced a revenue anticipation note, but its issuance was suspended. The form of USVI's public debt service limits options for policymakers. Governor Albert Bryan Jr. succeeded Mapp in January 2019. Governor Albert Bryan Jr. stabilized government operations and finances in his first year in office after the USVI was hit by two powerful hurricanes in September 2017, causing extensive damage. Hurricane Irma was one of the strongest and costliest hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin, passing directly over St. Thomas and St. John, while Hurricane Maria hit St. Croix before devastating Puerto Rico. In November 2017, the USVI government estimated uninsured hurricane damage exceeding $7.5 billion. Disaster declarations enabled federal assistance through the Stafford Act, including grants, loans, and direct aid from FEMA, U.S. Corps of Engineers, and U.S. Coast Guard. Other forms of assistance included loans and grants to individuals and small businesses. The USVI government and hospital authorities received Community Disaster Loans on January 3. The USVI government and hospital authorities received Community Disaster Loans (CDLs) on January 3, 2018, totaling $10 million for the government with a 20-year term. CDLs aim to provide liquidity to local governments facing revenue declines post-disasters. USVI's public revenues were halved after hurricanes, leading to additional funding for disaster relief through supplemental appropriations. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provided the USVI with extra Medicaid funding, including $107 million for the Medicaid program. On September 30, 2019, an additional $107 million was provided for the USVI Medicaid program, with $35.6 million available subject to certain requirements. The FMAP was raised from 55% to 100% for both USVI and Puerto Rico Medicaid programs. House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey introduced H.R. 5687 on February 4, 2020, which includes provisions for additional resources to territories like the USVI. The House passed the measure on February 7, 2020, but the Administration threatened to veto it. Hurricanes Irma and Maria severely damaged VIWAPA's transmission and distribution lines, with 93% of USVI customers having power restored by January 2018. The U.S. Virgin Islands action plan estimated $2.3 billion in infrastructure needs, with HUD allocating $67.7 million for enhanced electrical power systems. Governor Bryan requested further assistance from HUD. Governor Bryan requested $350 million from HUD for strengthening the grid and lowering electricity costs in the US Virgin Islands. $774 million in mitigation funds were allocated, but HUD prohibited their use for disaster risk reduction in power systems until further notice. The US Virgin Islands government requested $350 million from HUD to improve the electrical power systems. However, HUD prohibited the use of $774 million in mitigation funds for this purpose until further notice. VIWAPA's financial challenges, including slow payments from the government and cash flow issues, hinder its ability to enhance resiliency and meet federal funding matching requirements. The UVSI legislature allocated $22.2 million for hospitals to pay outstanding obligations to VIWAPA. USVI policymakers have expressed concerns over VIWAPA's financial stability in 2018 and 2019. Delegate Stacey Plaskett urged Governor Bryan and USVI Senate President Francis to declare a state of emergency due to the territory's \"energy crisis.\" Governor Mapp's FY2019 budget proposals aim to extend the solvency of USVI public pension systems, postponing projected insolvency from 2024 to 2025. Measures outlined in the proposals are expected to delay insolvency for three more years. The budget also includes lifting a hiring freeze and anticipates additional revenues from expanded federal reimbursement for health programs and recovery-related investments. Despite decreased tourist traffic, accommodation tax collections are projected to remain below pre-hurricane levels in FY2019, impacting the tourism-dependent USVI economy. The US Virgin Islands heavily rely on tourism and related businesses, making them vulnerable to hurricanes. Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector declined significantly after hurricanes in 1995 and 2017, taking about six years to recover. Construction sector saw some growth post-disasters, but tourism sector employment remains below pre-2017 levels as of December 2019. The US Virgin Islands experienced a decline in tourism employment after hurricanes in 2017, with some hotels remaining closed. Construction-related activity increased slightly post-disasters, but the full economic recovery may take years due to the severity of damage. Cruise ship and air passenger arrivals also saw fluctuations, with some recovery in recent years. The economic effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria on the US Virgin Islands (USVI) are evident in initial unemployment claims data, with a significant uptick post-disasters. The job loss percentage (-7.8%) following the hurricanes was higher than during the Great Recession in New York City. Many young professionals and healthcare workers have left the USVI for positions on the mainland, complicating recovery efforts in the healthcare sector. Tracking the progress of USVI economic recovery is challenging due to limited federal statistical data for U.S. territories. The Virgin Islands Bureau of Economic Research reports on economic, tourism, and population trends in the USVI. Congress may need to consider legislation for disaster assistance programs and fiscal challenges. USVI policymakers have opposed using PROMESA provisions due to borrowing cost concerns. USVI lacks access to federal Bankruptcy Code for debt restructuring. Congress may need to consider proposals to lower energy costs for the US Virgin Islands by supporting initiatives such as constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facility. This could lead to lower energy prices and increased use of renewable energy sources. However, significant financial commitments would be required, which may challenge the fiscal capacity of the USVI government and VIWAPA.

However, significant financial commitments would be required, which may challenge the fiscal capacity of the USVI government and VIWAPA. Additionally, Congress may need to expand oversight of federal agencies administering disaster assistance programs to ensure timely receipt of funds and reevaluate the rum cover-over program's structure for public benefit. Advocacy for changes in the cover-over program in US Virgin Islands may require Congress to initiate alterations. Congress has the option to support economic and social development through various tax and social program rules, some of which treat USVI differently than states."
