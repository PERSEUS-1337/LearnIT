    "content": "Effective January 1, 1996, section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 is amended to establish a milk price support program for calendar years 1996 through 2002. During 1996-2002, milk prices in the 48 contiguous States for cheese production will be supported. The support price for cheese milk will start at $10.00 per hundredweight in 1996 and decrease by 10 cents per hundredweight annually until 2002. Milk used for nonfat dry milk or butter will not receive support. The support price for cheese milk purchases will be based on the price in effect for the preceding calendar year. Sales for export under the dairy export incentive program will not be considered as Commodity Credit Corporation purchases. Support rate adjustments will be effective from 1996 to 2002 based on milk and milk product purchases by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Secretary may decrease the price support for cheese milk if milk purchases exceed 1,500,000,000 pounds. The adjustment will be effective for the applicable calendar year. Refunds for reductions in assessments from 1995 will be provided by the Secretary. During 1995, producers can receive a refund if they did not increase marketings compared to 1994. In 1996, there will be a price reduction for all milk produced and marketed in the 48 contiguous States. In 1996, there will be a price reduction for all milk produced and marketed in the 48 contiguous States. The reduction amount will compensate for refunds made in the previous year. Enforcement includes collecting and remitting the reduction to the Commodity Credit Corporation as prescribed by the Secretary. Penalties apply for non-compliance. The Secretary may enforce penalties for non-compliance with recordkeeping requirements, with a civil penalty determined by the quantity of milk involved and the support rate in effect. The program authorized by this section will be carried out through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The program authorized by this section will be effective from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2002. Section 102 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 regarding Milk Manufacturing Marketing Adjustment is repealed. Establishment of a Class IV account. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a special milk marketing order to equalize returns on milk used in the 48 contiguous States for Class IV final products. The Secretary will determine a milk equivalent value per hundredweight for Class IV final products each month based on average wholesale market prices. The Administrator of the special Class IV account announces the monthly Class IV differential, which is the difference between the support rate for milk and the Class IV price. The Administrator also determines the amount of milk produced and marketed for commercial use in making Class IV final products. The Administrator of the special Class IV account calculates the amount of milk used for Class IV final products, multiplies it by the Class IV differential, and prorates it among the total milk produced and marketed for commercial use in the 48 contiguous States. (c) Account Obligations.--Each person making payment to a producer for milk produced in the 48 contiguous States shall collect and remit the Class IV differential proration amount to the Administrator of the special Class IV account. Producers marketing their own milk or dairy products to consumers must also remit to the Administrator. The Administrator of the special Class IV account receives payments based on the quantity of milk marketed by producers. They distribute proceeds to those using skim milk and butterfat for Class IV products proportionally. The Secretary of Agriculture appoints an Administrator for the Class IV account to oversee revenue distributions and enforce collection of required amounts. Penalties are imposed for non-compliance with payment and recordkeeping obligations. The Secretary may enforce civil penalties for violations related to milk quantity based on support rates. Regulations for the Class IV account will be issued without notice and comment requirements. Milk marketing orders are defined as orders issued under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Effective January 1, 1996, each marketing order for milk and its products must include skim milk and butterfat used for butter, nonfat dry milk, and dry whole milk as a Class IV classification under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The Dairy Export Incentive Program is outlined in Section 3. Section 153 of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to update the export incentive programs, including the export bid program and the price equalization program. Amendments are made to subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) to reflect these changes. The price equalization program under Section 153 of the Food Security Act of 1985 shall make payments to the Administrator of the Class IV account. The Administrator can request price equalization payments on a quarterly basis. The price equalization program under Section 153 of the Food Security Act of 1985 makes payments to the Administrator of the Class IV account based on the difference between the support rate for milk and the average Class IV price. The Corporation is restricted from making payments that violate trade agreements during a 12-month period starting on July 1. Payments under the export bid program are counted once for consistency with any quantitative obligations. The price equalization program, operated under rules issued by the Secretary, prioritizes funds for the export bid program and requires documentation of milk equivalent exports. The amendments will be effective from January 1, 1996. Consolidation and reform of federal milk marketing orders. The Secretary of Agriculture will invite proposals to consolidate and reform Federal milk marketing orders, including regulating all milk under either a Federal or State order. A hearing will be conducted to consider these proposals, with manufacturing grade producers receiving pool proceeds from Class III and Class IV sales only. The Secretary will have 90 days after the hearing to determine the consolidation of the orders. The Secretary of Agriculture will determine the consolidation of Federal milk marketing orders within 90 days based on the hearing record. Congress suggests consolidating orders to between 8 and 14."
