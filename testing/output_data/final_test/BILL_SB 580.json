    "title": "SB 580",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 54237 of the Government Code is amended to prioritize the disposal of surplus residential property by offering it first to former owners, then to low or moderate-income occupants who have lived there for two years, and finally to occupants with five years of residence and household income below 150 percent of the area median income. A single-family residence cannot be offered to present occupants who are not the former owners if they have had an ownership interest in real property in the last three years. Single-family residences offered to present occupants must be sold at an affordable price, not less than the agency's acquisition cost but not exceeding fair market value. If sold below fair market value, the selling agency must impose restrictions to ensure housing remains available to low or moderate-income individuals. The Department of Housing and Community Development provides recommendations for pricing and restrictions. The selling agency must adhere to pricing standards and criteria for single-family residences offered to present occupants. Repairs or replacement dwellings may be provided as required by lenders or government housing assistance programs. The selling agency must verify income and assets of present occupants when offering single-family residences at below fair market value. Verification procedures follow guidelines similar to those used by the California Housing Finance Agency and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Income and asset limitations do not apply to sales described as mitigation measures in an environmental study initiated before this measure was enacted. The surplus residential properties not purchased by former owners or present occupants are offered to housing-related entities at a reasonable price for rehabilitation and use as affordable housing. Public entities must dedicate profits from subsequent sales to affordable housing construction in specific areas. The entity must develop the property as limited equity cooperative housing for present occupants, or as low and moderate income rental or owner-occupied housing if cooperative development is not feasible. The price should be set to provide affordable housing for current tenants and low to moderate-income individuals. The selling agency must impose terms and restrictions to ensure that residential property offered below fair market value remains available to low or moderate-income individuals. The Department of Housing and Community Development will provide recommendations for pricing and conditions. If a property is a historic home, it must first be offered to a housing-related public entity or a nonprofit dedicated to rehabilitating and maintaining historic homes for public use. A historic home is defined as single-family surplus residential property listed on the California Register of Historical Resources, the National Register of Historic Places, or the local register by January 1, 2015. SEC. 2. Section 54237.7 of the Government Code is amended to read: 54237.7. The Department of Transportation shall deposit proceeds from surplus residential property sales into the SR-710 Rehabilitation Account for repairs. Funds exceeding $500,000 will be transferred to the State Highway Account for projects in specific areas. Projects in Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, and the 90032 postal ZIP Code will be selected and prioritized by affected communities in consultation with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Eligible projects include sound walls, transit improvements, bikeways, pedestrian enhancements, signal synchronization, and street resurfacing. The funds cannot be used for the North State Route 710 tunnel. The final payment for property repairs, minus federal reimbursements, will be transferred to the State Highway Account for specified purposes. The net proceeds from surplus residential property sales at an affordable price will be deposited into the Affordable Housing Trust Account for the benefit of low and moderate-income individuals in specific areas. The California Housing Finance Agency will use the funds for authorized activities. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the sale of historic properties in the State Route 710 corridor due to unique circumstances. This act is an urgency statute for immediate implementation."
