    "content": "The Physician Workforce Enhancement Act of 2009 is also known as the Hospital Residency Loan Program under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will establish a loan program by January 1, 2010, to provide loans to eligible hospitals for residency training programs. Hospitals must submit an application approved by the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration. Eligibility criteria include a preference for rural and small urban areas. An eligible hospital for a loan under this program must meet criteria such as not operating a residency training program, having accreditation by relevant bodies, and providing assurances to the Administrator. The hospital must use the loan for establishing a physician residency training program in specific medical specialties, and enter into an agreement with the Administrator. The Administrator certifying the hospital will ensure loan repayment as per subsection (e). Preference is given to rural or small hospitals for loans. Funds must be used for residency training program costs. Repayment of loans for eligible hospitals under subsection (e) must be in accordance with a repayment plan agreed upon by the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration. Repayment must commence within 18 months of loan disbursement and follow a schedule approved by the Administrator. The loan repayment period is 24 months after commencement, and if a residency training program is canceled, the loan must be repaid within 45 days. No interest is charged on the loan, and there is a limitation on the total loan amount. The loan amount for eligible hospitals is capped at $1,000,000. Penalties will be imposed for violations, and reports on program efficacy must be submitted annually. The program increased the number of practitioners in medical specialties serving underserved populations. $25,000,000 is authorized for loans from 2010 to 2020, with funds remaining available until expended. Repaid loan amounts are credited back for program use. The loan program under this section will terminate on December 31, 2019. Repaid amounts will be credited to the general fund in the Treasury."
