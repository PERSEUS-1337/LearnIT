    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cumberland Island Preservation Act\" and pertains to the Cumberland Island National Seashore and Cumberland Island Wilderness in Georgia. Boundary Adjustments for Land Exchange: The proposed land exchange will exclude conveyed lands from the boundaries of the Cumberland Island Wilderness and include acquired lands to be managed as part of the wilderness area designated by Public Law 97-250. The Secretary of the Interior will adjust the boundaries of the Cumberland Island Wilderness to include acquired lands in a land exchange negotiation with the Nature Conservancy and High Point, Inc. The main road at Cumberland Island National Seashore, listed on the register of national historic places, will be preserved. The main road and spur road at Cumberland Island National Seashore are essential for accessing natural, cultural, and historical resources. However, their inclusion in the national historic places register and Cumberland Island Wilderness creates conflicting management mandates for the Secretary of the Interior. Exclusion of these roads from the wilderness area is proposed to address this issue. The Secretary of the Interior excludes certain areas from the Cumberland Island Wilderness and potential wilderness area. This exclusion does not affect the main road's historic register status or the Secretary's authority to impose restrictions to minimize impacts. Additionally, funds will be used to restore Plum Orchard Mansion. The Secretary of the Interior will restore Plum Orchard mansion at Cumberland Island National Seashore to its original condition and may accept donations for the restoration. A maintenance agreement will be sought for the mansion after restoration, and a comprehensive plan for repair and restoration must be submitted to Congress within 180 days. The Secretary of the Interior will restore Plum Orchard mansion at Cumberland Island National Seashore to its original condition with necessary appropriations authorized. Additionally, archaeological sites on Federal land will be identified and protected, and a plan will be implemented to preserve national historic sites within the seashore. A parcel of Federal lands within the seashore will be designated as a wilderness area in line with the Wilderness Act. The Cumberland Island National Seashore, comprising approximately ____ acres on the southern portion of Cumberland Island, is designated as wilderness and part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Secretary of the Interior will administer the designated parcel in accordance with the Wilderness Act and adjust the boundaries of the Cumberland Island Wilderness. The wilderness area designation is subject to valid existing rights and uses. The designated wilderness area shall be subject to valid existing rights and pre-existing uses."
