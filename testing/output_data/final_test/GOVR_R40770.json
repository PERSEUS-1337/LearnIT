    "content": "The federal budget deficit reached $1.4 trillion in FY2009, exceeding $1 trillion for the first time and remaining above that mark for the next three fiscal years. To assess the deficit accurately, it is more meaningful to measure it relative to gross domestic product (GDP). Deficits since 2009 have been unusual but not unprecedented, with figures above 10% of GDP in 2009, 9% in 2010, 8% in 2011, and 7% in 2012. Prior to 2009, the deficit had not surpassed 7% of GDP since 1946. Federal budget deficits lead to an increase in the publicly held federal debt. The FY2009 deficit of 10% of GDP caused the debt-to-GDP ratio to rise by 12.6 percentage points, increasing the debt from 41% of GDP in 2008 to 73% in 2012. The current policy debate on the \"fiscal cliff\" raises questions about managing the deficit's magnitude and its risks to the economy. Balancing deficit reduction against the risks of continuing a large deficit is crucial for fiscal sustainability. Some economists worry that rising public debt may become unsustainable if private investors lose confidence in the government's ability to repay or finance it without causing inflation. Unsustainability occurs when debt grows faster than the economy. A country cannot sustain increasing debt faster than economic growth, leading to debt service consuming more national income. If investors see no policy changes to control debt, they will flee, causing a \"debt spiral\" with higher yields, deficits, and borrowing. This unsustainability can trigger rapid default or hyperinflation as investors fear being left with the debt. Investors may accept large deficits temporarily if they believe the government will reduce them in the future. Historical examples show that large deficits can be financed during wartime with the expectation of a rapid decline post-war. The willingness to accept deficits depends on the current debt level relative to GDP. The United States had a good starting position in 2001 after reducing debt to GDP by 16 percentage points between 1993 and 2001. The United States had a good starting position in 2001 after reducing debt to GDP by 16 percentage points between 1993 and 2001. The increase in debt in 2012 brings federal debt as a share of GDP to its highest level since 1950, but it remains below three-quarters of its World War II peak. Financial market measures do not show widespread concern about potential U.S. default, as Treasury yields have gone down instead of up despite the deficit increasing. Yields have been below 3% for the first time since the 1950s, indicating market fears of default. Credit default swaps for U.S. Treasuries rose during the financial crisis but implied a low probability of default. Investors believe future deficits will be reduced to sustainable levels. Financing the historically large deficit this year is partly due to unique economic conditions following the post-war recession in 2007. Investors have shown a \"flight to quality\" by seeking the safest assets like Treasury securities during the financial crisis. While there is no widespread concern about government borrowing sustainability, there is a risk of rising interest rates if deficits remain unsustainable. Investor behavior suggests belief in policy steps to reduce the deficit, but there is no guarantee the government will take necessary actions. The United States may face higher interest rates due to perceived default risk, leading to larger policy changes. Predicting a \"tipping point\" for investor confidence is challenging, with varying acceptable debt levels among countries. Advanced economies like the U.S. are seen as more capable of sustaining higher debt levels compared to developing countries. Comparing the U.S. to other advanced economies can provide insight into its public debt sustainability. Comparing the United States to other advanced economies like Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, all of which faced fiscal and financial crises, reveals that high debt levels do not necessarily cause crises. Countries like Iceland, Ireland, and Spain had low government debt levels before the crisis and only accumulated high debt levels as a result of the crisis. This was due to factors such as declining revenue, increased social insurance outlays, and government support for the banking system. High public debt levels before a crisis may not accurately predict future crises. In 2007, Italy and Greece had high public debt levels before the crisis, suggesting a link between high debt and crises. However, Japan had the highest debt among advanced countries but maintained low borrowing costs due to high national saving rates. The US had above-average debt levels in 2007 and 2012 compared to other countries, but not as high as the highest debt countries. The debt to GDP ratio in the United States and many other countries is higher today than in 2007, except for Greece and Japan. The eurozone crisis countries experienced a debt spiral, with markets perceiving them as having little sovereign risk before the financial crisis but significantly more afterward. Loss of confidence leads to a vicious cycle where investors demand higher yields on government debt. The higher yields on government debt can cause a sudden spike in deficits, leading to a country swinging from stability to crisis quickly. Since 2008, many countries have seen GDP shrink for three or more years, exacerbating budget deficits. Countries needing assistance to finance deficits share similarities with the United States, such as large budget deficits, net foreign debt, asset bubbles, and government outlays for financial sector turmoil. However, the US differs in its reputation for fiscal responsibility. The United States is distinguished by factors such as fiscal solvency, a large economy, a flexible exchange rate, and being the world's \"reserve currency\" and \"safe haven.\" Treasury securities are seen as a riskless asset internationally, which could lead to prolonged financing of unsustainable deficits. However, if confidence is lost, there could be a significant shift out of Treasury securities. Sustaining budget deficits at 2009-2012 levels would cause the national debt to continually rise relative to GDP. Policy changes may be necessary to address this issue. The deficit has decreased from 10% to 7% of GDP without policy changes, and it is expected to continue falling due to improving business cycle conditions and \"real bracket creep.\" CBO projects deficits to be less than 3% of GDP after 2013 under current law, indicating a sustainable path. However, this projection assumes differences from current policy. Projections assume key differences from current policy: tax provisions expire, spending reductions proceed, AMT patches not extended, Medicare cuts take place. Deficits would be higher if assumptions changed. Under its Alternative Fiscal Scenario, CBO projects deficits to remain at least 4.2% of GDP, leading to a persistent increase in debt. Policy changes are necessary to stabilize debt levels, with annual deficits not exceeding 3\u00bd% of GDP in 2015 and 2016, and 2\u00be% from 2019 onwards. Variations in GDP growth and interest rates could impact the sustainability of deficits. Under the Alternative Fiscal Scenario, CBO projects deficits to remain high, requiring policy changes to stabilize debt levels. Deficits need to be reduced to 3\u00bd% of GDP in 2015 and 2016, and 2\u00be% from 2019 onwards. Long-term projections show increasing deficits due to rising Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid spending. Reducing the growth rate of healthcare costs is crucial for long-term fiscal sustainability. In the long term, reducing healthcare cost growth below the economy's growth rate would have the largest impact on the budget deficit. Despite low interest rates, debt service payments have been relatively low in recent years. However, financing the deficit may become more costly once economic conditions normalize, leading to a significant rise in debt service costs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a rise in the interest rate paid on government debt over the next 10 years, potentially increasing the budget deficit by $100 billion to $500 billion per year. Concerns have been raised about the government's reliance on foreign investors to finance the federal debt, making the United States vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. Foreigners currently hold over $5.3 trillion of the federal debt. Foreigners currently hold $5.3 trillion of the total privately held federal debt, making them less willing to passively buy and hold federal debt due to exchange-rate risks. A decrease in foreign demand for Treasury securities could lead to significantly higher interest rates for Americans. J.P. Morgan estimates a 20% decline in foreign demand would raise Treasury yields by 0.5 percentage points, potentially impacting U.S. income. Foreigners increased their net purchases of Treasury securities during the financial crisis, showing willingness to maintain their holdings. However, the sustainability of foreign borrowing is subject to the same rules as government borrowing, with the net debt owed to foreigners unable to rise indefinitely. The sustainability of government borrowing is a concern as the net debt owed to foreigners cannot indefinitely rise faster than GDP. The current account deficit has decreased relative to GDP since 2007, but it is uncertain if this change is temporary or long-lasting. The upward trend in the net debt owed to foreigners raises worries about the long-term sustainability of large-scale borrowing from abroad. Foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasury securities have significantly increased from $0.6 trillion to $3.9 trillion from 2001 to 2012, complicating the continued willingness of foreign investors to hold these securities. Foreign governments may accumulate official reserves for various reasons, such as preventing currency appreciation, investing windfall from export surges, guarding against future investment withdrawals, or rebuilding reserves after defending their currency. These motivations do not imply a permanent desire to continuously accumulate Treasury securities. Foreign governments holding large portfolios of federal debt have an incentive to maximize returns, leading to a dilemma for policymakers on reducing the deficit. Selling holdings individually could hinder collective action to stabilize Treasury prices. The risk of entering a debt spiral depends on the sustainability of the deficit size and its impact on the economy. The risk of entering a debt spiral depends on the seriousness of economic effects, with potential negative consequences. Financial crises can have long-lasting effects on GDP growth and unemployment, as seen in the 2007-2009 recession. Higher interest rates from increased credit risk could reduce the market value of existing assets. Higher interest rates due to greater credit risk could decrease the market value of federal debt, leading to a negative wealth effect for debt holders. This could result in reduced spending, especially for financial institutions holding Treasury securities. During the 2008 financial crisis, leveraged financial firms responded to losses by deleveraging, potentially causing a credit crunch. Money market mutual funds held significant amounts of Treasury securities, which could lead to capital losses in the current low interest rate environment. In the 2008 financial crisis, money market funds holding Treasury securities faced potential capital losses, which could trigger a fund to \"break the buck\" and lead to a run on money market funds. Treasury securities are also used as collateral in the repo market, providing liquidity for leveraged financial firms. If the creditworthiness of Treasury securities is questioned, lenders may become more cautious. If the creditworthiness of Treasury securities is questioned, lenders may become less willing to accept them as collateral or lend against them, leading to a contraction in credit and harming firms' access to liquidity. The key issue is whether a spike in Treasury yields would affect private yields on corporate bonds, bank lending rates, and consumer credit. Treasury yields are seen as a benchmark rate for other private rates, but a change in sovereign credit risk may not necessarily impact private yields. If government credit risk affects private corporations, private yields may rise with Treasury yields. A debt spiral could lead to contractionary fiscal policy, impacting overall spending in the economy. This could improve confidence in financial markets but also reduce spending in the short run. The rationale for countries like Greece to implement austerity measures is to counteract the contractionary effects of debt spirals. While the United States has not experienced a debt spiral in modern times, other countries like Iceland and Greece have seen significant GDP contractions due to debt spirals. Despite not defaulting yet, these countries have faced deep economic downturns, with GDP falling by 11% in Iceland and 18% in Greece. This contrasts with the 2.6% GDP drop in the US during the recent recession. The International Monetary Fund has helped countries avoid default, with GDP growth declining by 2.6 percentage points in the first year after a default. However, countries typically bounce back economically, with no long-term negative effects on GDP growth. A sudden spike in Treasury yields could potentially impact the broader economy, similar to the recent financial crisis triggered by mortgage default rates. The financial crisis of 2008 was triggered by the sudden loss of value and liquidity in AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities, leading to doubts about the solvency of firms holding these assets. This caused widespread illiquidity and some financial firms to fail. Despite the belief that monetary policy could contain systemic risks, the crisis proved otherwise. The U.S. Treasury faced reaching its debt limit by the end of 2012, with potential measures to delay it until early 2013. The potential risk of default on federal debt due to insufficient revenue to meet spending obligations authorized by Congress has raised concerns. While some argue that enough revenue will be collected to meet interest payments, Treasury maintains it cannot prioritize payments. A 1985 Government Accountability Office opinion suggested Treasury could prioritize and pay interest. The Office opinion argues that the Treasury can prioritize and pay interest first, even though revenues may be sufficient to meet interest payments. Investors may view a failure to raise the debt limit as a signal of government credit risk, leading to a debt spiral. Debt holders may fear that if the government fails to meet legal obligations, they may prioritize popular programs over interest payments, leading to a political crisis and potential deficit reduction. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded U.S. federal debt from AAA to AA+ due to concerns about the fiscal consolidation plan falling short of stabilizing the government's debt dynamics. If debt holders doubt the government's ability to make interest payments, interest rates could rise, leading to a debt spiral before a default occurs. The downgrade of U.S. federal debt from AAA to AA+ by Standard & Poor's on August 5, 2011, was due to concerns about stabilizing the government's debt dynamics. Despite fears of a debt spiral and potential default, market reactions to the 2011 downgrade showed that Treasury yields actually fell, indicating no immediate negative impact. Treasury yields fell after the 2011 downgrade despite concerns about the \"safe haven\" status of Treasury securities. The impact of a future downgrade on interest rates is uncertain and would depend on the extent of the downgrade. A one-step downgrade would still leave U.S. debt above \"junk\" status. Many foreign governments issue debt at manageable interest rates despite lower credit ratings. Future downgrades could impact Treasury securities' safe haven status, potentially triggering investor sentiment deterioration. The downgrade of AAA mortgage-backed securities in 2007-2008 had economic effects similar to a \"debt spiral\". The impact on the broader economy depends on how the downgrade affects financial markets. In 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded government sponsored enterprises and U.S. insurers from AAA to AA+ following the federal debt downgrade. Rating downgrades sometimes lag market events. A ratings downgrade could be triggered by abnormal financial conditions. Government budget deficits can crowd out private investment spending when the economy is at full employment. This occurs as government borrowing competes with business borrowing for national saving, pushing up the cost of borrowing. Government deficits are unlikely to significantly crowd out private business borrowing when the economy is not at full employment. Low interest rates support this view, as business investment has remained low due to either declining demand or credit constraints. This reduces the potential for large government deficits to impact private investment spending. Low interest rates support the view that government deficits are not crowding out private business borrowing. The rise in the budget deficit has increased GDP despite a possible crowding out effect. Foreign saving can also finance borrowing in the standard macroeconomic model. In the standard macroeconomic model, borrowing can be financed by foreign saving, leading to a rise in the trade deficit. Foreign credit can prevent crowding out of domestic capital investment, but large budget deficits may be less effective in stimulating the economy due to heavy reliance on foreign borrowing. The trade deficit may not completely negate the stimulus but could make it less effective in boosting aggregate spending. The trade deficit has fallen substantially since the recession began, reducing concerns of crowding out from the trade deficit. Foreign financing of capital spending means income generated will go to foreigners. Large budget deficits will no longer stimulate aggregate spending once the economy reaches full employment. Domestic investment must equal national saving plus net borrowing from abroad. Before the crisis, three-quarters of investment was financed by national saving and one-quarter by borrowing from abroad. In 2008, national saving fell to 12.6% of GDP due to a rise in the budget deficit to 3.2% of GDP. Despite this, net borrowing from abroad remained steady as investment spending decreased. The budget deficit averaged 9.3% of GDP from FY2009 to FY2011, impacting total private saving. Investment was low during the recession but is expected to rebound with economic recovery. If the deficit decreases, private saving would need to increase significantly or net borrowing from abroad would have to rise above the 2000-2007 average. Private saving has increased from 14-16% of GDP in 2000-2007 to 18.9% in 2009-2011. Economists question if this rise can offset the budget deficit. Low national saving and high borrowing from abroad for investment were unsustainable. If the deficit remains high, national saving will decrease, leading to lower domestic investment or increased borrowing from abroad. The future willingness of foreign investors to buy U.S. assets depends on various factors. The future willingness of foreign investors to buy U.S. assets will depend on investment opportunities abroad and the sustainability of U.S. debt. Concerns include competition for funds with increased borrowing by foreign governments and the potential for high inflation due to large deficits. The Federal Reserve controls the money supply independently of the Treasury and its financing needs. Large deficits could lead to higher inflation if the Fed finances government operations by increasing the money supply. However, current laws prevent direct debt purchases from the Treasury, but economists warn that the central bank may be forced to monetize debt if private investors refuse to finance it. Investors may raise inflation expectations if they anticipate future monetization of debt, leading to higher interest rates. Fiscal and monetary decisions today impact future inflation. No significant evidence of rising inflation expectations currently."
