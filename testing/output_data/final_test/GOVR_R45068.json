    "content": "The Department of Defense heavily relies on contractors for military support and equipment. Congress has been frustrated with cost overruns and has made efforts to reform defense acquisitions through legislation like the National Defense Authorization Acts. The National Defense Authorization Acts have been instrumental in reforming defense acquisitions, with key provisions from FY2016 to FY2018. Recent changes include altering the role of Service Chiefs, restructuring the USD [AT&L] office, and shifting authority to military departments. Congress primarily influences defense acquisitions through Title VIII of the NDAA. The NDAA, particularly Title XVII of the FY2018 NDAA, focuses on Small Business Procurement and Industrial Base Matters. Congress has been active in legislating acquisition reform, with an average of 82 provisions in NDAA titles related to acquisition reform for FY2016-FY2018. The FY2016 NDAA aimed to streamline DOD and Military Services' acquisition processes, including expanding rapid acquisition authority and developing guidance for middle tier programs. The FY2018 NDAA required DOD to develop guidance for rapidly acquiring middle tier programs in two to five years, including rapid prototyping and fielding. Congress also authorized the Secretary of Defense to waive acquisition laws if it is in the national security interest of the United States and if the law impedes the acquisition process. In the FY2017 NDAA, Congress focused on defense technology innovation by promoting collaboration with the national technology and industrial base. Other transaction authority (OTA) allows DOD to enter into research projects with private organizations, exempting transactions from certain procurement statutes and regulations. The FY2016 NDAA expanded DOD's use of OTA for prototype programs. Subtitle G of Title VIII of the FY2018 NDAA expands the use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) for prototype programs. The Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying Acquisition Regulations (809 Panel) was established to streamline defense acquisition processes and must report recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and Congress. The FY2016 NDAA required reports on streamlining acquisition processes and assessing capabilities deployment timelines. The FY2018 NDAA established a pilot program for companies to pay DOD processing costs for bid protests. A micro-purchase is a simplified acquisition of supplies or services. The FY2017 NDAA and FY2018 NDAA raised micro-purchase thresholds for DOD and federal government, respectively. Simplified acquisition procedures allow streamlined purchases of supplies or services. The FY2018 NDAA also increased the simplified acquisition threshold. Congress emphasized DOD's use of fixed price contracting and performance-based contract payments in the FY2017 NDAA. The FY2017 NDAA restricted the use of lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection criteria to certain circumstances, emphasizing the importance of performance-based contract payments. The FY2018 NDAA required DOD to adhere to commercial standards for auditing costs incurred under flexibly priced contracts. The FY2017 NDAA mandated the use of private auditors for DOD auditing needs and raised the threshold for certified cost and pricing data submissions. It also required major defense acquisition programs to adopt a modular open system architecture approach for incremental development and enhanced competition. The act established authority for prototype projects to address high-priority warfighter needs and reduce sustainment costs. The FY2017 NDAA requires program cost and fielding targets to be assigned to MDAPs before development funds are obligated. It also mandates milestone decision authorities to provide Congress with an \"acquisition scorecard\" after each milestone decision. Additionally, the act includes measures to address sustainment and total life-cycle costs of MDAPs, such as conducting sustainment reviews five years after initial operational capability. The FY2018 NDAA repealed chapter 144a of Title 10 and included provisions related to MDAPs, such as excluding defense business systems from the definition of an MDAP and prohibiting the use of an LPTA source selection process for development contracts. It also emphasized reliability and maintainability in MDAPs, focused on test and evaluation plans, and established a centralized office for commercial item determinations. The FY2018 NDAA included provisions to encourage and expand commercial items authorities, such as requiring GSA to contract with multiple commercial online marketplaces and clarifying the definition of commercial items. The FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018 NDAA made amendments to technical data rights, giving DOD more authority to negotiate for data rights and establish policies on intellectual property acquisition. The FY2017 NDAA also limited funds for staff augmentation contracts within OSD and military department headquarters. The FY2018 NDAA addressed contracts for services, improving data collection and analysis, creating standard guidelines, and establishing a pilot program for multiyear contracts. The FY2016-2018 NDAAs included provisions for the acquisition workforce, modifying the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund, requiring training on market research, creating a dual career track, and clarifying tenure requirements for program managers. The FY2017 NDAA expanded the use of the DAWDF and authorized the position of senior military acquisition. The FY2018 NDAA made adjustments to the fund and authorized the position of senior military acquisition advisor. It required the implementation of a program manager development program, modified the Secretary of Defense's authority, and extended the Acquisition Demonstration project pilot. In the 1980s, defense acquisition programs faced cost overruns, leading to the establishment of the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management in 1985. The Packard Commission, chaired by former Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard, issued a final report in 1986 with recommendations for defense management reforms. One key recommendation was the creation of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition) position to oversee procurement and research and development policies. This was motivated by the fragmented responsibility for acquisition policy. The acquisition policy has become fragmented with no single senior official in the Office of the Secretary of Defense overseeing it full-time. Responsibility has shifted to the Services without proper coordination, leading to diluted authority and accountability. The establishment of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and subsequent legislative acts aimed to consolidate civilian control over acquisitions within OSD. The service Chiefs retained influence over acquisitions despite changes in policies and processes. Analysts and officials, including John Hamre and General Ray Odierno, called for giving the services and Chiefs more authority over acquisitions. John Hamre emphasized the central role of service chiefs in establishing military weapon systems. The service chiefs play a central role in establishing military requirements and resourcing decisions, despite not being responsible for weapon systems. Giving them responsibility for requirements and budgets but not acquisition creates a fractured authority and accountability in the Defense Department. The Obama Administration objected to changes that would reduce the Secretary of Defense's ability to guard against unwarranted cost optimism and prevent excessive risk-taking. The Senate initiated provisions to enhance the role of the Chiefs and the military services in the NDAA. The Senate provisions in the NDAA aimed to reduce the Secretary of Defense's ability to prevent cost overruns and delays by limiting the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics' authority. The FY2016 NDAA incorporated much of the Senate bill's content, while the FY2017 and FY2018 NDAA further refined the role of the services and reorganized the office of the USD (AT&L). Section 802 of the FY2016 NDAA sought to enhance the Chiefs of Staff's involvement in the defense acquisition process. Section 802 of the FY2016 NDAA aimed to enhance the role of Chiefs of Staff in defense acquisition by assigning them responsibilities in decision-making, resource balancing, and career path management. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council was also required to seek their input in major defense acquisition programs. Section 802 of the FY2016 NDAA enhanced the role of Chiefs of Staff in defense acquisition by involving them in decision-making for major defense acquisition programs. Section 825 designates the service acquisition executive as the milestone decision authority for major programs, with other sections strengthening the role of services in acquisitions. Configuration Steering Boards ensure relevant Chiefs approve proposed changes for major programs. The FY2017 NDAA does not directly shift more acquisition authority to the military services, but some sections in the bill could adjust acquisition authority in their favor. Section 901 significantly affects OSD's role in defense acquisition by breaking up AT&L into USD (Research and Engineering) and USD (Acquisition and Sustainment, A&S). The conference report outlines three broad priorities framing the conference. The conference report highlights three priorities: advancing technology and innovation, fostering distinct technology and acquisition cultures, and providing oversight of the Department's Fourth Estate. Section 807 of the FY2017 NDAA mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish goals for milestone decision authority before funds are used for technology development or production of an MDAP, with the Deputy Secretary of Defense being the only one allowed to delegate this responsibility. The NDAA sets goals that cannot be delegated below the Deputy Secretary of Defense, potentially weakening the influence of the USD (A&S). Other sections in the NDAA strengthen the role of services in acquisitions, such as granting service acquisition authority to waive tenure requirements and authorizing military departments to establish service-specific funds for acquisition programs. The FY2018 NDAA clarified the roles of USD (A&S) and amended requirements for MDAPs, including the need for service chief concurrence on material solutions and cost, schedule, and performance trade-offs at Milestones A, B, and C."
