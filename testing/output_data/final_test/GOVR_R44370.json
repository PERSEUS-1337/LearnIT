    "content": "The Smithsonian Institution (SI) was created by Congress in 1846 to increase and diffuse knowledge among men. It was established through a bequest from English scientist James Smithson, who left his estate to the United States. Today, SI is a complex of museums, education, research, and revenue-generating entities primarily located in Washington, DC, with additional facilities across the US and world. It employs 6,500 staff and 6,300 volunteers, and in FY 2015, its museums and zoo had 29.3 million visitors. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) oversees museums and a zoo that were visited 29.3 million times and websites accessed 134 million times. It is a government establishment with a unique position, separate from the branches of the national government, overseen by a board. SI manages entities created by Congress and established to accept gifts, seek grants, and raise funds. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) receives funding from trust resources, appropriations, and other sources. It executes no direct government programs beyond regulating its buildings. Approximately 60% of SI's annual expenditures come from appropriations, with the rest from grants, gifts, commercial activities, and investments. Staff are federal employees, and separate funding streams are referred to as \"trust funds.\" The Smithsonian Institution (SI) receives funding from trust resources, appropriations, and other sources to fund its activities and collections. It reported $484.7 million in trust funds for operational expenses in FY2016. SI is overseen by a Board of Regents and acts as a trustee of bequests and gifts to further its missions. The Smithsonian Institution is overseen by the Regents, who have broad authority to oversee and amend activities. The Regents are composed of various government officials and citizen Regents, with some residing in Washington, DC, and others in states. The Regents may elect a chancellor from among themselves. The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, composed of government officials and citizen Regents, have the authority to oversee activities. The Chief Justice traditionally serves as chancellor, leading a three-Regent executive committee. Congressional appointments are renewable, and citizen Regents serve six-year terms. The secretary is responsible for SI buildings, property, and record-keeping. The secretary of the Smithsonian oversees various areas including Science, History, Art, Culture, Finance, Administration, Collections, Education, Communications, and Advancement. In 2015, an agreement was authorized for Smithsonian exhibit space in a cultural complex in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The Regents authorized an agreement for Smithsonian exhibit space in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, with terms including a $50 million funding commitment from the UK and assistance from LLDC in raising additional donations. SI's criteria for the venture included alignment with their mission and substantial private resources from London. In June 2016, the Smithsonian Institution (SI) and the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) announced an agreement to develop a permanent gallery space as part of V&A East in London's cultural complex. Secretary Skorton emphasized that it would be a collaboration, not just a Smithsonian outpost, to engage with diverse audiences and enhance storytelling globally. SI has previously initiated programs without congressional authorization and has its own funding sources beyond appropriations. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) has its own funding sources beyond appropriations and perceives a duty as trustee of the Smithson bequest. While SI has initiated programs without congressional authorization, it has later sought appropriations for permanent ventures like the Smithsonian Observatory and the Anacostia Museum. Establishing an SI museum in London may raise questions about the rationale and authority for funding beyond the United States. The Smithsonian Institution has been able to justify the need for public funding for domestic facilities outside of Washington, DC, with activities in Panama and Belize receiving approval from Congress. These locations support research that cannot be done in Washington, DC, providing a rationale for funding beyond the region. The Smithsonian Institution is considering establishing an outpost in London to display collections, which raises questions about its mission and intentions. The Smithsonian Institution is considering establishing an outpost in London without congressional approval, using trust resources. Congress may question if this aligns with Smithson's intentions for SI in Washington and how future appropriations requests will be justified. Concerns about overseas activities, potential budget redirection, and domestic renovation needs will likely be considered. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced H.R. 3169, the Smithsonian Modernization Act of 2015, which aimed to change the number of Regents and establish a standard term for all Regents. It would have removed certain government officials as Regents and allowed for citizen Regents to be appointed by the President based on nominees from Congress. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced H.R. 3169, the Smithsonian Modernization Act of 2015, to strengthen the Smithsonian's resources through full-time Regents dedicated to oversight and fundraising. The bill aimed to update the governance structure and increase access to private resources. H.R. 3387, the Open and Transparent Smithsonian Act of 2015, was also introduced by Norton to make the Smithsonian subject to the Freedom of Information Act. The Smithsonian Act of 2015 aimed to make the Smithsonian subject to various transparency and oversight laws. H.R. 3169 and H.R. 3387 were introduced for this purpose, with H.R. 3169 focusing on governance structure and fundraising, while H.R. 3387 aimed to make the Smithsonian subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Senator John Boozman also introduced S. 2057 to authorize additional storage space for collections at various Smithsonian locations. The Smithsonian Collections Space Authorization Act aimed to provide funding for the care and study of national collections in Maryland. S. 2057 and H.R. 3702 were introduced for this purpose, with H.R. 3702 being a companion measure to S. 2057. No further action was taken on these bills. On December 18, 2015, Representative Grace Meng introduced H.R. 4307, the National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture Act, to establish a new national museum within the Smithsonian Institution focused on Asian Pacific American life, art, history, and culture. The bill included provisions for exhibits, artifact collection, and the appointment of a museum director. H.R. 4307 mandated the Regents to designate a site for the museum within 12 months. The bill was referred to multiple committees for consideration but no further action was taken. On September 13, 2016, H.R. 6001 was introduced to establish a Smithsonian American Latino Museum in SI's Arts and Industries Building on the National Mall. The bill authorized the Regents to plan and construct the museum, including an underground annex facility, in a manner harmonious with the National Mall. On September 13, 2016, Senator Robert Menendez introduced S. 3314, the Smithsonian American Latino Museum Act, as a companion measure to H.R. 6001. The bill was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration but no further action was taken."
