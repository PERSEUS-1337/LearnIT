    "content": "The \"Small Business Subcontracting Transparency Act of 2015\" amends the Small Business Act to enhance transparency in subcontracting goals. It includes provisions related to material breach, subcontracting assurances, and the authority of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. SEC. 3. AUTHORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION is amended to enhance transparency in subcontracting goals. Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act is amended to include a definition of \"covered small business concerns\" which encompasses various types of small businesses. The Small Business Act is amended to include small business concerns owned and controlled by women. If a subcontracting plan fails to provide opportunities for small businesses, acceptance of the plan may be delayed. A procurement center representative or commercial market representative can delay acceptance of a subcontracting plan for 30 days by providing written notice to the head of the contracting agency with recommendations for changes to maximize opportunities. This applies unless it is for the Department of Defense. A procurement center representative or commercial market representative may delay acceptance of a subcontracting plan for a 15-day period by providing written notice to appropriate Department of Defense personnel with recommendations for plan alterations. The authority of a procurement center representative or commercial market representative to delay acceptance of a subcontracting plan does not include the authority to delay the award or performance of the contract. Disagreements may arise if the representative does not reach an agreement with the head of the procuring activity regarding plan alterations. The agency must alter the subcontracting plan within 30 days if there is a disagreement, and the Administrator can submit it to the head of the contracting agency for a final decision. A procurement center representative cannot delay acceptance of a subcontracting plan in cases of urgent need certified by the head of the contracting agency. SEC. 5. GOOD FAITH COMPLIANCE.\n\nWithin 270 days of this Act's enactment, the Small Business Administration Administrator will issue regulations outlining examples of activities that would be deemed a failure to comply in good faith with requirements for entities awarded prime contracts."
