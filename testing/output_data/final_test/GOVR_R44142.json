    "content": "This report addresses issues related to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) of July 14, 2015, including monitoring and enforcing the agreement, the impact of sanctions relief on Iran's policies, regional security implications, and the potential for changing U.S.-Iran relations. The report does not cover all issues but focuses on key topics currently debated in public and congressional discussions. For more in-depth analysis, refer to other CRS reports. The report provides additional resources for further information on international sanctions on Iran, Iran's nuclear program, regional implications of the Iran agreement, and implications of lifting the U.N. ban on arms. The resources include CRS reports on Iran sanctions, Iran's nuclear program compliance, Israel-U.S. relations, the \"Islamic State\" crisis, Yemen civil war, and armed conflict in Syria. The report provides additional resources for further information on international sanctions on Iran, Iran's nuclear program, regional implications of the Iran agreement, and implications of lifting the U.N. ban on arms. It includes CRS reports on Iran sanctions, Iran's nuclear program compliance, Israel-U.S. relations, the \"Islamic State\" crisis, Yemen civil war, and armed conflict in Syria. The report does not cover bilateral issues such as compensation for U.S. victims of Iranian terrorism. The JCPOA includes monitoring provisions by the IAEA to verify Iranian compliance with enrichment and reactor programs. Tehran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol and modified Code 3.1 of its safeguards agreement. U.S. intelligence officials are confident in detecting Iranian compliance with the agreement. The JCPOA includes monitoring provisions by the IAEA to verify Iranian compliance with enrichment and reactor programs. The agreement allows for monitoring of Iranian centrifuges and infrastructure for 15 years, daily access to relevant buildings at Natanz facilities, verification of inventory of centrifuge components for 20 years, monitoring of uranium mills for 25 years, and access to a dedicated procurement channel for nuclear-related materials. The JCPOA includes monitoring provisions by the IAEA to verify Iranian compliance with enrichment and reactor programs, including access to specified sites with prior notice. The IAEA can request access to sites if concerns arise about undeclared nuclear activities, and Iran can propose alternative solutions to address these concerns. The JCPOA allows the IAEA to request access to sites at any time if concerns about undeclared nuclear activities arise. If no resolution is reached within 14 days, Iran will consult with the Joint Commission to find a solution. If an agreement cannot be reached, the commission will advise on necessary actions, with Iran implementing them within 3 days. The entire process should be completed within 24 days. Some experts argue that the 24-day period in the JCPOA may not allow the IAEA to uncover all possible nuclear activities Iran could conceal, especially small-scale activities crucial for weapon manufacturing. Environmental sampling can detect microscopic traces of nuclear materials even after attempts to remove evidence. The JCPOA verification provisions supplement the authorities provided by the comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol, allowing for continuous monitoring of Iran's uranium mills and specific centrifuge components. The agreement also provides clearer provisions regarding access and compliance determinations compared to traditional safeguards agreements. The additional protocol's language regarding IAEA inspections of centrifuge manufacturing facilities is unclear. Disputes over IAEA access to Iranian facilities have a vague resolution process and require approval from the IAEA Board of Governors. Certain prohibited activities related to weapons development under the JCPOA may not trigger special inspections by the IAEA Board of Governors. In 2007, Iran and the IAEA agreed on a work plan to address outstanding issues. In August 2007, Iran and the IAEA agreed on a work plan to clarify outstanding questions regarding Tehran's nuclear program, resolving most suspicions of pursuing nuclear weapons. However, there is one major unresolved issue concerning possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program. Several pre-JCPOA U.N. Security Council Resolutions require Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA's investigation. The IAEA Board of Governors emphasized the urgent resolution of all outstanding substantive issues with Iran. IAEA and Iranian officials met multiple times between January 2012 and May 2013 to address outstanding issues related to Iran's nuclear program. A \"new approach\" was adopted in October 2013, leading to a joint statement in November 2013 outlining a \"Framework for Cooperation\" to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. Iran has questioned the evidence presented by the IAEA and denies working on nuclear weapons. Iran has provided some information to the IAEA regarding outstanding issues related to its nuclear program, but has not fully addressed concerns about research on high explosives and neutron transport. The JCPOA requires Tehran to complete certain steps to ensure the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. The JCPOA requires Tehran to complete steps outlined in an Iran-IAEA roadmap to address outstanding issues related to possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program. The roadmap includes assessments by IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano and aims to resolve issues by December 15, 2015. It also covers arrangements for addressing remaining outstanding issues and specifically focuses on the military site of Parchin. The IAEA obtained information indicating that in 2000 Iran constructed a large explosives containment vessel at Parchin for nuclear weapons development. Inspectors visited the site in 2005 but found nothing relevant. Iran has not responded to IAEA requests and altered buildings at Parchin, hindering verification efforts. Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz stated that the arrangements include \"confidential documents.\" The IAEA emphasized the importance of safeguarding confidential information related to nuclear facilities and material. The JCPOA outlines the IAEA's role in ensuring safeguards confidentiality. The JCPOA outlines the IAEA's role in ensuring safeguards confidentiality and drawing a \"Broader Conclusion\" for states with comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols in force. This conclusion signifies the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, addressing outstanding issues concerning Iran's nuclear program. The process typically takes five to seven years for states with complex nuclear programs. The IAEA's Broader Conclusion for states with complex nuclear programs typically takes five to seven years. If the conclusion is drawn, U.N. bans on arms sales and Iran's development of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles would be lifted. Congressional review was enacted under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. The congressional review period for the Iran nuclear agreement is 60 calendar days from the date of submission to Congress, ending on September 17. If a resolution of disapproval is passed, President Obama could not waive sanctions for another 12 days, potentially leading to a veto. Congress would then have 10 days to reconsider the bill with a two-thirds majority to override the veto. The maximum period during which statutory sanctions could not be waived is 82 days after Congress's receipt of the agreement. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, outlines three scenarios regarding Congress's approval or disapproval of sanctions relief for Iran. The Act specifies that any relief from statutory sanctions must include waiver, suspension, reduction, or other efforts to limit the application of sanctions. Chairman Ed Royce introduced a resolution of disapproval of the JCPOA. The implications of rejecting the agreement include erosion of the multilateral sanctions regime and potential for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. President Obama warned of the possibility of another war in the Middle East if the deal is rejected. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power suggested that other countries may follow suit in rejecting the agreement. Samantha Power warns that a U.S. rejection of the JCPOA could lead to other countries refusing to impose sanctions in the future. The fate of international sanctions is uncertain if the U.S. disapproves the agreement, as foreign governments may choose to continue or cease cooperation. The decision of firms worldwide on U.S. economic sanctions could vary, with some finding them tolerable while others may not. Many companies may find U.S. economic sanctions tolerable or immaterial when resuming transactions with Iran. Foreign firms may weigh the risks of U.S. penalties and decide to continue or refrain from doing business with Iran. The United States will terminate sanctions on Implementation Day to comply with U.N. Security Council requirements. The United States will adjust sanctions to allow trade in software, metals, and nuclear-related commodities with nonnuclear-weapon states. Specific individuals and entities from the JCPOA will be removed from sanction lists, freeing their assets and restoring travel rights. This will happen by October 18, 2023, or upon IAEA reporting compliance. The United States is committed to repealing legislation and removing Iranian names from sanction lists based on the IAEA's report on Iran's nuclear activities. Certain categories of U.S. sanctions will remain, including those related to terrorism, human rights violations, regional instability, and ballistic missile program. Sanctions related to Iran's acquisition of ballistic missiles and arms will continue for a specified period as per U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015). Iran's negotiators accepted certain sanctions under the JCPOA, including technology, arms trade, asset freezing, and travel restrictions. The United States has labeled Iran a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984, citing its support for Hezbollah and Hamas. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) is designated as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, leading to sanctions including asset freezing and travel restrictions for Iranian individuals and entities. Several Iranian entities, including Saderat, the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security, Mahan Airlines, Caspian Airlines, and Meraj Air, are designated as terrorists by the U.S. This results in the denial of access to U.S.-based assets, entry into the United States, and transactions with individuals disrupting peace processes, stabilization efforts, committing human rights abuses, facilitating misuse of information technology, evading sanctions, trading in goods that violate human rights, or engaging in censorship. The President has the authority to identify senior Iranian government officials involved in proliferation, support of terrorism, or human rights violations. President Clinton declared Iran as a threat to US national security and economy, blocking financial commitments to Iran's petroleum resources and exports. Congress later codified these orders, requiring notification before revocation. The JCPOA does not require the US to suspend the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act or other related statutes and Executive Orders. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act imposes sanctions on those supplying Iran with WMD technology or advanced conventional weapons. The US may face challenges in pressuring Iran on human rights, terrorism, and arms proliferation post-JCPOA implementation. Sanctions under the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act may not be lifted until Iran meets certain conditions. Paragraph 26 of the JCPOA requires parties to refrain from reintroducing sanctions removed by the Agreement. The US will make best efforts to sustain the JCPOA and prevent interference with Iran's benefit from lifted sanctions. The US Administration will not reimpose sanctions specified in Annex II without following the dispute resolution process outlined in the JCPOA. The US Administration will refrain from imposing new nuclear-related sanctions under the JCPOA. Iran will consider any reintroduction or imposition of sanctions as grounds to cease its commitments. The US could seek harmonization of designations of Iranian entities supporting terrorism through diplomacy or new legislation. Congress may seek to utilize Executive Order 13553 to target individuals and entities involved in serious human rights abuses by the Government of Iran. Additionally, they could consider the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to identify and sanction foreign individuals responsible for human rights violations. The JCPOA outlines a dispute resolution process for alleged breaches of commitments. If Iran fails to resolve disputes, a veto-wielding U.N. Security Council member can veto a resolution to continue sanctions relief. This includes U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929, allowing all member states to cooperate with sanctions on Iran. The JCPOA allows for snap-back sanctions on Iran's economic sectors, with U.S. sanctions potentially impacting foreign companies. The EU has indicated it would re-impose sanctions if the U.N. mechanism is triggered, risking penalties for companies engaging with Iran. The risk of U.S. penalties for companies engaging with Iran may lead to many ending their business with Iran. Some governments may not press their corporations to comply with U.S. sanctions, potentially trading within the limits of resumed U.N. sanctions. The Administration reserves the right to calibrate the snapping back of U.S. sanctions in response to alleged Iranian violations. There is a possibility of reimposing some U.S. sanctions instead of triggering the U.N. sanctions snap back, which could lead to the discontinuation of the JCPOA. The JCPOA may face discontinuation if sanctions are reinstated, leading to potential penalties for companies doing business with Iran. The agreement allows for the continuation of contracts signed prior to sanctions being re-imposed, but firms continuing transactions may still face sanctions. The JCPOA allows for contracts signed before sanctions to continue with a wind-down period. The EU has assured the US that contract sanctity will not be allowed under a snap-back scenario. Iran will gain access to $60 billion in foreign exchange reserves once sanctions are lifted, potentially increasing its regional influence. The JCPOA sanctions relief will allow Iran to freely export crude oil and potentially reach pre-2012 export levels. Experts believe a nuclear deal could give Iran more legitimacy and influence in regional policy. Sanctions relief could also enable Iran to modernize its armed forces and increase assistance to the region. Iran could use sanctions relief to modernize its armed forces and support allied governments and factions in the region, despite U.N. bans on arms exports. A nuclear agreement may deter Iran from actions that could lead to sanctions or military intervention. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew believes Iran may use sanctions relief to rebuild its economy, potentially engaging in destabilizing activities. A nuclear deal could empower Iranian moderates like Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and lead to improved U.S.-Iranian cooperation on regional issues. Positive outcomes include potential cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Iran on Yemen. Iran could potentially cooperate on regional issues such as the civil conflict in Syria and the effort to defeat the Islamic State organization in Iraq and Syria. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and other officials are advocating for certain positions. Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, are strongly advocating for congressional disapproval of the JCPOA under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. Netanyahu opposed the deal publicly and in a conversation with President Obama, with Israel's security cabinet unanimously registering disapproval. Other Israeli politicians have supported Netanyahu's criticism or voiced their own concerns. Some commentators are calling on Netanyahu to refrain from further opposition. Israel's response to the Iran nuclear deal is rooted in deep concern over the issue, with some Israeli commentators urging Netanyahu to not aggressively oppose the deal due to doubts about his influence and concerns about potential damage to strategic arrangements with the US. Netanyahu's senior advisor stated that Israel must ensure Iran adheres to the deal, despite its perceived weaknesses. Israel and the United States began preliminary consultations on an aid and arms sales package to address concerns about the Iran nuclear deal. Israeli leaders fear the deal legitimizes Iran's nuclear aspirations and could increase support for Hezbollah. Netanyahu argued against the deal, stating the original American position was to dismantle Iran's nuclear program for sanctions relief. Israel and the United States are in preliminary consultations on an aid and arms sales package in response to concerns about the Iran nuclear deal. Israeli leaders worry the deal could legitimize Iran's nuclear ambitions and boost support for Hezbollah. Netanyahu opposed the deal, advocating for dismantling Iran's nuclear facilities in exchange for sanctions relief. Israel seeks reassurance from the US amid potential shifts in regional power dynamics. Israeli and some other critics of the Iran nuclear deal are shifting focus towards ensuring Iranian compliance with the agreement. While some Israeli defense officials mention a potential military strike, analysts believe it is less likely. Critics disagree with the Obama Administration on the lessons learned from the 1994 U.S. agreement with North Korea. Israeli critics of the Iran nuclear deal are comparing it to the 1994 U.S. agreement with North Korea. Netanyahu and Secretary of State John Kerry have differing opinions on the comparison. Israeli officials are delaying discussions on additional American military assistance until after Congress reviews the Iran deal. Opposition leader Herzog plans to visit. Opposition leader Herzog plans to visit the United States to request a security umbrella and support for Israel to maintain its advantage in the region post Iran deal. Potential aid and arms sales package to Israel may include increased annual U.S. military aid, early delivery of F-35 fighter aircraft, refueling planes, and funding for missile defense programs. President Obama invited Gulf Cooperation Council leaders to Camp David to discuss strengthening relations. The GCC leaders from Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain met at Camp David to discuss strengthening security cooperation and resolving conflicts in the Middle East. They expressed hope for a comprehensive final agreement and aspirations for normal relations with Iran based on mutual respect. Concerns were raised about Iran's influence in the region and the potential impact of sanctions relief on its support for pro-Iranian activities. The GCC leaders met at Camp David to discuss security cooperation and conflicts in the Middle East. Some leaders were absent, but high-level decisionmakers attended. A new U.S.-GCC strategic partnership was announced, focusing on all elements of U.S. policy. The U.S. and GCC announced a strategic partnership to secure core interests in the Gulf, increase security cooperation, and counter external aggression. This includes arms transfers, joint military exercises, and a commitment to Gulf-wide ballistic missile defense. Efforts will also focus on countering Iran's activities, defeating ISIS, and combating violent extremism. The GCC leaders were satisfied with the outcome of the meeting, reaffirming their support for the Iran nuclear agreement during meetings with U.S. officials. The agreement aims to prevent Iran from acquiring a military nuclear capability. Resolution 1747 and 1929 impose restrictions on Iran's arms exports and global sales of conventional arms to Iran, impacting security in the Middle East. Resolution 1929 prohibits the supply of battle tanks, combat vehicles, artillery systems, aircraft, helicopters, warships, missiles, and related items to Iran. The UN Security Council's Committee, established under resolution 1737 (2006), requires all States to prevent their nationals from providing Iran with technical training, financial resources, or services related to arms. Iran's military capabilities have not significantly increased since the 1990s, but it remains capable of combat with its neighbors. Iran's Supreme Leader and other Iranian political and military figures have warned of potential military action if Iran feels threatened. Recent DOD reports highlight Iran's ability to influence factions in the region like Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militia. US secondary sanctions may have limited Iran's access to major combat systems since the 1990s. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act imposes sanctions on those supplying Iran with WMD technology or advanced conventional weapons. The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act imposes sanctions on designated persons and foreign countries supplying Iran with advanced weapons. Sanctions include restrictions on U.S. government contracts, export licenses, foreign assistance, and arms sales. The President can use national emergency authorities to freeze assets and prohibit transactions with designated countries. The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act imposes sanctions on designated persons and foreign countries supplying Iran with advanced weapons, including restrictions on U.S. government contracts, export licenses, foreign assistance, and arms sales. The act is not part of the sanctions suspended under the Iran nuclear agreement. U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 allows for the eventual repeal of the ban on Iranian arms exports, with provisions expiring within five years or upon a determination of the \"Broader Conclusion.\" According to Resolution 2231, UN member states must prevent the supply of arms from Iran until five years after the JCPOA Adoption Day or the IAEA confirms the Broader Conclusion. Despite inspection authorization, the export ban has been challenging to enforce, allowing Iran to ship weapons to allies in the Middle East. The US military has conducted inspection operations at sea to support enforcement efforts. The United States has tried to enforce the export ban on Iranian arms shipments to Syria, but Iraq's cooperation has been limited. The U.N. panel reports ongoing Iranian arms transfers, raising concerns among Member States. No formal reports of non-compliance have been made, but there are offers from Iran. Other Security Council resolutions may help in interdicting arms exports to conflict zones. Resolution 1701 on Lebanon and Resolution 2216 on Yemen aim to prevent unauthorized arms exports to these conflict zones, with UNIFIL assisting Lebanon and authorizing inspections of shipments to Yemen. Challenges in implementing these resolutions highlight limitations in curbing Iranian arms exports. Resolution 2231 imposes restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile activities and trade in missile technologies, with the requirement to cease such activities until the IAEA confirms Iran's compliance with nuclear-related measures. This resolution will take effect on Implementation Day. Resolution 2231 imposes restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile activities, including launches using such technology, for up to eight years from Adoption Day. The ambiguity lies in the definition of \"ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons,\" with unclear legal binding. Iran's missile launches do not violate the JCPOA, even if they involve ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The ban on proscribed activities could last until 2023, with the possibility of reimposing restrictions in case of significant nonperformance by Iran. U.S. intelligence reports confirm Iran's ballistic missiles can deliver WMDs. Iranian ballistic missile program could be halted if Iran abstains from missile-related activities described in Resolution 2231, but Tehran has stated it will not adhere to the restrictions. Iran claims its ballistic missiles are for legitimate defense and not designed for WMD capability. Iran also asserts its right to pursue space launch activities under the Outer Space Treaty. Transfer of ballistic missile technology is still prohibited by the resolution. The JCPOA and Resolution 2231 prohibit the sale, supply, or transfer of ballistic missile-related items to or from Iran. Requests for transfers must be approved by the Joint Commission, with end-user guarantees in place. After the expiration of missile export restrictions in Resolution 2231, requests for ballistic missile-related transfers would go directly to the Security Council for decision. Iran claims its ballistic missiles are for defense purposes and asserts its right to pursue space launch activities. The expiration of missile export restrictions in Resolution 2231 will still impose checks on Iran's ability to import items for its ballistic missile program. Major suppliers to Iran's program, except for China and North Korea, are members of the Missile Technology Control Regime. U.N. Security Council Resolutions prohibit North Korean exports of ballistic missiles and related components. The nuclear agreement with Iran could impact the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts depending on U.S.-Iranian relations and cooperation on other fronts. In a scenario where there is no significant trust-building between the United States and Iran following the nuclear deal, Iran would continue supporting the Asad government in Syria and Shiite militias in Iraq. The United States and Iran would work separately to contain Islamic State advances in Iraq and Syria without direct communication or coordination. Continued U.S. pressure on Iran post-nuclear agreement could reassure Asad that the deal does not pressure Syria to moderate its stance towards the opposition or civilians. Asad congratulated Iran's Supreme Leader on the deal, expressing confidence in Iran's continued support for \"just issues.\" The Syrian government's private concerns about potential repercussions remain unknown. The deal could lead to improved bilateral relations between Iran and the United States, enabling direct cooperation against Islamic State forces in Iraq and possibly Syria. Iran may reduce support for the Asad regime and advocate for a political solution that includes Asad's departure. Asad may seek increased aid from allies like Hezbollah and Russia, potentially increasing their influence in Syrian politics. The potential departure of Asad and the rise of a new government in Syria could lead to increased influence for Hezbollah and Russia. Iran may shift its focus in Iraq to support security forces under Prime Minister Abadi. The nuclear deal with Iran could provide more resources for supporting allies like Asad and pro-Iranian groups in Iraq, potentially reducing their willingness to make concessions. Increased Iranian economic aid in Syria could widen the gap in living conditions between government and opposition areas. However, this could also lead to internal polarization within the Syrian government and between Syrian units and Iranian-backed militias. In Iraq, increased Iranian support for militias or pro-Tehran officials may undermine Prime Minister Abadi if it strengthens Iranian allies to a point where they outmatch Iraqi security forces. Iran's ability to allocate post-deal financial gains to foreign policy priorities in Syria and Iraq may be limited by domestic economic needs and high expectations for growth and services at home. A nuclear deal with Iran could potentially increase regional nuclear proliferation concerns among countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt. While it may not trigger a full-scale proliferation cascade, these states could adopt a nuclear hedging strategy by enhancing their nuclear infrastructure to keep options open. The potential for regional nuclear proliferation concerns among countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt is heightened by a nuclear deal with Iran. These states could enhance their nuclear infrastructure to keep options open, facing obstacles such as IAEA safeguards agreements and the need for foreign assistance in developing nuclear weapons. International agreements regulate assistance in nuclear weapon development, and the provision of nuclear fuel cycle technology is controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt may consider enhancing their nuclear infrastructure in response to a nuclear deal with Iran. Saudi officials have expressed skepticism towards Iran's intentions and some suggest seeking nuclear \"parity\" with Iran. While Saudi Arabia's position on the JCPOA may seem ambiguous, U.S. officials believe they support the agreement. President Obama met with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir in 2015 to discuss the matter. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir reaffirmed Saudi Arabia's support for preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, including strict inspections and sanctions for violations. The statement also mentioned improving relations with Iran but being firm in response to any threats. Saudi Arabia supports preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons through inspections and sanctions. They aim to improve relations but will respond firmly to any destabilizing actions. Speculation surrounds how Saudi leaders may react to the JCPOA and potential Iranian nuclear capabilities. Saudi Arabia may seek a nuclear guarantee if Iran develops nuclear weapons. There are uncertainties about Saudi's nuclear parity with Iran and the impact on their partnership with the US. Saudi plans to build 16 nuclear power plants by 2040 to reduce reliance on oil. Saudi Arabia plans to develop 16 nuclear power plants by 2040 to reduce oil consumption for electricity. Joint ventures with Argentina, South Korea, and Russia have been established for nuclear technology cooperation. The country is considering restrictions on domestic nuclear fuel production. Saudi Arabia is willing to accept \"Gold Standard\" restrictions on domestic nuclear fuel production to enter into a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US. Saudi Arabia has an IAEA Safeguards Agreement but has not agreed to an Additional Protocol. Isolating Saudi Arabia economically in case of nuclear proliferation concerns would be challenging due to its oil market influence, wealth, and global investments. Turkey, a NATO member, could potentially pursue its own nuclear weapons program if Iran develops nuclear capabilities. Turkey, as a NATO member, benefits from a security guarantee provided by the United States and other nuclear-armed NATO countries. This deterrence, along with Turkey's emphasis on self-reliance in defense, may deter Turkey from pursuing its own nuclear weapons program. Turkey's cautious support for a deal with Iran on nuclear infrastructure may be influenced by its dependence on Iran for energy. Turkey's strategy to increase domestic energy production includes plans for its first nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, near Mersin. Construction began in April 2015 after delays due to safety concerns post-Fukushima incident. Additional plants are planned in Sinop and another location. Since the Egyptian military ousted President Mohammed Morsi in 2013, Egypt has aligned more closely with Gulf monarchies. Speculation arises on how Egypt, a predominantly Sunni Muslim country, will respond to the Iran nuclear deal. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu predicts a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, with Sunni Arab nations like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt seeking nuclear capabilities. Egypt signed a deal with Russia in 2015 to build its first commercial nuclear power plant. The potential for Egypt to develop a nuclear program to counter Iran exists, but it may be more probable for Egypt to pursue other options. Egypt's pursuit of civilian nuclear power for economic reasons is more likely than for political purposes. The country's need for energy diversification, due to a lack of gas, is a driving factor. Egypt has advocated for a WMD-free zone in the Middle East since the early 1990s, potentially aimed at Israel's presumed nuclear arsenal. Israel's ambiguous status is seen as a hindrance to nonproliferation efforts. The international focus on Israel's nuclear status may intensify during the JCPOA, leading to potential changes in Israel's nuclear posture. Discussions about a WMD-free zone in the Middle East have been ongoing, with frustration over the lack of agreement among states. At the 2015 Review Conference, Egypt sponsored a resolution proposing a regional conference on banning weapons of mass destruction (WMD), but the United States, Britain, and Canada opposed the terms. Israel attended as an observer for the first time and also rejected the proposal. Egypt reacted cautiously to the nuclear agreement with Iran, hoping it prevents an arms race in the Middle East and ensures a WMD-free region. The JCPOA is debated for its impact on the U.S.-Iran relationship and strategy in the Middle East. Iran and the U.S. have a history of conflict since the 1979 Islamic revolution, including naval clashes during the Iran-Iraq war. Iran is accused of terrorism by the U.S. and holds dual nationals on questionable charges. Iran's Supreme Leader is wary of increased U.S. influence post-nuclear deal. The nuclear deal could potentially increase U.S. influence in Iran, but it is not expected to lead to a breakthrough in U.S.-Iran relations or change Iran's regional policy. The Obama Administration sees the deal as a chance to improve relations with Iran by empowering moderate elements and promoting regional stability. President Obama hopes that the finalized deal will usher in a new era in U.S.-Iran relations. The Administration is open to realigning U.S. policy towards a more neutral position between Iran and Sunni Arab allies. The nuclear deal could enhance existing cooperation between the U.S. and Iran on regional issues, such as forming governments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Discussions on the comprehensive accord have included topics like the threat of the Islamic State and the situation in Bahrain. The United States and Iran are indirectly cooperating in Iraq to support the Shiite-dominated government against Islamic State forces. U.S. officials aim to persuade Iran to help move President Asad aside in Syria to counter the appeal of the Islamic State. Remaining U.S. sanctions and non-nuclear issues may hinder post-nuclear agreement rapprochement with Iran. No sanctions addressing terrorism or human rights abuses will be eased as part of a nuclear deal, and public criticism of Iran's human rights practices will continue. In agreeing to the JCPOA, Iran has tacitly accepted the United States' public criticism of its human rights practices and detention of U.S. citizens. The global oil market in 2015 is characterized by weak prices and oversupply due to OPEC's decision to defend market share. If Iran increases oil exports, oversupply will worsen and prices will remain weak. The major question is how quickly Iran's oil exports will occur. Iran's oil exports could rapidly increase, potentially causing prices to fall by $15 per barrel. Iranian Minister of Petroleum Bijan Zanganeh stated that Iran could send 500,000 barrels per day to the market immediately, and up to 1 million barrels per day within six months. This could trigger a sharp downturn in prices, although questions remain about the availability of stored oil aboard tankers. Iran may need to invest in existing and new fields to increase oil production by 700,000 barrels per day by the end of 2016. This could have a gradual effect on prices due to the challenges in securing investment funding and the slow process of expanding production and exports."
