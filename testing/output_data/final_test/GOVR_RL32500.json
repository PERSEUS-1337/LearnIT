    "content": "The National Security Act of 1947 established the framework for the United States Intelligence Community, including the CIA and the position of Director of Central Intelligence. It aimed to coordinate and centralize the intelligence efforts of the US in response to the Soviet Union. The act granted the CIA operational roles related to national security as directed by the National Security Council. The U.S. Intelligence Community, established in 1947, has greatly expanded in size and responsibilities, including agencies like the CIA, NSA, FBI, and others. Since its establishment in 1947, the U.S. Intelligence Community has grown in size and responsibilities, including agencies like the CIA, NSA, and FBI. Various commissions and initiatives have proposed changes to address shortcomings in the Intelligence Community's structure and mission, ranging from organizational restructuring to enhancing the DCI's authority and establishing intelligence oversight. In the mid-1970s, investigatory bodies led by Senator Frank Church and Representative Otis G. Pike proposed reforms to the U.S. Intelligence Community, including separating the DCI and CIA Director positions, dividing CIA's responsibilities, and establishing congressional oversight committees. This led to the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1976 and 1977. The establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) was a result of investigations into the Iran-Contra affair in the mid-1980s. Post-Cold War and the Aldrich Ames espionage case, studies were conducted to determine the future roles, capabilities, and structure of the Intelligence Community, including the need to maintain the CIA as a separate entity and the effectiveness of U.S. counterintelligence efforts. Budget constraints and policy shifts also prompted examinations of personnel and managerial structures within intelligence components. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY1997 (P.L. 104-293) reflected organizational adjustments in response to budget constraints and shifting policy concerns. Studies also addressed personnel issues, resource allocation, duplication of services, expanded use of open source intelligence, and the need for covert action capability. Observers have suggested that further reevaluation of intelligence organization is necessary in light of events such as September 11, 2001, and the Iraq War. Congress now has increased access to intelligence judgments and information acquired by intelligence agencies. The report provides a chronological overview of major executive and legislative branch intelligence investigations from January 1949 to present. It discusses the U.S.'s emergence as a global leader post-World War II and its efforts to enhance national defense against Soviet aggression. The focus is on external intelligence investigations that have influenced Congress's role in covert actions. The National Security Act of 1947 was enacted to coordinate U.S. national defense efforts, including intelligence activities, in response to the Soviet Union's expansion of communism. It established the framework for the United States Intelligence Community, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council (NSC) to advise the President on national security integration. Following the National Security Act of 1947, various investigations were conducted to assess the efficiency of the executive branch and intelligence agencies. The Task Force on National Security Organization and the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report were key investigations initiated during this period. The Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch, chaired by Herbert Hoover, conducted a comprehensive review of the federal bureaucracy, including intelligence agencies. The Task Force on National Security Organization, led by Ferdinand Eberstadt, submitted the Eberstadt Report to Congress in January 1949. The report highlighted organizational and coordination issues within the national intelligence effort and the newly established CIA, emphasizing the lack of cooperation between the CIA, military, and State Department leading to duplication and inefficiencies in intelligence estimates. The Eberstadt Report criticized the CIA, military, and State Department for lack of cooperation, leading to biased intelligence estimates. It recommended fostering mutual confidence between agencies and making the CIA the central organization of the national intelligence system. Additionally, it suggested creating an evaluation board within the CIA for producing national estimates and emphasized professionalism and continuity of service. The Eberstadt Report recommended a civilian DCI with a long term in office for continuity of service. It supported integrating all clandestine operations into one office within the CIA under NSC supervision. The report also suggested that clandestine operations should be the responsibility of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in times of war. It found the CIA's internal structure and personnel system lacking organization and recommended clearer departmental responsibilities and proper personnel selection and training systems. The report addressed concerns about intelligence budgets, proposed a legal framework for budgetary procedures, rejected placing FBI's counterintelligence responsibilities in the CIA, highlighted deficiencies in military and scientific intelligence, and emphasized the importance of appraising scientific advances in hostile countries. The report stressed the need for a central authority to collect and evaluate scientific and medical intelligence. The Intelligence Survey Group (ISG) was established by the National Security Council to assess the CIA's efforts and its relationships with other agencies. The ISG, chaired by Allen W. Dulles, presented its findings in the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report to the National Security Council in 1949. The Dulles Report, presented to the National Security Council in 1949, contained critical recommendations for the CIA and DCI. It highlighted issues with intelligence execution, national estimates, and personnel at the agency. The report emphasized the need for the CIA to focus on its role as an intelligence coordinator. The Dulles Report recommended that the DCI should be a civilian for continuity of service and independence. It also called for increased coordination between the CIA and FBI in counterespionage and proposed a large-scale reorganization to eliminate overlapping functions. The Dulles Report recommended a large-scale reorganization of the CIA to streamline functions, integrating covert operations and clandestine intelligence into one office. It proposed replacing existing offices with four new divisions for coordination, estimates, research, and operations, with the heads of these divisions reporting directly to the DCI for better policy guidance. These recommendations served as the blueprint for the modern-day CIA structure. The Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report influenced the reorganization of the CIA, leading to the establishment of a single operations division in 1949. The merger of OSO and OPC in 1953 formed the Directorate of Plans (DP), later renamed the Directorate of Operations (DO) in 1973. The Eberstadt Report also played a role in reorganization efforts by DCI Walter Bedell Smith in 1950, following the fall of China to Communists and the North Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950. Following the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, Smith established the Board of National Estimates (BNE) to produce National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs). The Eisenhower Administration saw Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe and Communist insurgencies in Southeast Asia and Africa, leading to covert operations. However, between 1948 and 1955, there was no formal approval procedure for covert actions, prompting three investigations into U.S. intelligence. Between 1954 and 1956, three investigations were conducted into U.S. intelligence activities, including the CIA. The investigations were prompted by the lack of formal approval procedures for covert actions between 1948 and 1955. The investigations included the Task Force on Intelligence Activities of the Second Hoover Commission, the Doolittle Report commissioned by President Eisenhower, and the Bruce-Lovett Report initiated by the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities. In May 1955, the task force submitted classified and unclassified reports to President Eisenhower and Congress. The unclassified report contained nine recommendations and introduced the term \"Intelligence Community.\" It recommended reforming the CIA's internal organization and suggested the DCI focus on intelligence issues while delegating day-to-day administration. The task force recommended better oversight of intelligence activities through a bipartisan commission and systematic rechecking of personnel every five years. It also suggested the CIA replace the State Department. The task force recommended that the CIA replace the State Department in procurement of foreign publications and scientific intelligence. Additionally, there were \"housekeeping\" recommendations such as improving linguistic training and raising the DCI's salary. President Eisenhower sought a separate report on the CIA's Directorate of Plans, leading to Lieutenant General James Doolittle being commissioned to report on covert activities and make recommendations for improvement. The Doolittle Report, declassified in 1976, contained forty-two recommendations to improve covert operations. It emphasized the need for effective espionage, counterespionage, and subversion tactics to combat the Cold War enemy's goal of world domination. The report also highlighted the necessity of reconsidering traditional American concepts of \"fair play\" to ensure national survival. The Doolittle Report recommended exploring scientific and technical approaches to intelligence gathering due to the challenges of human espionage in the closed society of the Eastern Bloc. It found the CIA properly placed in the government and suggested improvements in internal administration, recruitment, training, and document classification. Increased cooperation between different sides of the agency was also advised. The Doolittle Report recommended increased cooperation between the clandestine and analytical sides of the agency, as well as better control of expenditures in covert projects. General Doolittle also expressed concerns about potential policy implementation by the DCI and Secretary of State, who were brothers. In 1956, PBCFIA's chairman directed experienced diplomats and attorneys to address these issues. David Bruce and Robert Lovett were tasked to prepare a report for President Eisenhower on the CIA's covert action programs. The report criticized the CIA for focusing too much on Third-World intrigues and not enough on gathering intelligence on the Soviet Union. It also expressed concerns about the lack of coordination and accountability in the government's psychological and political warfare program. The report highlighted the need for better control of expenditures in covert projects and increased cooperation between the agency's clandestine and analytical sides. The report by Bruce and Lovett criticized the CIA's covert action programs, highlighting concerns about the lack of oversight and accountability. They raised issues regarding the close relationship between Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and DCI Allen W. Dulles, suggesting they could unduly influence U.S. foreign policy. The report recommended reassessing covert action programs and creating a permanent authoritative position to evaluate their impact. A permanent authoritative position was established to assess covert action programs following recommendations from the Second Hoover Commission's Report and General Doolittle's findings. New NSC Directives 5412/1 and 5412/2 were issued in 1955 to regulate covert activities until 1970. President Eisenhower created the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities (PBCFIA) in 1956 to evaluate U.S. intelligence programs, which later became the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) in 1961. Congressional intelligence oversight committees were not established until later. In the 1950s, the Eisenhower Administration supported covert CIA initiatives in Iran and Guatemala to overthrow unfriendly governments. The Bruce-Lovett Report in 1956 set a precedent for future investigations into intelligence activities. The Cuban revolution led to a Communist government under Fidel Castro, justifying covert U.S. actions. An ill-fated U.S. backed invasion of Cuba in April 1961 marked a new chapter in the Cold War. In April 1961, a U.S. backed invasion of Cuba led to a disaster at the Bay of Pigs, exposing direct U.S. involvement. President Kennedy initiated the Taylor Commission and the CIA conducted the Kirkpatrick Report to investigate the operation's failure. The Taylor Commission, chaired by General Maxwell Taylor, investigated the reasons for the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. The 53-page classified report, submitted to President Kennedy in June 1961, focused on administrative issues and criticized the White House, CIA, State Department, and Joint Chiefs of Staff for their roles in organizing and training Cuban exiles for the operation. The Zapata operation, initially planned as a guerrilla operation, expanded into a full-scale military invasion during the Kennedy Administration. The operation's magnitude made it impossible to deny U.S. involvement, with blame placed on the CIA's Directorate of Plans for not fully informing the President. The State Department, JCS, and White House were also criticized for approving and reviewing the operation. The Taylor Commission found the Zapata operation to be ill-conceived with little chance for success, citing President Kennedy's decision to limit overt U.S. air support as a factor in its defeat. The report criticized the decision to protect the operation's covert character, stating that restrictions should only be accepted if they did not impair the chance of success. The failure in communication, coordination, and planning led the Commission to conclude that the Executive Branch was not organized effectively. The Taylor Commission found that the Executive Branch was not prepared to handle the paramilitary operation of Operation Zapata. It recommended the creation of a Strategic Resources Group for better planning and coordination in overall Cold War strategy. The SRG was recommended for planning and coordination of Cold War strategy, including paramilitary operations. The report emphasized involving the JCS in planning and implementation. It also suggested reviewing restraints on the US for more effective asset utilization. The goal remained to remove Castro from power. DCI Dulles ordered an internal investigation by the CIA's Inspector General, which was criticized for being unprofessional. The Kirkpatrick Report criticized the CIA for lack of consultation with Cuban analysts before the invasion, poor internal security, and misleading the President about the operation's success. Kirkpatrick blamed the CIA for the failure of the operation, stating that the Kennedy Administration trusted the Agency's planners. Following the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy reconstituted the PBCFIA as the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). The Taylor Report influenced Kennedy's desire to improve the overall management of the intelligence process. In 1962, President Kennedy instructed the new DCI, John McCone, to focus on community-wide coordination. President Lyndon B. Johnson did not conduct major investigations of the Intelligence Community. During President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration, the Intelligence Community focused on the Vietnam conflict and the Warren Commission investigated President Kennedy's assassination. The Vietnam War led to a shift in resources towards Southeast Asia, and later, the Nixon Administration reviewed the Intelligence Community's organization in response to concerns about its performance. President Nixon commissioned the Office of Management and Budget in December 1970. In December 1970, President Nixon tasked the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review the Intelligence Community's organization. The resulting Schlesinger Report highlighted issues like duplicative collection systems and lack of forward planning in resource allocation. The report aimed to identify areas for constructive change in the Intelligence Community. The Schlesinger Report identified the lack of strong central Intelligence Community leadership as the primary cause of problems in intelligence production. It recommended creating a Director of National Intelligence (DNI), enhancing the DCI's authority, and establishing a Coordinator of National Intelligence (CNI) to oversee the Intelligence Community at the White House level. The report emphasized the need for a strong DCI to control intelligence costs and improve production quality. The Schlesinger Report led to a reorganization of the Intelligence Community to control costs and improve intelligence production quality. This included enhancing the DCI's leadership role in planning, reviewing, and evaluating intelligence programs, establishing boards to assist in budget preparation and supervision of intelligence production. The IRAC was created to advise the DCI on budget preparation but lacked statutory authority. The Nixon directive led to the establishment of the Intelligence Community Staff (ICS) in 1972 to assist the DCI in guiding intelligence collection. However, the ICS lacked statutory authority. In 1992, DCI Robert Gates replaced the ICS with the Community Management Staff (CMS). Public consensus on national security eroded in the late 1960s due to the Vietnam War and Watergate Investigations controversy. The Watergate Investigations in 1972 and revelations of questionable CIA activities led to increased scrutiny of government policies, especially in national security and intelligence. The Ford Administration and Congress conducted three investigations between 1975 and 1976, leading to recommendations for intelligence reform. The Commission on the Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy, created in 1972, also made recommendations for intelligence reform. The Murphy Commission of July 13, 1972, led by Robert D. Murphy, focused on national security processes and intelligence issues. It emphasized the value of intelligence in policymaking and supported the Intelligence Community. The commission highlighted the challenge of DCIs having limited influence over other intelligence agencies. The Murphy Commission recommended that the DCI have an office near the White House and direct contact with the President. They suggested delegating CIA management to a deputy while the DCI focused on community-wide responsibilities. The commission also proposed changing the DCI's title to Director of Foreign Intelligence and enhancing oversight mechanisms. The Murphy Commission recommended enhancing oversight mechanisms for covert actions by a high-level interagency committee, establishing intelligence requirements at the NSC-level, and formalizing a five-year plan for intelligence activities. It also proposed a consolidated foreign intelligence budget and recognized the importance of economic intelligence. The commission recommended strengthening the analytical capabilities of various government departments instead of expanding intelligence agencies. It criticized the practice of drafting National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) by National Intelligence Officers (NIOs) and suggested a small staff of analysts from different agencies to work with NIOs in drafting NIEs. During the Vietnam War and Watergate era, the Intelligence Community faced criticism and scrutiny, leading to publicized congressional hearings in 1975 over alleged intelligence abuses, including assassination plots. The Murphy Commission recommended enhancing analytical capabilities across government departments and criticized the practice of NIOs drafting NIEs, proposing a small staff of analysts from various agencies to assist in the process. In 1975, publicized congressional hearings revealed alleged intelligence abuses, leading to three separate investigations and recommendations. Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller led the Executive Branch investigation, while Senator Frank Church and Representative Otis Pike led investigations in Congress. These efforts resulted in the creation of permanent intelligence committees and closer oversight by Congress. The Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, established in 1975, was chaired by Vice President Rockefeller and included recommendations for reorganization within the Intelligence Community. The Rockefeller Commission, appointed by President Ford, investigated whether the CIA violated the National Security Act of 1947. Its recommendations included limiting the CIA's authority to collect intelligence in the US, strengthening oversight committees, and considering making the CIA budget partially public. The Rockefeller Commission recommended appointing DCIs from outside the CIA career service, limiting their term to 10 years, appointing two deputies, upgrading the Inspector General position, expanding responsibilities of the General Counsel, and developing guidelines for permitted activities. The President should instruct the DCI to only conduct domestic mail openings in times of war and limit mail cover operations to matters of national importance. The Rockefeller Commission recommended limiting CIA involvement in domestic organizations to matters of national security. They advised against internal security tasks and emphasized the need for proper supervision and review to prevent improper activities. The CIA should only infiltrate American organizations with written approval from the DCI if there is a threat to agency operations that cannot be handled by law enforcement agencies. Previous improper investigations should be destroyed, and investigations of CIA personnel should be conducted with specific provisions in place. The Rockefeller Commission recommended limiting CIA involvement in domestic organizations to matters of national security and emphasized the need for proper supervision. Recommendations included establishing appropriate channels between the agency and the Executive Office of the President and prohibiting the testing of drugs and monitoring equipment on unsuspecting persons. An independent agency should oversee civilian uses of aerial photography to prevent improper domestic use of CIA-developed systems. The Church Committee recommended detailed agreements between the CIA and FBI, declassification of classified information, and focused on illegalities and improprieties in all intelligence agencies. It made 183 recommendations in its final report, issued on April 26, 1976. The Church Committee recommended omnibus legislation to define national intelligence activities and their relationship with Congress, including charters for intelligence agencies and clear prohibitions on activities. It also emphasized the role of the National Security Council in directing and monitoring intelligence work. The Church Committee recommended legislation to define national intelligence activities, emphasizing accountability to cabinet-level officials. It proposed that covert actions require presidential authorization and notification to congressional committees. The DCI should be recognized as the President's principal foreign intelligence advisor, responsible for establishing intelligence requirements and budget, guiding operations, and preventing duplication. The Church Committee recommended legislation to define national intelligence activities, emphasizing accountability to cabinet-level officials. It proposed that covert actions require presidential authorization and notification to congressional committees. The DCI should have responsibility for issuing fiscal guidance for national intelligence resources and reprogramming funds within the intelligence budget. Monies for the intelligence budget would be appropriated to the DCI, who should also establish an intelligence community staff. The position of Deputy DCI for the Intelligence Community should be established by statute, separate from the existing DDCI primarily responsible for the CIA. Consideration was urged to separate the DCI from direct responsibility over the CIA. The Church Committee recommended changes to the intelligence community, including limiting the DCI's term to ten years and establishing a more flexible personnel system for analysts. It also suggested barring political assassinations and supporting democratic governments in covert actions. The Church Committee recommended changes to the intelligence community, including limiting the DCI's term to ten years and establishing a more flexible personnel system for analysts. It also suggested barring political assassinations, supporting democratic governments in covert actions, and addressing concerns about CIA involvement with various groups and the covert use of books and publishing houses. The Church Committee recommended stricter regulation and oversight for the CIA, including enhanced positions for the Inspector General and General Counsel. It also suggested changes for other intelligence agencies, such as making the Defense Intelligence Agency part of the civilian Office of the Secretary of Defense and appointing directors of agencies by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Additionally, the committee urged the State Department to implement legislation authorizing certain actions. The committee urged the Administration to issue instructions for ambassadors to receive information on intelligence activities in their assigned countries. State Department efforts to collect foreign information should be improved. Funding for intelligence activities has been included in Defense Department legislation since WWII. The Church Commission recommended making total funding amounts public and empowering the GAO to conduct audits. Intelligence agencies should not test drugs on human subjects without stringent conditions. The committee recommended procedures for security clearances and handling classified information, as well as creating a registry of classified executive orders. The Pike Committee conducted adversarial hearings on intelligence activities and published recommendations in 1976. The Pike Committee's recommendations, published on February 11, 1976, included twenty recommendations related to congressional oversight and covert actions. It recommended prohibiting assassinations in covert actions, establishing a review process for proposals, notifying congressional committees of presidential approval within 48 hours, and setting a 12-month limit on covert actions. The Pike Committee recommended specific legislation to establish the NSA, define its role in monitoring communications, and place it under civilian control. They also recommended disclosing intelligence expenditures in the President's budget, prohibiting fund transfers between agencies involved in intelligence activities, and requiring congressional approval for fund reprogramming. Additionally, the committee suggested separating the DCI from managing any agency. The Pike Committee recommended separating the DCI from managing any agency, focusing on coordinating and overseeing the intelligence effort to eliminate duplication and promote competition in analysis. The DCI would be a member of the National Security Council, have a separate staff, prepare national intelligence estimates and daily briefings for the President, receive budget proposals from intelligence agencies, coordinate agencies under his jurisdiction, and evaluate performance and efficiency. The committee also recommended a full audit of all intelligence agencies by the GAO. The Pike Committee recommended a management and financial audit of all intelligence agencies, access to CIA financial records for internal audit staff, and the establishment of a permanent foreign operations subcommittee of the NSC. It suggested abolishing DIA and dividing its functions between the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the CIA. Intelligence components of the military services would be prohibited from covert actions within the U.S. or against U.S. citizens abroad. Relations between intelligence and law enforcement organizations were to be limited, and intelligence agencies would be barred from funding religious groups. The Pike Committee recommended legislation for classification and declassification of information, the appointment of an Inspector General for Intelligence, and restructuring the CIA into separate agencies for analysis and covert operations. Representative Les Aspin also suggested dividing the CIA. In 1976, recommendations were made for restructuring the CIA into separate agencies for analysis and covert operations. This included creating a Director General of Intelligence to advise the President on intelligence matters and a separate director of the CIA for day-to-day operations. Ray Cline, a former Deputy Director of the CIA, also suggested giving the DCI broad supervisory powers over the entire intelligence community and dividing the CIA into two agencies. In 1976, recommendations were made to restructure the CIA into separate agencies for analysis and covert operations. This included creating a Director General of Intelligence and a separate CIA director for day-to-day operations. Ray Cline proposed giving the DCI supervisory powers over the intelligence community and dividing the CIA into two agencies. Legislation was introduced in 1978 to provide statutory charters to intelligence agencies and create a Director of National Intelligence. Legislation introduced in 1978 aimed to restructure the CIA into separate agencies for analysis and covert operations, creating a Director of National Intelligence. The draft legislation faced criticism for its extensive reporting requirements and restrictions on activities. Despite the introduction of charter legislation in the 96th Congress, the bills were never reported out of the intelligence committees. Charter legislation in the 96th Congress loosened freedom of information regulations for intelligence agencies and reduced the number of committees notified of covert actions. It faced heavy criticism but a shorter bill eventually became law in October 1980 as part of the FY1981 Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L. 96-450). The Executive Branch also took action to prevent further congressional involvement. The Executive Branch implemented limited recommendations from various proposals through detailed Executive Orders by Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan. Executive Order 11905, issued by President Ford in 1976, designated the DCI as the President's primary intelligence advisor and outlined responsibilities for intelligence agencies and internal review committees. President Carter issued Executive Order 12036 in 1978, superseding E.O. 11905. The new order established NSC-level committees for internal review of intelligence operations and a separate Intelligence Oversight Board. It placed restrictions on surveillance of American citizens by intelligence agencies and clarified the DCI's authority in budget, tasking, and foreign liaison. Additionally, it recognized the National Foreign Intelligence Program budget and the National Intelligence Tasking Center. President Reagan continued to enhance the DCI's authority with Executive Order 12333 in 1981, detailing the roles and responsibilities of the Intelligence Community. This order designates the DCI as the primary intelligence advisor to the President and NSC, with duties including implementing special activities, liaising with foreign intelligence agencies, and protecting the community's sources and methods. Executive Order 12333 in 1981 granted the DCI full responsibility for national foreign intelligence production and dissemination, authority to task non-CIA intelligence agencies, and more explicit control over NFIP development. It relaxed restrictions on operations, focusing on authorizations rather than restrictions, establishing a presumption in favor of government needs over individual rights. However, the DCI still lacked statutory authority over all operations. In 1985, Admiral Stansfield Turner recommended intelligence reform, proposing the separation of the roles of DCI and head of the CIA to create a Director of National Intelligence superior to the CIA. Turner emphasized less focus on covert action. The CIA and DCI Casey were under scrutiny during investigations of covert support to Iran and the Nicaraguan Resistance. National Security Council staff got involved due to restrictions on intelligence agencies in Central America. A review chaired by Senator John Tower highlighted the need for clear procedures for covert actions and less involvement of NSC policy officials in intelligence estimates. The congressional investigation into covert support to Iran and the Nicaraguan Resistance resulted in recommendations for changes in laws and regulations governing intelligence activities. Recommendations included the need for presidential findings to initiate covert actions, findings to be in writing and shared with Congress within 48 hours, and the appointment of statutory inspector general and general counsels for the CIA. Minority members recommended improvements in congressional oversight. The two committees recommended changes to congressional oversight of covert actions, suggesting notifications to only four Members of Congress instead of eight. These recommendations were considered in the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY1991. A major restructuring of the U.S. Intelligence Community was proposed in 1992 by Senator David Boren and Representative Dave McCurdy. The proposed restructuring of the U.S. Intelligence Community in 1992 included creating a Director of National Intelligence (DNI) with authority over intelligence funds and personnel, two Deputy Directors of National Intelligence (DDNIs), and a separate Director of the CIA subordinate to the DNI. The proposed restructuring of the U.S. Intelligence Community in 1992 included consolidating analytical and estimative efforts, creating a National Imagery Agency within the Department of Defense, and authorizing the Director of DIA to task defense intelligence agencies with collection requirements. The 1992 proposed restructuring of the U.S. Intelligence Community aimed to consolidate analytical efforts and create a National Imagery Agency within the Department of Defense. The Boren-McCurdy legislation, which would have provided statutory mandates for intelligence agencies, was not adopted, but provisions were added to the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization Act to outline the DCI's coordinative responsibilities. Opposition from the Defense Department hindered the legislation's adoption. The Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community was established in 1994 to assess the future direction and structure of the Intelligence Community. The commission, initially chaired by Les Aspin and later by Harold Brown, made recommendations for organizational changes to enhance guidance provided to intelligence agencies. The Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community recommended changes to enhance guidance for intelligence agencies, focusing on global crime and coordination between law enforcement and intelligence communities. It proposed the establishment of an NSC Committee on Global Crime and designated the Attorney General to coordinate the nation's law enforcement response to global crime. The Commission also emphasized the need for better coordination of activities overseas and the sharing of relevant information between agencies. The Aspin/Brown Commission recommended the establishment of two new deputies to the DCI, one for the Intelligence Community and one for day-to-day management of the CIA. The DCI would have new tools for intelligence budget oversight and authority over personnel systems. The Commission also suggested realigning intelligence budgeting procedures for better management across agencies. The Aspin/Brown Commission recommended providing the DCI with sufficient staff capability to assess tradeoffs between programs and establish a uniform resource data base for the Intelligence Community. They also recommended disclosing total amounts appropriated for intelligence activities, which was implemented for Fiscal Years 1997 and 1998. Additionally, they suggested that appointments to intelligence committees should not be limited in duration. The House Intelligence Committee also conducted a review of intelligence in 1995-1996. The House Intelligence Committee conducted a review of intelligence in 1995-1996. The IC21 Staff Study recommended a more \"corporate\" intelligence community with strengthened central management, reinforced core competencies, and consolidated infrastructure. Specific recommendations included giving the DCI a stronger voice in appointing directors of defense agencies and greater control over intelligence budgets and personnel. The IC21 Staff Study recommended establishing a Committee on Foreign Intelligence within the National Security Council, creating two DDCIs for CIA management and IC-wide budgeting, separating the Clandestine Service from the CIA, and establishing a Technical Collection Agency for directing all collection tasking. The IC21 Staff Study recommended creating a Committee on Foreign Intelligence within the National Security Council, two DDCIs for CIA management and IC-wide budgeting, separating the Clandestine Service from the CIA, and establishing a Technical Collection Agency for directing all collection tasking. Additionally, recommendations included setting common standards and protocols for technical collection systems, establishing a Technology Development Office for research and development, and strengthening congressional oversight through a joint intelligence committee or making the House intelligence committee a standing committee without tenure limits. The Intelligence Renewal and Reform Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-293) established two committees within the NSC to address foreign intelligence and transnational threats. The Act also created the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) by combining elements from intelligence agencies and the Defense Mapping Agency. The Intelligence Renewal and Reform Act of 1996 established two deputy DCI positions, one for Deputy DCI and the other for a Deputy DCI for Community Management. These positions focused on coordinating intelligence agencies and ensuring effective information sharing about transnational threats among Federal departments and agencies. Additionally, the legislation provided for three assistant DCIs for Collection, Analysis and Production of Intelligence, and Administration. Congress did not establish a separate position for a head of the CIA. The Intelligence Renewal and Reform Act of 1996 established positions for Deputy DCI and Deputy DCI for Community Management to coordinate intelligence agencies. It also created three assistant DCI positions for Collection, Analysis and Production of Intelligence, and Administration. The statute required the DCI's concurrence in appointments to major defense intelligence agencies and other key positions. The Intelligence Renewal and Reform Act of 1996 established positions for Deputy DCI and Deputy DCI for Community Management to coordinate intelligence agencies. It also created three assistant DCI positions for Collection, Analysis and Production of Intelligence, and Administration. The act gave the DCI authority to develop an annual budget for the National Foreign Intelligence Program and participate in the development of intelligence programs with the Secretary of Defense. President Clinton signed the legislation but expressed concerns about provisions related to the creation of new NSC committees. President Clinton criticized provisions in the Intelligence Renewal and Reform Act of 1996 that intrude upon Executive prerogatives and responsibilities, particularly those dictating the creation of new NSC committees and requiring the DCI to concur before appointing certain intelligence officials. He also expressed concerns about the constitutionality of limitations on the President's advice-receiving ability and appointment authority. Additionally, he noted strong opposition from DCI John Deutch to provisions establishing three new assistant DCIs requiring Senate confirmation. President Clinton criticized provisions in the Intelligence Renewal and Reform Act of 1996 that intrude upon Executive prerogatives and responsibilities, particularly those dictating the creation of new NSC committees and requiring the DCI to concur before appointing certain intelligence officials. He also expressed concerns about the constitutionality of limitations on the President's advice-receiving ability and appointment authority. Additionally, he noted strong opposition from DCI John Deutch to provisions establishing three new assistant DCIs requiring Senate confirmation. George Tenet, nominated to succeed Deutch, expressed willingness to make changes to meet Senate objectives and indicated that the DCI's statutory responsibilities for coordinating intelligence agencies were adequate. In May 1998, the Senate Intelligence Committee held a hearing on the nomination of Joan A. Dempsey as the first Deputy DCI for Community Management. In opening remarks, Chairman Shelby noted discussions with the executive branch regarding positions established by P.L.104-293. An accommodation has been reached with the Director of Central Intelligence on these positions. The President is expected to nominate an Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Administration soon. The DCI is allowed to fill the positions of ADCI for Collection and ADCI for Analysis and Production without Senate consent for up to one year. Dempsey highlighted the fundamental problem of intelligence organization in her testimony. The fear of a powerful DCI not supporting the DOD with intelligence was noted, along with concerns about DOD subverting the DCI's role. Despite this, mechanisms like the Defense Resources Board and Intelligence Program Review Group have helped in finding solutions. Relations between the DOD and DCI have generally been good, with the Senate Intelligence Committee considering the nomination of James Simon as Assistant DCI for Administration. Kerrey noted the appointment of Acting Assistant Directors by the DCI and expected Presidential nominations soon. The Intelligence Community resisted appointing Assistant Directors for collection and analysis after the 1997 Authorization Act. Simon testified about creating a process to meet the needs of all customers. He emphasized the importance of a capable staff for coordination missions. The FY1997 Act established statutory provisions for the DCI's community-wide role, but efforts to fully implement it have not been successful. Dempsey and Simon served in their positions for several years before changes were made in 2003. Larry Kindsvater was confirmed as DDCI for Community Management in July 2004. Nominations for assistant DCI positions have not been submitted. The FY1997 Act established four new Senate-confirmed positions with responsibilities across intelligence agencies. However, nominations for these positions have been limited, with only two individuals confirmed and sworn in before leaving office in 2003. Observers believe the DCI's authorities in budget preparation for intelligence agencies have not been fully utilized. Efforts to repeal these provisions are unlikely due to ongoing scrutiny of intelligence agencies post-9/11 attacks. The Pentagon and congressional intelligence committees conducted a Joint Inquiry into the Intelligence Community's activities post-9/11 attacks. The committees recommended amending the National Security Act to create a Director of National Intelligence separate from the CIA, with full management responsibilities for the entire U.S. Intelligence Community. The committees recommended legislative changes to reorganize the Intelligence Community, similar to the Goldwater-Nichols Act for the Defense Department. Senator Richard Shelby also proposed organizational changes to address the fragmented authority within the IC. Senator Richard Shelby proposed giving the \"office of the DCI more management and budgetary authority over IC organs, separate from the job of the CIA Director.\" He suggested re-examining the National Security Act to separate analytical functions from collection responsibilities to avoid self-interested bureaucratic behavior. Shelby acknowledged the challenge of centralizing budgets from the Defense Department but emphasized the need for a true DCI. Senator Richard Shelby proposed restructuring the Intelligence Community to be agile in evolving threats, cautioning against solely focusing on fighting terrorists. The 9/11 Commission, established by the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2003, made recommendations on addressing the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission recommended restructuring the Intelligence Community by establishing a National Counterterrorism Center and a Director of National Intelligence to address organizational issues and improve community performance. The Director of National Intelligence would have control over budget, hiring/firing senior managers, and setting standards for information infrastructure and personnel. The DNI would oversee agencies with three deputies, each holding key positions in component agencies. The 9/11 Commission recommends a separate intelligence appropriation act to be made public. The restructuring of the U.S. Intelligence Community has led to changes in oversight by both the executive branch and congressional committees. The position of the DCI has been strengthened, but they do not have authority over agencies other than the CIA. Despite efforts to improve intelligence capabilities, challenges remain following the September 2001 attacks and inaccurate intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The need for reorganizing the Intelligence Community has become evident due to intelligence estimates about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Legislation to reorganize the nation's intelligence effort, including S. 2845, is under consideration, and the 9/11 Commission's recommendations are gaining interest in Congress."
