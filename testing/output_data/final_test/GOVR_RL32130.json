    "content": "During the Cold War, U.S. nuclear policy focused on deterring a Soviet attack. The end of the Cold War led to a reduction in U.S. nuclear weapons development efforts, including halting testing, canceling weapons development, and withdrawing battlefield nuclear weapons. Personnel in the nuclear weapons complex also decreased. The United States halted nuclear testing in 1992 and worked towards negotiating the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The Clinton Administration changed the test readiness posture to 24 to 36 months after the moratorium. The George W. Bush Administration had a different stance on nuclear weapons policy, influenced by the September 11 attacks, leading to the delivery of a Nuclear Posture Review to Congress in December 2001. The NPR under the George W. Bush Administration focused on a capabilities-based approach for nuclear weapons, moving away from solely countering the Soviet threat. This approach included a \"new triad\" of strike forces, defenses, and infrastructure to address multiple contingencies and new threats. The goal was to assure allies and friends of the US's ability to respond to military needs. The NPR under the George W. Bush Administration focused on a capabilities-based approach for nuclear weapons, moving away from solely countering the Soviet threat. The goal was to assure allies and friends of the US's ability to respond to military needs by retaining Cold War-era nuclear weapons at lower levels and targeting terrorist-related facilities and facilities for producing or storing weapons of mass destruction. The end of the Cold War changed constraints on nuclear weapons use, focusing on targeting specific threats in rogue states like hard and deeply buried facilities for WMD production. Weapons were designed to achieve required damage probabilities on targets, with reducing collateral damage being secondary. The U.S. nuclear policy aims to use weapons with characteristics to defeat chemical and biological agents while minimizing collateral damage. Earth penetration and increased accuracy reduce the yield needed to destroy targets, making it more feasible. These weapons would need to be readily available for specific threats with little warning, potentially targeting only a handful of targets in rogue states. The National Nuclear Security Administration believes that a nuclear stockpile with these capabilities would serve as a more credible deterrent than the Cold War stockpile. Some critics oppose developing nuclear weapons with lower yield and reduced collateral damage, arguing that it blurs the line between conventional and nuclear weapons. They believe the current U.S. nuclear arsenal is sufficient against various threats, including hardened and deeply buried targets. The United States is urged to seek international support in the war on terrorism, which may involve sharing information, securing radioactive material, and cooperating on nuclear nonproliferation. This comes after steps were taken to halt work on new weapon types, with critics questioning the need for such developments. Critics argue that the US's nuclear initiatives, such as developing new weapons, contradict pledges made to support nuclear disarmament. They believe that reducing the time to conduct a nuclear test implies an intent to test, which could harm global cooperation on nonproliferation efforts. Critics fear that the US's nuclear initiatives, including developing new weapons and reducing the time for nuclear testing, may lead other nations to believe the US is more willing to use nuclear weapons. International concern has been raised by the New Agenda Coalition over the broader role of nuclear weapons in security strategies. This could potentially undermine US security by provoking nations that may be targets of US nuclear actions. Critics fear that US nuclear initiatives may prompt other nations to acquire nuclear weapons for deterrence. North Korea and Iran are believed to have active nuclear programs, with North Korea claiming to possess nuclear weapons. However, the effectiveness of nuclear weapons in military terms is questioned, as conventional weapons could still defeat deeply buried targets. The effectiveness of low-yield nuclear weapons for destroying biological or chemical agents is uncertain, and intelligence may struggle to locate targets in underground complexes. Nations could counter earth penetrators by burying facilities more deeply, rendering nuclear weapons of any yield of little use. Substituting radioactive materials for biological or chemical agents may offer little advantage to the local population or U.S. troops. A provision in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act barred R&D that could lead to production by the United States of a nuclear weapon of less than 5 kilotons (kt) that had not entered production by November 1993. The Spratt-Furse provision, also known as the PLYWD provision, was repealed in the FY2004 NDAA, but testing, acquisition, or deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons still require specific congressional authorization. The FY2005 budget does not include a request related to this provision. The debate over the Spratt-Furse provision focused on the military utility of 5-kt weapons. Lifting the ban was argued to be necessary for training weapon designers and developing new weapons, but opponents were concerned about increasing the likelihood of using nuclear weapons. However, low-yield nuclear weapons have uncertain military utility, requiring substantial advances in understanding their effects for assessment. Military utility comes from prompt effects that can be measured precisely. The prompt effects of low-yield nuclear weapons are influenced by factors like accuracy and local features, making modeling more complex compared to high-yield weapons. Detailed engineering studies and computer models are needed to understand the effects accurately. Detailed engineering studies and computer models are crucial for understanding the effects of low-yield nuclear weapons, especially in urban environments where structures can significantly modify the blast effects. The effects of low-yield nuclear weapons in urban environments differ significantly from large yield effects, with uncertainties making estimation difficult. These weapons could be used for specific missions like destroying bridges or troop concentrations, but advancements in accuracy now allow conventional weapons to target small objectives and attack troop concentrations. However, low-yield nuclear weapons may still have military value for destroying targets that previously required larger weapons, despite facing uncertainties. Low-yield weapons face uncertainties in targeting buried facilities, with George Miller noting that most low-yield concepts have yields greater than 5 kt. The U.S. military became more interested in low-yield weapons after the 1991 Persian Gulf War for attacking underground structures. The Air Force sought new low-yield warheads to destroy Saddam's bunkers in 1991. Efforts to develop precision low-yield weapons continued despite nuclear testing moratorium legislation in 1992. In 1993, the House Armed Services Committee opposed DOE's efforts to study low-yield nuclear weapons, citing concerns about blurring the line between conventional and nuclear weapons. The committee included a provision in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act to bar R&D on these weapons. The committee recommends discontinuing work on very low yield nuclear weapons due to concerns about blurring the line between conventional and nuclear conflict, undermining efforts to discourage nuclear weapons development, and questionable utility compared to precision guided conventional munitions. The committee recommends discontinuing work on very low yield nuclear weapons to prevent blurring the line between conventional and nuclear conflict and to discourage nuclear weapons development in other countries. The provision clarifies that the prohibition applies to activities leading to the production of new low-yield weapons, while allowing research for counter-proliferation purposes. The legislation prohibits research and development of low-yield nuclear weapons in the United States, aiming to prevent blurring the line between conventional and nuclear conflict and discourage similar weapons development in other countries. The Department of Energy is allowed to conduct research for counter-proliferation purposes and for modifying existing weapons for safety or reliability. The United States policy prohibits research and development of new low-yield nuclear weapons, including precision low-yield warheads. The Secretary of Energy is restricted from conducting such research unless it is for testing devices with less than five kilotons yield, modifying existing weapons for safety or reliability, or addressing proliferation concerns. The term 'low-yield nuclear weapon' refers to a weapon with a yield of less than five kilotons. The Department of Energy is prohibited from actions that could result in producing such weapons, unless specific exemptions apply. The legality of any action involving low-yield nuclear weapons is highly dependent on the circumstances. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a provision for the Secretaries of Defense and Energy to assess defeating hardened and deeply buried targets, allowing DOE to conduct necessary research and development. This provision clarifies DOE's ability to support DOD studies and options assessments for such targets. The committee believes that DOE should assist DOD in reviewing and defeating hardened and deeply buried targets, as it will remain a significant challenge in the future. The conference bill, H.R. 4205, includes a provision for a study on this topic to be conducted by the Secretaries of Defense and Energy. The conference bill, H.R. 4205, requires a study by the Secretaries of Defense and Energy to review U.S. requirements to defeat hardened and deeply buried targets, assess options, and determine capability and cost of each option. DOE should provide information to help DOD make informed decisions on new methods or modifications to existing law. The DOD-DOE report from July 2001 discussed the challenge posed by hardened and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) to the United States, emphasizing the need to defeat these facilities to prevent adversaries from using them as sanctuaries for attacks. It also highlighted the threat of buried facilities containing chemical or biological weapons. The DOD-DOE report from July 2001 addressed the challenge of defeating hardened and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) to prevent adversaries from using them as sanctuaries for attacks. It also discussed the potential problem of buried facilities containing chemical or biological weapons, emphasizing the need for multiple types of payloads to achieve various objectives, such as in situ neutralization of agents and access-denial to prevent their recovery and use. The report highlighted the difficulty in defeating HDBTs and mentioned the potential value of nuclear weapons for this mission. The report highlighted the potential value of nuclear weapons for defeating hardened and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) that cannot be targeted with conventional or current nuclear weapons. Additional investment in intelligence, special weapons, and counter-WMD capabilities, including nuclear weapons, is necessary to address emerging strategic threats. Nuclear weapons have the unique ability to destroy agent containers and CBW agents, with high accuracy and the use of lower-yield weapons being possible for buried targets. The report emphasized the potential value of nuclear weapons for defeating hardened and deeply buried targets. Using lower-yield weapons could reduce collateral effects. However, the DOD-DOE report concluded that there is no defined requirement for a nuclear weapon for WMD Agent Defeat missions. The FY2002 National Defense Authorization Act did not address the issue of low-yield nuclear weapons or nuclear earth penetrators. The leaked excerpts of the congressionally-mandated Nuclear Posture Review in March 2002 stated various points. The leaked excerpts of the congressionally-mandated Nuclear Posture Review in March 2002 highlighted the potential value of nuclear weapons for defeating hardened and deeply buried targets, emphasizing the use of lower-yield weapons to reduce collateral effects. Representative Weldon proposed an amendment to the FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act that would repeal the Spratt-Furse provision under certain conditions related to nuclear testing and national security interests. The 1993 provision on low-yield nuclear weapon development was modified by Weldon to allow research but not development. The amendment passed in the House, but not in the Senate bill. Understanding the phases of weapon development is crucial for discussing legislation on low-yield R&D. The phases include weapon conception, program study, and detailed engineering design work. The phases of weapon development include weapon conception, program study, design definition, development engineering, production engineering, first production, quantity production, and retirement. Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories design nuclear explosive components, while Sandia National Laboratories design nonnuclear components. No new warhead has been designed since the 1980s. In phases 3 and 4, the phase 2a design would be turned into a detailed design for a producible weapon through computer simulation, testing, etc. For alterations and modifications of existing weapons, the phase structure is repeated in phase 6.X with different names: concept assessment, feasibility study, design definition, development engineering, production engineering, first production, and full-scale production. Section 3143 of P.L. 107-314 required DOE to have a single line item for all funds requested for R&D that could lead to U.S. production of a new weapon. The legislation requires a single line item for R&D funds related to new nuclear weapons in specific phases, with each weapon activity in higher phases to be listed separately. The definition of a \"new nuclear weapon\" is clarified, and the transition between phases is noted for cost increase. This approach enhances visibility, aids congressional oversight, and prevents programs from being grouped together. The Administration seeks to repeal the Spratt-Furse provision restricting low-yield nuclear weapon R&D, citing Section 3136 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. This provision prohibits the Secretary of Energy from conducting research that could lead to the production of a new low-yield nuclear weapon. The Administration aims to repeal the Spratt-Furse provision limiting low-yield nuclear weapon research, hindering efforts to counter WMD threats. A revitalized nuclear weapons advanced concepts effort is crucial for training scientists, engineers, and maintaining a responsive nuclear weapons enterprise. The provision has impeded exploration of technical options, not just research on low-yield warheads. The PLYWD legislation prohibits activities that could enhance US warhead production, hindering exploration of new weapons concepts for national security. Repealing PLYWD does not commit the US to developing low-yield warheads without Congressional authorization and funding. The Senate bill, S. 1050, contained a repeal of the low-yield nuclear weapon ban, sparking a debate among Senators about the potential risks of nuclear proliferation and the shift in American foreign and nuclear policy. The Senate debated amendments regarding the development of low-yield nuclear weapons, with Senator Reed proposing restrictions on engineering development that could lead to new warheads. Senator Warner countered with a requirement for congressional authorization before proceeding with any phases of a low-yield weapon project. The Senate passed amendments regarding low-yield nuclear weapons, with Senator Warner's amendment requiring congressional authorization for any phases of a low-yield weapon project. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004 was also passed, modifying the low-yield provision substantially. The FY1994 provision regarding low-yield nuclear weapons was amended by Representative Spratt. The amendment revised the limitation on the Secretary of Energy from conducting research and development for a low-yield nuclear weapon that has not entered production. The amendment clarified the activities permitted for concept studies, feasibility studies, and engineering design work. The amendment drew a line between permitted and prohibited activities for different phases of development. The amendment to the FY1994 provision on low-yield nuclear weapons allows research on weapons with yields less than five kilotons but prohibits development engineering activities beyond phase 2a/6.2a. It clarifies that concept studies, feasibility studies, and engineering design work are permitted, but subsequent development is not allowed. The amendment strikes a balance between the original provision and the Administration's proposed changes. The amendment to the FY1994 provision on low-yield nuclear weapons allows research on weapons with yields less than five kilotons but prohibits development engineering activities beyond phase 2a/6.2a. It clarifies that concept studies, feasibility studies, and engineering design work are permitted, but subsequent development is not allowed. The new language narrows the applicability of the phrase \"which could lead to production\" and focuses on whether the development or production is of an actual low-yield weapon. The House passed the bill, as amended, on May 22, 361-68, addressing ambiguities in R&D activities that could lead to the production of low-yield nuclear weapons. The Senate and House approached the issue of low-yield nuclear weapons differently. The Senate bill would rescind the low-yield R&D provision and require explicit congressional authorization for engineering development. The House bill retained the low-yield ban but with modifications. Both bills aimed to clarify the line between permitted activities and those requiring congressional approval for development beyond phase 2a/6.2a. The House language was less clear on this distinction. The House and Senate disagreed on the authorization process for new nuclear weapons. The House agreed to the conference report, while the Senate viewed funding as explicit authorization. The President signed the measure into law on November 24, repealing the Spratt-Furse provision. The repeal of the Spratt-Furse provision prohibits R&D on low-yield nuclear weapons without specific congressional authorization. It also requires an assessment of any changes needed to achieve nonproliferation objectives. The requirement for an assessment of changes to achieve U.S. nonproliferation objectives is unclear. The issue of low-yield R&D in the FY2005 cycle is less prominent. NNSA denies plans to develop new low-yield weapons. NNSA denies plans to develop new low-yield weapons in FY2005, stating there are no requirements or funds allocated for such research. Supporters of the ban argue that new weapons could increase the likelihood of nuclear weapon acquisition and use by broadening the President's options. Critics believe the Administration aims to lift the ban on low-yield nuclear weapons, leading to their development, production, and deployment. Senator Feinstein and Senator Biden express concerns about the potential consequences of repealing the ban. Critics are concerned about the development and deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons, warning that it could lead to a dangerous signal of intent to fight a nuclear war. Senator Kennedy emphasized that a mini-nuke is still a nuke and using it would only escalate towards nuclear war. The decision to move forward with these weapons lies with Congress, with approval not guaranteed. The provision repealing Spratt-Furse in the Senate Armed Services Committee's bill does not authorize testing, acquisition, or deployment of these weapons. Senator Kyl stated that the repeal does not authorize the testing, acquisition, or deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons. He emphasized that having more weapons does not mean they will be used, as the threshold for using nuclear weapons remains high. The United States had low-yield nuclear weapons in the past during significant national security challenges, but those challenges never reached the nuclear threshold. Low-yield weapons may lead to nuclear proliferation as other nations may feel the need for nuclear weapons for their security. Critics argue that resuming low-yield R&D could result in nuclear testing, potentially prompting others to do the same. The effectiveness of nonproliferation efforts is highlighted as an important restraint against nuclear proliferation. The NPT is crucial for nuclear nonproliferation, with a key decision in 1995 to extend the treaty indefinitely. Resuming nuclear testing could undermine the nonproliferation regime. Opponents of the ban on low-yield weapons argue that studying such weapons would not lead to nuclear proliferation, as nations act in their own interests regarding security. They point out that other nations do not have such a prohibition, and lifting it would bring the United States to parity. Critics question the utility of the NPT, citing examples of countries like North Korea and Iran making progress on their nuclear programs despite being party to the treaty. They believe that U.S. actions, even on preliminary studies of possible weapons, will not make other nations more likely to develop WMDs. Opponents of the ban on low-yield weapons argue that studying such weapons would not lead to nuclear proliferation. They believe that U.S. actions, even on preliminary studies of possible weapons, will not make other nations more likely to develop WMDs. The United States has decades of experience with low-yield nuclear weapons, including those with altered radiation outputs. Use of existing, tested designs, perhaps with modifications not requiring testing, would provide high confidence. Understanding the effects of low-yield weapons is essential for assessing their military value. Some argue that there is little meaningful use for these weapons, as demonstrated in the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars. Targeting challenges, such as locating suitable targets and defeating them with conventional weapons, make the utility of low-yield weapons questionable. Additionally, factors like deep burial, tunnel complexes, and deception tactics in rogue states could hinder the effectiveness of nuclear weapons even if targets are identified. Low-yield nuclear weapons may not be effective against rogue states due to challenges in locating and destroying targets in cities. Detonating a 5-kiloton weapon near a city like Damascus could result in significant casualties. Despite military interest in low-yield weapons for specific capabilities, their overall military value is debated. US Strategic Command is interested in studying new technologies for nuclear weapons, including precision, increased penetration, and reduced yields. The ban on low-yield R&D hinders the assessment of sub-5-kt weapons' value and design for specific missions. Senators argue that lifting the ban would provide valuable research for national security decisions. The ban also increases the lead time to develop low-yield weapons if needed. The Administration requested $21.0 million for the Advanced Concepts Initiative (ACI) in FY2004, with $15.0 million allocated for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) weapon and $6.0 million for other advanced weapon concepts. The ACI program involves studies by weapons personnel at Los Alamos, Livermore, and Sandia to explore new warhead designs and modifications to meet DoD needs. The program aims to develop and exercise capability to examine options for new nuclear weapons. The Administration requested $21.0 million for the Advanced Concepts Initiative (ACI) in FY2004, with $15.0 million allocated for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) weapon and $6.0 million for other advanced weapon concepts. The FY2004 NDAA and EWDAA provided $6.0 million for ACI, but conferees on the latter made $4.0 million available for authorization only after delivery of a DOE-DOD report on the nuclear stockpile. ACI may be limited to a budget of $2 million for much if not all of FY2004. The FY2005 request for ACI is $9.0 million. During the Cold War, weapons laboratories had small teams studying advanced weapons concepts using various tools. Team members worked on advanced concepts for a year or two and interacted with various organizations. The end of the Cold War marked the end of nuclear weapons development. Since the end of the Cold War, weapons laboratories wound down their advanced concepts programs in the 1990s. Calls have been made to reestablish these programs, emphasizing their value in maintaining engineering skills and training new employees. The focus remains on sustaining current weapons through the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The Chiles report of 1999 and the Foster panel's FY1999 report both highlighted the importance of exploratory development programs at the labs. The leaked version of the Nuclear Posture Review suggests exploring new nuclear weapon options, such as modifying existing weapons for flexibility, developing earth-penetrating weapons, and creating warheads to reduce collateral damage. The National Nuclear Security Administration plans to reestablish advanced warhead concepts teams at national laboratories to assess these options for meeting military requirements. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) will reestablish advanced warhead concepts teams at national laboratories and headquarters in Washington to train the next generation of weapon designers and engineers. NNSA and the Department of Defense will review potential programs for nuclear capabilities, including the need for nuclear testing to field new warheads. Additionally, funding will support participation in Air Force concept studies for enhancing and modernizing current warheads, with a focus on enhancing computer modeling at Los Alamos. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is reestablishing advanced warhead concepts teams at national laboratories and headquarters to train the next generation of weapon designers and engineers. Los Alamos will enhance computer modeling and simulation capability, Sandia will focus on \"mission end-to-end command and control,\" and Livermore will study \"design to effect\" for nuclear weapons. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended authorizing the full $21.0 million for Advanced Concepts in FY2004. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is reestablishing advanced warhead concepts teams at national laboratories and headquarters to train the next generation of weapon designers and engineers. The committee recommended more significant future investment in Advanced Concepts activities and urged NNSA to proceed with its advanced concepts initiative. The House rejected a proposal to transfer funds from Advanced Concepts to conventional programs. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the nuclear program in its report on H.R. 2754. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the flawed budget process of the nuclear weapons program, questioning the legitimacy of requests due to outdated stockpiles and facilities from the Cold War era. They highlighted the lack of debate on the $6 billion annual spending on DOE's nuclear weapons complex as a national security investment. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the DOE's nuclear weapons budget, questioning the legitimacy of requests and highlighting management issues within NNSA. They expressed concerns about the pursuit of new initiatives without proven success in the Stockpile Stewardship program. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the DOE's nuclear weapons budget, questioning the legitimacy of requests and highlighting management issues within NNSA. They expressed concerns about the pursuit of new initiatives without proven success in the Stockpile Stewardship program. The Committee recommended eliminating funding for ACI due to concerns about NNSA's ability to meet its primary mission. The House passed H.R. 2754 without amendments related to ACI or other Weapons Activities provisions. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, recommended providing the full amount requested for ACI. The Senate passed H.R. 2754 on September 16, with various amendments including barring funds for advanced nuclear weapon concepts like RNEP. Senator Reed's amendment aimed to align the appropriations bill with language from the FY2004 Defense authorization bill. Senator Bingaman's amendment also restricted spending on additional studies under ACI until a detailed report is provided by NNSA for FY2004 activities. The Senate passed bill H.R. 2754 on September 16, 92-0, with non-RNEP ACI not expected to be a point of contention in the defense authorization conference. However, it was a topic of discussion in the energy and water conference, with potential debates on funding levels and the impact on NNSA projects. The Senate also passed two amendments related to nuclear weapon programs. The Senate passed bill H.R. 2754 on September 16, 92-0, with non-RNEP ACI not expected to be a point of contention in the defense authorization conference. An issue faced by energy and water conferees was the gulf between House Appropriations Committee and House Armed Services Committee reports on nuclear initiatives. The House agreed to the conference report on the EWDAA, and the President signed the NDAA into law on December 1, providing the requested $6.0 million for non-RNEP ACI. The NDAA provided $6.0 million for non-RNEP ACI on December 1. The EWDAA allocated $6.0 million for Advanced Concepts, with $4.0 million available after submission of a revised Nuclear Weapons Stockpile plan. The plan includes reducing operationally deployed weapons to 1,700-2,200 by 2012. ACI funds are limited to $2.0 million until the report is submitted. The conferees included an amendment barring spending on ACI until 30 days after NNSA submits a report detailing planned activities. The report was submitted on March 3, 2004, suspending activities until April 2. The language requiring a DOE-DOD report on the link between the stockpile plan and the President's planned nuclear force structure addressed concerns about maintaining all contingencies regardless of likelihood. The Department of Defense needs to determine the stockpile composition to support the President's stockpile reductions and coordinate with DOE for nuclear weapons complex requirements. The FY2005 request for ACI activities is $9.0 million, focusing on developing advanced concepts for the future stockpile and conducting design studies. Senator Reed's amendment on RNEP restricts funds for advanced nuclear weapons concepts. NNSA Administrator Brooks highlighted the goals of the Advanced Concepts Initiative (ACI), including enhancing safety, security, and weapon design capabilities without testing. The FY2005 budget request for ACI includes projected budgets for FY2006-FY2009, with increasing funding each year. Various stakeholders, including the Administration, DOD, NNSA, and nuclear weapons laboratories, see numerous benefits in ACI, with detailed plans for implementation. The Advanced Concepts Initiative (ACI) aims to enhance safety, security, and weapon design capabilities without testing. Stakeholders, including weapons lab personnel, support ACI for its potential benefits. The debate over ACI, low-yield weapons, and RNEP revolves around the need for new nuclear weapons for deterrence. George Miller of Livermore emphasizes the dynamic nature of deterrence in relation to evolving threats. The debate over the need for new nuclear weapons for deterrence revolves around whether nuclear weapons should evolve to respond to changing threats. Critics argue that existing weapons are sufficient for deterring other nations from using nuclear weapons against the United States. The Administration is seeking additional capabilities from nuclear weapons beyond deterring a U.S.-Russian nuclear war. The Administration is seeking additional capabilities from nuclear weapons beyond deterrence, aiming to dissuade other countries from military competitions and counter threats of WMD. The goal involves having potential adversaries take certain actions, such as Iran opening its nuclear facilities to inspection and North Korea halting work on nuclear weapons. The Administration aims to go beyond deterrence with nuclear weapons, seeking to dissuade countries from military competitions and WMD threats. Coercion, involving the threat of force to eliminate potential threats, is considered as a strategy to achieve these goals. This shift may impact the type of weapons needed for implementing the new policy. The new policy aims to make U.S. nuclear forces more credible for deterrence by developing lower-yield weapons tailored to specific targets. Supporters believe this capability would enhance U.S. security by convincing adversaries that they cannot neutralize U.S. nuclear forces. Former NNSA Administrator John Gordon emphasized the importance of being able to design and produce new warheads to strengthen the overall deterrent posture. Critics argue that new U.S. nuclear weapons may not enhance deterrence as they could be seen as no more credible than current weapons by rogue states. They point to a 1992 decision by the first Bush Administration to limit nuclear testing to ensure the safety and reliability of deterrent forces, omitting weapons development as a purpose for testing. Critics question the need for new U.S. nuclear weapons, citing a 1992 decision to limit testing for safety and reliability. They argue that existing weapons should suffice for U.S. security concerns, including addressing current targets like deeply buried and biological weapon sites. Critics also oppose the Administration's policy of preemption and view requests to enhance nuclear capabilities as risky. General Richard Myers has suggested new types of nuclear weapons, such as earth penetrator weapons and using gamma rays to destroy anthrax spores. Kathleen Bailey and Robert Barker propose new warheads with various capabilities, including suppressed electromagnetic pulse, reduced residual radiation, and robust warheads. Another suggestion is warheads for intercepting missiles with chemical or biological agents. Critics question the value and feasibility of these weapons. Peter Zimmerman raises concerns about the reduced residual radiation. Peter Zimmerman, a former science adviser for arms control at the State Department, discusses the challenges of developing reduced residual radiation weapons and suppressing electromagnetic pulse. He also mentions the lack of interest from the Administration and Congress in nuclear-armed interceptors. The Department of Energy expressed low interest in robust warheads in a 1989 report, citing concerns about the feasibility and potential impact on the need for testing. The Department of Energy expressed uncertainty about the feasibility of developing warheads with reduced sensitivity to aging and material properties. These warheads would be less operationally efficient and come with size and weight penalties. However, with plans to reduce the number of warheads carried by deployed missiles, ultra-robust warheads may be more desirable. The question of using nuclear weapons to destroy bioweapon stockpiles is raised. The feasibility of using nuclear weapons to destroy biological warfare agents, such as anthrax spores, is discussed in this section. Experts like Hans Kruger and Jonathan B. Tucker have studied the technical aspects of such attacks. Kruger, a physicist, has expertise in the effects of nuclear weapons on chemical and biological agents, while Tucker is a Senior Researcher at the Center for Nonproliferation. In this section, the feasibility of using nuclear weapons to destroy biological warfare agents is discussed. Experts like Hans Kruger and Jonathan B. Tucker have studied the technical aspects of such attacks, considering factors such as storage configurations and the form of the biological agent. Kruger and Tucker studied using nuclear weapons to destroy biological warfare agents, considering storage configurations and agent form. Kruger mentioned using a lethal dose of radiation to neutralize BW agents, with gamma rays penetrating deeper than x-rays. The effectiveness of using nuclear weapons to destroy biological warfare agents lies in the neutron and gamma rays generated, with neutrons being more penetrating and generating gamma rays when striking the target material. The key factor is the number of neutrons and their energy level, as a dose sufficient to kill agents at the bottom of a stack would expose the rest to a greater dose. While the fireball of a nuclear explosion may incinerate agents, radiation is a more useful kill mechanism due to its calculable nature. Nuclear weapons, specifically neutron bombs, are more effective in neutralizing biological warfare agents compared to traditional nuclear weapons. Neutron bombs produce a higher number of neutrons with greater energy levels, making them more precise in targeting and killing agents. This type of weapon can be detonated at a greater height to minimize fallout while still effectively neutralizing biological agents. A 10-kt neutron bomb burst at a height of 10 meters can neutralize BW agents to a radius of about 50 meters, compared to 10 meters for a 10-kt fission weapon. The increased neutron flux of a neutron bomb allows for a larger sterilization area than a fission warhead of equal yield. Detonating a neutron bomb at a high altitude can avoid ground contact, reducing local fallout and still sterilizing a significant area. This is not feasible for a fission warhead. The effectiveness of a neutron bomb in neutralizing BW agents within a radius of about 50 meters is highlighted. An earth penetrator weapon would be needed to destroy agents in an underground bunker, with the chief kill mechanism being the heat of the fireball. Critics question the optimization of Kruger's postulated target for destruction by a nuclear weapon. The focus then shifts to anthrax as one of the tougher BW agents to kill and one of the most militarily useful agents. According to experts, Iraq initially only had the capability to produce wet anthrax, but later worked to acquire the knowledge to produce dry, powdered anthrax. Dry anthrax has a longer shelf-life and is easier to disseminate as an aerosol. The ability of anthrax bacteria to transform into spores with a long shelf-life makes it particularly dangerous. Anthrax has a spore form with a long shelf-life, making it well-suited for delivery by missiles or bombs. A gram of anthrax in spore form theoretically contains 10 million lethal doses. A small quantity of powdered anthrax in an envelope shut down the Capitol complex in 2001. Military or strategic attacks would require much more material, possibly hundreds of pounds to attack a large city. According to Tucker, a nation would likely not make anthrax far in advance unless it had the technology to produce dry powdered anthrax with a longer shelf life. Wet anthrax tends to coagulate after several months, making it unusable as a weapon. Storing large quantities of anthrax aboveground would require attacking shallow underground bunkers with EPWs to reach the stored anthrax. Storing anthrax in a bunker at a depth deeper than EPWs can reach would prevent harmful radiation from reaching it. Anthrax spores are resilient and may survive ground shock alone. Additional protection from neutrons can be achieved by shielding anthrax with materials like beryllium or polyethylene mixed with boron. Dry powdered anthrax could also be concealed for further safety. The destruction of anthrax could depend on locating the agent, with various weapons and tactics used to neutralize it. Intelligence hurdles include the need for detailed knowledge of the target's storage configuration and precise location. During the Gulf War, BW facilities were targeted in error, highlighting the importance of accurate intelligence. Knowing the type of agent is crucial for neutralization efforts. The type of agent is crucial for neutralization efforts, as different bio agents have varying radiation neutralizing doses. Using a weapon that can neutralize the most radiation-resistant agent could result in excessive yield. Critics highlight political issues with nuclear weapon development, especially if neutron bombs are involved, as they spare property but kill people. Developing such weapons could face intense criticism, especially if targeted at perceived rogue states in the Third World. The Defense Department is working on nonnuclear weapons for destroying chemical or biological agents, including the HTI-J-1000, a weapon that would generate intense heat to destroy the agents. This weapon is part of a program spearheaded by the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The Defense Department is developing nonnuclear weapons like the HTI-J-1000 to destroy chemical or biological agents with intense heat. Michael Levi proposed using satellite imagery and armed drones to monitor and destroy any activity at an underground anthrax storage bunker in Iraq. Kruger argued against using conventional explosives to neutralize BW agents due to the large quantity required. Kruger argues that attacking a biological weapons storage site with conventional weapons would cause significant collateral damage, dispersing live agents over a large area. He suggests deploying reduced blast/enhanced radiation weapons without testing, based on designs from decades ago. Optimizing weapons for defeating specific BW agents may require testing due to potential changes. Sealing off a facility poses challenges, such as the likelihood of a U.S. attack without warning and the presence of extensive tunnel networks in certain nations. Despite these obstacles, a nuclear blast could technically sterilize BW agents under specific circumstances, like a large quantity stored near the Earth's surface. A large quantity of agent in aqueous solution stored at or near the Earth's surface, pinpointed within meters with accurate intelligence on the agent present and how it is stored. Nuclear weapons may not be the first choice for attacking BW agents due to political disadvantages and uncertainty of effectiveness. Congress would closely examine any request for development. Congress would closely examine any request for development of nuclear weapons intended to destroy BW agents, questioning the military scenario's probability, plausibility, flaws, and necessity for nuclear use. Additionally, they would consider the progress of nonnuclear alternatives, the pros and cons of weapon development, and the role of ACI in fighting nuclear proliferation. Advanced concept exploration is also required to avoid technical surprises and attract future technologies. The Panel emphasizes the importance of keeping Congress informed about foreign weapons programs and their implications for U.S. security. Advanced Concept Exploration (ACI) could enhance U.S. understanding of potential terrorist nuclear weapons, improve interpretation of intelligence fragments, detect nuclear weapon development efforts, prevent weapon transport into the U.S., and mitigate technical surprises by understanding foreign weapon developments. Designs consistent with Chinese or North Korean weapons programs can help the United States interpret intelligence clues to understand the pace, technological successes and failures, and warhead characteristics. Supporters of ACI argue that the program won't encourage nuclear proliferation, as nations decide to go nuclear for reasons beyond ACI. Even if ACI did encourage proliferation, it doesn't mean the U.S. should stop the program. Supporters suggest that North Korea and Iran pursue nuclear weapons due to fear of U.S. conventional forces, questioning if the U.S. should reduce its military capabilities to prevent this. India and Pakistan are said to pursue nuclear weapons due to perceived threats, not because of U.S. forces. ACI's critics argue that designing new nuclear weapons for nonnuclear weapon states undermines U.S. nonproliferation efforts. They believe the program is unnecessary for interpreting intelligence on rogue states or terrorists' weapons development. The Stockpile Stewardship Program has already enhanced U.S. weapons knowledge, making ACI redundant for understanding Russian or Chinese nuclear programs. The ACI program has increased U.S. weapons knowledge, improving the ability to interpret intelligence on Russian and Chinese nuclear programs. Rogue states seek nuclear weapons as a deterrent against U.S. nuclear forces. North Korea cited U.S. threats as a reason for developing a deterrent force. Critics argue that designing new nuclear weapons for nonnuclear states undermines nonproliferation efforts. The Stockpile Stewardship Program already enhances U.S. weapons knowledge, making ACI redundant for understanding rogue states or terrorists' weapons development. ACI proponents argue that the U.S. must maintain weapons design capability to potentially create new weapons in the future. They believe that having experienced designers is crucial to avoid a situation where the U.S. needs a new weapon but lacks the expertise to design one. Supporters see ACI as complementing the Stockpile Stewardship Program by focusing on designing new weapons, which requires different skills and processes than maintaining existing ones. The ACI initiative aims to train and mentor the next generation of weapon designers by providing unique opportunities to transfer nuclear warhead design knowledge and skills. This program is seen as essential to ensure that expertise is passed on to future stockpile stewards and to extend the capabilities of the nuclear weapons complex. The ACI initiative aims to transfer existing expertise to future stockpile stewards and extend the lifetimes of front-line weapons. It will also create new links between the weapons community and DOD agencies to understand valuable weapons and technologies. Critics argue that maintaining skills to design new weapons is unnecessary as current designs are sufficient. Critics of the multibillion-dollar stockpile stewardship program argue that maintaining design skills for current weapons is sufficient, questioning the need for the ACI initiative. They believe that designing new weapons is unnecessary and that existing training programs for junior staff are already in place. In October 1996, Los Alamos established the Theoretical Institute for Thermonuclear and Nuclear Studies to train new personnel in nuclear weapons design. Critics question the effectiveness of the proposed ACI plan for maintaining weapon design capabilities, arguing that it focuses on reworking old ground rather than significant design activity. They believe existing DOD-DOE groups already handle the necessary links between the Department of Defense and the nuclear weapons establishment. The Administration requested funding for a study on the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), with the FY2005 request being $27.6 million. The study aims to modify existing bombs to penetrate the ground before detonating, increasing effectiveness against hardened targets. The DOE conducted a similar modification in the 1990s, converting some B61 bombs into B61-11 earth penetrators without nuclear testing. Converting B61s or B83s into RNEPs would not require nuclear testing. The Spratt-Furse ban on low-yield R&D does not necessarily open the door to RNEP, as the ban applied only to weapons under 5 kt, while RNEP would be a modification of bombs with yields far above 5 kt. The ban on low-yield weapons applied only to those not in production by November 30, 1993. Structures can be hardened and buried to protect strategic targets. Thousands of such facilities exist worldwide, including in Iraq, North Korea, and Iran. Special operations forces or precision-guided bombs could defeat these structures, but destruction would be a more effective means of eliminating the threat they pose. Facilities at shallow depths are vulnerable to destruction by conventional munitions, while facilities buried deeper may require a nuclear weapon. The use of high-yield nuclear weapons is unlikely due to the significant blast and fallout effects. The challenge lies in destroying hardened and deeply buried facilities with lower-yield weapons. The challenge is to destroy hardened and deeply buried facilities with lower-yield weapons. A nuclear weapon that penetrates the ground transfers more energy into ground shock, effectively destroying buried targets. Burying the weapon several meters deep is crucial, with burial beyond that depth yielding diminishing returns. Lower-yield earth-penetrator weapons can have the same effect on buried targets as higher-yield surface-burst weapons. Lower-yield earth-penetrator weapons can effectively destroy buried targets by transferring more energy into ground shock. Detonating a weapon a few meters underground does not reduce fallout; in fact, it can create more fallout than a surface burst. The reduction in fallout from lower yield can offset the increase in fallout from a shallow subsurface burst. Lower-yield weapons may not suffice to destroy all buried targets. Some hard targets, like those buried deep underground, may require high-yield nuclear weapons for destruction. Even low-yield earth-penetrator weapons may not be sufficient to destroy such targets, which could include hardened structures buried under hundreds of feet of earth or rock. Additionally, superhard targets, such as those found under certain Russian mountains, may not be reliably defeated even by high-yield nuclear weapons. Low-yield EPWs would only be able to destroy facilities close to the surface, while larger yield weapons are needed to destroy facilities buried under significant amounts of concrete. These low-yield EPWs would also generate a significant amount of fallout. Photographs of nuclear tests show fallout clouds from low-yield weapons buried deep underground. Tests like \"Des Moines\" and \"Baneberry\" had yields of 2.9 kt and 10 kt, respectively, with fallout reaching the Canadian border. New containment procedures were implemented after the Baneberry test to prevent similar incidents. The minimum burial depth for tests is 600 feet, while earth-penetrator weapons would be buried shallower and could result in less fallout. Improved accuracy and earth penetration allow for a reduction in warhead yield needed to destroy buried targets. Los Alamos scientists suggest that a 15-kiloton weapon with 100 meters accuracy or a 0.5-kiloton weapon with 5 meters accuracy could destroy a moderately hard structure buried shallowly. This reduction in yield required, combined with decreased collateral damage, highlights the effectiveness of low-yield earth penetrator weapons. However, it is crucial to consider that even low-yield weapons could still result in significant casualties depending on the circumstances. EPWs, like the B61 mod 11, were developed to target buried structures with minimal changes to the nuclear explosive package, avoiding the need for nuclear tests. This technology traces back to the Cold War era and gained interest after the Persian Gulf War. The B61-11 bomb has limited ground penetration capability and cannot survive in many types of terrain with hardened underground facilities. Due to the increase in buried targets and weaknesses of the B61-11, the Department of Defense and Department of Energy approved a study on how to effectively counter this threat. The Department of Energy, through the Nuclear Weapons Council, approved a study on the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) to modify existing nuclear weapons like the B61 and B83 for better penetration into various geologies. This would enhance the Nation's ability to target hard and deeply buried facilities. The emphasis is on an enhanced penetrator system, not low-yield nuclear weapons. The RNEP study aims to enhance the Nation's ability to target hard and deeply buried facilities by selecting a candidate bomb with increased yield to destroy buried targets that may be too hard or deep for low-yield weapons. The study does not involve creating new, lower yields and was initially delayed to FY2003 due to budget redirection from Directed Stockpile Work Research and Development. The Administration requested funds for the RNEP study in FY2003. The Administration requested funds for the RNEP study in FY2003, with a planned budget of $15.0 million a year for FY2003-FY2005. The House Armed Services Committee supported the request, including a provision for a National Academy of Sciences study on the effects of an EPW. Representative Markey's amendment to bar funds for developing a nuclear EPW was defeated in May 2002. The amendment to eliminate funds for RNEP was defeated in May 2002. The conference bill fully funded RNEP but delayed the obligation of FY2003 funds until a report was submitted to the Armed Services Committees. The study on RNEP began in May 2003 after a meeting of NNSA, DOD, and nuclear weapons laboratory personnel. The FY2003 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provided $15.0 million for RNEP. In FY2004, the defense authorization bills included the full $15.0 million request for RNEP. There were attempts to transfer funds to conventional technology for use against buried targets, but these were rejected. The Senate required congressional authorization for engineering development of RNEP. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing RNEP funds to $5.0 million for research on deep earth penetration through hard surfaces, coordinating with the Department of Defense for dual-use applicability of conventional and nuclear weapons. The House agreed to this bill. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing RNEP funds to $5.0 million for research on deep earth penetration through hard surfaces, coordinating with the Department of Defense for dual-use applicability for both conventional and nuclear weapons. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended providing $15 million for RNEP. Senator Feinstein's amendment to eliminate all FY2004 funds for RNEP was tabled, while Senator Jack Reed's amendment barred the use of funds for advanced nuclear weapon concepts including RNEP. RNEP, the initiative closest to deploying a weapon in response to NPR guidance, was a key issue in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act conference. The RNEP program involves converting existing weapons without nuclear testing, requiring a smaller production effort than new weapons. Deployment would not be quick, as seen with the B61-11 taking six years to develop. The NDAA provided funds for RNEP, with restrictions on advanced nuclear weapon concepts. The FY2005 budget cycle includes funding projections for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) totaling $484.7 million over five years. Performance targets for RNEP include completing scheduled activities and tests in subsequent years. The DOD-DOE agency coordinates nuclear weapon requirements and production schedules. Obtain appropriate authorization for RNEP Phase 6.3 activities. Budget increase beyond FY2005 is a placeholder to protect the option of proceeding with RNEP. The decision to proceed with RNEP in the next fiscal year is fixed, but without a placeholder, implementation would be delayed. The move to Phases 6.3 and 6.4 shows potential program advancement. No final decision has been made yet pending completion of the study, which was initially projected to cost $45 million. Changes in funding occurred due to delays and budget cuts in previous years. The RNEP study budget increased to $71 million over four years due to various factors such as additional project management requirements and better definition of study requirements. Uncertainties prevent projecting a budget for FY2007-FY2009. The RNEP study budget increased to $71 million over four years due to factors like better study requirements and increased surety of the proposed weapon. Critics may question the intent to proceed with RNEP and the 58% cost increase. Supporters argue that RNEP is necessary to deter threats from rogue states seeking WMD in the post-9/11 world. Supporters of RNEP argue that it is necessary to deter rogue states seeking WMD by holding their most valued assets at risk. Critics question the application of Cold War tactics in the post-9/11 world. The President should have options for conventional forces, precision weapons, and nuclear weapons to hold all targets at risk. Critics question the application of Cold War deterrence tactics to rogue states, doubting the credibility and effectiveness of using nuclear weapons. Supporters of RNEP argue that it provides added military value by holding key assets at risk and meeting desired specifications and capabilities approved by the Nuclear Weapons Council. Critics question the need for nuclear EPWs like RNEP, suggesting that conventional options are sufficient for defeating deeply buried targets. They argue that funds should be allocated to improving conventional means rather than developing new nuclear weapons. Concerns about fallout from RNEP potentially limiting its use are also raised by critics. Critics of RNEP raise concerns about the potential fallout from low-yield EPWs, arguing that the idea of a benign earth-penetrating nuclear weapon is physically impossible. They highlight the significant collateral damage that would result from the use of such weapons, making RNEP potentially unusable except for retaliatory purposes. Critics argue that using earth-penetrating nuclear weapons for preemptive or retaliatory counter-proliferation warfare is strategically, legally, and morally unsuitable. The potential fallout and collateral damage make the weapon potentially unusable except for retaliatory purposes against nuclear weapon-states like China and Russia. Representative Frank questions the morality of using nuclear weapons to rescue oppressed populations, undermining the idea of America coming to their rescue. Supporters of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) argue that it may be necessary to use this weapon in certain military scenarios, despite concerns about its potential impact on nuclear nonproliferation. They believe that RNEP could achieve critical military objectives with less fallout compared to surface-burst weapons, making it a preferable option in some cases. Representative Thornberry suggests that the U.S. should not avoid researching Earth-Penetrating Weapons (EPWs) to set an example for the rest of the world. Representative Thornberry argues that American strength is crucial for peace and security, dismissing the idea that tying hands behind the back would make the world safer. Supporters of RNEP believe that its development would not deter other nations from pursuing WMD programs, citing the deployment of the B61-11 as evidence. Critics, however, raise concerns about proliferation risks associated with RNEP. Critics argue that the United States' exploration of new nuclear weapon capabilities, such as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), undermines its credibility in preaching restraint to rogue states with nuclear programs. They fear that the development of RNEP implies a willingness to use nuclear weapons against such states, leading to serious consequences. This inconsistency could prompt non-nuclear weapon states to accelerate their efforts to obtain nuclear weapons for deterrence. Fewer nations are potential targets for RNEP in early 2004. Iraq and Libya are unlikely to develop WMDs, with Libya already giving up its programs. Precise targeting for an attack with an earth penetrator weapon is crucial, but recent events raise doubts about the reliability of U.S. intelligence in detecting WMD programs. Critics question the precision and reliability of intelligence in pinpointing targets. Iran's nuclear program faced scrutiny in December 2003 when intrusive inspections by the IAEA revealed equipment and materials linked to nuclear weapons. Despite initial cooperation, Iran began withholding information, stating they had already provided sufficient answers to the agency's questions. North Korea's contradictory statements have raised concerns about their nuclear program, including the production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium with aid from Pakistan. RNEP supporters believe tactical intelligence can prevent misuse of nuclear weapons. The preparation time for nuclear tests has decreased since the Cold War due to a moratorium on testing. The Clinton Administration required the ability to conduct a nuclear test within 24 to 36 months of a presidential order. DOD and NNSA found it would take close to 36 months to test and recommended an 18-month test readiness posture. The Administration requested $24.9 million for this transition in FY2004. NNSA integrated test readiness and enhanced test readiness programs into one program called \"test readiness.\" The NDAA and EWDAA provided funding for test readiness programs, with a focus on restoring a 24-month posture before pursuing an 18-month posture. NNSA plans to achieve a 24-month readiness posture in early FY2005 and an 18-month posture later that year, requesting $30.0 million for FY2005. Between 1951 and 1992, the U.S. conducted nuclear tests regularly, with varying numbers each year. The United States conducted nuclear tests regularly between 1951 and 1992, with a total of 1,030 tests. Since 1963, all tests have been held underground at the Nevada Test Site. In October 1992, the U.S. began a moratorium on nuclear testing, which continues to the present. Ambassador Linton Brooks stated in 2003 that there is currently no need for testing, and he does not foresee a need to resume testing in the next few years.

In October 1992, a moratorium on nuclear testing began, which continues. Ambassador Linton Brooks stated in 2003 that there is currently no need for testing, and he does not foresee a need to resume testing in the next few years. Understanding the differences in test readiness is crucial for weapons modification and development. New-design warheads typically required nuclear testing for development purposes. Tests involved designing unique test devices, elaborate diagnostics, and sealing them in a shaft, taking 18 to 24 months to complete. Developing a new warhead typically required several tests conducted in vertical shafts in the ground, taking six to eight weeks for drilling. Effects tests examined how a nuclear explosion would affect military equipment by exposing them to radiation from a low-yield nuclear device. These tests required elaborate preparation and excavation of horizontal tunnels and experimental chambers, which could take up to a year. Stockpile confidence tests conducted by the DOE involved pulling a warhead from the field, making minimal modifications to ensure compliance with treaties, and testing to verify expected yield and performance criteria. These tests used diagnostics similar to weapon development tests but were less complex and required less preparation time. Stockpile confidence tests conducted by the DOE were less complex than weapon development tests, requiring minimal preparation time. They were conducted in vertical shafts about once a year and had yields below 20 kt. These tests could be used in the future as a response to nuclear tests by Russia or China, using existing instruments and devices with experiments planned in advance. NNSA believes such tests could be conducted in as little as six months, albeit at higher costs compared to an 18-month posture. The NNSA is currently conducting subcritical experiments involving chemical high explosives and fissile materials to study the behavior of plutonium. These experiments do not result in a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. Twenty SCEs were conducted between July 1997 and September 2003 in a tunnel complex. The purpose of these experiments is to assess if changes induced by radioactive decay of aged plutonium would affect weapon performance. The NNSA conducts subcritical experiments with plutonium to study its behavior. These experiments do not cause a nuclear chain reaction. The experiments are held underground at the Nevada Test Site and are seen as consistent with the moratorium. Plans are in place for more complex experiments in the future, including one named \"Unicorn\" conducted in a vertical shaft. This experiment will resemble underground nuclear tests conducted before the 1992 moratorium. The Unicorn subcritical experiment at the U1a complex will exercise key NTS capabilities and may replace smaller SCEs. The schedule for subcritical experiments beyond FY2005 is uncertain. Future nuclear tests may focus on resolving weapon defects for safety and reliability, potentially in conjunction with the stockpile stewardship program. Future tests, in conjunction with the stockpile stewardship program, would involve technical work to fix warhead problems and prepare for testing. NNSA estimates 18 months for preparation, with different timelines for various types of tests. Support activities can be done in advance to prepare for a generic test. Test readiness involves preparing for a generic test by conducting safety analyses, training personnel, updating agreements, and obtaining necessary equipment. Support activities for a specific test include designing instruments and analyzing safety at the test site. The goal is to complete these steps within a specified timeframe, with NNSA selecting 18 months as the test readiness goal. The 1992 moratorium's duration was uncertain, but it could not end before July 1. President Clinton continued the moratorium on nuclear testing, considering a return to testing in 1995. He pressed for a true zero-yield CTBT with safeguards to protect U.S. interests. Safeguard F allowed for withdrawal from the CTBT if the safety or reliability of critical nuclear weapons could no longer be certified. President Clinton maintained the ability to conduct a nuclear test within 24 to 36 months of a presidential order, established in FY1996. Concerns were raised about the length of time needed to test, with Congress passing a resolution of ratification for the START II Treaty in January 1996. The resolution of ratification of the START II Treaty included a declaration stating the commitment to maintain the Nevada Test Site for nuclear testing readiness within 3-12 months. The Foster panel recommended having devices available for testing on short notice to avoid delays. The Nevada Test Site was recommended to maintain nuclear testing readiness within 3-12 months, with devices available on short notice. Concerns were raised about the sustainability of the current 2-3 year test readiness posture due to retiring experienced personnel. There was uncertainty over the state of test readiness, with conflicting statements from Secretary of Defense William Cohen and Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson about the timeline for conducting a nuclear test. Studies were conducted by DOD and NNSA to address these concerns. NNSA and DOD conducted studies between 1999 and 2003 to determine the time needed for nuclear testing. They concluded that the U.S. would likely require about 36 months to test, with plans to move to an 18-month posture in 2002. In September 2002, NNSA notified Congress of its intent to transition to enhanced test readiness. Congress allocated $15 million in H.J.Res. 2 (P.L. 108-7) for this purpose in FY2003. The FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act required the Secretary of Energy to report on a plan and budget to enhance test readiness in the FY2004 budget submission. The conference bill included Section 3142, outlining plans for achieving enhanced readiness posture for the resumption of underground nuclear weapons tests within one year. The Administrator for Nuclear Security is required to prepare plans for achieving readiness postures of six months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months for the United States to resume underground nuclear weapons tests. This readiness posture is achieved when the Department of Energy can resume tests within the specified timeframe after being directed by the President. The Secretary must include a report on these plans in the budget justification materials for FY2004. The Secretary of Energy is required to submit a report on plans for resuming underground nuclear weapons tests, including cost estimates and recommendations for optimal readiness posture. The Secretary is encouraged to include these plans in the budget report as well. The required report recommended a test readiness posture of 18 months, costing $83 million for the transition period and $25-$30 million annually thereafter. A 24-36 month posture was considered more likely, with a 6-12 month posture requiring a major redirection of resources. NNSA's report on test readiness recommended an 18-month nuclear test posture, costing $225 million annually for general requirements at the Nevada Test Site. The Secretary of Energy was required to achieve this posture by October 1, 2006, and maintain it thereafter. If a different posture was preferred, the Secretary could choose to achieve and maintain it, with a report stating the reasons. The House Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating the $24.9 million requested for \"enhanced test readiness\" due to inadequate budget justification and program credibility concerns. It questioned NNSA's ability to maintain an 18-month readiness posture during a test moratorium without proper budget analysis or program plan. The House Appropriations Committee questioned the Department of Energy's rationale for maintaining a testing capability during a testing moratorium. The Senate rejected an amendment that would have prevented modifying the test readiness posture of the Nevada Test Site to less than 24 months. The House eliminated $24.9 million for test readiness, while the Senate provided the full request. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern over transitioning to an 18-month posture but supported maintaining the Nevada Test Site. The decision on reducing funds for test readiness was uncertain. The Nevada Test Site receives funds for activities not unique to the test readiness mission. The limit on obligations in the House defense authorization bill and the provision in the Senate defense authorization bill regarding a test readiness posture of other than 18 months were rendered moot by DOE's submission of the test readiness report. Authorization conferees could have considered achieving an 18-month test readiness posture by October 1, 2006, as per the Senate bill, or by the end of FY2005, the date agreed upon by DOD and NNSA. The NDAA conference report did not address test readiness, but the EWDAA conference report provided full funds while emphasizing the need for NNSA to restore a 24-month test readiness posture before pursuing an 18-month posture. This decision aimed to avoid the issue of readiness timelines. The EWDAA conference report emphasized the need for NNSA to restore a 24-month test readiness posture before pursuing an 18-month posture, avoiding readiness timeline issues. The FY2005 request for test readiness is $30.0 million, with conferees expecting NNSA to reach a 24-month posture before requesting additional funds for an 18-month posture. NNSA anticipates reaching a 24-month posture soon. The budget document does not provide out-year budgets for test readiness but estimates it can maintain an 18-month posture for $25 million a year. Some believe the current 24- to 36-month posture is adequate and that enhancing test readiness would divert resources from the stockpile stewardship program. The program has means to maintain skills through subcritical experiments, simulations, and exercises. The National Academy of Sciences panel believes the US can ensure the safety of its nuclear-weapon stockpile under the CTBT with adequate resources. Some fear that enhancing test readiness could lead to adverse international consequences, potentially threatening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Representative Markey and colleagues have expressed concerns about the potential resumption of full-scale nuclear testing. Representative Markey and colleagues are concerned that enhancing test readiness could renew interest in testing among other nations, potentially threatening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Some believe that an 18-month readiness posture may not be necessary for stockpile stewardship or new weapons development. The time between discovering a problem and making a political decision to test could be used for preliminary planning, reducing the time needed to conduct a test. The United States is debating the need for a shorter timeframe for nuclear testing readiness due to concerns about maintaining skills for resumption of testing. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham emphasizes the importance of being able to certify the reliability of the nuclear stockpile and conduct a test in a shorter timeframe than the current three years. The current 24- to 36-month posture is seen as too long, with the risk of delays as experienced personnel retire. Maintaining skills for testing under this timeframe is challenging as test-related activities are only a minor part of the workload for staff. The debate in the United States is focused on the need for a shorter timeframe for nuclear testing readiness to maintain skills for resumption of testing. The current 24- to 36-month posture is considered too long, with concerns about eroding skills as experienced personnel retire. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) suggests an 18-month timeframe for test readiness to assess and implement solutions efficiently. The decision to conduct a test would be separate and made by the President and Congress. The debate in the United States is focused on the need for a shorter timeframe for nuclear testing readiness. Some suggest an 18-month posture, while others argue for a one-year or 3-12 month posture. Technical considerations determine the time needed for tests, with national nuclear laboratories stating a test could be conducted in 3 to 6 months if necessary. The debate in the United States is centered on the timeframe for nuclear testing readiness. Some propose an 18-month posture, while others advocate for a shorter timeframe. National nuclear laboratories believe tests could be conducted in 3 to 6 months if needed. The feasibility of an 18-month posture for stockpile stewardship or weapons development tests is being questioned, with complex tests likely taking longer even with enhanced readiness. NNSA claims an 18-month posture should be achievable, especially for tests related to existing warhead issues or new warhead design. Critics question the feasibility of establishing an 18-month timeframe for nuclear testing readiness, citing concerns about eroded expertise, staff turnover, and the need for new technology and training. The NNSA would need to replace outdated technology from 1992 and meet new regulatory standards for environment, safety, and health. Uncertainties, costs, and personnel issues make it unclear when reaching an 18-month nuclear testing readiness goal could happen. Debate over four nuclear initiatives is expected to continue for years, with supporters arguing they are essential elements of a nuclear weapons program. The NNSA faces challenges in replacing outdated technology and meeting new regulatory standards. Uncertainties and costs make it unclear when reaching an 18-month nuclear testing readiness goal could happen. Debate over four nuclear initiatives, including low-yield R&D, ACI, and RNEP, continues with supporters arguing they are essential elements of a nuclear weapons program. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham stated that there are no plans to develop new nuclear weapons, but rather to explore weapons concepts for deterrence and stockpile reliability without testing. Critics view these measures skeptically. Critics argue that lifting the low-yield ban and pursuing more-usable weapons, like ACI and RNEP, will lower the threshold for nuclear use. They believe these initiatives, along with the Administration's policy decisions, make nuclear use more likely. The Administration's policy statements on nuclear preemption and use have raised concerns about insensitivity to world opinion and potential dangers. The statements indicate a willingness to use overwhelming force, including nuclear weapons, in response to attacks with WMD, but do not explicitly declare the use of nuclear weapons. The Administration's statements on nuclear preemption have sparked concerns about potential preemptive use of nuclear weapons against WMD attacks. Critics interpret the statements as hinting at such a possibility, leading to calls for clarity from the Administration to alleviate global fears of nuclear conflict. The Administration's decision on whether to clarify its stance on preemptive nuclear weapon use will weigh the benefits of resolving ambiguity against the costs. The Administration's focus on countering terrorist WMD threats with new or modified nuclear weapons adds to the debate on the purpose and effectiveness of these initiatives. The Administration's nuclear initiatives raise questions about deterring terrorist WMD threats. Key considerations include targeting unknown perpetrators, the value of assets to terrorists, and the adequacy of current U.S. forces for deterrence. Additionally, there is debate on using conventional or nuclear forces to overthrow regimes supporting terrorism or destroy critical facilities. Deterrence effectiveness hinges on holding assets of great value to leadership at risk. The United States cannot assume that what deterred the Soviet Union would deter rogue states with nuclear weapons. Rogue states may believe the US would not use nuclear weapons due to international backlash or that low-yield weapons would not be effective against them. Concerns about nuclear testing leading to the development and use of advanced nuclear weapons persist. The prospect of testing ACI, RNEP, and low-yield weapons for nuclear tests is discussed. While there are concerns that these programs could lead to testing, there are arguments that testing may not be necessary. Examples are given of warheads being converted without testing, suggesting that new designs may not require testing. The Administration's confidence in nonnuclear interceptors is also mentioned. The Administration's confidence in nonnuclear interceptors leads to withdrawal from the ABM Treaty for deploying a new-design EPW. Doubts exist on the need for nuclear weapons tailored to destroy chemical and biological agents. The efficacy of nuclear weapons for such targets is questioned, with concerns about contamination outweighing advantages. Policy, not technical judgments, will determine if enhancing nuclear test readiness leads to testing. Critics fear studying new nuclear weapon concepts may lead to their use, but supporters argue against inevitability. Nuclear weapons remain an option for the United States. Nuclear weapons are an option available to the United States, along with conventional forces, diplomacy, and economic leverage. Despite military benefits, Presidents have refrained from using low-yield nuclear weapons since the 1950s. A new weapon could provide a wider range of options for nuclear use, potentially tilting the tradeoff between costs and benefits. However, any new weapon has limits to its military value, and the claim that EPWs may be the only way to destroy certain targets does not guarantee success. Nuclear EPWs have limited effectiveness in destroying hardened and deeply buried targets, as their impact is only significant within a specific range of depths. The United States could adjust the weapon's yield, but target nations can counter by increasing bunker hardness or depth. Factors like geology and tunnel layouts can also affect the weapon's effectiveness, limiting its military value to a specific range of targets."
