    "content": "The U.S.-Mexican border region has long struggled with water sharing, causing tension and cooperation. The Colorado River and Rio Grande are the main shared river basins. This report focuses on U.S. and Mexican water sharing, including legal obligations under the 1944 Water Treaty. The U.S. and Mexico have a history of agreements regarding the sharing of international rivers. Starting in 1848, border agreements were made, leading to the 1889 Convention and the 1944 Water Treaty. The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) was established to resolve treaty-related issues. The main rivers shared by the two countries are the Colorado River and the Rio Grande. The 1944 Water Treaty governs water allocations for the U.S. and Mexico, establishing the framework for the IBWC to resolve disputes. Groundwater in aquifers along the U.S.-Mexican border is not covered by the agreements, potentially playing a significant role in water supply during dry conditions. Senate \"understandings\" clarify provisions in the Treaty. The Senate provides interpretative statements on treaties without altering them. President Truman ratified the 1944 Water Treaty with Senate understandings. The International Boundary Commission (IBC) was established in 1889 to apply border agreements. The 1944 Water Treaty expanded the IBC's role, creating the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) to address boundary and water treaty issues. The IBWC consists of U.S. and Mexican Sections with specific roles and is headquartered in El Paso, TX, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. The USIBWC, located in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, operates under the Department of State's foreign policy guidance. The commissioner is appointed by the President, and funding comes from the Department of State's budget. The IBWC resolves border water disputes using technical expertise and diplomacy, formalizing agreements in amendments to the 1944 Water Treaty. The USIBWC, under the Department of State, resolves border water disputes through formalized agreements in amendments to the 1944 Water Treaty. The executive branch has the authority to approve proposed minutes to the Treaty, with the Department of State responsible for responding to them. If no disapproval is announced within 30 days, the minute is adopted; otherwise, the two governments negotiate the issue. The Department of State handles proposed minutes under the 1944 Water Treaty, addressing various issues like sanitation plants, drought water conveyance, and dam construction. These minutes, considered binding executive agreements between the US and Mexico, are typically approved by the Secretary of State without Congress or Senate involvement. The 1944 Water Treaty includes provisions for water distribution between the United States and Mexico, with the United States providing Mexico with 1.5 million acre-feet of water annually from the Colorado River basin. Mexico has rights to two-thirds of the flows from six major tributaries entering the Rio Grande from Mexico, while the United States receives all flows from US tributaries and one-third of flows from Mexican tributaries. Congress has authorized the construction of public works and projects in accordance with the Treaty. Mexico must deliver at least 350,000 AF per year from its six tributaries to the United States, with provisions for repayment in case of a water debt. If Mexico fails to meet its obligations due to an \"extraordinary drought,\" it must make up the deficiency in the next five-year cycle. Repayment can be made using excess water, a portion of its allotment, or a transfer of stored water from international reservoirs like Falcon Dam and Amistad Dam. Article 24(d) of the 1944 Water Treaty provides mechanisms for dispute settlement between the United States and Mexico, including diplomatic channels and recourse to general or special agreements. These mechanisms have not been necessary in the past, as disputes have been resolved through the minute process and diplomatic efforts. The 1944 Water Treaty allows the IBWC to divert water from the Rio Grande in cases of drought, with conditions to prevent harm to the other country. Temporary diversions do not establish permanent rights, and the IBWC is responsible for keeping records of water usage. The treaty prioritizes domestic and municipal uses for the water. The 1944 Water Treaty establishes a hierarchy of water uses, prioritizing domestic and municipal uses, agriculture, electric power, industrial uses, navigation, fishing, hunting, and other beneficial uses. However, it lacks provisions for ecological purposes and water quality requirements, leading to tensions over salinity levels. Minute 242 in 1973 resolved disputes over water quality. The Protocol accompanying the 1944 Water Treaty establishes that constructed works in one country used partly for Treaty compliance shall be operated by that country's federal agencies in cooperation with the IBWC. Subsequent minutes, like Minute 319, have integrated operational activities for specific works. The extent of Mexico's reservoir operations for Treaty compliance is discussed in the \"Southeastern Rio Grande Basin\" section, focusing on water delivery shortfalls. The 1944 Water Treaty established requirements for dams, flood control, hydroelectric energy, and reservoir maintenance along the Colorado River. The river flows through seven U.S. states and forms the border between Mexican states before emptying into the Gulf of California. Disputes over water supplies have occurred for most of the past century. The 1944 Water Treaty established requirements for dams, flood control, hydroelectric energy, and reservoir maintenance along the Colorado River. Disputes over water supplies have occurred for most of the past century, involving state allocations, water quality, availability, and conservation between the United States and Mexico. Recent flows have averaged volumes closer to 14.4 million AF annually, leading to a demand-supply imbalance that is expected to worsen in the coming decades. The Colorado River water issues are anticipated to worsen in the coming decades. Concern about meeting future demands in the United States is significant for discussions about water sharing with Mexico. Treaty implementation issues in the basin include salinity, environmental protection, and Minute 319. Disputes arose in the 1960s over the quality of water delivered to Mexico, leading to the agreement of Minute 218 in 1965. In 1965, Minute 218 required the US to extend a drainage channel to reduce salinity in water delivered to Mexico. Mexican farmers were still unhappy, leading to Minute 242 in 1973. This minute required the US to build more channels, clean up Mexicali Valley lands, and maintain water salinity levels. The agreement, backed by the IBWC, remains in force, showing successful resolution but requiring external pressure. The Colorado River Delta, spanning the US and Mexico, faces water consumption issues leading to wetland degradation. Environmental advocates propose pulse flows every four years to restore wetlands, emphasizing the need for environmental protection in water sharing agreements between the two countries. Some stakeholders are hesitant about these restoration efforts due to concerns about water allocations. Restoration efforts in the Colorado River basin have sparked concerns about water allocations for U.S. users. Bilateral discussions between the U.S. and Mexico have focused on improving water management and conservation, leading to the development of Minute 319 to allocate water based on surplus or drought conditions. Minute 319, signed in 2012, allows for temporary water adjustments between the U.S. and Mexico based on drought conditions. It also includes joint investments for environmental protection and incentivizes water conservation. The agreement is set to expire in 2017, with discussions on renewal or replacement ongoing. Minute 319, signed in 2012, allows for temporary water adjustments between the U.S. and Mexico based on drought conditions. It includes joint investments for environmental protection and incentivizes water conservation. The agreement extends provisions of Minute 318 and allows Mexico to defer delivery of its Colorado River water allocation for earthquake repairs, delivers additional water to Mexico during high water levels in Lake Mead, and reduces deliveries during water shortage conditions in the Colorado River basin. The Minute 319 pilot program, signed in 2012, addresses water shortage conditions in the Colorado River basin by allowing temporary water adjustments between the U.S. and Mexico. It includes joint investments for environmental protection and incentivizes water conservation. Stored water was used for a pulse flow in 2014 to simulate a spring flood, reconnecting the river with its estuary. The pilot program's pulse flow in the Colorado River basin aims to improve ecosystem restoration by monitoring impacts on various aspects like instream flow, vegetation, and aquatic species. Mexico's deferred water deliveries under Minutes 318 and 319 raised Lake Mead's water elevation, with ongoing efforts resulting in nearly 10 additional feet of water by the end of 2016. The final report on the program's results is expected in June 2018. The water conservation efforts under Minutes 318 and 319 raised Lake Mead's elevation above 1,075 feet, avoiding triggers for water delivery reductions. Without these provisions, lower basin states would not benefit from Mexico sharing cutbacks or higher lake elevations. Lake Mead elevations were impacted by Mexico's delayed water deliveries under the 1944 Water Treaty. Minute 319 was seen as a positive step in bilateral water management and environmental protection, but some stakeholders in Texas were unhappy with Mexico's water deliveries in the Rio Grande basin. Negotiations for a new minute (referred to as Minute 32X) were ongoing at the end of the Obama Administration. The Trump Administration's actions related to Minute 319 or a new minute on the Colorado River will be influenced by the relationship between the two countries in 2017, basin water conditions, reservoir levels, and stakeholders' interest in clarifying water-sharing arrangements during future shortages. The Rio Grande basin operates as two separate binational basins divided into the northwestern El Paso-Ju\u00e1rez basin and the southeastern Lower Rio Grande basin. Water-sharing agreements differ in these basins, with the US required to deliver water to Mexico in the northwestern basin and Mexico largely obligated to deliver water to the US in the southeastern basin. The Rio Grande basin operates as two separate binational basins, with water demands regularly exceeding supply, especially during droughts. The delivery of water from Mexico in the southeastern Rio Grande basin has received national attention, while the northwestern El Paso-Ju\u00e1rez water issues have raised local concerns. The US is obligated to deliver water to Mexico under the 1906 convention, with reductions in deliveries during extraordinary drought conditions. Deliveries of water from the US to Mexico in the northwestern Rio Grande basin have been significantly reduced in recent years due to drought conditions. Junior water rights holders in New Mexico and Texas have experienced deeply curtailed water deliveries, as low as 4% of their full allotment. The US is not required to repay any reduced deliveries to Mexico, with reductions occurring in roughly 30% of the years from 1939 to 2015. The U.S. stakeholders associated with the Rio Grande Project have seen significant reductions in water deliveries, as low as 4% of their full allotment, due to drought conditions. Mexico is required to deliver water to the U.S. in the southeastern Lower Rio Grande basin under the 1944 Water Treaty, often using wet-weather flows to comply with delivery requirements. During the 1994-2003 drought, Mexico struggled to meet water deliveries to the United States from the Rio Conchos basin. Presidential intervention, negotiation, and improved water efficiency helped resolve tensions over the water debt. Wet conditions in 2005 cleared the remaining debt. Mexico's Rio Conchos historically contributed 70% of the flow in the Rio Grande. Mexico's Rio Conchos historically contributed 70% of the flow in the Rio Grande, but by the 1990s, it only contributed 40%. A delivery cycle from October 25, 2010, to October 24, 2015, resulted in a 15% shortfall in Mexico's water deliveries. Efforts were made to establish modalities for reliable water deliveries and to ensure Mexico's compliance with its Treaty obligations to the United States. Mexico has made efforts to meet its annual water delivery obligations to Texas, showing positive momentum in 2015. By January 25, 2016, Mexico had paid off previous debts and started deliveries for the current cycle. However, deliveries in the first year of the 2015-2020 cycle fell short by 133,439 AF. The predictability of Mexican deliveries within the five-year cycle has been a point of tension, especially during dry conditions in 2012. Some U.S. stakeholders argue that uncertainty in Mexico's water deliveries affects effective water management in the Rio Grande basin. Demand exceeds supply in the region, leading to water shortages during droughts. Currently, Texas water users can expect to receive on average 70% of their water allocation in average water years. Over-allocation in Mexico's Rio Grande basin is attributed to the expansion of Mexican irrigated agriculture from 1965 to 1994. Texas agricultural water withdrawals did not increase at a similar rate during this period due to established agriculture on the U.S. side of the border. Industrial activity near the border and population growth in urban areas on both sides increased demands for urban water supplies. Efforts were made to align water demand and supply in the southeastern Rio Grande basin after the 1994-2003 drought, including buyback of water rights and infrastructure improvements. Focus has been on reducing agricultural water use, with some efforts undertaken binationally. Despite progress, demand still exceeds supply, and stakeholders question the effectiveness of water savings. Unconventional oil and gas development in the region is also a concern. Unconventional oil and gas development in northeastern Mexico may impact water use in the Rio Grande basin. Some U.S. stakeholders are concerned about Mexico's water-delivery process prioritizing its own needs over U.S. deliveries. They argue for more predictable water deliveries based on specified quantities annually. High storage levels in Mexican reservoirs have been cited as evidence supporting their position. Some U.S. stakeholders argue that Mexico's high reservoir levels indicate hoarding of shared water resources. Mexican interests believe the 1944 Water Treaty is more generous to the United States in terms of water allocation, despite historical water origins favoring the U.S. Mexico's reservoir conservation is seen as a point of contention in water delivery negotiations. Mexico's water conservation in reservoirs is part of a long-term drought risk management strategy, influenced by less developed agricultural insurance and government assistance programs. The U.S. and Mexican Sections of the IBWC have been meeting regularly to discuss water deliveries, with political officials supporting efforts to resolve the current water dispute. Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto instructed his Foreign Ministry to work with the IBWC, U.S. Department of State, Mexico's Water Commission, and Texas authorities to resolve the water dispute. Diplomatic efforts led to an exchange of technical data for future water management. In 2015, the U.S. Department of State and IBWC organized meetings with Mexican officials and Texas representatives to discuss basin water modeling and compliance improvement. Several Members of Congress have expressed concerns about Mexico's water deliveries and compliance with the 1944 Water Treaty. P.L. 113-235 required the U.S. Section of the IBWC to report on water delivery and accounting issues to the Committees on Appropriations. The Commissioner for the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) must report to the Committees on Appropriations on efforts to improve transparency and predictability of water deliveries from Mexico to the United States to meet annual water apportionments to the Rio Grande. This includes actions to minimize or eliminate water deficits owed to the United States in the current 5-year cycle. The report should project the balance of the water delivery deficit at the end of the current cycle and estimate the impact of a negative delivery balance on the United States. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act and FY2017 foreign operations measure included reporting requirements related to Mexico's water deliveries in the Rio Grande Valley. The U.S. Department of State delivered four reports to Congress in response to legislative directions between February 2015 and February 2016. Mexican-U.S. relations improved during the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations. Relations between Mexico and the U.S. improved during the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations, with water sharing addressed through technical meetings and bilateral talks. Binational cooperation included data-sharing, joint research efforts, and stakeholder participation in water sharing in the Colorado River basin. The Colorado River and Rio Grande basins face water-sharing conflicts, especially during droughts. Congress may focus on oversight of Minute 319 implementation and negotiations for its successor. Questions include effective mechanisms for Mexican water delivery to benefit Texas stakeholders. The North American Drought Monitor provides maps for monitoring drought conditions. The North American Drought Monitor, created by U.S., Mexican, and Canadian experts, provides maps synthesizing various drought indices and impacts. Figures show drought conditions from 2011 through October 2016 for the Rio Grande and Colorado River basins, highlighting dry conditions and low precipitation."
