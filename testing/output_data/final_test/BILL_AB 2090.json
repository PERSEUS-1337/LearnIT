    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Low Carbon Transit Operations Program is created to assist transit agencies in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving mobility, with a focus on disadvantaged communities. Funding for the program is continuously appropriated from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The Controller allocates funding based on Department of Transportation approval of proposed expenditures meeting program requirements. The Low Carbon Transit Operations Program provides funding for transit agencies to enhance transit services, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve mobility. Expenditures must support new or expanded transit services and facilities, with a focus on increasing mode share and reducing emissions. Additionally, funds may be used to support existing services in cases of declared fiscal emergencies. The transit agency must request funds to sustain transit service, with a finding that reducing service would increase greenhouse gas emissions. Funds must be used for transit operating assistance meeting specific criteria and cannot be requested for more than three consecutive funding years. The transit agency must request funds to sustain transit service, with a finding that reducing service would increase greenhouse gas emissions. Expenditures support bus- or rail-service operating costs, including labor, fueling, maintenance, and other expenses. Recipient agencies must demonstrate that each expenditure directly sustains transit service to prevent reductions or eliminations. Transit agencies serving disadvantaged communities must allocate at least 50% of received funds towards proposed expenses and provide documentation for compliance. The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board, determines eligibility of proposed expense types based on documentation provided by recipient transit agencies. Approved expenditures and allocations for each agency are notified to the Controller. Recipient agencies must provide annual reports to the Department of Transportation in a prescribed format for fund proceeds use. The Department of Transportation and recipient transit agencies must comply with guidelines from the State Air Resources Board to ensure that fund proceeds are used to benefit disadvantaged communities."
