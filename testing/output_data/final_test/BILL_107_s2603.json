The First and Second Morrill Acts in 1862 and 1890 respectively led to the establishment of land grant colleges and universities in the United States. These institutions focus on research, teaching, and outreach, providing affordable access to high-quality postsecondary education and contributing significantly to advanced research. The land grant colleges and universities, along with the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, disseminate research findings and connect research to societal needs. Advanced Internet and telecommunications technologies have untapped potential to enhance educational resources. Local and regional organizations hold fragmented educational resources that lack coordination for potential beneficiaries. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 set up a framework for the transition to digital television and the auction of analog spectrum, potentially yielding over $20 billion in revenue for the US Treasury. A trust should be created with a portion of these funds to support the telecommunications sector. The Federal Government generates revenue through auctions of the electromagnetic spectrum, akin to public lands in the past.
