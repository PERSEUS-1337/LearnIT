    "content": "IPR are legal rights granted by governments to encourage innovation and creative output, such as patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, or geographical indications. Governments grant a temporary legal monopoly to innovators through IPR, allowing them to control the use of their creations. IPR can be traded or licensed to others for fees and royalties. The WTO TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards for IPR protections, enforced on a national basis and challengeable through the WTO dispute settlement process. The Patent Act governs the issuance and use of patents in the United States. Patents are granted for new inventions with industrial or commercial applications, providing the holder with exclusive rights for 20 years. This temporary monopoly aims to encourage innovation and R&D investment. The Patent Act governs patents in the US, granting temporary monopoly for 20 years to encourage innovation. Patents are issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office. Trade secrets are valuable information protected by secrecy efforts. Trade secret protection, governed by state law like the Uniform Trade Secret Act, differs from patent protection. Unlike patents, trade secrets do not require application or registration and offer indefinite protection as long as they remain secret. Patents, on the other hand, require disclosure to the PTO, provide stronger but limited protection for 20 years, and involve a costly application process. Copyrights protect original expressions of authorship in physical or digital forms, such as books, music, movies, paintings, and computer software. Unlike patents, copyrights focus on the expression of the idea rather than the idea itself. Both copyrights and patents require investments of time, money, and effort to create valuable intellectual property. Copyright protection in the United States is provided for works of cultural, social, and economic significance. Copyrights last for the life of the author plus 70 years for personal works, or 120 years from creation for corporate works. Trademarks, governed by state and federal law, allow sellers to use distinctive names, marks, symbols, or sounds to identify and market products or services. Trademarks help in quick identification of products and can indicate quality. Trademarks are valuable indicators of a product's quality, preventing others from capitalizing on the reputation associated with the trademarked item. Distinctiveness is crucial for trademarks to be effective, as generic names cannot be trademarked. Trademark rights are obtained through use or registration with the PTO. Geographic indications, protected by the Lanham Act, safeguard the quality and reputation of products from specific regions. Geographic indications protect products from specific regions, such as agricultural products or wines. In the United States, protection is acquired through registration with the PTO. IPR infringement involves misappropriation of intellectual property rights, such as patents or copyrights. The main challenge in international trade is patent infringement in foreign countries or non-compliance with TRIPS Agreement standards. Copyright infringement, including piracy and counterfeiting, is a major challenge in protecting intellectual property rights. Piracy can occur through physical duplication, illegal dissemination over the Internet, or unauthorized commercial transactions. Counterfeiting involves imitation of products using famous trademarks without proper registration or use. Counterfeit products are imitations of genuine goods, created to deceive consumers about their origin. They pose a major challenge for trademarked products, as they can damage the reputation of the original item and reduce its sales. Counterfeited goods, such as fake fashionwear and pharmaceutical products, are often of inferior quality and can be potentially harmful. Counterfeit products, including fake pharmaceuticals and imitation of trademarked goods, pose a significant challenge by deceiving consumers and damaging the reputation of genuine products. Trade secret theft can occur through industrial espionage for economic benefit or economic espionage to benefit a foreign power. This criminal activity, including intellectual property theft, is increasingly happening in cyberspace. Cybercrime, including cybertheft, occurs in cyberspace where crimes involve stealing money or valuable items using a computer. Terms like cyber intrusions and cyber attacks are also used. Innovation is defined as implementing new products, processes, marketing methods, or organizational methods. Indicators of innovation include activities related to commercializing inventions and new technologies. The United States, along with Germany, Japan, and China, accounted for over 60% of all 2014 PCT patent applications. China showed significant growth in 2014. Top technology fields in PCT filings included computer technology, digital communication, and medical technology. Intellectual property is a key driver of U.S. productivity, economic growth, and innovation. Intellectual property (IP) is a key source of U.S. comparative advantage, with industries like aerospace, automotive, computer, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors relying on patent protection. Copyright-based industries such as software, data processing, motion pictures, publishing, and recording also benefit. IP-intensive industries play a major role in the U.S. economy and international trade, supporting millions of jobs. IP-intensive industries in the United States directly and indirectly support millions of jobs, with higher wages compared to non-IP-intensive industries. These industries contribute over $5 trillion to the U.S. economy, accounting for more than one-third of the GDP. In terms of trade, IP-related merchandise exports totaled $775 billion, while imports reached $1,336 billion in 2010. Key sectors for IP-intensive trade include semiconductor and electric parts, basic chemicals, motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and computer equipment. In 2007, U.S. trade in services by IP-intensive industries totaled about $90 billion, with key sources including software publishing, motion picture and video, financial services, science R&D, and management consulting. The role of IP-intensive industries in services trade involves royalties and licensing fees for U.S. IP, resulting in revenues through authorizing technologies, trademarks, and entertainment products to foreign entities. In 2013, U.S. had a trade surplus of $90 billion from cross-border trade in royalties and license fees. Industries like computer software, videogames, books, and movies contributed $1.1 trillion to the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy benefits from the copyright industries, which contribute 6.7% to GDP and employ 5.5 million workers. Foreign sales in certain sectors reached $156.3 billion in 2013. The pharmaceutical industry supports over 810,000 direct jobs and has an economic output of nearly $800 billion annually. The manufacturing industry, particularly IP-intensive sectors, outperformed non-IP-intensive sectors between 2000-2012. Between 2000-2012, U.S. manufacturing industries, especially IP-intensive ones, outperformed non-IP-intensive industries in various economic measures per employee like R&D investment, wages, exports, value-added, and gross output. Advocates of civil liberties argue that the economic and commercial benefits of lawful exceptions and limitations to exclusive rights, known as \"fair use,\" are not fully considered in the analysis of IPR's role in the U.S. economy. The \"fair use\" doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted works without permission in cases like news reporting, research, and teaching. Advocates argue that \"fair use\" exceptions to copyright law, such as for news reporting and research, have significant economic benefits. In 2009, businesses relying on \"fair use\" generated $4.5 trillion in revenue and $2.4 trillion in value-added, supporting 17 million jobs. Globalization has led to new markets for U.S. exporters but also increased counterfeiting and piracy. Factors contributing to intellectual property rights infringement include advances in technology and globalization. IPR infringement is a growing problem with low costs and high profits, contrasting the high costs and time for research and development in the pharmaceutical industry. Counterfeiters can reduce costs by using cheap ingredients, leading to dangerous products. The rise of easily duplicated technologies and increased Internet usage have fueled counterfeiting and piracy. The United States is concerned with foreign IPR infringement of U.S. intellectual property. Quantifying economic losses from IPR theft is challenging due to its illicit and secretive nature. It is easier to measure the positive contribution of copyright industries to the U.S. economy than to quantify losses from IPR infringement. The economic impact of IPR infringement is challenging to measure due to various factors such as the types of infringing goods, consumer behavior, and deterrence to R&D. Calculating data on counterfeiting and piracy involves assumptions that can greatly influence loss estimates. The basic economic model assumes substitutability between pirated and legitimate goods, impacting sales. Sales of pirated goods can be equated to revenue losses of legitimate U.S. copyright businesses. IPR infringement is evolving from physical counterfeiting to digital piracy, making it harder to measure. The difficulty in accurately measuring economic losses from copyright infringement is exacerbated by the shift to digital piracy. Estimates of U.S. trade losses may be underestimated due to the prevalence of Internet piracy, with approximately 24% of global Internet traffic infringing on copyright. Data on economic losses from IPR infringement come from various sources, including academic, policy, and industry sources. The U.S. government lacks systematic data collection on the impacts of counterfeiting and piracy, relying on estimates from industry groups that may not always disclose losses due to reputational and commercial risks. The adverse economic effects of global IPR infringement amount to hundreds of billions of dollars, with trade in counterfeit and pirated goods estimated to be around $250 billion in 2007. Customs data on seizures provide insight into the impact on producers and exporters. Counterfeit and pirated goods in world trade have increased from 1.85% in 2000 to 1.95% in 2007. A study by BASCAP estimated the total value of counterfeit products for G-20 economies to be $455 billion to $650 billion in 2008, projected to reach $1.22 trillion to $1.77 trillion in 2015. The study also found that G-20 economies lost over $125 billion annually due to counterfeiting and piracy, leading to a loss of about 2.5 million jobs. In FY2014, U.S. border seizures of pirated and counterfeit goods totaled 23,140 commodities valued at $1.2 billion. China and Hong Kong were the top two source economies for seizures. Watches/jewelry and handbags/wallets were the most seized items, including circumvention devices violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The United States faces significant economic losses due to piracy and counterfeiting, with industries losing billions of dollars annually. Infringement of intellectual property rights can lead to job losses, reduced earnings for workers, and decreased tax revenues. Attempts have been made to quantify these losses, with estimates suggesting hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses from international theft of U.S. IP. The United States faces significant economic losses from international theft of U.S. IP, estimated to be in the range of total U.S. exports to Asia in 2012. Efforts have been made to quantify these losses, with a McAfee survey showing companies lost an average of $4.6 million worth of IP in 2008 from security breaches. The United States is a leading advocate of strong global IPR rules, integrating IPR policy in its international trade activities through various agreements. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995 to enhance rules on trade, including the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) from the Uruguay Round negotiations. The TRIPS Agreement, established by the WTO in 1995, sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection. Developed countries pushed for its inclusion in trade negotiations, while developing countries initially preferred discussing IPR under WIPO. Eventually, developing countries agreed to comply with TRIPS after negotiating other trade issues. This agreement marked the first time IPR rules were integrated into the multilateral trading system. The TRIPS Agreement, established by the WTO in 1995, sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection. It includes national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment principles, covering patents, copyrights, trademarks, and more. The agreement also outlines enforcement standards for civil, administrative, and criminal procedures related to intellectual property rights. The TRIPS Agreement, established by the WTO in 1995, sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection, including national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment principles. It covers patents, copyrights, trademarks, and more, with enforcement standards for civil, administrative, and criminal procedures. The agreement also establishes a Council to monitor implementation, transition arrangements for developing countries, and a dispute settlement mechanism with binding nature and consequences for non-compliance. It aims to balance rights and obligations, promoting technological innovation while securing social and cultural development. The TRIPS Agreement, established by the WTO in 1995, sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks. It aims to promote technological innovation while balancing rights and obligations. Article 66.2 requires developed countries to promote technology transfer to least-developed countries. Developing countries have tried to make technology transfer a meaningful obligation within the TRIPS Agreement system. The TRIPS Agreement, established by the WTO in 1995, sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection. Developed countries are required to promote technology transfer to least-developed countries. Developing countries have to make efforts to comply with international IPR standards, which may be more burdensome for them. Developing countries were given an extended period to bring their laws and enforcement mechanisms into compliance with the TRIPS Agreement. For developing countries, all provisions of the TRIPS agreement should now be in force. Least developed countries have been granted extensions for implementing IPR commitments, with the latest deadline set for July 1, 2021. LDCs are not required to fully apply TRIPS Agreement provisions until this date or until they are no longer classified as LDC countries. The Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations launched a Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health in 2001 to address developing country concerns. It delayed patent system provisions for pharmaceutical products for least developed countries until 2016 and allowed for compulsory licenses for pharmaceuticals in national emergencies like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The Doha Declaration directed WTO members to address the use of compulsory licensing for health emergencies like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Compulsory licenses allow domestic production of patented items by countries with insufficient manufacturing capability. Restrictions on production authorized by compulsory license limited its use to countries with manufacturing capability, excluding those without. On the eve of the Cancun Ministerial in August 2003, WTO members agreed to waive the domestic market provision of the TRIPS agreement for exports of pharmaceutical products for \"HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other epidemics\" to least developed countries and countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity. This Decision was later ratified as an amendment to the TRIPS agreement at the Hong Kong Ministerial in December 2005. The deadline for ratification has been extended multiple times, most recently until December 31, 2015. 57 WTO members have ratified the amendment so far, with the United States being the first to accept it. The WTO system allows countries to issue compulsory licenses for pharmaceutical products. Only Rwanda has used this system to import HIV/AIDS medicines from Canada. WIPO is another venue for addressing IPR issues. WIPO, established in 1970 after the WIPO Convention, focuses on global intellectual property protection. It administers IPR treaties setting minimum standards for member states, including the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty. WIPO, established in 1970 after the WIPO Convention, focuses on global intellectual property protection. It administers IPR treaties setting minimum standards for member states, including the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty. Recent WIPO efforts have focused on patent law, with the adoption of the Patent Law Treaty (PLT) in 2000 for harmonization of patent procedures. Discussions for a Substantive Patent Law Treaty (SPLT) began in 2001 but were put on hold in 2006 due to differing views among developed and developing countries. Government leaders at the G-8 meeting in 2008 called for \"accelerated discussions\" of the SPLT, although discussions remain stalled. WIPO focuses on building a technical and legal resource base for informed discussions on patent issues. Harmonization efforts are also happening outside WIPO, such as in the Trilateral Cooperation and IP5. WIPO assists member states with training programs, legislative information, and public awareness activities. Its enforcement activities are more limited compared to the WTO. President Obama signed the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, also known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), on June 29, 2015. TPA grants Congress time-limited authority to set trade negotiating objectives and expedite implementing bills for certain reciprocal trade agreements, with a focus on intellectual property rights (IPR) issues. IPR negotiating objectives for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) were first included in trade promotion authority in 1988. The 1988 Act (P.L. 100-418) aimed to enhance IPR protection and strengthen international rules through GATT and other conventions, leading to the TRIPS Agreement and IPR provisions in NAFTA. Subsequent FTAs followed this template, with a shift towards strengthening the IPR trade regime under the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210). The 2002 Trade Promotion Authority Act aimed to negotiate trade agreements with IPR provisions reflecting U.S. law, leading to \"TRIPS-plus\" provisions in FTAs. These provisions expanded coverage, established higher standards of protection, and limited flexibility options like compulsory licensing. Additionally, new measures addressed technological innovations and extended IPR protections to digital media in response to changing global commerce. The language in the May 10, 2007 Bipartisan Trade Agreement aimed to extend IPR protection to new technologies and methods of dissemination, ensuring legal and technological protections for works over the Internet and new media. The agreement also included flexibilities for patent protections to promote access to medicines in developing countries while maintaining strong overall IPR protection. Members of the new Democratic majority sought changes in pending U.S. FTAs to ensure developing countries have trading opportunities. The congressional leadership ensured that pending FTAs allowed flexibility for developing country trading partners to meet IPR obligations and promote access to medicines. A Bipartisan Trade Agreement was reached in May 2007, modifying IPR language in FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia. The U.S.-South Korea FTA was not modified as South Korea is considered a developed country. Congress passed the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Promotion and Accountability Act in June 2015, expanding on IPR negotiating objectives from 2002. The 2015 objectives recognize the importance of digital trade and seek provisions to prohibit. The objectives of the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Promotion and Accountability Act in June 2015 focus on recognizing the importance of digital trade and seeking provisions to prohibit cybertheft and trade secret theft. Key objectives include ensuring adequate protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) through the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement, protecting IPR related to new technologies, eliminating discriminatory treatment in IPR enforcement, and ensuring rights holder protection in digital trade. The United States focuses on enforcing IPR, protecting rights holders through digital rights management, preventing government involvement in IPR violations, and reaffirming the Doha Declaration on TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. The United States has been increasingly using free trade agreements to promote stronger intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes among foreign trading partners. They have entered into 14 FTAs with 20 countries and are currently negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement to reduce trade barriers and strengthen economic ties with participating countries. The United States is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to expand economic ties with participating countries in the region. The TPP includes extensive intellectual property rights (IPR) provisions, with significant disagreement among parties on issues like patent protection for pharmaceuticals. Significant disagreement persists among parties negotiating the TPP, with data exclusivity for biologic medicines being a major point of contention. The United States is pushing for a 12-year exclusivity period for biologic drugs, which some argue delays the introduction of affordable generic drugs in developing countries and those trying to manage healthcare costs. The United States is advocating for a 12-year data exclusivity period for biologic drugs in the TPP negotiations, which is causing disagreement among parties. Other TPP countries have shorter periods of protection. The Obama Administration is also in talks with the EU on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), where differences on intellectual property rights (IPR) obligations are a challenge. The EU and the United States have differing views on geographical indications (GIs) in trade negotiations. The EU emphasizes strong GI protection for products like Parmesan cheese and Champagne, while the US prefers trademark law. Balancing intellectual property rights with public policy goals like access to medicines is a key issue in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) talks. Trade secrets and cybercrime are also concerns in the negotiations. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) was negotiated outside of the WTO by the United States and other developed countries to address new IPR issues in the digital environment. Despite not entering into force, the ACTA's prospects are uncertain following the European Parliament's rejection in 2012. Japan is the only party to have submitted formal approval. IPR issues from the ACTA negotiations have resurfaced in the TPP and T-TIP negotiations, maintaining congressional interest. In U.S. FTAs, patent protection is a contentious issue related to the WTO TRIPS Agreement. Developed countries argue that patents incentivize innovation, while developing countries are concerned about drug costs and access. Many FTAs include TRIPS-plus patent provisions such as patent term extensions and compulsory licensing. The U.S. FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia address concerns over pharmaceutical patents and access to medicines. The U.S. Trade Representative seeks pharmaceutical IP provisions that promote innovation, generic drug competition, and affordable access to medicines in the TPP. Key patent issues include patent term extensions for \"unreasonable delays\" in issuing patents. Patent protection may be extended for \"unreasonable delays\" in issuing patents, allowing right holders to recoup R&D costs. This can delay the entry of generic drugs, increasing costs for consumers. TRIPS mandates a 20-year patent term but does not require extensions for delays. FTAs may include provisions for mandatory patent term extensions beyond TRIPS obligations. FTAs allow for patent term extensions in cases of \"unreasonable delays\" in patent issuance, beyond the TRIPS-mandated 20-year term. The U.S.-South Korea FTA defines \"unreasonable delays\" as a delay of more than four years from the filing date. Other FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and Peru make patent term restorations for pharmaceutical products optional. Countries are required to make \"best efforts\" to process patent and marketing approval applications. Patent linkage, a common requirement in many U.S. FTAs including KORUS, prohibits the approval of generic drugs without the patent holder's permission, delaying the entry of generic drugs into the market after the patent expires. This is in contrast to TRIPS, which does not mandate patent linkage obligations, allowing generic drug manufacturers to apply for marketing approval without the patent owner's consent. Regulatory authorities need permission from the right holder for marketing approval of a generic drug. U.S. FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia do not link generic drug approval to patent status. Data exclusivity protects test data, requiring generic companies to submit their own data for approval. This can incentivize innovation but may increase costs. TRIPS and U.S. FTAs provide data exclusivity for pharmaceutical products, incentivizing innovation but potentially raising costs and delaying access to generics. FTAs like KORUS extend data exclusivity beyond TRIPS, with minimum periods of five years for new products and three years for existing ones. The Colombia, Panama, and Peru FTAs maintain five years of data exclusivity for test data related to new chemical products, with provisions that may reduce the term by six months. Data exclusivity for biologics is a debated topic. Data exclusivity for biologics is a debated topic in trade policy. Compulsory licenses allow third parties to manufacture or use patented products without permission, with TRIPS permitting this practice and requiring compensation to the patent owner. U.S. FTAs with Australia and Singapore limit compulsory licenses to specific situations like domestic use, antitrust violations, national emergencies, and extreme need. Under U.S. FTAs, compulsory licenses are limited to specific situations like domestic use, antitrust violations, national emergencies, and extreme need. The patent holder is not obligated to provide test data or technical know-how for patents subject to compulsory licensing. Parallel imports, or grey-market goods, involve goods imported without permission of the rights-holder after being sold elsewhere. International exhaustion of IPR allows trade in goods without permission of the rights-holder. Under an international system, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are exhausted at the first sale for any destination, allowing for the free export of goods. Developing countries see parallel importation as a way to increase access to medicines without compulsory licenses. Pharmaceutical companies are concerned about the threat to price differentiation between markets. TRIPS does not address parallel imports, and U.S. FTAs with certain countries disallow this practice. The United States has pursued TRIPS-plus measures in FTAs, such as extending copyright terms and protecting rights-management information. U.S.-negotiated trade agreements prohibit the removal or alteration of such information, while patent protection policies have shifted in some FTAs. In FTAs, copyright protection provisions have been consistent, requiring an additional twenty years of protection, bringing the minimum term to seventy years. FTAs also address technological advancements by outlawing circumvention of technological measures and regulating ISPs' liability for copyright infringement. Copyright liability regulations require ISPs to block or remove infringing materials promptly. Critics argue these provisions burden ISPs and limit policy flexibility. Protecting proprietary information is crucial for a company's competitiveness and survival, with trade secrets often constituting a significant portion of firms' information portfolios. Trade secrets make up two-thirds of firms' information value. USTR's 2015 report highlighted the challenge of protecting U.S. trade secrets internationally, citing concerns about theft and inadequate enforcement. The digital environment has added complexity to trade secret theft, with cybercrime a growing concern. Penalties for theft vary among countries, with some lacking any penalties at all. In the United States, remedies for trade secret theft primarily are found in state law. The U.S. aims to establish criminal penalties for the theft of trade secrets in the TPP. This agenda may involve prohibiting countries from conditioning market access on technology transfer, seeking concessional terms for acquiring IPR by state-owned enterprises, requiring the use of locally owned IPR, promoting local standards unfairly, and requiring unnecessary disclosure of confidential business information. The Obama Administration's strategy on mitigating the theft of U.S. trade secrets, released in February 2013, emphasizes seeking new criminal remedy provisions for trade secret theft in U.S. trade negotiations. U.S. trade policy is increasingly focused on addressing evolving issues in international IPR protection and enforcement, influenced by the growing role of emerging markets and digital trade. The term \"indigenous innovation\" is associated with promoting domestic innovation, building R&D capabilities, and increasing the value added by domestic companies. Indigenous innovation policies aim to promote domestic innovation and increase the value added by domestic companies. These policies can involve government procurement, technical standards, and technology transfer. However, concerns have been raised that such policies, like those in China, may be discriminatory and disadvantage U.S. right holders, leading to trade tensions with the United States. China's indigenous innovation policies, including forced localization measures, are a concern for U.S. business leaders due to potential discrimination against foreign firms. These policies, highlighted in the USTR's 2015 Special 301 Report, are also gaining ground in countries like India. Forced localization measures act as non-tariff barriers to market access, favoring domestic industries at the expense of foreign counterparts. Localization barriers, such as in-country testing requirements and data localization rules, can limit market access and innovation in the ITC sector. These measures, while sometimes serving data privacy or security goals, can distort trade, hinder foreign direct investment (FDI), and prompt other countries to adopt similar restrictions. The WTO's TRIMs agreement prohibits discriminatory \"local content\" requirements for foreign investment, but challenges remain, especially in the digital realm. The TPP and T-TIP negotiations focus on localization barriers in the digital environment, affecting patent protections. Concerns arise over policy and legal developments in countries like India and Canada, where patent denials for pharmaceuticals have occurred since 2012. India's Supreme Court restricts patents for certain drugs without \"enhanced efficacy,\" impacting innovator companies' practices. India's patent laws aim to prevent \"evergreening\" by requiring enhanced efficacy for patent extensions. Pharmaceutical companies are accused of making minor modifications to prolong their monopolies, delaying the entry of cheaper generic drugs. India has issued compulsory licenses for pharmaceuticals, such as in the case of Nexavar, to make drugs more affordable for its citizens. The USTR criticized Canada's court decisions on pharmaceutical patents, leading to a NAFTA Chapter 11 case with Eli Lilly seeking $500 million in damages for lost sales. The Government of Canada is seeking $500 million in damages for lost sales due to invalidated patents for two medicines. The \"promise doctrine\" in Canadian patent law requires fulfillment of core criteria of patentability at the time of filing. Lilly claims that this standard is problematic. Lilly claims that Canada's utility standard for patents is discriminatory and contrary to other countries and NAFTA. The USTR has expressed concerns about the lack of clarity and impact of heightened utility requirements in Canadian courts, leading to uncertainty for patent holders and undermining incentives for investments in the pharmaceutical sector. The Government of Canada responded to accusations of discriminatory utility standards for patents on June 30, 2014, stating that its patent system aligns with NAFTA and TRIPS. Observers note the lack of a uniform standard for utility among countries and no specific standard in NAFTA. The tribunal has not yet issued a decision on the dispute. International trade negotiations are increasingly focusing on protecting plant and animal inventions, new plant varieties, traditional knowledge, and folklore. Some indigenous communities and NGOs are concerned about patents on traditional knowledge and genetic material, as well as the distribution of benefits from their commercial use. The US and other advanced countries support treating traditional knowledge as intellectual property. TRIPS allows exemptions for plants and animals from patentability, requiring protection through patents, sui generis systems, or a combination of both. Paragraph 19 of the Doha Declaration raised concerns about the relationship between TRIPS, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, and traditional knowledge. Countries like India, Brazil, and Peru argue for disclosure of genetic material sources for patent applicants. The US and EU support national systems where companies must share benefits from patents on genetic products. The recent FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia do not mandate patentability for plants and animals, but state that countries should expand patent coverage in these areas. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is the principal U.S. statute for identifying foreign trade barriers due to inadequate intellectual property protection. The 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act strengthened section 301 by creating \"Special 301\" provisions for an annual review of foreign countries' intellectual property policies. The USTR conducts an annual review of foreign countries' intellectual property policies and practices, identifying countries that do not offer adequate protection. The Special 301 provisions allow the USTR to designate countries denying sufficient intellectual property protection, even if they comply with TRIPS commitments. Findings are submitted in the USTR's annual \"Special 301\" report, categorizing countries based on their intellectual property practices. The USTR may designate countries as Priority Foreign Countries under section 301 provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 if they deny intellectual property protection. If named, the USTR must investigate the country's IPR practices and can impose trade concessions or import restrictions. Good faith negotiations or progress in improving IP protection can prevent designation. The WTO provides dispute settlement recourse in such cases. The USTR may designate countries as Priority Foreign Countries under section 301 provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 if they deny intellectual property protection. This could lead to dispute settlement proceedings at the WTO for member countries. Trade sanctions are a possibility for countries outside the WTO. The USTR has created administrative categories like Priority Watch List and Watch List to address intellectual property protection inadequacies. Section 306 Monitoring is used as a tool in this process. The USTR uses tools like Section 306 Monitoring and Out-of-Cycle Review to monitor countries for compliance with intellectual property agreements. The Special 301 statute guides the identification of countries for various lists based on factors like IPR infringement, laws enforcement, progress in IPR protection, and commitment to trade agreements. The USTR determines countries' placement on the watch list based on factors like commitment to trade agreements and gathers information from various sources. Section 337 of the Tariff Act prohibits unfair competition in product importation. Section 337 of the Tariff Act prohibits unfair competition in product importation, focusing on products produced through infringing protected intellectual property rights. The U.S. International Trade Commission administers these proceedings without requiring a showing of injury due to imports. The ITC can issue exclusion or cease and desist orders if a violation is found, enforced by CBP. A general exclusion order blocks all infringing articles, while a limited exclusion order targets specific firms. The ITC may also issue cease and desist orders to halt sales of infringing products in the US. Public interest criteria and presidential review can impact the issuance of remedies. The ITC considers various factors for presidential review of remedial orders, including public health, competitive conditions, production in the US, consumers, and foreign relations. Section 337 cases have been increasing, mostly involving patent infringement allegations and a rising number of trade secret investigations across various technologies. There is significant overlap between industries dominating the ITC's IP docket and those identified as the most patent-intensive by the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce identified four patent-intensive industries in the United States: computer and peripheral equipment, communications equipment, semiconductor and other electronic components, and other computer and electronic products. Legislative efforts related to Section 337 focus on jurisdictional issues with foreign websites and the balance between protecting intellectual property and promoting innovation. Congress may address these issues and the effectiveness of CBP's enforcement of exclusion orders. The Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator is reviewing the enforcement process of exclusion orders due to limited CBP resources. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency of Section 337. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free entry to certain products from developing countries to foster economic growth. GSP was renewed by the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. The Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-27) renewed the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which allows duty-free entry for certain products from developing countries. The GSP program includes criteria for countries to qualify as beneficiaries, with a focus on intellectual property protection. The USTR conducts annual reviews, addressing concerns like intellectual property rights in countries such as Indonesia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Since the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 renewed the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for duty-free entry of certain products from developing countries, the USTR has been conducting annual reviews on intellectual property rights in countries like Indonesia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Congress has responsibilities related to IPR and trade policy, including considering key issues such as the role of IPR in trade negotiations and its potential impact on trade liberalization. Debates focus on the balance between protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) in trade negotiations, including concerns about access to medicines and free flow of information. There are discussions on the use of regional and bilateral FTAs by the United States to promote IPR goals, with some questioning their effectiveness compared to multilateral efforts. Congress passed Trade Promotion Authority in June 2015, shifting attention to current trade policy issues. With the passage of Trade Promotion Authority in June 2015, attention is now on ongoing trade negotiations such as the TPP and T-TIP. Congress may need to assess how IPR negotiating objectives are being met in these agreements, including provisions related to patent protection and new objectives like indigenous innovation and cybercrime. The extent to which U.S. FTA partners and WTO members are complying with IPR standards is also a key consideration. The U.S. is concerned about the compliance of its FTA partners and WTO members with IPR commitments. Questions arise about the effectiveness of trade policy tools in enforcing IPR, such as the \"Special 301\" process and dispute settlement mechanisms. Supporters argue for balanced assessments of countries' IPR regimes. Some argue that the Special 301 process is industry-driven and lacks systematic country designations. The U.S. has been involved in several WTO disputes related to TRIPS Agreement, but only one case has been filed since 2000 against China. There are calls for greater use of WTO/FTA dispute settlement mechanisms to address IPR trade challenges with emerging economies like China. Congress may need to evaluate the criteria for initiating cases and the resources needed for investigations. Congress could explore options for advancing U.S. IPR trade policy objectives in emerging economies through U.S. FTA negotiations like TPP and T-TIP, which aim to address challenges in third countries and could potentially include China and India in the future. The United States seeks to encourage emerging economies to join TPP negotiations and is negotiating BITs with China and India to address IPR issues. Congress could examine the progress of these negotiations, which would require Senate ratification to enter into force. Some stakeholders suggest using U.S. trade programs to push for policy reform in emerging economies, such as removing India from the Generalized System of Preferences list due to concerns about its intellectual property environment. Congress may also review the effectiveness of the WTO TRIPS Agreement in dealing with emerging economies and consider using the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism to address violations. Some stakeholders urge the United States to enhance trade enforcement on intellectual property rights (IPR) with other countries. There are calls for potential updates to the TRIPS Agreement, especially in FTAs like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of the current U.S. IPR organizational structure in enforcing foreign countries' IPR obligations. Coordination issues among various federal agencies are also highlighted. The U.S. faces coordination challenges in enforcing intellectual property rights (IPR) due to the involvement of multiple federal agencies. There are debates on the effectiveness of the current organizational structure in coordinating IPR activities. Various interagency bodies like IPEC, IPR Center, and ITEC aim to enhance IPR enforcement, but concerns arise about potential overlaps in their functions. The U.S. faces challenges in coordinating IPR enforcement due to multiple federal agencies involved. There are debates on the effectiveness of the current organizational structure. Limited information on federal resources for IPR protection complicates lawmakers' ability to prioritize IPR activities. The U.S. government faces challenges in coordinating IPR enforcement due to multiple agencies involved. Congress may shape U.S. trade policy on IPR through negotiating objectives and FTA agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The U.S. government faces challenges in coordinating intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement due to multiple agencies involved. Congress may shape U.S. trade policy on IPR through negotiating objectives and free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries, including new issues like digital trade. Congressional debates may focus on IPR protection and enforcement in relation to public policy goals, such as access to affordable medicines, and the allocation of budgetary resources for IPR enforcement. Key U.S. government agencies and coordinating bodies are involved in IPR-related activities. The USTR is the lead U.S. trade negotiator and enforces IPR provisions in trade agreements. It monitors IPR protection of trading partners and identifies non-compliance through the Special 301 Report. The USTR enforces IPR provisions in trade agreements and monitors compliance. The Department of Commerce administers the GSP program and addresses IPR issues through the Patent and Trademark Office. The PTO develops IPR policy, collaborates on international agreements, and provides training for strong IPR regimes in foreign countries. The PTO's capacity building programs promote strong international IPR protection through the IPR Attach\u00e9 Program. The PTO is funded by fees from patent and trademark applications. The ITA monitors foreign countries' progress in implementing intellectual property agreements. The Department of Justice enforces criminal laws to protect intellectual property rights in the US and internationally. Key units responsible for IPR enforcement include the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney's Office, Civil Division, FBI, and Office of Justice Programs. The Criminal Division prosecutes intellectual property crimes, particularly through its Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). The Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) of the Department of Justice, along with the FBI, focuses on prosecuting computer crime and intellectual property offenses. The FBI's intellectual property enforcement program targets crimes that impact national and economic security, such as trade secret theft and counterfeit goods. Their strategic goal is to disrupt criminal organizations profiting from intellectual property theft. Other priorities include investigating counterfeit health and safety products and trade secret theft. The Civil Division also plays a role in recovering penalties for these offenses. The Department of Justice (DOJ) focuses on civil actions to recover penalties for importation of counterfeit goods and defends CBP enforcement of Section 337 exclusion orders. The DOJ also awards grants to support intellectual property enforcement efforts and works with Congress to develop laws for increased IPR protection. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to facilitate legitimate trade while enforcing U.S. trade and IPR laws, investigating trademark, counterfeiting, and copyright violations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) focuses on enforcing U.S. trade and IPR laws, including trademark, counterfeiting, and copyright violations. Key parts of DHS involved in IPR enforcement are U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Secret Service, and the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) leads day-to-day IPR enforcement activities at the U.S. border, detecting and seizing counterfeit and pirated goods, and determining penalties for infringement. CBP has the authority to detain or seize infringing goods and allows owners of copyrights and trademarks to record their rights in the CBP's electronic IPR database. ICE, in coordination with CBP, investigates and apprehends international criminal groups and individuals involved in importing and distributing counterfeit goods. When CBP seizes counterfeit goods, ICE conducts criminal investigations. Information relevant to identifying counterfeit shipments is shared between ICE and CBP. The U.S. Secret Service also investigates counterfeiting violations. The Secret Service investigates counterfeiting, financial crimes, and cyber attacks on critical infrastructure. They may uncover links to intellectual property rights violations. The FDA, under the Department of Health and Human Services, ensures the safety of medicines and food, including protecting against counterfeit drugs entering the U.S. They work with CBP to inspect FDA-regulated products at the border and conduct foreign inspections of manufacturers. The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress administers U.S. copyright law by registering claims to copyright and related documents, including \"assignments or transfers of rights\" and maintains information on registrations, recordings, compulsory licenses, and other copyright-related actions. Additionally, the Copyright Office provides legal and technical expertise on national and international copyright issues to the U.S. government. The Copyright Office also works with other federal agencies to provide assistance and advice in negotiations for international intellectual property agreements, as well as technical assistance to foreign countries crafting their own copyright laws. The Department of State represents U.S. views in international arenas, working to build consensus for IPR enforcement. State's foreign postings inform the USTR Special 301 review. The Bureau of INCLE combats intellectual property piracy, while the Bureau of Economics supports stronger international IPR standards. AID funds training to improve compliance with TRIPS Agreement and bilateral trade agreements. The ITC is responsible for quasi-judicial federal government agency duties. The ITC is a federal agency that investigates unfair trade practices related to intellectual property rights. It can issue orders to stop imports and \"cease and desist\" orders against violators. Damages for infringement must be sought through civil action in federal court. The USTR leads coordination of trade policy, including IPR protection. The Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) in the Office of Management and Budget coordinates federal agencies involved in IPR enforcement. The U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator develops and implements a \"Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement\" to combat counterfeiting and piracy. The Department of Homeland Security houses the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center), an interagency task force established by ICE in 2002 to combat counterfeiting and piracy. Led by the ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Director, the IPR Center coordinates federal intellectual property functions to protect national security and the economy. The IPR Center, led by the ICE HSI Director, focuses on law enforcement response to IPR theft through coordinating investigations and prosecutions. In contrast, the ITEC, established in 2012, aims to enforce U.S. rights under international trade agreements and trade laws through a \"whole-of-government\" approach. The Administration has emphasized the need for creating the ITEC to combat unfair trade practices, with support from various government departments. The USTR manages a private sector advisory committee system for trade policy, including 16 Industry Trade Advisory Committees (ITACs) representing industry and labor. ITAC membership includes industry and labor representatives from various U.S. economic sectors, with one committee focusing on intellectual property rights (IPR)."
