Congress finds that the use of large-scale achievement tests in education has increased, leading to concerns about the consequences of relying solely on these tests for high-stakes decisions affecting students. In 1997, Congress directed the National Academy of Sciences to study and recommend methods to ensure that tests assessing student performance are fair and not discriminatory. In 1999, the National Research Council issued a report titled \"High Stakes: Testing for Tracking, Promotion, and Graduation\" based on principles of measurement validity and effectiveness of treatment. The National Research Council found that tests, when used appropriately, can provide valuable information for decision-making in education. However, tests are not perfect and do not provide an exact measure of a student's knowledge or skills. It is important to ensure that all students are expected to meet high standards. To meet world-class standards, there is a need for world-class curricula and instruction for all students. However, in most of the Nation, much needs to be done before a world-class curriculum and instruction are in place. Currently, the curriculum lacks emphasis on student understanding and application of concepts, focusing more on memorization and skill mastery. Instruction in core subjects is highly stratified, with lower track students receiving less than a world-class curriculum. It is a mistake to start educational reform without addressing these issues. It is important to implement changes in teaching and curriculum before introducing high-stakes tests for individual students. Test validity issues are more significant for young children, especially those under 8 years old or below grade 3. Well-designed assessments can be beneficial for monitoring trends in student performance. The National Research Council recommends providing information about tests and scores to parents, educators, and officials for effective educational outcomes. Tests can guide curriculum changes but should not be the sole factor. The National Research Council recommends using tests to guide curricular reform, but cautions against using them for high-stakes decisions about individual students. High-stakes decisions should be based on multiple sources of information, not just a single test score. Large-scale assessments should not determine outcomes for students under 8 years old or below grade 3. High-stakes testing programs should include a well-designed evaluation component to monitor consequences on all students, including minorities, English-language learners, and students with disabilities. These principles are supported by the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing adopted by leading testing experts and organizations. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing emphasize that high-stakes testing should not solely determine decisions about student retention, graduation, or ability grouping. Test performance must meet professional standards of validity and reliability and allow for score interpretations in relation to a functional performance level. The test should be aligned with state or local standards and curriculum, follow changes in teaching, and use multiple measures of student achievement. The test must align with state or local standards, follow changes in teaching, and use multiple measures of student achievement. Students are given multiple opportunities to demonstrate proficiency, the test is administered according to guidance, and evidence shows technical quality. Appropriate accommodations and alternate assessments are provided for students with disabilities and limited English proficiency. Assessments for students with limited English proficiency may include using non-English tests, alternate assessments in the students' native language, and accommodations if more than 5 percent of students in a state require it. Students enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12 in a State who are members of a single language minority group and are limited English proficient may be assessed using tests developed in their language for accurate information. If the language of the group is oral or unwritten, oral instructions and assistance must be provided. Each State educational agency receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 must periodically evaluate the impact of high stakes decisions on students' education, particularly focusing on individual students and subgroups disaggregated by socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, and limited English proficiency. The English-only test should not be used for promotion or placement in special education for children below the age of 8 or third grade. The State educational agency must evaluate the impact of high stakes decisions on students' education, focusing on individual students and subgroups based on socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, limited English proficiency, disability, and gender. Local educational agencies receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 must also conduct evaluations if their state does not. The evaluation of high stakes decisions on students' education must consider the impact on individual students and subgroups based on socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, limited English proficiency, disability, and gender. Results of the evaluation should be made public with clear information about the test nature, use, and interpretation of scores. The Department of Education is required to conduct a similar evaluation among a sample of states and local educational agencies, report the results to Congress, and make them available to the public. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"large-scale test\" and \"sole criterion,\" which are crucial for understanding the evaluation of high stakes decisions on students' education."
