    "content": "The government of Puerto Rico is facing a serious fiscal emergency due to long-standing budgetary challenges. Despite reforms and tax increases, the economy is projected to shrink. Defaults on government bonds have already occurred, with more expected. In August 2015, debt service on bonds issued by the Public Finance Corporation was not paid in full. The Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority did pay interest on certain bonds due in January 2016, but the Government Development Bank did not pay principal due in May 2016. The Puerto Rican government's fiscal situation is dire, with depleted resources and strained liquidity. A federal judge declared the government insolvent and unable to pay its debts. The Governor of Puerto Rico acknowledged the insolvency while signing emergency legislation to address the crisis. The government has slowed tax refunds and supplier payments to improve liquidity. The Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act allows the governor to declare a fiscal state of emergency and a moratorium on debt payments. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla declared a moratorium on certain debt payments by the Government Development Bank, leaving a payment shortfall of about $367 million. The Commonwealth government stated it will not have sufficient resources to meet the entire debt service. The Puerto Rico government declared a moratorium on debt payments, citing a shortfall of $367 million. The Government Development Bank faced liquidity issues and was found insolvent in 2015. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla invoked emergency powers to address the financial crisis. The PREMFRA act allows Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla to declare an emergency period for the Government Development Bank (GDB) to continue operations. It also allows for the establishment of a bridge bank to assume GDB responsibilities and assets. A new public corporation, Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, would take over fiscal and financial advisory roles. Legal actions against the Puerto Rican government are stayed during emergency powers. GDB bondholders filed a suit to halt transfers. The Puerto Rican government filed a suit in federal court to prevent actions weakening the GDB's financial condition. Despite a temporary restraining order being declined, the suit was withdrawn after an executive order imposed strict conditions on GDB withdrawals. Previous measures have not put public finances on a sustainable path, despite efforts by the government and restructuring experts. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla has addressed the high costs of debt service and financial instability of public corporations. The financial situation of some public corporations led Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla and the island's legislature to enact debt restructuring legislation (Act 71) in June 2014. However, Act 71 was struck down by a U.S. district court in February 2015. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld this decision in July 2015. The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case in March 2016. Puerto Rico's public debt was downgraded by major credit ratings agencies in February 2014 and again in June 2014 after the enactment of Act 71. In late June 2014, Puerto Rico enacted Act 71 to restructure debt issued by public corporations, leading to downgrades. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla declared the island's debts unpayable in June 2015. By spring 2016, most public sector debt not covered by bond insurance was at default risk levels. Investor confidence plummeted, cutting off credit access and intensifying financial pressures. Market prices for Puerto Rican bonds dropped significantly. An August 2013 Barron's article had already highlighted the island's weak fiscal position and high debt. The article highlighted Puerto Rico's weak fiscal position and high public debt. The FY2016 budget set aside $1.5 billion for debt service costs, with total outlays of $9.8 billion. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla aimed for a balanced budget with major decreases in public spending. The budget was signed into law on July 1, 2015, after approval by the lower chamber and Senate. The FY2016 budget for Puerto Rico, signed into law on July 1, 2015, faced challenges with a structural budget deficit and high debt costs. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla stated that the debt was unpayable, leading to efforts to restructure the island's public debt. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla declared in a televised address in 2015 that Puerto Rico's debt was unpayable. He announced plans to seek concessions from creditors, implement structural changes, and start negotiations with creditors. The governor called for a comprehensive restructuring of the island's fiscal obligations to promote economic growth and improve access to credit markets. The governor of Puerto Rico declared the debt as unpayable in 2015 and proposed a comprehensive restructuring plan including legislation to improve competitiveness, reform of social insurance programs, investments in infrastructure, a moratorium on debt payments, and the creation of a working group for economic recovery. The plan aims to reduce public outlays, improve tax administration, privatize some services, enhance budgetary controls, and establish a nonpartisan fiscal commission. No new taxes or public employee layoffs are planned, but projected revenues from existing tax measures are included. The governor of Puerto Rico declared the debt as unpayable in 2015 and proposed a comprehensive restructuring plan. A report by former IMF economists highlighted serious fiscal problems in Puerto Rico. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla appointed an Economic and Fiscal Recovery Working Group, which issued a framework plan outlining budgetary and structural reforms to address a $27.8 billion financing gap over the next five years. The plan includes the establishment of a control board composed of experts to help stabilize the island's finances and promote long-term economic growth. The Economic and Fiscal Recovery Working Group in Puerto Rico identified fiscal gaps of $14 billion to $23 billion over 5 to 10 years. Recommendations include changes in income support programs, health program reimbursements, labor and public housing policies, and tax policy. Implementing these reforms may face challenges, especially those requiring approval by the Puerto Rican legislature. Austerity measures aimed at improving fiscal stability could have short-term adverse effects. The Puerto Rican government faced a financial crisis in 2015, with projections of running out of money by November. Extraordinary measures like delaying tax refunds and bond payments helped maintain liquidity. However, these actions strained households and businesses. By April 2016, the government was declared insolvent by the Governor and a federal judge. The Puerto Rican government faced insolvency in 2015, failing to pay $0.63 million of $58 million in bond interest and principal. Concerns arose about future payments on bonds with general obligation guarantees. Plans to issue $2.9 billion in bonds were put on hold, as the government aimed to bolster revenues with a tax reform and achieve fiscal sustainability. The Puerto Rican government faced insolvency in 2015, leading to difficulties in funding government operations. A measure was passed to allow public corporations to issue revenue bonds, providing some liquidity. Concerns were raised about the exposure of insurance companies to governmental credit risks. Constitutional limits on borrowing also posed financial hurdles for Puerto Rico's government. Puerto Rico's government debt servicing costs were close to the 15% limit imposed by the Constitution. Meeting this limit could require further fiscal adjustments or a constitutional amendment. Fiscal challenges are expected in FY2017, with doubts about the $1.9 billion debt service payments. The government lacks a line of credit to manage financing gaps. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla submitted a FY2017 budget on May 23, 2016, with outlays totaling $9.1 billion, $700 million less than the previous year. The budget was delayed due to uncertainties like an emergency fiscal act and a federal control board. Proposed debt service payments for FY2017 are below amounts due, reflecting the government's struggle to manage financing gaps. Various measures have been taken to realign revenues and outlays, including cutbacks to public pension systems and tax increases. Since 2009, Puerto Rico has implemented fiscal austerity measures such as cutbacks to public pension systems, tax increases, and reductions in public sector employment. Other measures include reorganization of public school staff, salary and benefit freezes, and modifications to pension systems. The government has also taken steps to improve the financial condition of public corporations. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico ruled that the government's reasons for changes to pension plans were insufficient to justify abrogation of certain contractual rights of teachers. Funding ratios for retirement systems in Puerto Rico remain low. The Legislative Assembly passed a measure to raise the sales tax rate to 11.5%, with 1% earmarked for local governments. Puerto Rico faces fiscal challenges dating back to the mid-1970s, with public debt now exceeding the island's gross national product. Efforts to strengthen finances include Act 1, which raised petroleum taxes and considered a transition to a value-added tax. Puerto Rico's public debt accelerated in the early 2000s, surpassing revenues. Total debt levels rose until the mid-1970s, declined gradually, then increased again until 2013. Public sector debt reached $69.9 billion by September 2015, with public corporations accounting for the largest portion. These corporations, integral to the economy since the 1930s, have contributed to the island's fiscal challenges. Public corporations in Puerto Rico, involved in various sectors like health care, transportation, electric power, broadcasting, education, arts, and tourism, have contributed significantly to the island's fiscal challenges. Off-budget debt issued by these corporations has been a major factor in the buildup of Puerto Rico's public debt since 2000. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) alone owes over $9 billion, representing a significant portion of the total public sector debt. PREPA, with over $9 billion in debt, entered a restructuring agreement in 2014 to secure financing for fuel purchases. Lisa Donahue was appointed as Chief Restructuring Officer in 2015. A restructuring plan was proposed in 2015 for $2.3 billion to modernize operations. A preliminary agreement was reached in 2015 to restructure part of the debt, including a 15% writedown. A tentative agreement was reached in mid-December 2015 between PREPA and holders of about 70% of PREPA's debt, contingent on the passage of a PREPA Revitalization Act by the Puerto Rico legislature. The act, enacted on February 16, 2016, includes a \"transition\" surcharge on consumer bills to help PREPA meet its financial obligations. Chief Restructuring Officer Lisa Donahue warned of cash shortages in the summer of 2016, potentially leading to operational disruptions due to PREPA's financial and operational challenges. PREPA's existing oil- and diesel-fired plants are old, inefficient, and unreliable, leading to disruptions in power supply. The lack of modern gas-fired power generation capacity hinders the potential of renewable energy on the island. Despite some reductions in prices due to falling oil prices, residential electricity prices are still 50% above average mainland rates, hindering economic growth. Unbilled power generation and lost or unaccounted for power have reduced PREPA's revenues. The Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico (GDB) serves as a financial advisor and provides short-term financing for the government and public corporations. It also issues loans and guarantees to private entities and has historically been involved in economic investments for Puerto Rico. In the 1990s and 2000s, the GDB financed investments and operating costs of the Puerto Rican government. By June 2013, the public sector accounted for nearly all of the GDB's loan portfolio, which was 48% of its government-wide assets. Credit rating agencies and government reports warned of financial risks due to Puerto Rico's public debt restructuring. In August 2015, Puerto Rico failed to make a full payment on bonds issued by the Public Finance Corporation, a GDB subsidiary. In March 2016, a federal court judge revealed the GDB's insolvency in 2015. GDB officials acknowledged the bank's precarious financial situation. The Governor of Puerto Rico declared a moratorium on debt payments by the Government Development Bank (GDB) due to financial difficulties. Steps have been taken to transfer GDB responsibilities and assets to other institutions to prevent insolvency. Independent analysts suggest other public corporations are also insolvent, but officials emphasize differences in financial conditions among government entities. The Highways and Transportation Authority (HTA) in Puerto Rico has faced financial challenges, including cost overruns on the Tren Urbano project and operating deficits. HTA owed the Government Development Bank (GDB) $2.2 billion in 2012 and enacted a tax on petroleum products in 2015 to repay debts. The Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority (PRASA) also faces financial issues. The Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority (PRASA) has seen improvements in its financial situation due to increased water rates, although investors remain skeptical. Plans to issue $750 million in new revenue bonds were postponed indefinitely after the Puerto Rican governor declared the island's public debts unpayable. A revitalization bill for PRASA has passed both the Puerto Rican House of Representatives and Senate, creating a customer surcharge to support debt service for three years. The Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority (PRASA) has improved financially with increased water rates, but investors are still doubtful. A customer surcharge is proposed to support debt service for three years. Puerto Rico's public finances are in a precarious state due to prolonged economic weakness, low employment rates, and population decline. A study found that a third of Puerto Ricans now live on the mainland, with migrants being younger and less educated. Outmigration reduces labor available for economic growth, signaling better opportunities on the mainland. Some migrants return to the island, but trends show more moving to the mainland. Congress has options to address Puerto Rico's fiscal distress due to its territorial status. The federal government's reluctance to offer direct financial assistance to states in fiscal distress is influenced by the unique status of territories like Puerto Rico. State governments are expected to take responsibility for their fiscal decisions, as central governments in some federal systems provide more support but impose stricter fiscal controls. Former IMF economists' report highlighted these dynamics. The report by former IMF economists suggested imposing fiscal controls on Puerto Rico to address economic issues. Congressional options include providing credit support or changing bankruptcy laws for short-term liquidity challenges, while also focusing on long-term economic growth. The U.S. Department of the Treasury proposed legislation to help Puerto Rico restructure its debt, improve fiscal governance, healthcare, and stimulate the economy. The Obama Administration ruled out a federal bailout but offered technical support. The Obama Administration ruled out a federal bailout for Puerto Rico but offered technical support and proposed a broad legal framework for debt restructuring. Central governments and international organizations have historically provided credit support to lower borrowing costs for governments, often tied to reform requirements. For example, the European Central Bank supported Eurozone countries in 2011, and the U.S. government provided credit guarantees for Mexico in 1994-1995. The U.S. government provided credit support for state government agencies through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation during the Depression era. Different reimbursement and eligibility rules apply to federal entitlement programs in Puerto Rico compared to the mainland, such as capped funding for Medicaid in territories. Congress has the ability to revise Medicaid matching fund formulas, eligibility standards, reimbursement rules, and enrollment standards. In the 114th Congress, Resident Commissioner Pierluisi introduced bills to modify federal health and income support programs for Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is excluded from filing under chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, preventing subunits like public corporations from seeking debt relief. The restructuring law enacted in June 2014 aimed to address the financial situation. In June 2014, Puerto Rico enacted a law to provide an alternative to bankruptcy for public corporations like PREPA. However, the law was struck down by a U.S. district court. Congress could amend the Bankruptcy Code to allow Puerto Rico's municipalities to enter chapter 9 for debt restructuring. Bills were introduced by Resident Commissioner Pierluisi and Senator Blumenthal to address this issue. On July 15, 2015, Representative Pelosi introduced the Puerto Rico Emergency Financial Stability Act of 2015 (H.R. 4290) to stay litigation on the island's public debts. Senator Warren introduced a companion measure (S. 2436) in the Senate. Senator Menendez later introduced bills (S. 2675, S. 2676) for debt adjustments. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla and Treasury Secretary Lew support giving Puerto Rico access to chapter 9, but some hedge funds oppose it. Access to chapter 9 for Puerto Rico may offer limited relief from debt burdens, especially for GO bond holders. The island's debt is mainly issued by the central government, while public corporations issue special revenue bonds, which are typically protected from adjustment. A federal system of government provides fiscal insurance to lower-level governments, allowing them to adapt policies to local preferences. A federal system of government provides fiscal insurance to lower-level governments, allowing them to respond to disasters or economic downturns. Different federal systems vary in the level of support provided to local governments, with some allowing more autonomy while others impose more central control. The independence of U.S. state governments in managing their finances is tied to their responsibility for budgetary shortfalls. The U.S. federal system provides implicit fiscal insurance to state and local governments through income support programs and federal disaster assistance. Some Members have suggested a control board to oversee Puerto Rico's finances, while Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla has proposed a local control board for fiscal recovery. Representative Jeff Duncan has also discussed oversight of public administration in Puerto Rico. Jeff Duncan, chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, proposed a control board similar to the one established for the District of Columbia in 1995 to oversee Puerto Rico's finances. However, a federal appeals court judge argued that direct Congressional control over Puerto Rico's finances would require redefining its relationship with the United States. The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 created the Control Board and a chief financial officer position for the District's financial operations. The federal government assumed pension and judicial obligations of the District, reduced its share of Medicaid costs, and established a Control Board in 1995. State governments have also set up financial control boards for other cities like Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Detroit. The U.S. Treasury proposed fiscal oversight and debt restructuring for Puerto Rico in 2015. Congressional proposals, including H.R. 4199, have suggested control or oversight boards for Puerto Rico's financial stability and debt restructuring. The Puerto Rico Financial Stability and Debt Restructuring Choice Act was introduced in December 2015. Senator Hatch introduced the Puerto Rico Assistance Act of 2015 on the same day. The House Natural Resources Committee issued a discussion draft in March 2016 for the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act. Representative Duffy introduced the PROMESA Act in April 2016 to set up an Oversight Board for Puerto Rico and restructure its debts. H.R. 5278, a revised version of the PROMESA Act, was introduced in May 2016. The House Committee on Natural Resources marked up H.R. 5278 on May 25, 2016, with amendments including technical corrections and extensions of studies on Puerto Rico's government and economy. The committee approved the measure on a 29-10 vote, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating a cost of $370 million to operate the Oversight Board for Puerto Rico. Section 107 of H.R. 5278 mandates a dedicated funding source for the board, which would increase federal revenues by the same amount. The House Committee on Natural Resources approved H.R. 5278 with amendments, including a dedicated funding source for the Oversight Board for Puerto Rico, estimated to increase federal revenues by $370 million. Puerto Rico's reliance on tax advantages has reduced U.S. Treasury receipts, with IRS support for Act 154 taxes offsetting revenue losses. Puerto Rico's Act 22, providing tax exemptions to wealthy residents, may impact U.S. Treasury revenues. Congress could address structural issues hindering Puerto Rico's economic growth, like Jones Act restrictions on shipping. Labor participation rates in Puerto Rico are low, with suggestions that social insurance discourages formal employment. The Economic and Fiscal Recovery Working Group proposed an earned income tax credit in September 2015. The Economic and Fiscal Recovery Working Group plan of September 2015 proposes labor reforms such as an earned income tax credit, restructuring of the Nutritional Assistance Program, and changes to public housing policies to incentivize work. Some economists suggest that the federal minimum wage hinders labor demand. The plan also includes limits on severance pay, weakened dismissal protections, and changes in overtime regulations, along with a request for a 10-year waiver of minimum wage increases for workers under 25."
