According to Congress findings, in 2013, US healthcare spending reached $2.9 trillion, with over 75% attributed to chronic disease treatment. The World Health Organization reported that diet is a major cause of chronic diseases. Chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer account for 7 out of 10 deaths in the US each year. Heart disease was the leading cause of death in 2013 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2013, heart disease was the leading cause of death for American adults, with approximately 600,000 deaths each year. Coronary heart disease costs American taxpayers $108.9 billion annually. Research shows that a healthy diet can reduce cardiovascular disease symptoms and reverse artery damage. Two-thirds of US adults are overweight, with half being obese. The US spends $147 to $210 billion yearly on obesity-related diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. According to statistics, diabetes affects millions of Americans, with 29.1 million diagnosed cases and 86 million adults with prediabetes. The costs of diagnosed diabetes have risen to $245 billion in 2012. Additionally, the American Cancer Society predicts 1,658,370 new cancer cases and 589,430 cancer-related deaths in the US in 2015. This accounts for nearly 1 in 4 deaths in the country. The direct medical costs for cancer in the United States in 2011 were $88.7 billion. Physicians in 2008 felt inadequately trained to provide nutrition advice, with only 14 percent feeling adequately trained. A 1985 report recommended 25 hours of nutrition education in medical schools, but by 2010, only 38 percent of schools met this requirement. In 2010, the percentage of medical schools requiring a dedicated nutrition course decreased from 30% to 25%. Over half of graduating medical students felt their nutrition education was insufficient. Healthy People 2020 aims to increase nutrition counseling in physician office visits, but in 2010, only 13.8% included such counseling. According to Mission: Readiness, one in four Americans cannot serve in the military due to weight. The military discharged 4,300 active-duty personnel in 2012 due to weight problems. The military spends over $1 billion a year on weight-related health problems. American Indian or Alaska Native adults are more likely to be obese and have diabetes compared to White adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Indian or Alaska Native adults have the highest rate of diabetes among all minority groups at 15.9 percent. The Department of Health and Human Services guidelines and federal agencies' annual reports focus on primary care federal health professionals completing continuing medical education on nutrition. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue guidelines for federal agencies to ensure full-time primary care health professionals receive continuing education on nutrition. Federal agencies must submit biannual reports to Congress on the adoption of these guidelines. The Act requires federal agencies to ensure primary care professionals receive continuing education on nutrition, specifically focusing on the role of nutrition in preventing obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. The agencies must report the percentage of professionals who completed these courses in their biannual reports to Congress. The curr_chunk defines education as courses meeting CME or CE requirements for medical or nurse practitioners. It also defines terms like nurse practitioner, physician, primary care health professional, and primary care services. The curr_chunk clarifies that \"services\" include those provided by nurse practitioners as if they were furnished by a physician, as defined in the Social Security Act."
