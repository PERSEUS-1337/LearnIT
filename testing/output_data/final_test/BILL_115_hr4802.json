The Act requires Senior Real Property Officers of covered agencies to track applications for locating or modifying communications facilities on federal property, including the number of applications received, approved, and denied, along with reasons for denials and timeframes. The Act mandates Senior Real Property Officers to monitor applications for communication facilities on federal property, tracking receipt, approval, denial reasons, timeframes, compliance with deadlines, and costs incurred by the agency. The Senior Real Property Officer of a covered agency must submit an annual report to the Assistant Secretary on the tracking of applications for communication facilities on federal property, including specified information. Additionally, the Assistant Secretary must submit a report to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives within 180 days after the end of each fiscal year. The report to be submitted to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation will include information from Senior Real Property Officers' reports, an analysis of agency application consideration efficiency, and recommendations for improving the application process. Beginning on the first day of the fiscal year, the Senior Real Property Officer of a covered agency must respond to inquiries about application status within 7 days. Agencies are required to include performance goals for speed and efficiency in their performance plans.
