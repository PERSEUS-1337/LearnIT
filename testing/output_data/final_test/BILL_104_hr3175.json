The Women and Alcohol Research Equity Act of 1996 highlights the importance of research on alcohol abuse and alcoholism among women. Data shows that one in four alcoholics in treatment is a woman, and research funding for women's alcohol-related issues is crucial. Additionally, research indicates that alcohol can lead to more severe health issues in women compared to men. Approximately 30 percent of clients with alcohol problems seek treatment in traditional public facilities, while women are more likely than men to use nontraditional health care systems for alcohol-related issues. Data on women in nontraditional treatment settings is lacking, making it difficult to determine if they are overrepresented or underrepresented. Alcohol use by pregnant women is the leading cause of mental retardation in newborns, with fetal alcohol syndrome affecting 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 babies annually. The incidence of fetal alcohol effects (FAE) is higher than fetal alcohol syndrome, with varying rates among different ethnic groups. Treatment programs often lack child care options for women seeking help, and the death rate of female alcoholics is high. The death rate of female alcoholics is significantly higher than for male alcoholics, with more women dying from cirrhosis of the liver. Women also tend to experience greater physiological impairment earlier in their drinking careers, despite consuming less alcohol than men. Additionally, women become intoxicated faster than men. The combined effects of estrogen and alcohol may impact liver damage and osteoporosis in women. Women metabolize alcohol faster than men due to different enzyme and hormonal activity. Chronic heavy drinking can lead to menstrual disorders, fertility issues, and premature menopause. Alcohol consumption is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, especially with daily intake of 1 ounce or more of absolute alcohol. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has increased research funding for alcohol abuse and alcoholism among women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has increased research funding for alcohol abuse and alcoholism among women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has allocated specific funding for research on alcohol abuse and alcoholism among women, with a minimum amount set for fiscal year 1997 and additional appropriations authorized for subsequent years."
