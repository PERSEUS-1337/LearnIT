    "content": "The 2010 ACA mandated state health care exchanges for selling insurance policies. States can create their own exchange or partner with the federal government. HHS will run exchanges for states that do not comply. As of July 2014, some states had their own exchanges, some had partnership exchanges, and others had federally facilitated exchanges. Exchanges started offering insurance on October 1, 2013, and were fully operational on January 1, 2014. The health care exchanges, operational since January 1, 2014, serve as marketplaces for private insurance companies to sell qualified health plans. Individuals must use the exchanges to qualify for federal premium tax credits and subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office projects 25 million enrollees by 2024, with new enrollees expected to be diverse and less familiar with insurance. The ACA requires exchanges to perform education and outreach functions to help consumers navigate the enrollment process. Techniques include mailings, brochures, social media, and health fairs. Consumer assistance outreach programs include navigator and non-navigator programs to provide information about insurance plans and federal assistance. Non-navigators complement navigators by reaching underserved populations and have separate federal funding. They are optional at state exchanges and mandatory at certain partnership exchanges. Certified application counselors assist with QHP enrollment and subsidies. Counselors have more limited duties than navigators and non-navigators, and may be funded through existing programs. Consumers can also use insurance brokers and agents to purchase QHPs. Brokers and agents, licensed by states, can help consumers purchase Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and are paid commissions by insurance companies. They may also apply to serve as navigators but cannot receive compensation from insurers in this role. Consumers can also directly approach insurance companies for information and enrollment in QHPs. Some states have implemented additional training and licensing requirements for navigators. The navigator program under the ACA requires exchanges to have navigators who conduct public education activities, distribute information on QHPs, and facilitate enrollment. CMS interprets the law to allow states to not require all navigators to be licensed as insurance agents or brokers. Federal and state oversight of navigators, the role of brokers and agents, and previous education and outreach efforts for federal health care programs are outlined in this report. The ACA requires exchanges to have navigators who assist with grievances, complaints, and questions, provide culturally and linguistically appropriate information, and help consumers compare insurance options. Navigators must be qualified and licensed, and exchanges determine eligibility for tax credits and assistance. Exchanges enroll applicants into Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and determine eligibility for tax credits and assistance. Navigators, including various organizations and individuals, assist with enrollment and provide information, but cannot be health insurers or receive consideration from them. CMS regulations prohibit individuals or organizations from serving as navigators if they have connections with enrolling individuals in QHPs or non-QHPs. Entities involved in stop loss insurance or receiving consideration from health insurance issuers are also barred. Insurance brokers and agents can apply to become navigators but cannot accept compensation from insurers in this role. In instances when a state operates a SHOP exchange, but the state's individual exchange is run by the federal government, CMS allows two separate navigator programs. Such states will have a federal navigator program for the individual exchange and a state navigator program for the SHOP. SHOP navigators can refer small businesses to agents and brokers for assistance, as long as state law permits. Navigators must have a physical presence in their exchange service area. Navigators working for federally facilitated exchanges are not required to have their principal. CMS awarded $67 million in grants to 105 navigator organizations for federally facilitated and partnership exchanges in August 2013. Another $60 million in grants was released in June 2014 for new navigator programs, with awards taking effect in September 2014. Applicants must submit outreach and education plans to CMS for approval. Navigator applications are evaluated based on outreach and education activities, existing relationships with eligible individuals, compliance with regulations, conflict of interest policies, training requirements, and data privacy standards. Criteria for evaluation include planned activities and budget. Navigators are evaluated based on planned activities, budget, background, expertise in health issues, outreach, and working with underserved populations. They must provide regular reports and comply with CMS evaluations. Navigator organizations may receive a higher score if they have a plan for background checks. State-based exchanges can establish non-navigator programs with similar functions. States in consumer partnership exchanges must create non-navigator programs in addition to navigator programs. State-based exchanges and consumer partnership exchanges can use ACA Section 1311 grants for non-navigator programs in their first year of operation. This program was created by CMS to address funding gaps for education and outreach. Non-navigators can complement navigator programs and provide a full range of services during the initial year. The sustainability of funding for subsequent years is uncertain, but exchanges are required to be self-sustaining from January 1, 2015 onwards. Exchanges have the option to charge fees to participating issuers or explore other revenue-generating methods. Non-navigator programs at consumer partnership exchanges and state-based exchanges funded through ACA grants must adhere to training and conflict-of-interest restrictions similar to navigators. State-based exchanges can create non-navigator programs using their own funds and are encouraged to follow CMS navigator standards. Non-navigators in federally funded and state exchanges must maintain a physical presence in exchange areas. State exchanges have flexibility in defining roles of in-person assistance and non-navigator personnel. CMS regulations require state exchanges to have certified application counselor programs to help with enrollment in QHPs. State-based exchanges may use Section 1311 establishment funds for counselor training. Certified application counselors can be funded by private, state, or federal programs. They are designated by exchanges to provide information on QHPs and health insurance affordability programs. Counselors must act in the best interest of enrollees when assisting with applications for coverage. State-based marketplaces can certify counselors directly or through outside organizations. Certified application counselors must undergo exchange-approved training, comply with data security and privacy standards, and meet state and federal laws. They work with exchanges, navigators, and non-navigators to assist individuals with disabilities, address complaints, and provide services. Recertification is required annually, and counselors must meet state or exchange standards. They cannot receive any form of compensation from health insurance issuers. Entities can become certified application counselors regardless of receiving payment from health insurers. They do not need a physical business location in the exchange area. CMS provided grants to community health centers to help enroll consumers in QHPs. Navigators and non-navigators must attest to their eligibility and submit conflict-free plans. CMS regulations state requirements for business arrangements. CMS regulations (45 C.F.R. 155.215) allow certain business arrangements for navigators and non-navigators as long as they do not hinder fair, accurate, and impartial services. To address conflicts of interest, covered navigators must disclose information such as insurance lines they intend to sell, employment history with insurance issuers, and any spousal relationships with insurance companies. In May 2014, CMS issued final rules to protect enrollees and prevent abuse in outreach and enrollment activities for navigators, non-navigators, and certified application counselors. Conflict-of-interest rules apply to staff of entities awarded navigator or non-navigator grants. Certified application counselors must disclose potential conflicts of interest to the exchange. The final rules issued by CMS in May 2014 require authorization from consumers before accessing their personally identifiable information. Navigators, non-navigators, and certified application counselors cannot be compensated on a per-application basis and are prohibited from charging applicants for assistance. They also cannot provide gifts or cash exceeding $15 to promote third-party products. Assisters may use cash exceeding nominal value to reimburse applicants for legitimate expenses incurred during the exchange process. They are prohibited from soliciting consumers for assistance through direct contact unless initiated by the consumer or with a preexisting relationship. Outreach activities can be conducted through unsolicited contact methods. Automatic telephone dialing systems or prerecorded messages cannot be used unless there is a preexisting relationship with the consumer. Consumers can change plans if assisters make an error in their application. CMS regulations require training standards for assisters at federally facilitated exchanges and state-run exchanges. Navigators and non-navigators must complete 20 hours of HHS-approved training and pass exams for certification. State exchanges can also develop their own training with HHS approval. Annual certification or recertification is mandatory for all personnel. CMS regulations require navigators and non-navigators at exchanges to undergo 20 hours of training covering eligibility, enrollment rules, insurance options, government assistance, privacy, outreach methods, and working with individuals with disabilities or limited language skills. Privacy training includes safeguarding health, income, tax information, and Social Security details. The CMS regulations require navigators and non-navigators to safeguard health, income, tax information, and Social Security numbers. Navigators must also have knowledge about the racial, ethnic, and cultural groups in their service areas, provide information in a consumer's preferred language, recruit a diverse staff, and assist individuals with disabilities. Certified application counselors must pass a certification exam and provide materials and assistance to individuals with disabilities. They do not need training on certain federal health programs. Counselors can refer individuals to navigator programs, non-navigator programs, or an exchange call center for appropriate services. CMS regulations protect enrollee privacy. CMS regulations require exchanges to include security and privacy requirements in contracts with non-exchange entities accessing personally identifiable information. Violations can result in fines up to $25,000 per disclosure. States may set additional criteria and background checks for navigators. CMS regulations mandate security and privacy requirements for entities accessing personally identifiable information. States can impose additional eligibility criteria and background checks for navigators and non-navigators. Federally facilitated exchanges only designate outside organizations with screening processes for staff and volunteers, experience in social services, and compliance with rules. Exchanges can terminate agreements if organizations fail to meet terms or violate privacy standards. The agreements between brokers and agents with federally facilitated exchanges outline privacy and security standards for handling personally identifiable information. CMS will monitor compliance with these standards, including oversight of non-exchange entities. State exchanges will oversee entities required to comply with state-specific standards. HHS may conduct audits and investigations to ensure privacy and security protocols are followed. The ACA allows states and exchanges to impose additional standards for navigators, with CMS regulations interpreting that these standards should not prevent the application of ACA Title I. HHS oversight includes audits, investigations, and reporting requirements for security incidents and breaches by federally facilitated exchanges and state-based exchanges. Non-exchange entities associated with federal or state exchanges must also report incidents and breaches accordingly. CMS has determined that states and exchanges cannot require all navigators to be licensed agents or brokers to comply with ACA regulations. This would violate ACA rules mandating that each exchange have at least two different types of navigators, including community or consumer-focused non-profit groups. Eligible navigator organizations include chambers of commerce, unions, and health workers. In May 2014, CMS issued final rules providing guidance on state standards that could hinder the application of ACA Title 1 for navigators and non-navigators. State standards include requirements that prevent referral to entities not providing fair information, restrictions on services to those needing assistance, limitations on advice about health plans, and imposing standards that could block federal requirements for navigators and non-navigators. CMS awarded $67 million in grants to 105 organizations for navigator programs in federally facilitated and partnership exchanges in August 2013. Funding was allocated based on the number of uninsured residents in each state. Grantees began assisting with enrollment in October 2013. CMS awarded $67 million in grants to 105 organizations for navigator programs in federally facilitated and partnership exchanges in August 2013. Grantees included food banks, county commissioners, hospitals, universities, legal aid societies, Planned Parenthood chapters, and American Indian health services. A second round of navigator grants was announced for the 12-month period starting in September 2014, with each state eligible for at least $600,000 in funding. ACA Section 1311 provides money for planning and establishment grants for exchanges, with the Secretary determining the total available to each state for exchange grants. No grants may be awarded after January 1, 2015. State-based exchanges and consumer partnership exchanges can use Section 1311 exchange grants to fund non-navigator assistance programs during their initial year of operation. Section 1311 funds can also cover the costs of administering the navigator program, including training and oversight. State exchanges spent more on outreach than federally facilitated exchanges, with an average of $30.66 per beneficiary compared to $11.49. States with their own exchanges had more stringent training requirements. U.S. health insurance agents and brokers, known as \"producers,\" play a crucial role in helping individuals and businesses choose suitable policies. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, insurance producers held about 443,400 jobs in 2012 with median annual wages of $48,150. They offer various financial services, including annuity products and retirement planning, and are paid by insurance companies. Insurance agents and brokers work with consumers and are paid by insurance companies. They can be captive agents working for one firm or independent agents selling products from multiple insurers. Independent agents may earn commissions, while those working for an agency or insurer may receive a salary with commission or bonus. Insurance brokers represent a wider array of products than agents and play a greater role in assessing clients' risk profiles and insurance needs. Web-based insurance brokers offer products from various insurers on a central website, where potential clients can enter basic information to view different insurance plans based on company name, cost, premiums, and other variables. The ACA regulates agent and broker activity, including provisions like the Medical Loss Ratio requirement. Commissions and fees paid to brokers are considered administrative costs by CMS. Some insurance companies have reduced commissions to meet the MLR. Agents and brokers have reduced commissions to meet MLR requirements and contain costs. They play a role in selling QHPs to individuals and small businesses, drawing consumers to exchanges. They can help enroll individuals through exchange websites or outside issuer sites. If clients qualify for federal health programs, brokers should direct them to the appropriate agency. CMS regulations outline processes for licensed agents to enroll consumers in QHPs through federally facilitated exchanges and sell off-exchange insurance. Federally facilitated and partnership exchanges do not pay commissions to brokers for selling QHPs, but require insurance companies to pay similar broker compensation. Agents and brokers in these exchanges must register, complete training, and comply with laws. Once certified, they receive an exchange user ID to make transactions and receive compensation from insurers. Insurance agents and brokers with national producer numbers can assist consumers in purchasing Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) through federally facilitated and partnership exchanges. They use either an issuer-based pathway or an exchange pathway to help consumers on exchange websites. Agents and brokers also use the exchange website for employer and employee applications on SHOP exchanges. Insurers assign agents and brokers to sell their products, check their license status, and ensure they are certified by the exchange. Agents start the signup process by logging onto the insurer's website. Agents and brokers with national producer numbers can assist consumers in purchasing Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) through exchanges. They redirect consumers to the exchange website for eligibility application and plan selection. Agents may help create exchange accounts, but consumers must finalize the process themselves. Consumers must create their own secure password and user name for exchange accounts. State-based exchanges regulate agents and brokers selling QHPs, requiring continuing education and state-specific training. Producers may need to provide information on all available QHPs to consumers. Brokers and agents can be compensated directly through exchanges or issuer-based commissions. Brokers must enroll individuals in Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) through the exchange. Federally facilitated and partnership exchanges can work with web-based brokers, subject to state regulations. State-based marketplaces have flexibility in setting conditions for web-based brokers, but CMS regulations mandate exchanges to determine enrollee eligibility and transmit enrollment information to QHP issuers. Web-based brokers must comply with marketing restrictions to prevent confusion with official exchange websites, display QHP information, and allow consumers to view all exchange QHPs. Web brokers selling products on federally facilitated exchanges must display disclaimers indicating that their website may not contain all QHP information available on the exchange website. They are also subject to exchange marketing and privacy regulations and must provide links to the appropriate exchange. CMS is developing guidance on displaying these disclaimers as some consumers may contact insurance companies. CMS rules require insurers to provide options for consumers to enroll in Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) through exchanges. This includes displaying all QHPs offered, distinguishing between eligible QHPs and other health plans, and clarifying that tax credits only apply to QHPs through an exchange. Additionally, insurers must use an approved disclaimer, provide a weblink to the exchange, and charge the same premium as QHPs on the exchange. Insurers must charge the same premium for QHPs on exchanges, after federal subsidy adjustments. Insurers can assist consumers with eligibility determinations, tax credits, and QHP selection, following exchange and state laws. HHS has conducted previous health insurance education and enrollment initiatives. HHS has conducted previous health insurance education and enrollment efforts, including programs like Medicare Part D and CHIP. These initiatives involve public relations, advertising, and trained volunteers to assist consumers in making health insurance decisions. Lessons from these programs are being used to launch in-person assistance programs for ACA outreach. The Medicare Part D prescription drug program, approved in 2003, offers private insurance plans to eligible beneficiaries. It includes outreach efforts to reach low-income consumers and those with language barriers or disabilities. Dual eligible beneficiaries were shifted from Medicaid to Part D. A transitional drug discount card program was available before the full Part D benefit took effect in 2006. In 2004-2005, Congress allocated $1 billion for Medicare Part D implementation. HHS used $99 million for outreach and education, including $67.3 million for beneficiary materials and $31.6 million for provider outreach. CMS paid Ketchum $47.3 million for initiatives like a bus tour. Over $234 million was spent on a help line. A coordinated campaign targeted low-income beneficiaries. The campaign focused on low-income beneficiaries, distributing publications, creating a toll-free help line, and collaborating with various organizations. The Regional Education about Choice in Health (REACH) program targeted beneficiaries with barriers, while the Access to Benefits Coalition (ABC) included nonprofits and local coalitions. Pharmaceutical and insurance companies, along with the Medicare Rx Education Network, were involved in outreach efforts. State Health Insurance and Assistance Programs (SHIPs) received increased funding to help. The State Health Insurance and Assistance Program (SHIP) provides counseling and information assistance to Medicare beneficiaries and their families. Despite initial challenges, by 2010, 90% of eligible individuals had Part D drug coverage or private coverage. Over 30 million beneficiaries were enrolled in Part D plans by 2013. Congress continues to fund SHIP despite the program's authorization expiring in FY1996. Despite the State Health Insurance and Assistance Program's authorization expiring in FY1996, Congress continues to fund the program by transferring discretionary funding from trust funds. SHIP counselors provide one-on-one services to Medicare beneficiaries through offices in all 50 states and other territories. State SHIP programs train volunteers to assist with Medicare-related inquiries, serving over 5 million consumers annually. The State Health Insurance and Assistance Program (SHIP) provides services to Medicare beneficiaries through offices in all 50 states and territories. SHIP counselors are trained to offer accurate information on insurance, Medicare Part C, Medicare Part D, and low-income subsidies. CMS oversees SHIP training programs and performance, with initial counselor training averaging 20.5 hours. The National Medicare Training Program supports SHIP and other volunteers. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) allows states to cover targeted, low-income children in families with no insurance. The BBA 97 allowed states to spend up to 10% of their initial CHIP benefit spending on administrative costs, including outreach. States were permitted additional flexibility if they expanded their Medicaid programs under CHIP. Congress also allowed states to use up to 10% of their unspent FY1998 funds for outreach activities, with private funding supplementing public outreach efforts. Enrollment efforts for the CHIP program included hiring outreach workers, distributing advertising materials, and collaborating with various organizations. Despite a slow start, all states had implemented their programs by the end of 2000. Federal agencies and states worked together to reach out to hard-to-reach groups, such as immigrants and those with limited English skills. States collaborated with various groups to assist families in enrolling in healthcare programs. The CHIPRA and ACA initiatives provided funding for outreach campaigns targeting underserved populations and rural areas. The ACA extended the time period for outreach grants and increased the appropriation level to $140 million for FY2009-FY2015. The CHIP statute was not prescriptive in terms of telling states how to meet screening and enrollment requirements to determine eligibility for Medicaid and/or CHIP. States had an incentive to enroll children in CHIP, because the states were eligible for enhanced federal matching funds to expand coverage to low-income uninsured women and children, without necessarily expanding their Medicaid programs. Lawmakers have raised questions and concerns about the navigator programs, with some Members of Congress, state legislators, health care advocacy groups, and brokers involved in discussions. Some lawmakers and advocacy groups have raised concerns about the protection of enrollees' personal information in the CMS regulations. They have requested additional information on the access and training of navigators, non-navigators, and certified application counselors. HHS implemented final rules in May 2014 to require authorization before accessing personally identifiable information. The Federal Trade Commission warned consumers in 2012 about scam artists seeking personal information under the guise of verifying ACA coverage. Consumers must authorize access to their personally identifiable information and can revoke it at any time. Privacy violations extend beyond exchange-sanctioned assistance programs. The Exchange must establish privacy and security standards for accessing personally identifiable information. Individuals should have easy access to their information and the ability to dispute any inaccuracies. The Exchange must establish privacy and security standards for accessing personally identifiable information, including providing individuals with a timely means to dispute inaccuracies, ensuring openness and transparency about policies, offering individual choice in decision-making, limiting collection, use, and disclosure, and maintaining data quality and integrity. The Exchange must establish privacy and security standards for accessing personally identifiable information, including ensuring data quality and integrity, safeguarding information with operational, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, and implementing accountability measures for adherence and breaches. The Exchange must establish and implement safeguards to protect personally identifiable information, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well as compliance with applicable laws. The Exchange must ensure the secure destruction of personally identifiable information and regularly update security controls. Non-Exchange entities must adhere to the same or stricter privacy and security standards when handling information electronically. The Exchange must ensure workforce compliance with policies for handling personally identifiable information, including written procedures and data sharing arrangements. Data sharing arrangements must meet specific requirements for sharing personally identifiable information between the Exchange and agencies administering Medicaid, CHIP, or the BHP. Compliance with the Code is necessary for keeping return information confidential and disclosing it only as permitted. Any improper use or disclosure of information is strictly prohibited. Any violation of section 1411(g) of the Affordable Care Act will result in a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per person or entity for improper use or disclosure of information."
