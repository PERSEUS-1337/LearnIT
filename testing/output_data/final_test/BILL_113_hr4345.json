    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Weatherization Enhancement, and Local Energy Efficiency Investment and Accountability Act\" and includes sections on reauthorizing the weatherization assistance program, grants to eligible organizations, quality assurance program, and state energy programs. Congress recognizes the effectiveness and bipartisan support for the State Energy Program (SEP) and Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income Persons (WAP) in addressing national energy needs over the years. The State Energy Program (SEP) was established in 1975 to support energy efficiency, renewable energy, economic development, and energy policy. It is governed by various energy acts such as the Energy Conservation and Production Act, State Energy Efficiency Programs Improvement Act of 1990, Energy Policy Act of 1992, Energy Policy Act of 2005, and Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) was created in 1976 to help low-income families in response to the oil embargo. It has become the largest residential energy conservation program in the United States, with over 7.1 million homes weatherized since its inception. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) has weatherized over 7.1 million homes since its creation. It saves 35% of energy consumption in homes, creating jobs and providing $437 in annual energy cost savings per home. The program also yields $2.51 in energy savings for every Federal dollar spent and serves as a foundation for energy efficiency standards and workforce training. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) enhances energy efficiency by reducing carbon emissions, decreasing national energy consumption, and promoting new retrofitting models for low-income homes through innovative partnerships with nonprofit organizations. Improved monitoring and reporting of the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) work product has led to benefits, with efforts to expand independent verification of efficiency work to support long-term goals. State-level deficiencies in monitoring efforts have been identified by various government reports, aiming to ensure more effective use of WAP funds. The evolution of the WAP has seen advancements in efficiency technology, such as States adopting advanced home energy audits in the 1990s, resulting in significant returns on investment as the home energy efficiency industry progresses. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) has evolved with advancements in efficiency technology and professional workforce, aligning with the performance-based home energy efficiency industry. The Weatherization Assistance Program is reauthorized with $450,000,000 allocated for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. Grants are provided to eligible housing and nonprofit organizations. The section aims to expand energy efficiency retrofits for low-income homes, promote innovation through partnerships with organizations, assist in improving and replicating energy retrofit programs, and ensure self-sustainability of projects funded by grants. The section defines a 'covered organization' as a tax-exempt organization with a record of improving energy efficiency in low-income homes. The Secretary will award grants through a competitive process based on specified criteria. In awarding grants, the Secretary considers factors such as the number of low-income homes already worked on and projected to work on, applicant qualifications and past performance, diversity of locations served, and the amount of non-Federal funds secured. The Secretary considers factors such as the amount of non-Federal funds, volunteer labor, and resources provided by the applicant, the potential for project replication and sustainability, and other relevant factors when evaluating grant applications from covered organizations. Applications must be submitted within 120 days of the section's enactment. The Secretary evaluates grant applications based on factors like non-Federal funds and project sustainability. Applications must be submitted within 120 days of enactment. Grants can be used for energy audits, retrofit activities, training, data collection, and providing information on energy savings. The grant program allows for verification activities, grant management, and other necessary materials as determined by the Secretary. The maximum grant amount is $5,000,000, and guidelines will be issued within 60 days for allowable expenditures and energy savings criteria. The Secretary will review and evaluate criteria for weatherization training programs, energy audits, project monitoring, liability insurance, and recordkeeping requirements for home retrofits. Reporting to the Department of Energy on data for each retrofitted home is mandatory. The Secretary will review and evaluate covered organizations receiving grants, ensure compliance with state and local laws, submit annual reports to Congress on energy and cost savings, and allocate funds for program implementation. The Secretary will allocate different percentages of the amount based on availability: 2% if less than $225,000,000, 5% if $225,000,000 or more but less than $260,000,000, 10% if $260,000,000 or more but less than $400,000,000, and 20% if $400,000,000 or more is available. SEC. 103. QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. Section 415 of the Energy Conservation and Production Act is amended to include a Quality Assurance Program for weatherization contractors. Starting January 1, 2015, contractors must be accredited by specific organizations or equivalent state certification programs to be eligible for funds. To be eligible for a grant under section 414C, a nonprofit organization must use a certified crew chief who supervises work done with grant funds. Volunteers working for the organization do not need certification if they are not directly handling skilled labor tasks. Effective October 1, 2015, the Secretary must ensure that each retrofit receiving weatherization assistance meets minimum efficiency and quality standards. Random inspections of at least 10% of dwelling units are required to verify compliance, exceeding industry standards. The Secretary must ensure that retrofit work meets or exceeds industry standards for home performance. SEC. 201. REAUTHORIZATION OF STATE ENERGY PROGRAMS: Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to reduce funding for State Energy Programs from $125,000,000 to $75,000,000 for fiscal years 2015 through 2019."
