Post offices were previously named based on various sources such as town names, landmarks, and postmaster's names. Postmaster Miscellaneous Order 87 in 1891 instructed post offices to use names published by the United States Board on Geographic Names. Postmaster Miscellaneous Order 48 in the following year mandated that post offices should have the same name as the town or village they were located in to avoid confusion and ensure efficient mail delivery. The U.S. Post Office Department began officially addressing the naming of post offices in 1891 to ensure efficient mail delivery. Congress first honored an individual by naming a post office in 1967, and the USPS was established in 1971 with its own real estate authority. Legislation to name USPS facilities was then referred to specific committees for approval. During the 108th to 112th Congresses, post office naming bills fluctuated in number, with about 20% of all statutes enacted being post office naming acts. Individuals of local and national renown were honored, including soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Notable honorees included Gerald R. Ford, Jr., Ronald Reagan, Bob Hope, Cesar Chavez, Nat King Cole, Mickey Mantle, and Buck Owens. Congress names post offices for fallen soldiers and other individuals of renown. Factors considered in selecting a post office include the honoree's ties to the area, building condition, ownership, and existing names. The USPS maintains a list of post offices named since 1967. When naming a post office, work with USPS's government relations person for the Member's state. Legislation requires precise address and honoree's name. Post office naming acts typically originate in the House, with a rule requiring all state Members as cosponsors. In the 113th Congress, the committee adopted a rule to minimize time spent on bills designating USPS facilities. Committee staff maintain a list of naming bills for consideration under suspension of the rules or by unanimous consent. Passage by the House is usually routine, with negotiations between majority and minority leaders determining when and how the bills are considered on the floor. In September 2005, a motion to pass a bill naming a post office in Berkeley after a community activist was defeated on a roll call vote. Opposition was based on concerns about the activist's principles conflicting with American values. In the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses, both Senators from a state had to agree to a naming bill. The committee adopted a policy in the 109th Congress that post office naming bills honoring living persons would no longer be considered. In the 111th Congress, the committee established a rule that only allows naming postal facilities after certain individuals, such as former Presidents, Vice Presidents, Members of Congress over 70 years old, and wounded veterans. This policy was re-adopted in the 112th and 113th Congresses. Post office naming bills passed by the House often wait several months for action by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the full Senate. In the Senate, postal naming bills are often passed without debate by unanimous consent. In 2008, there was concern over a bill to name a post office after a lobbyist, which was passed by the House but not the Senate. Renaming a post office has minimal practical effects as they retain their geographical designations in the USPS system. The only tangible effect is the installation of a dedicatory plaque in the facility's lobby. The USPS may organize a dedication ceremony for a plaque purchased locally at a cost of $250 to $500, measuring 11x14 inches. Representative Darrell E. Issa introduced a bill requiring the USPS to provide a plaque within 120 days of a facility's designation. The ceremony includes inviting the honored individual, an honor guard, a religious figure, media notification, and refreshments, with costs covered by USPS or shared with the community. The bill H.R. 3137 allows the USPS to accept donations for funding plaques for commemorative postal facility designations. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee reported the bill in 2009, but no further action was taken."
