The \"Hospice Evaluation and Legitimate Payment Act of 2013\" requires a face-to-face encounter with a healthcare professional to determine eligibility for hospice care before the first 60-day period and each subsequent recertification. The \"Hospice Evaluation and Legitimate Payment Act of 2013\" mandates a face-to-face encounter with a healthcare professional within 7 days of electing hospice care, effective January 1, 2014. SEC. 3. RESTORING AND PROTECTING THE MEDICARE HOSPICE BENEFIT. Section 1814(i) of the Social Security Act is amended to delay regulations until after a demonstration program is completed or by October 1, 2017. The proposed regulation in the Federal Register allows for public comment and requires the Secretary to implement payment revisions unless the demonstration program shows otherwise. The Federal Register proposed a regulation for public comment on payment revisions for hospice care. A demonstration program must be established before implementing any changes to payment rates for hospice services. The demonstration program for proposed revisions to hospice care payment rates will last for a 2-year period starting on or after October 1, 2013. Up to 15 certified hospice programs can apply to participate, with a representative cross-section selected to take part. The demonstration program for proposed revisions to hospice care payment rates will include a representative cross-section of hospice programs in urban and rural areas across the United States. The Secretary will evaluate if the revised payment methodology has improved patient care quality and access to hospice care for beneficiaries. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress with the evaluation results and recommendations for legislation and administrative action after the completion of the demonstration program on proposed revisions to hospice care payment rates. The demonstration program will ensure that payment revisions for hospice care result in the same aggregate payments as if the programs had not participated. The Social Security Act is amended to require hospice programs to undergo standard surveys every 36 months by a State or local agency or an approved accreditation agency."
