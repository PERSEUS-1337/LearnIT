    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mother's Day Centennial Commemorative Coin Act\". The Congress finds that Anna Jarvis, founder of modern Mother's Day, was born in Webster, West Virginia on May 1, 1864. She dedicated her life to honoring her mother, Anna Reeves Jarvis, who passed away on May 9, 1905. In 1910, West Virginia Governor William Glasscock issued the first Mother's Day Proclamation. On May 8, 1914, the Sixty-Third Congress approved designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day. Res. 263 designates the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day and encourages displaying the American flag at homes as a tribute to mothers. President Woodrow Wilson's 1914 proclamation urged government officials and citizens to show their love and respect for mothers by displaying the flag on this day. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury shall mint $1 coins weighing 26.73 grams, with a diameter of 1.500 inches, containing 90% silver and 10% copper. The coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. SEC. 4. DESIGN OF COINS. The coins minted under this Act shall commemorate the 100th anniversary of Mother's Day. The design must include the coin's value, the year \"2014\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. The Act authorizes the issuance of coins in uncirculated and proof qualities starting January 1, 2014. The minting authority terminates on December 31, 2014. Sales of the coins may begin before the issuance date. SEC. 6.
