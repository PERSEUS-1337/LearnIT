The findings by Congress highlight the severe human rights violations against women in Afghanistan under the Taliban rule, including denial of basic rights like education, healthcare, and freedom of movement. Despite efforts to improve their situation, many women still lack access to essential services, leading to high mortality rates. In Afghanistan, women face oppression from Taliban and militia groups, with attacks on girls' schools increasing to restrict their rights. Strengthening women-led institutions is crucial for upholding women's and human rights in the country. The Sense of Congress on women's rights in Afghanistan is highlighted in Section 3. The protection of women's rights in Afghanistan and their participation in democracy are crucial for the country's stability. The US Government must support women's rights throughout Afghanistan, including backing the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. These organizations were established under the Bonn Agreement to address past violations against women. The US Government should prioritize providing assistance to Afghan-led nongovernmental organizations, especially those led by Afghan women. Grants and aid to Afghanistan must be contingent on the government adhering to international standards for women's rights and human rights. The US Government should prioritize providing assistance to Afghan-led nongovernmental organizations, especially those led by Afghan women, contingent on adherence to international standards for women's rights and human rights. Section 103(a)(7) of the Afghan Freedom Support Act of 2002 is amended to provide equipment, medical supplies, and assistance to health care facilities for reducing maternal and infant mortality, expand programs for women and girls with mental health issues, and protect vulnerable populations like widows and orphans. To support women and girls in Afghanistan, initiatives include establishing schools with math, science, and language education, expanding vocational training programs, promoting adult literacy, and providing special education for girls previously denied schooling by the Taliban. To support women's rights in Afghanistan, initiatives aim to disseminate information on women's rights and international human rights standards, provide assistance for property, inheritance, and voting rights, ensure equal access to the judicial system, and monitor violations of women's rights. Initiatives in Afghanistan aim to support women's rights by increasing political and civil participation, providing legal assistance for rights violations, offering training on women's and human rights to military and legal personnel, and assisting in programs to advance women's status. For fiscal years 2007 through 2009, funds are authorized to support Afghan women's rights initiatives, including $5,000,000 for the Ministry of Women's Affairs, $10,000,000 for the Independent Human Rights Commission, and $30,000,000 for grants to Afghan women-led nonprofit organizations. Afghan women-led nonprofit organizations are supported for various activities such as building schools for married girls and girls' orphanages, providing vocational training, healthcare clinics, strengthening women-led organizations, and offering financial aid to widows, orphans, and women heads of households. In providing assistance under the Afghan Freedom Support Act, Congress urges the President to condition aid on adherence to women's and human rights standards. Afghan women-led NGOs should receive grants without discrimination. The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development must submit reports every 6 months for 3 years on activities under the Afghan Freedom Support Act to specific Senate and House committees. Reports should detail assistance provided to the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, and Afghan women-led nonprofit organizations."
