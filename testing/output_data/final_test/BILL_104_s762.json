    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Billing Abuse Prevention Act of 1995\" aims to address billing code abuse in the Medicare program. The General Accounting Office suggests using commercial software to detect abuse, potentially saving taxpayers $2,000,000 per day. Regulatory requirements may hinder the prompt implementation of such software. The Act requires Medicare carriers to acquire commercial ADPE within 90 days to identify billing code abuse in processing Medicare part B claims. The ADPE must be used as a supplement to existing systems and be standardized for uniformity. Carriers must implement the ADPE within 180 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4.

It should be modifiable to meet statutory requirements and general policies of the Health Care Financing Administration.\n\nSEC. 5. DISCLOSURE. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE.
