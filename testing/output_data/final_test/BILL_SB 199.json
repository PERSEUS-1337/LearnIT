    "title": "SB 199",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The purpose of amending Section 12300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is to provide supportive services to aged, blind, or disabled persons who are unable to perform these services themselves and cannot safely remain in their homes without assistance. Supportive services for aged, blind, or disabled individuals include domestic services, personal care assistance, accompaniment to health appointments, yard hazard abatement, protective supervision, assistance with reading documents, teaching for reducing the need for services, and paramedical services. Personal care services encompass ambulation assistance, bathing, grooming, prosthetic device care, bowel/bladder care, repositioning, skin care, and transfers. Personal care services include repositioning, skin care, range of motion exercises, transfers, feeding, fluid intake, respiration, and assistance with medication self-administration. These services can be provided in the beneficiary's home or other authorized locations, such as the recipient's place of employment under specific conditions. The personal care services authorized for a recipient can be utilized at their place of employment to support their work, but cannot replace any accommodations required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or other legal obligations. The provision of personal care services at the recipient's workplace is limited to the total hours authorized for the recipient at home. Additional hours for employment are not allowed. Providers of supportive services, who have a legal duty to care for the recipient, can only receive payment if they leave full-time employment or are unable to find suitable alternative care providers. Payment is only for domestic services. Providers are paid for domestic services, personal care services, accompaniment to health appointments, protective supervision, and paramedical services. Respite care is also provided to reduce governmental costs. A person eligible for services under a federal waiver or Section 14132.95 cannot receive the same services under this article. If the waiver does not cover all eligible services, those not covered can receive services under this article. The rate of reimbursement for in-home supportive services provided under this article cannot exceed the rate established under Section 14132.95, with a maximum of 283 hours per month. Recipients cannot receive more than the specified maximum hours. The Director of Health Care Services must seek federal approvals by January 1, 2017, to use Medicaid funds for providing assistance to blind recipients in reading and completing documents. The service will be operational from January 1, 2017, contingent on federal financial participation and approvals. The department may implement the service to blind recipients through all-county letters until emergency regulations are filed. Regulations must be adopted by January 1, 2018, and are considered emergencies. The department is exempt from certain requirements after the initial adoption of regulations. The department may request approval to readopt emergency regulations twice after the initial adoption, amendment, or repeal. Final regulations must be adopted by January 1, 2019. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state in this act will be provided to local agencies and school districts as per the Government Code."
