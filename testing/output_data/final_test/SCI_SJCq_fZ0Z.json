    "content": "A major drawback of backpropagation through time (BPTT) is the challenge of learning long-term dependencies by propagating credit information backwards through every step of the forward computation. Truncated backpropagation through time is often used as a heuristic, but it leads to biased gradient estimates. To address this, Sparse Attentive Backtracking is proposed as an alternative algorithm that learns an attention mechanism over past hidden states and selectively backpropagates through paths with high attention weights to learn long-term dependencies more effectively. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are effective for sequence processing tasks like speech recognition, image captioning, machine translation, and speech synthesis. Training these models with backpropagation through time (BPTT) can lead to vanishing or exploding gradients due to shared parameters across time steps. This makes credit assignment challenging for events that have long-term dependencies. Training RNNs with backpropagation through time (BPTT) can be challenging due to vanishing or exploding gradients with long-term dependencies. Truncated BPTT (TBPTT) is commonly used to address this issue by backpropagating gradients for a limited number of time steps. This approach helps to overcome computational concerns and speeds up the training process. Truncation in RNNs is driven by computational constraints, aiming for faster parameter updates. However, it hinders capturing correlations across distant states. Regular RNNs have fixed-size hidden state vectors, creating a bottleneck for information flow. A semi-parametric RNN is proposed to address this, allowing for conditioning on all previous states and enabling jumps through time with attention mechanisms. The semi-parametric RNN introduces a fixed-size hidden state, a macrostate consisting of past microstates, and microstates chosen from hidden states. The next hidden state is computed based on the macrostate and external input, utilizing an attention mechanism for reading from the growing array. Sparse attentive backtracking (SAB) is an algorithm that uses an attention mechanism to select relevant microstates from a macrostate, allowing information to propagate over long sequences and learn long-term dependencies. SAB is well-suited for tasks where closely related parts occur far apart in time, and during training, gradients are backpropagated locally. The proposed Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm incorporates hidden states and allows for asynchronous updates during training. It offers a principled approach to sparse credit assignment and mitigates exploding/vanishing gradients through temporal skip connections. SAB shows competitive results compared to full Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and outperforms Truncated BPTT with shorter truncation windows. This mechanism may also have biological plausibility. Neurophysiological findings support attention mechanisms in credit assignment and learning in biological systems. Hippocampal recordings in rats show replay of prior experiences during awake resting and sleep, linked to memory consolidation and learning. Replay events are influenced by reward signals. The mental look back into the past occurs when credit assignment is needed, especially in the presence of a reward signal. Truncated backpropagation through time is a common heuristic used in training on long sequences, but its limitation in performing credit assignment over longer sequences can lead to failure cases even in simple tasks. The Decoupled Neural Interfaces method BID14 replaces full backpropagation through time with synthetic gradients, small networks mapping hidden unit values to gradient estimators. This allows for asynchronous approximate gradient updates for each layer, reducing the need for backpropagation. Online credit assignment in RNNs without backtracking is still a research challenge, with one approach BID22 attempting to estimate gradients. One approach BID22 aims to solve the problem of estimating gradients using forward mode automatic differentiation instead of backpropagation. This method, called Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization (UORO), updates a rank-1 approximation to the gradient tensor to keep the estimate unbiased. Residual Networks and Dense Networks allow information to skip over convolutional processing blocks in neural architectures. In Residual Networks, identity connections are used to skip over convolutional processing blocks, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. Densely-connected convolutional networks provide a direct path from any point to the output. Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) introduces a dynamic skip connection modulated by an attention mechanism, allowing the model to select and use past microstates. This approach addresses the limitation of classical RNN models in handling long-range dependencies. The model in Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) can reference past microstates in the computation of the next hidden state, addressing the limitation of classical RNN models in handling long-range dependencies. This is achieved by selecting and summarizing microstates from the macrostate during the forward pass, and allowing the gradient to flow through these selected microstates during the backward pass. The selection process can vary in density and sophistication, providing flexibility in incorporating past information. The model in Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) addresses the limitation of classical RNN models by selecting and summarizing microstates from the macrostate during the forward pass. The backward pass allows the gradient to flow through selected microstates, with the option for denser or sparser gating. The attention weights are used to incorporate selected microstates into the final hidden state. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) model selects and summarizes microstates from the macrostate during the forward pass. The backward pass allows gradient flow through selected microstates, with options for dense or sparse gating. Not all hidden states need to be eligible as microstates, and restricting the pool to every k att 'th one can reduce memory and computation expense while improving performance. Increasing the granularity of microstate selection can prevent the model from focusing solely on recent hidden states. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm selects and summarizes microstates from the macrostate during the forward pass of RNN architectures like vanilla, GRU, and LSTM models. However, it is currently incompatible with accelerated RNN kernels offered by NVIDIA on GPU devices. The microstate selection mechanism determines which subset of the macrostate will be summarized during training, making it a core component of the algorithm. The selection mechanism in the Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm is crucial for summarizing microstates during training. It uses a simple mechanism, such as a Linear-TanhLinear MLP, to compute attention weights for each microstate vector. This mechanism successfully focuses on relevant past time steps for credit assignment, but exploring more complex models could be a future research direction. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm uses a Linear-TanhLinear MLP to compute attention weights for microstates. These weights are then summed up and incorporated into the hidden state output of the LSTM model for future conditioning. Multiple options exist for combining microstates and hidden states, but for this model, a simple summation approach is chosen. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm utilizes an attention mechanism to compute attention weights for microstates, which are then integrated into the LSTM model's hidden state output for future conditioning. The attention mechanism sparsifies attention by making discrete decisions based on the salience of microstates at the current time. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm uses attention weights to select the most salient microstates, which receive gradient information. A summary vector is obtained by weighting the macrostate with sparse attention weights, leading to fast computation. The summary is incorporated into the hidden state by summing it with the provisional hidden state. The output at each timestep is computed by concatenating the hidden state and attention weights, followed by an affine output transform. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm utilizes attention weights to select important microstates for gradient information. A non-linearity in the computation of raw attention weights is crucial to avoid catastrophic cancellations during weight sparsification. This ensures that gradient flows effectively through skip connections in the attention mechanism. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm uses attention weights to select key microstates for gradient information. Non-linearity in computing attention weights prevents catastrophic cancellations during weight sparsification. An empirical study on SAB's performance in five tasks, including synthetic tasks like copying and adding problems, confirms its ability to handle credit assignment effectively. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm uses attention weights to select key microstates for gradient information, preventing catastrophic cancellations during weight sparsification. The algorithm's performance in various tasks confirms its effectiveness in handling credit assignment. Comparisons with LSTM baselines show quantitative performance improvements. Hyperparameters specific to tasks are discussed, along with additional hyperparameters unique to the SAB model. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm uses attention weights to select key microstates for gradient information. It outperforms full backpropagation through time (BPTT) and truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) on the synthetic copying task. The impact of hyperparameters like k att and k trunc is studied, with SAB attending to every second hidden state. The Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) algorithm outperforms truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) on various tasks such as synthetic adding, language modeling, and sequential MNIST classification. SAB shows better performance than TBPTT with shorter truncation lengths, especially in tasks like the copying memory task. SAB outperforms baselines in accuracy and cross-entropy on unseen sequences, especially for longer sequences. Attention weights quickly focus on input digits in the copying task. LSTM with self-attention trained using full BPTT is similar to unidirectional LSTM with self-attention BID16. The experiment compared SAB and LSTM with full self-attention on the adding task with sequence lengths up to T=300. SAB and BPTT achieved optimal performance on the copying task with sequence length T=100. On the copying task with sequence lengths up to T=300, SAB's performance is close to optimal. When T=200, SAB performs similarly to the best of both baselines. With longer sequences (T=400), SAB outperforms TBPTT but is outperformed by BPTT. The model was also evaluated on a language modeling task using the Penn TreeBank dataset. Performance of SAB was evaluated on the character-level PTB dataset. Training was done on non-overlapping sequences of length 180 with 1000 hidden units. SAB trained for 100 epochs and slightly underperformed compared to BPTT but outperformed TBPTT in terms of bits-per-character (BPC) metric. The models used 1000 hidden units and a batch size of 64. SAB was trained for a maximum of 30 epochs without hyperparameter search. Results for Text8 dataset were measured in Bit-per-character (BPC). A sequential MNIST classification task was performed using LSTM with 128 hidden units and a learning rate of 0.001. Early stopping was based on the validation set after training for about 100 epochs. Future work could focus on improving computational efficiency for Sparse Attentive Backtracking. Improving computational efficiency for Sparse Attentive Backtracking involves reducing memory requirements by using a hierarchical model and recomputing states only when necessary. Additionally, considering a maximum inner product search algorithm can help reduce the computational cost of the attention mechanism. These improvements aim to enhance the modeling of long-term dependencies. Sparse Attentive Backtracking is a new algorithm that combines the strengths of full backpropagation through time and truncated backpropagation through time by backpropagating gradients through selected paths using an attention mechanism. This allows RNNs to learn long-term dependencies while still being computationally efficient. Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) combines full and truncated backpropagation through time by using an attention mechanism to backpropagate gradients through selected paths. This allows RNNs to learn long-term dependencies efficiently. The time complexity of the forward pass in SAB is O(tn^2), with t as the number of timesteps and n as the hidden state size. The space complexity for training remains O(tn), but for inference, it is now O(tn) instead of O(n). The backward pass time cost is challenging to determine due to dependencies on past microstates forming a directed acyclic graph. The attention mechanism in Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) focuses on relevant microstates to efficiently learn long-term dependencies in RNNs. By truncating gradients to one skip-step in the past, the method combats exploding and vanishing gradient problems. Empirical results on various datasets show the necessity of gradient clipping for optimal performance. The attention mechanism in Sparse Attentive Backtracking (SAB) focuses on relevant microstates to efficiently learn long-term dependencies in RNNs. Gradient clipping is found to be necessary only for the text8 dataset, with little to no difference observed for other datasets. Visualization of attention weights during training for the Copying Memory Task shows how the model learns to concentrate on the beginning of the sequence."
