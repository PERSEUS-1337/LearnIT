    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Residential and Commuter Toll Fairness Act of 2009\". Residents in various localities in the US pay tolls, user fees, and fares for transportation access. The revenue from these fees supports infrastructure projects benefiting commuters and the economy. Some residents face higher toll burdens due to limited transportation options in their areas. Residents in certain areas face transportation access challenges, such as living in remote locations or having to pay tolls for access. To address this inequality, some governments have implemented discounted transportation programs. Authorities have established discounted transportation toll, user fee, and fare programs for residents facing unequal financial burdens due to living in areas accessible only through toll roads. These programs do not discriminate against ineligible individuals and are not meant to promote state interests or economic development. The Act aims to ensure that regulations do not hinder commerce between states, individual travel, equal protection under the law, or the privileges of US citizens. The Act aims to establish programs for discounted transportation tolls, user fees, and fares for residents in specific geographic areas. The Act authorizes local residential or commuter toll, user fee, or fare discount programs. States, counties, municipalities, and transportation authorities can establish discounted toll, user fee, or fare programs for residents to reduce toll burdens. They are also authorized to create rules for these programs. Systems are authorized to establish programs under subsection (a) by enacting necessary rules or regulations. This Act does not limit the authority of States, counties, municipalities, and transportation authorities managing transportation systems."
