    "content": "The damaging effects of invasive plants and animals include loss of rangelands, blockage of power plant intakes, and declines of birds and mammals. Eradication of established species is unlikely, and managing these effects is challenging due to the number and variety of non-native species. Legislation to address these problems is unclear, as laws concerning wild plants and animals are not comprehensive at the federal level. The U.S. system, inherited from English legal tradition, allows states to regulate native wild animals while landowners control plants on their lands. States have the authority to control wildlife within their boundaries, leading to a patchwork of legislation for addressing invasive species. The absence of a general federal responsibility for wildlife impacts the federal role in managing invasive species. The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) was established in 1999 to address invasive species issues, providing information and guidance to local and state governments. Federal assistance is limited, with a focus on information rather than practical help. NISC has outlined actions in its 2008-2012 report to tackle existing problems, encouraging agencies to develop policies within their legislative mandates. NISC outlined actions to address invasive species issues, including developing legislative proposals. Hawaii and Florida are examples of states highly susceptible to invasion due to their rich flora and fauna and isolated biological history. The transportation access in certain environments increases the risk of invasive species introductions, especially in aquatic habitats like the Great Lakes. Seaports exchanging ballast water are particularly vulnerable, as well as areas around airports with high international traffic. Various pathways for species invasions include transportation corridors, imported pets, landscaping plants, aquaculture, and deliberate releases of non-native organisms. The pathways of invasion between countries can be predicted, with examples such as brown tree snakes hiding in dark places and beetles arriving on pallet wood and packing crates. Legally shipped live animals or plants may carry microorganisms, parasites, or seeds that pose a danger to other species. Any arrival of living or untreated material offers a possible pathway for biotic invasion. Federal laws focus on black lists (allowing anything not listed) or white lists (excluding anything not listed) to control invasive species. Black lists typically include species known to cause damage to fisheries, endangered species, or agriculture. Preventing the spread of invasive species in the US may involve public education, penalties for shippers, and monitoring. Black lists require time to gather information on species damage and implement regulatory responses. The white list approach aims to predict potential harm by excluding non-native organisms based on known characteristics. For example, the mongoose, known for becoming a pest on islands, would likely never be allowed. In contrast, species with a long track record in the country, like orchids or sheep, would likely be permitted. The existence of a list, whether white or black, implies that importers know they are importing living organisms. Efforts to prevent unintentional introductions are necessary as potential pathways for invasion continue to be discovered. Federal laws on invasive species are inconsistent, with gaps in prevention and early detection. Coordination of current efforts alone will not fill these gaps. The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) is the focal point for federal efforts to control and prevent invasive species, but gaps in authorities and personnel hinder these efforts. Four key agencies, including APHIS and FWS, have roles in addressing invasive species, but important gaps in their authorities remain. Legislation could address these gaps through a species-by-species approach. Legislation to address invasive species can take a species-by-species or pathway approach. The species approach assumes knowledge about a species' risk or safety, but predicting this is difficult. The pathway approach focuses on circumstances favoring the arrival of unwanted organisms. Agencies like APHIS and FWS analyze the risk of invasive species, but face resource challenges. Faster assessments of species or pathways would help allocate resources more effectively. Faster assessments of species or pathways are needed to direct resources effectively. The Non-indigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act focuses on prevention and control of invasive species, requiring participation from federal agencies and implementing regulations to exclude invasives from U.S. ports. Policymakers could explore research to identify pathways for invasive species introduction. New legislation and expert review are planned to prevent invasive species introductions. An educational campaign is also proposed to prevent inadvertent acts by the public. To prevent invasive species introductions, creating an informational warning list of species restricted under state laws or newly arrived from other countries could be effective. Reviewing industries dependent on importing non-native species for cooperative methods to reduce releases after sale is also suggested. To prevent the introduction of invasive species, efforts should focus on reducing releases after sale. This can be achieved through incentives for selling sterile animals or plants, educational programs at the point of sale, and measures to avoid exporting potentially invasive species. Certification processes similar to those for agricultural shipments could be implemented to ensure products are free of pests before export. Certification processes similar to those for agricultural shipments could be implemented to ensure products (such as supplies, equipment, and personnel) are free of pests before export. A multi-agency federal or cooperative center for first-strike prevention and control of invasive species is being modeled after interagency fire management efforts. This center could provide aid in preventing the unintentional introduction of diseases or pests during humanitarian relief efforts. Implementing certification processes similar to those for agricultural shipments could help ensure products are free of pests before export. A multi-agency federal or cooperative center for first-strike prevention and control of invasive species could offer critical support in eradicating new invaders. These options could lead to savings for the economy and ecosystems."
