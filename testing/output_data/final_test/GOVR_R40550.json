    "content": "The USPS works with the DOD to handle mail and packages for military personnel. Domestic postage covers delivery to USPS gateway sites, with the military covering overseas transport costs. Postage for mailers is subsidized, only paying the domestic portion. The President can authorize service members to send free mail to designated areas, including Iraq and Afghanistan. The DOD pays for delivery from U.S. gateway sites to domestic addresses. Free mail must have a complete APO or FPO return address and \"free\" written on it. Citizens cannot send mail to service members without paying postage. During World War II, the government introduced \"V-Mail\" for correspondence with Armed Forces members. Only service members could send V-Mail for free, while families and friends had to pay standard postage rates. Currently, postage for letters to overseas service members ranges from $0.44 to $3.28. Packages are subject to standard domestic rates based on size, shape, and weight, but discounted APO/FPO Priority Mail Flat-Rate Boxes are available. The USPS offers free Military kits for sending packages overseas, which can be ordered by calling 1-800-610-8734. Each kit includes Priority Mail boxes and labels. The curr_chunk discusses a postage benefit for members of the armed services introduced by Representative Peter King in H.R. 1935, the Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2011. It includes various supplies like Priority Mail boxes, labels, tape, and customs forms. The postage for a specific box size is $12.95 with a $2 discount. The bill aims to provide postage benefits for active duty members in Iraq or Afghanistan and those hospitalized due to service-related injuries. The Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2011, H.R. 1935, proposes a postage benefit for military personnel, allowing free mailing of letters and packages to troops in Iraq or Afghanistan and hospitalized service members. The bill sets a funding limit of $75 million from fiscal year 2012 to 2017 and is similar to previous bills introduced by Representative King. The bill H.R. 923 proposed free postage for military personnel in Afghanistan or Iraq and hospitalized service members. Mailers would write \"'Free Matter for Member of the Armed Forces of the United States' on the envelope. The bill would forbid advertisements and reimburse USPS for extra expenses. Another bill, H.R. 2874, by Rep. Harold E. Ford Jr., aimed to provide free postage for families of service members and charities, giving soldiers special stamps worth $150 per quarter to send to their families. H.R. 2874 proposed special stamps worth $150 per quarter for service members to send to families or charities without postage. The bill aimed to avoid misuse of free postage and reduce stress on the military postal system. The amended version of H.R. 923 required the DOD to establish a program for service members to receive a monthly voucher to cover postage for sending letters or parcels. The CBO estimated a cost of $30 million over FY2006 and FY2007 for nearly all eligible service personnel to take advantage of this benefit. The House passed H.R. 5122 on May 11, 2006, and the Senate substituted its own defense authorization language on June 22, 2006. The free-mail-for-troops provision was not included in the FY2007 defense authorization acts. H.R. 1439 was introduced on March 9, 2007, to establish a postage benefit for members of the armed services in Iraq or Afghanistan. H.R. 1439 and S. 1444 were bills introduced to provide free postage benefits for members of the armed services in Iraq or Afghanistan. The bills aimed to allow beneficiaries to send letters or parcels free of charge, with weight limits imposed. The cost of the program would be covered by an appropriation to the Department of Defense. S. 1444 had a lower weight limit for packages and capped the program cost at $10 million in FY2008. Representative Fossella offered an amendment to H.R. 1585, similar to previous bills H.R. 1439 and S. 1444, requiring the Secretary of Defense to provide vouchers for members of the Armed Forces in Iraq or Afghanistan to send parcels or mail for free. The amendment was adopted by voice vote, and the House passed H.R. 1585 with the postage provision. The House passed H.R. 1585 with the postage benefit provision on May 17, 2007, by a vote of 397 to 267. The Senate passed its version of the defense authorization bill without the postage benefit provision on October 1, 2007, by a vote of 92 to 3. Representative Peter King introduced H.R. 704, the Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2009, and Representative Kathy Castor introduced H.R. 707, the Home Front to Heroes Postal Benefits Act, both aiming to provide free-postage vouchers to qualified individuals in the Armed Forces. The House passed H.R. 1585 with a postage benefit provision for qualified individuals in the Armed Forces. H.R. 704 and H.R. 707 aimed to provide free postage vouchers for active duty members serving in Iraq or Afghanistan or hospitalized due to service-related injuries. The term \"active military service\" includes full-time duty, training duty, and attendance at designated service schools. H.R. 707 defines a \"qualified individual\" as a member of the Armed Forces entitled to free mailing privileges under title 39, U.S. Code. This definition may be broader than that in H.R. 704. H.R. 707 allows qualified individuals at Armed Forces installations to transfer postage vouchers for mailing privileges. The free postage benefit was included in H.R. 2647 but was later removed in the Senate's amended version. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a free postage benefit in H.R. 3326, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010, but it was not enacted by the 111th Congress. Questions remain about concerns and costs of the proposed free-mail-to-troops postage benefit. The CBO scored H.R. 923 (109th Congress) at $30 million annually, including $17 million for postage and $13 million for DoD's costs. Legislation did not specify how DOD would provide postage vouchers to troops overseas or transfer them to family/friends in the US. Implementation guidance is needed for this aspect. Recent bills are considering the use of postage vouchers for sending correspondence or packages. Questions arise regarding the risk of counterfeiting, potential for selling vouchers for cash, and whether subsidies should be provided for low-cost mailings or more expensive parcel postage. The dimensions and shape of packages significantly impact USPS delivery costs. For example, mailing a 15-pound package from Ohio to an APO zip code could cost over $20 in postage. Mailing a 15-pound package from Silver Lake, Ohio zip code 44224 to APO zip code 96278-2050 would cost over $20 in postage. However, using a Priority Mail Flat-Rate Box (12\" by 12\" by 5\") would only cost $14.95. It is unclear if the Department of Defense faces similar cost differences for package delivery. Consideration is being given to requiring recipients of free postal benefits to use a specific size and shape of box to reduce delivery costs."
