Congress finds that obesity is related to over 30 chronic conditions, affecting millions of Americans with 1 in 3 adults and nearly 1 in 5 children being obese. Without intervention, almost half of Americans could be obese by 2030, with childhood obesity rates nearly tripling since 1980. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 75% of healthcare costs are due to chronic conditions. Obesity accounts for 21% of healthcare costs in America and could exceed $300 billion annually by 2018. It is a threat to national security and the leading reason for military service disqualification. Reducing the average body mass index by 5% could save over $29 billion in healthcare costs in five years. Studies show that overweight or obese children are more likely to have obesity as adults. Monitoring body mass index in children is crucial for promoting lifelong healthy habits, with BMI being considered a vital sign. The Measures to Prevent Childhood Obesity Act is outlined in Section 3. The Measures to Prevent Childhood Obesity Act, outlined in Section 3, includes a requirement for reporting body mass index information for children vaccinated, including age, gender, height, and weight for calculation purposes. The Measures to Prevent Childhood Obesity Act requires health providers to report body mass index data for children vaccinated, including age, gender, height, and weight. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide grants for analyzing BMI measurements of children aged 2 through 18. The Measures to Prevent Childhood Obesity Act mandates health providers to report BMI data for vaccinated children aged 2-18. Eligible entities must have a statewide immunization information system capable of storing demographic info, height, weight, and immunization data. The grant under this section is used for analyzing obesity prevention programs, purchasing computer equipment for a statewide immunization system, hiring personnel to maintain BMI data, and training healthcare professionals on BMI measurements. The Secretary prioritizes states with high healthcare provider data submission to immunization systems for grant selection. Data must cover at least 20% of the under 18 population and include diverse age groups and geographic areas. As a condition of receiving a grant under this section, a State must ensure that BMI measurements are recorded for children ages 2 through 18 by a licensed healthcare provider annually, following protocols from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The State must provide information on lowering BMI and obesity prevention programs to parents of children with a BMI above the 95th percentile. Reports on BMI data analysis must be submitted to the Secretary within 5 years of receiving the grant. The State must report on demographic groups, geographic areas, and effectiveness of obesity prevention programs and wellness policies to determine the most successful strategies. The State must report on demographic groups, geographic areas, and effectiveness of obesity prevention programs to determine the most successful strategies. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress and certain executive agencies analyzing trends in childhood obesity across regions of the United States, by gender, and socioeconomic status, as well as describing relevant programs. The Secretary will analyze childhood obesity rates in different geographic areas and recommend programs to be implemented by States. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2013 through 2018."
