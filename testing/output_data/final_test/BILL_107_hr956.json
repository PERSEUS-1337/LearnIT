    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Since 1975, the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) has provided funding for social services to support at-risk individuals and families, the elderly, and those with disabilities. In 1981, SSBG was converted into a block grant to give states flexibility in serving these populations. The focus of SSBG funds is on cost-effective community-level support to prevent the need for more expensive institutional care covered by programs like Medicaid and Medicare. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) provides funding for various programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), child welfare services, and support for at-risk individuals and families. It aims to promote family stability, economic self-sufficiency, and safe family environments. The SSBG supports independent living for elderly individuals, prevents abuse and neglect of older Americans, and provides community-based services for disabled individuals nationwide. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) provides resources for community-based services nationwide, including early intervention, crisis intervention, adult day care, respite care, transportation, employment training, and independent living services. It also supports mental health services for vulnerable adults and children, offering counseling, case management, and information/referral assistance to millions of individuals. Additionally, the SSBG addresses child abuse with nearly 3,000,000 reports annually. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) supports child protective services, adoption services, and prevention/intervention services for families. However, the SSBG has faced over $1 billion in cuts over the last 6 years, impacting services in many states and local communities. Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grants cannot make up for these cuts as SSBG funds also support the elderly, disabled, and other ineligible populations. The 104th Congress committed to the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) by authorizing funds of $2,380,000,000 through fiscal year 2002, increasing to $2,800,000,000 in fiscal year 2003 and beyond. The Social Security Act is amended to allow the transfer of up to 10 percent of TANF funds to the Social Services Block Grant for fiscal year 2002. This amendment will take effect on October 1, 2001. Additionally, funds for the Social Services Block Grant are being restored. The Social Security Act is amended to restore funds for the Social Services Block Grant, with specific allocations for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. Additionally, a requirement is established for states to submit an annual report on their activities. The Social Security Act is amended to require states to submit an annual report on their activities, with the Secretary compiling and submitting this information to Congress annually."
