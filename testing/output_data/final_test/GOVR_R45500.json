    "content": "The transportation sector is vulnerable to terrorist attacks, raising questions about resource allocation for protection. Deterrence measures can be implemented to reduce the risk without hindering travel and commerce. Key policy objectives include ensuring the trustworthiness of passengers and cargo. Protection measures in the transportation sector focus on ensuring the trustworthiness of passengers, cargo, transportation workers, and private companies to prevent attacks from within the system. Additionally, security perimeters are established around transportation facilities and vehicles to prevent external attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress swiftly created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee airline passenger and baggage screening and deploy armed air marshals on commercial flights. This was in response to the difficulty of preventing terrorist attacks, such as ramming a bomb-laden speedboat into an oil tanker or shooting a missile at an airplane. The focus shifted to minimizing the consequences of attacks without imposing excessive burdens. The TSA, created after 9/11, oversees airline passenger screening. The federal role in airport screening is controversial, with limited private screening options available at 22 airports. Congress aims to maintain private screening options, with the TSA Modernization Act directing TSA to streamline the process for private screening contracts and explore allowing individual airport terminals to switch to private contractors. Despite the focus on aviation security legislation, challenges remain in effectively screening passengers, baggage, and cargo for explosives. Other challenges include developing risk-based methods for screening, incorporating biometrics for identity verification, utilizing intelligence information to identify potential threats, and implementing effective systems for risk-based screening of air cargo worldwide. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, explosives screening in the aviation domain was limited in scope. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated 100% screening of all checked baggage on domestic and international passenger flights. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 mandated the physical screening of all cargo on passenger flights, which is carried out through the Certified Cargo Screening Program using TSA-approved technologies and procedures. TSA works internationally to ensure U.S.-bound air cargo shipments meet security standards. The TSA works with Customs and Border Protection to target high-risk cargo shipments using the ATS-C system. They also pilot test the ACAS system for predeparture vetting of cargo manifests. P.L. 115-254 requires TSA to establish an air cargo security division and improve security measures. P.L. 115-254 mandates TSA to enhance air cargo security by improving the Known Shipper Program, Certified Cargo Screening Program, and exploring new screening technologies. It also requires collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to establish an ACAS program for inbound international cargo. TSA's focus on explosives screening technologies is highlighted, with a requirement to develop a technology investment plan. The P.L. 115-254 mandates TSA to enhance air cargo security by improving screening programs and exploring new technologies. It requires collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection for inbound international cargo. TSA's focus on explosives screening technologies is emphasized, with a requirement to develop a technology investment plan and establish an innovation task force. The Obama Administration accelerated deployment of Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) devices at passenger screening checkpoints to improve explosives detection on passengers. Next-generation screening technologies for airports include advanced X-ray systems for carry-on baggage, bottled liquids scanners, and portable explosives trace detection equipment. Privacy concerns have been raised regarding the intrusiveness of AIT for primary screening. The TSA has addressed privacy concerns by eliminating human analysis of AIT images and not storing imagery. Automated threat detection capabilities using ATR software are now in place. Medical risks from backscatter X-ray systems are no longer a concern as current millimeter wave systems emit nonionizing waves. Recent testing has shown failures in technology and procedures in passenger screening checkpoints. The TSA has implemented AIT for primary screening at larger airports, but many smaller airports lack this technology. Questions arise about TSA's plans to expand AIT for uniform explosives screening. TSA has deployed 960 AIT units through FY2018, with no plans for further procurement. Risk-based passenger screening measures are used to manage the lack of AIT equipment at smaller airports. The TSA has implemented risk-based passenger screening measures to manage the lack of AIT equipment at smaller airports. The PreCheck trusted traveler program offers expedited screening at fewer than half of all commercial passenger airports. The FAA directed TSA to initiate demonstration programs at large airports to increase efficiencies and reduce vulnerabilities in passenger checkpoint reconfigurations. Additionally, a separate demonstration program aims to develop and test next-generation screening system prototypes for expedited passenger handling. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is conducting testing at Reagan National Airport to evaluate advanced transportation security screening technologies. The TSA is also working to promote a diverse security technology industry to support small business innovators. Additionally, the TSA is establishing an innovation task force to accelerate the development of innovative transportation security technologies. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is reviewing whether the Transportation Security Laboratory in Atlantic City should be managed by TSA or another DHS entity. The TSA has implemented risk-based screening initiatives like PreCheck, modified procedures for children and elderly passengers, and expedited screening for known flight crew. PreCheck allows participants to keep shoes on and liquids/laptops in carry-on bags after passing a background check. Over 200 airports offer PreCheck expedited screening lanes as of December 2018. The TSA offers expedited screening lanes at over 200 airports through the PreCheck program, which costs $85 for a five-year membership. The goal is to process 50% of passengers through PreCheck lanes to reduce standard security screening needs. However, the program has struggled to increase membership. One concern is the lack of biometric authentication, with a previous program scrapped in 2009 due to a lack of security benefits. Biometric identity authentication was reintroduced at 13 airports in 2016 under the Clear program, separate from PreCheck. The Clear program, separate from PreCheck and not funded by TSA, allows participants to verify identity using biometric authentication like fingerprint or iris scan. The managed inclusion program, which directed selected travelers through PreCheck lanes, was phased out in 2015 due to lack of testing. Canine teams still conduct pre-assessments at some major airports for passengers not enrolled in PreCheck. PreCheck has improved screening efficiency and saved $110 million in direct screener workforce costs annually. There are discussions on expanding PreCheck to accommodate 15 to 20 million travelers, with recent legislation addressing its expansion. TSA is directed to work with private-sector entities to increase PreCheck enrollment options. The legislation directs TSA to work with private-sector entities to expand PreCheck enrollment options and set enrollment targets of 7 million by the end of FY2019, 10 million by the end of FY2020, and 15 million by the end of FY2021. It also requires TSA to ensure expedited screening lanes are available during peak travel times and only trusted traveler program members and Armed Forces personnel can use PreCheck lanes. Forces can use PreCheck lanes. TSA and CBP are directed to deploy biometric tech for international travelers. TSA plans to integrate biometrics for PreCheck travelers and expand to all domestic travelers. Privacy concerns arise with increased biometric use. TSA has programs for known crewmembers and passenger behavior detection. The TSA has a passenger behavior detection program called SPOT, with almost 3,000 behavior detection officers at 176 airports. Questions remain about its effectiveness and concerns about racial profiling. Congress has not taken action to eliminate or revamp the program despite raised concerns. The TSA's controversial initiative to use air marshals to shadow passengers based on behavioral profiles was shut down in December 2018 due to privacy concerns. TSA took over checking passenger names against terrorist watchlists after airlines failed to identify threats in 2009 and 2010. In November 2010, DHS announced that 100% of passengers flying to or from U.S. airports are being vetted using the Secure Flight system, which checks passenger name records against the Terrorist Screening Database. International flights also use watchlists by CBP's National Targeting Center-Passenger and the Advance Passenger Information System. TSA conducts risk-based analysis of passenger data through the Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System. In January 2015, TSA announced the integration of CAPPS assessments into Secure Flight for risk-based passenger screening at airport checkpoints. P.L. 115-254 replaced references to CAPPS with Secure Flight and mandated a review of the program's privacy impact assessment. Central issues regarding terrorist watchlists in aviation may be addressed in the 116th Congress. Key issues regarding terrorist watchlists in the aviation domain for the 116th Congress include updating watchlists promptly with new intelligence, utilizing all available information to assess threats among passengers and airport workers, detecting identity fraud, providing redress for individuals wrongly identified as threats, and coordinating with international partners. There is also a focus on using watchlists to prevent terrorist travel, especially by radicalized individuals joining foreign terrorist organizations like the Islamic State. Language in P.L. 114-190 directed TSA to evaluate recurrent fingerprint-based criminal assessments. The TSA was directed to assess the feasibility of recurrent fingerprint-based criminal background checks for PreCheck program participants and expand checks for certain airport workers. Airport operators are responsible for perimeter security, access controls, and issuing Security Identification Display Area (SIDA) badges to workers. TSA mandates secure access control points at airports. Airports must implement security measures like surveillance technologies, access control, and patrols to protect airport property. TSA requires background checks for airport workers with access to secure areas. State and local law enforcement agencies patrol airport property to deter threats. Background checks are required for airport workers with access to secure areas, including fingerprint-based criminal history records checks and security threat assessments. Certain criminal offenses within the past 10 years are disqualifying. Airports collect applicant information and fingerprints for TSA processing. P.L. 114-190 directs TSA to update eligibility criteria and disqualifying offenses for SIDA access credentials based on transportation vetting requirements and insider threat knowledge. TSA may expand the criminal history look-back period. The law proposes TSA to expand the criminal history look-back period to 15 years and disqualify individuals released from prison within 5 years of application. It requires recurrent vetting of airport workers using the FBI's Rap Back service and mandates a centralized database for tracking individuals. TSA must provide data to congressional oversight committees and use homeland security resources to educate personnel on mitigating insider threats. The law mandates TSA to conduct random physical inspections of airport workers at SIDA access points and in SIDA areas, with a focus on security effectiveness. It also requires TSA to continue covert testing of employee access controls and establish more stringent standards for individuals applying for SIDA access, including providing their social security number for vetting purposes. The TSA is implementing Computed Tomography (CT) scanning technology at passenger screening checkpoints to improve detection of explosives and other threats. This technology will require more resources initially to clear false alarms compared to X-ray technology. The TSA is implementing Computed Tomography (CT) scanning technology at passenger screening checkpoints to improve detection of explosives and other threats. P.L. 115-254 directs TSA to proceed with CT pilot programs and examine using CT technology for screening cargo on passenger aircraft. TSA also assesses other emerging screening technologies for air cargo screening and utilizes CT-based systems for checked baggage screening. TSA is funding the development of new algorithms to detect homemade explosives threats in checked baggage. The TSA is implementing new algorithms to detect homemade explosives in checked baggage and reduce false positives. They also train and deploy canine teams at transportation facilities to detect explosives, with over 370 TSA teams and 675 state and local law enforcement teams trained. There is interest in increasing deployments of canine teams in nonsterile areas of airport terminals following airport bombings in 2016. TSA is authorized to provide training to foreign governments in airport security measures, including the use of canine teams. The TSA is directed by P.L. 115-254 to establish a working group to support a decentralized domestic breeding program for explosives detection canines and to develop guidance for the procurement and deployment of third-party domestic canines to enhance security at transportation hubs. Large hub airports without enough canine teams can acquire canines from TSA-approved sources, which will be trained by TSA personnel. Additionally, TSA is instructed to issue standards for the primary screening of air passengers. The TSA is directed by P.L. 115-254 to establish a working group for enhancing security in public areas of transportation facilities. Federal law enforcement may assume a lead investigative role following a security incident, especially if it is deemed an act of terrorism. TSA also issues standards for air cargo screening by private entities using dogs not owned by TSA. The Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-50) directs TSA to increase funding for law enforcement officers in public areas of airports to deter terrorists. After a shooting incident at LAX in 2013, TSA proposed actions to improve checkpoint security but did not support arming TSA employees or mandatory law enforcement presence at checkpoints. The Airport Security Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-50) requires airports to create security incident response plans and share best practices. It also aims to increase funding for law enforcement support at screening checkpoints through cost savings from PreCheck implementation. TSA regulates foreign air carriers operating flights to the US to enforce security requirements. The TSA enforces security requirements for foreign air carriers operating flights to the United States, including inspections of foreign airports. Transportation Security Administration Representatives assess country compliance with aviation security standards and coordinate risk analysis. Some foreign airports have Customs and Border Protection preclearance facilities for passengers traveling to the US. Customs preclearance facilities allow passengers on international flights to deplane directly into the airport sterile area in the U.S. Plans to expand preclearance to more countries and airports are in progress, with a focus on screening measures. TSA is also working on increasing checked baggage preclearance processing. The TSA is working on increasing checked baggage preclearance processing to avoid rescreening at U.S. airports of entry. Security risk assessments are required at last point of departure airports, with donated screening equipment needing to be maintained properly and not compromised. DHS and the Department of State are tasked with reviewing and improving international aviation security standards. P.L. 115-254 directs TSA to collaborate with the International Civil Aviation Organization to enhance aviation security standards and work with FAA to monitor public charter flights between the U.S. and Cuba. The threat of shoulder-fired missiles was highlighted after the 9/11 attacks, leading to bilateral cooperation efforts to address the issue. The DHS Counter-MANPADS program aimed to protect airliners from heat-seeking missiles but faced challenges due to high costs. U.S. airlines have not deployed these systems, arguing that the government should share the financial burden. MANPADS pose a security threat to civil aviation overseas, with potential impact in the United States. MANPADS pose a security threat to civil aviation overseas, but an attack in the United States could have a significant impact on the airline industry. Efforts to reduce vulnerabilities to potential MANPADS attacks face logistical challenges. The proliferation of civilian drones raises security risks, including the possibility of terrorists using drones for attacks or targeting drones for cyber threats. The 116th Congress may focus on policies and technologies to address safety and security threats posed by drones. Terrorists could use drones for small-scale attacks with explosives or for chemical, biological, or radiological attacks. In the past, there have been incidents of unauthorized drone flights near high-profile targets, such as a political rally in Germany and a disrupted terrorist plot in the United States involving model aircraft packed with explosives. Incidents involving drones near high-profile targets have raised concerns about safety and security threats. Reports include drones flying near airports, manned aircraft, restricted airspace, and stadiums. In one case, a hobby drone collided with a National Guard helicopter in New York, causing damage. Other safety incidents involving drones have also been reported. ISIS has used drones in conflict zones for reconnaissance and dropping explosives. While small drones may limit damage from conventional explosives, attacks using chemical, biological, or radiological weapons could be more serious. Regulations require security threat assessments for commercial drone operators, but not for recreational users. Law enforcement may lack sufficient training for dealing with unlawful drone operations. Law enforcement agencies may lack training and technical capacity to respond to security threats posed by unmanned aircraft. Technology, such as tracking mechanisms and \"geo-fencing\" capabilities, can help manage unauthorized flights. Legislation directs the FAA to establish programs to detect and mitigate drone operations near critical infrastructure. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes actions to mitigate threats posed by drones. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes the military and other agencies to take defensive actions against unmanned aircraft threats in the United States, including detecting, monitoring, and disrupting control signals of UASs. P.L. 115-254 expands the authority of the Department of Justice, DHS, and the Coast Guard to protect facilities and assets from credible UAS threats. The FAA is directed to coordinate with various agencies for counter-UAS efforts. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes agencies to engage in counter-unmanned aircraft activities, reviewing standards, policies, and practices for safety in airspace, protecting individuals and property, and not interfering with aviation systems. FAA is directed to coordinate with DOD and DHS to ensure technologies for mitigating UAS risks do not impact airport operations. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes agencies to engage in counter-unmanned aircraft activities and directs FAA to work with DOD to streamline deployment of C-UAS. It requires FAA to develop a strategy for identifying public safety threats posed by UASs and implement a pilot program for enforcement actions against non-compliant UAS operators. The act prohibits arming drones with dangerous weapons and establishes criminal penalties for various offenses involving drones, such as flying over restricted areas or interfering with wildfire suppression efforts. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes agencies to engage in counter-unmanned aircraft activities and directs FAA to work with DOD to streamline deployment of C-UAS. It requires FAA to develop a strategy for identifying public safety threats posed by UASs and implement a pilot program for enforcement actions against non-compliant UAS operators. The act prohibits arming drones with dangerous weapons and establishes criminal penalties for various offenses involving drones, such as flying over restricted areas or interfering with wildfire suppression efforts. Concerns over cybersecurity threats to aircraft, air traffic control systems, and airports are addressed through Executive Order 13636, which guides DHS to collaborate with FAA in identifying cybersecurity risks and sharing information on threats within the broader cybersecurity framework. TSA's approach to cybersecurity involves voluntary collaboration with industry, as seen in the formation of the Transportation Systems Sector Cybersecurity Working Group. In 2012, TSA established the Transportation Systems Sector Cybersecurity Working Group to create a cybersecurity strategy for the transportation sector. In 2014, TSA, FBI, and industry partners launched the Air Domain Intelligence Integration Center to analyze cyberthreats to civil aviation. FAA has a software assurance policy for its information systems, but still faces challenges in mitigating cyberthreats, especially with the NextGen modernization initiative. The January 2018 GAO report warned about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in new aircraft tracking technologies under NextGen, including risks of jamming, hacking, and spoofing signals. FAA requires cybersecurity in airworthiness certification, and manufacturers collaborate with security companies for software assurance. Despite efforts to design resilient systems, TSA and FBI issued warnings in April 2015 about increasing vulnerabilities due to interconnectedness of aircraft systems. The GAO cautioned that FAA's current cybersecurity approach for aircraft and air traffic systems lacks comprehensive coordination and may hinder strategy development. Recommendations include developing a threat model, clarifying roles, improving security controls, and incorporating NIST guidance. The P.L. 115-254 mandates FAA to develop a strategic framework for reducing cybersecurity risks in the national airspace system, civilian aviation, and FAA information systems. It also directs FAA to update the framework to address known cybersecurity risks, certification of aircraft avionics systems, and develop an integrated cybersecurity testbed for air traffic control technologies. Additionally, the act orders a National Academy of Sciences study to enhance FAA's cybersecurity workforce. TSA is directed to implement the framework for improving cybersecurity. The P.L. 115-254 mandates TSA to implement the NIST framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity and coordinate with international counterparts for reciprocal recognition of security technology approvals. TSA also released a new cybersecurity roadmap in November 2018. In November 2018, TSA released a new cybersecurity roadmap to address cybersecurity risks in the transportation industry, including aviation. The roles of TSA and FAA in regulating cybersecurity, especially in aircraft certification and air traffic control, may be a topic for congressional oversight. Passenger rail systems in the US are vulnerable to terrorist attacks, with concerns that terrorists may target them due to increased security in air travel. Increased security efforts in air travel have raised concerns about potential terrorist attacks on softer targets like transit or passenger rail. Congress must balance the need for increased rail security with the efficient functioning of transit systems and other federal priorities. Due to the high volume of ridership and access points, it is impractical to screen all rail passengers like airline passengers. Transit security measures focus on managing the consequences of an attack, but steps have been taken to reduce the risks, including vulnerability assessments, emergency planning, training of personnel, and increasing security personnel. Increased security efforts in air travel have raised concerns about potential terrorist attacks on transit or passenger rail. Congress must balance the need for increased rail security with the efficient functioning of transit systems. Security measures focus on managing the consequences of an attack, including vulnerability assessments, emergency planning, training personnel, and increasing security personnel. TSA provides oversight, coordination, intelligence sharing, training, and assistance for surface transportation security. VIPR teams offer operational support in securing transit and rail passengers. The Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams provide operational support for transit and passenger rail security, conducting patrols to deter threats. Congressional efforts include grants for security, approval of security plans for high-risk targets, and background checks for frontline employees. TSA aims to increase system resilience and reduce risk in transit. TSA aims to increase system resilience in transit by protecting critical assets, expanding deterrence activities, and engaging the public. Surface transportation security inspectors assess transit systems through the BASE program. The RMAST program focuses on high-risk entities, but GAO reported in 2017 that TSA had not identified or prioritized them. TSA has not prioritized high-risk entities for the RMAST program. Congressional concerns include the expertise of surface inspectors and their management by airport-based security directors. The number of surface inspectors decreased due to risk-based focus, but GAO reported inefficiencies in 2017. TSA's surface inspectors may spend more time on low-risk surface transportation modes than on high-risk ones. Lack of guidance has led to inconsistent reporting of rail security incidents, poor data collection, and ineffective feedback processes. The Transit Security Grant Program provides funding for security improvements in public transit, passenger rail, and other surface transportation modes. Funding for the program has decreased by 84% since 2009, despite concerns about potential duplication among similar DHS grant programs. Congress has not supported consolidation of these programs, with appropriators expressing worries about the lack of focus on high-risk areas. In P.L. 114-50, Congress directed TSA to ensure high-risk transportation providers have plans for security incidents. The economic impact of a maritime terrorist attack could be significant. Customs and Coast Guard began screening vessels and cargo before reaching U.S. ports post-9/11. Customs implemented the \"24-hour rule\" for importers to submit shipment information in advance to prevent terrorist attacks. The Container Security Initiative examines high-risk shipments before loading them onto vessels. The Coast Guard also extended terrorist screening beyond U.S. ports. The Coast Guard extends terrorist screening beyond U.S. ports by requiring ships to announce their arrival in advance and evaluating security risks. They advocate for international port security standards and assess security measures at foreign ports. Multiple layers of security cover ports, vessels, cargo, and workers, with programs like C-TPAT ensuring supply chain security. C-TPAT covers the entire supply chain, including procedures for loading containers and applying seals to prevent tampering. CBP has radiation monitors at U.S. port truck gates. The Coast Guard requires security plans for vessel owners and port authorities, tailored to each port's vulnerabilities. Their goal is maritime domain awareness. The Coast Guard focuses on maritime domain awareness by requiring vessels to have Automatic Identification Systems and conducting background checks for port workers. Congress authorized these security measures in the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 authorized security measures for maritime domain awareness. Congress modified maritime security programs in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, incorporating cybersecurity as a required element in security plans for terminal and vessel operators. Recent attention has been on cybersecurity and the use of drones for coastal surveillance, with concerns about vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in the development of electronic navigation. The Coast Guard has integrated cybersecurity into enforcement programs, added cybersecurity training for mariner licensing and port security officers, and is exploring the use of unmanned aircraft systems for coastal surveillance missions. Funding has been allocated for drones on national security cutters, and testing in the Arctic has been ongoing since 2015 for various missions such as ice conditions surveying and search and rescue operations. The Coast Guard is testing unmanned aircraft that can be launched from land or a cutter. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018 requests a study on using drones to enhance maritime awareness and allows leasing of large UASs if funding is provided for Offshore Patrol Cutters."
