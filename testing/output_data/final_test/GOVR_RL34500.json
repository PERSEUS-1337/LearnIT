Approximately 11 million of these individuals are unauthorized residents, sparking debates in Congress about their rights and privileges, including due process, tax liabilities, military service, federal assistance, education, and pathways to citizenship. This report focuses on the policy and legislative debate surrounding unauthorized aliens' access to federal benefits. Researchers estimate that there were 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants in the US in 2014, including those who overstay visas, enter surreptitiously, or use fraudulent documents. The actual number is unknown due to methodological challenges. Some unauthorized aliens have legal documents, leading to them being called \"quasi-legal\" migrants. Some unauthorized aliens in the US are considered \"quasi-legal\" migrants due to having temporary employment authorization documents (EADs) issued by DHS. These aliens can obtain Social Security cards and fall into various categories, including those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), DACA recipients, asylum seekers with pending cases, immediate family of legal permanent residents, and those with pending petitions for adjustment of status. Abused, neglected, or abandoned children who lack authorization under immigration law raise complex immigration and child welfare concerns. Congress created a pathway in 1990 for unauthorized alien children who become dependents of state juvenile courts to stay in the US legally and permanently. Unauthorized minors in the United States who have faced abuse, neglect, or abandonment may be eligible for special immigrant juvenile (SIJ) status, allowing them to become legal permanent residents (LPRs) under the INA. Children born in the US to undocumented parents are US citizens by jus soli principle. Many households headed by unauthorized aliens likely have US citizen children and spouses who may be LPRs. According to 301(a) of the INA, individuals born in the US are citizens regardless of their parents' race or alienage. Around 27% of unauthorized adults live with US citizen children under 18, while 6% live with adult US citizen children. The number of citizen children in households with unauthorized aliens has increased from 2.7 million in 2003 to 4.5 million in 2010. The number of unauthorized immigrants decreased from 1.5 million in 2003 to 1.0 million in 2010. Policies balance entitlement program integrity with humanitarian emergency assistance. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act set rules for noncitizen eligibility for public benefits, barring unauthorized aliens from most federal benefits. Prior to 1996, unauthorized aliens were not allowed to participate in major federal assistance programs. Some programs did not have specific provisions regarding alien eligibility, making unauthorized aliens potential participants. This included programs like the WIC program and child nutrition programs. The PRUCOL eligibility standard, not defined in statute, has been used historically to benefit certain foreign nationals in the US. It is considered by many as outdated but has resurfaced for \"quasi-legal\" aliens. Before 1996, federal benefit eligibility was based on PRUCOL interpretations, which were disputed by a federal court. The federal court in Holley v. Lavine expanded the PRUCOL standard for benefit eligibility to cover certain undocumented aliens. However, there was no uniform definition of PRUCOL, leading to varying applications based on the benefit and alien class. The PRWORA of 1996 established restrictions on noncitizens' eligibility for federal public benefits, barring unauthorized aliens from most benefits except emergency services and specific programs. The definition of a federal public benefit includes grants, contracts, loans, licenses, and various assistance programs. Unauthorized aliens are barred from receiving various federal public benefits, including welfare, health, disability, housing, education, and food assistance. Exceptions include emergency Medicaid treatment, short-term disaster relief, and immunizations. Unauthorized aliens are prohibited from receiving most federal public benefits, with exceptions for emergency Medicaid treatment, short-term disaster relief, and immunizations. Additional exceptions include in-kind services at the community level, assistance without individual determinations of needs, and programs administered by specific government agencies. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) includes provisions governing the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to prevent unauthorized aliens from receiving it. Title VII of PRWORA addresses federally supported nutrition programs, allowing students eligible for free public education to receive federally subsidized school meals regardless of citizenship status. States have discretion to deny benefits to unauthorized aliens under various nutrition programs. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) includes provisions regarding nutrition programs such as the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). PRWORA also addressed Medicaid coverage for unauthorized alien women and their citizen children, with a court ruling that citizen children of unauthorized alien mothers must be automatically eligible for Medicaid at birth. Additionally, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was enacted in 1997 as a federal public health insurance program. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations in 2002 allowed states to provide CHIP coverage to fetuses, including unauthorized aliens. The Higher Education Amendments of 1986 limited federal student aid programs to U.S. citizens and LPRs. The Department of Education maintains restrictions on unauthorized aliens and temporary foreign residents for financial aid. The PRWORA bars unauthorized aliens from most state and locally funded benefits, including government contracts, licenses, grants, loans, and assistance. Exceptions include emergency medical treatment, disaster relief, immunization, and services designated by the attorney general. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) restricts unauthorized aliens from receiving most state and locally funded benefits, with exceptions for emergency medical treatment, disaster relief, immunization, and services designated by the attorney general. The law allows states to provide unauthorized aliens with state and local benefits through new state laws, despite federal restrictions. Additionally, PRWORA does not address eligibility for basic public education. The laws restrict unauthorized aliens from receiving most state and locally funded benefits, with exceptions for emergency medical treatment and certain services. Determining immigration status can be complex, and states have options to provide benefits to legal permanent residents that may not be available to unauthorized aliens. The Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system provides access to necessary immigration status data for government agencies. The Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system provides access to immigration status data for government agencies to determine noncitizen eligibility for public benefits. SAVE draws on the Verification Information System (VIS) database with over 100 million records, mandated by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system allows government agencies to verify noncitizen eligibility for public benefits. Agencies can access SAVE through electronic or paper-based verification processes, with fees charged by USCIS for web-based access. The SAVE program requires agencies to have a Memorandum of Understanding and purchase order to pay transaction fees for web-based access. Paper form submissions are charged $2.00 per case by USCIS. Immigration documents for aliens now include biometric identifiers for document integrity and personal identification, such as the plastic permanent resident card with security features like digital images and holograms issued by USCIS. The USCIS issues documents with security features like digital images, holograms, and micro-printing. Unauthorized aliens may commit document fraud, but the extent is unknown. Technology for verifying immigration status has advanced. The US does not require citizens to have national identification cards. The U.S. passport is a key document certifying citizenship, while other forms like Social Security cards and driver's licenses do not establish citizenship. False claims of citizenship are illegal under Section 1015 of the U.S. Criminal Code. The INA prohibits false claims of U.S. citizenship to obtain federal or state benefits or engage in unlawful employment. Specific laws like the REAL ID Act aim to enhance document integrity for state-issued IDs. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and CHIPRA 2009 require states to verify citizenship and identity for Medicaid eligibility. States can elect an alternative process for verification by submitting applicant information to the SSA for confirmation. The SSA verifies citizenship and identity for Medicaid eligibility. If the SSA cannot confirm the applicant's information, they must resolve the inconsistency or provide satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship. The Social Security card is not meant for personal identification, but to identify the record holder. The SSA was required to obtain evidence to establish age under the Social Security Amendments of 1972. The Security Amendments of 1972 required the SSA to verify age, citizenship, and identity for Social Security card applicants. Applicants must present documents with name, identifying information, and a photograph. Despite restrictions, there is a perception that unauthorized migrants receive federal benefits. Data on this issue is limited, but some evaluations and investigations attempt to address it. The Inspector General for Tax Administration found that the IRS paid $4.2 billion in refundable tax credits in 2010 to individuals unauthorized to work in the US. ITINs are issued to individuals not eligible for SSNs but required for tax purposes. The number of tax forms filed with ITINs increased from 1.55 million in 2005 to 3.02 million in 2010. The U.S. Department of Labor study estimated $38.0 million in Unemployment Compensation was paid to unauthorized aliens in FY2002. The UC program expended $53.8 billion that year, with eligibility requiring documentation of immigration status verified through the SAVE Program. The U.S. Department of Labor study found that errors in UC payments to unauthorized aliens were due to the state's failure to use available information to identify eligibility issues. Data from the Benefit Accuracy Measurement Survey showed that payments to ineligible aliens accounted for 0.02% of all UC payments from July 2013 to June 2016. Mixed-immigration status families complicate research on benefit receipt. In FY2014, 4.1 million U.S. citizen children living with noncitizen parents received food stamps, with some parents potentially being unauthorized migrants. Steven Camarota estimated that federal benefits to households headed by unauthorized migrants in 2002 included costs for Medicaid, treatment for the uninsured, and food assistance programs. Unauthorized aliens are eligible for programs like emergency Medicaid and school lunch. The costs associated with illegals are largely due to their American-born children who are U.S. citizens. Efforts to bar illegals from federal programs may not reduce costs as their citizen children can still access them. Controversies and debates surround unauthorized aliens' access to federal benefits, including issues with mixed-immigration-status families and unintended consequences of tightening identification requirements. Debates also arise on the implementation of the clause \"federal public benefit.\" Unauthorized aliens may face restrictions in being payees for federal benefits for U.S. citizen children in certain programs like SNAP. Their income is considered in household eligibility, but they are not counted as household members. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program sets a barrier for unauthorized alien parents to be payees for SSI benefits for their U.S. citizen children, requiring an investigation into their suitability and verification of their social security account number. The Social Security Administration may issue SSNs for verifying immigration status and citizenship, alongside biometric identification documents. Expanding documentary requirements to include proof of U.S. citizenship is advocated to prevent ineligible aliens from falsely claiming citizenship and promote equal treatment. Medicaid implemented a citizenship documentation requirement in 2006 to replace self-declaration of citizenship status. Medicaid implemented a citizenship documentation requirement in 2006 to supersede self-declaration of citizenship status. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found limited information on how the requirement deterred unqualified aliens from applying for Medicaid, with evidence of inadvertent denials of U.S. citizens. Twenty-two states reported declines in Medicaid enrollment due to delays or losses of coverage for individuals who appeared to be citizens. The citizenship documentation requirement in Medicaid led to declines in enrollment due to delays or losses of coverage for eligible citizens. The cost savings estimated by HHS CMS were uncertain, as increased administrative expenditures were not considered. The implementation of Section 401 of PRWORA across federal benefits is not uniform, leading to ambiguity in areas such as tax refunds. The ambiguity in the implementation of Section 401 of PRWORA across federal benefits is evident in the case of tax refunds. The Internal Revenue Service allows unauthorized resident aliens to claim the additional child tax credit, indicating that refundable tax credits may not be considered federal public benefits that unauthorized migrants are prohibited from receiving. Refundable tax credits could potentially be classified as benefits under Section 401, as they are akin to grants or payments provided by federal agencies or appropriated funds. During major disasters, government officials face dilemmas regarding access to emergency relief for unauthorized aliens, as outlined in Section 401 of PRWORA. This section allows unauthorized aliens to receive short-term, in-kind emergency disaster relief necessary for life and safety under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. FEMA conducts disaster assistance efforts under this authority. The Stafford Act requires nondiscrimination and equitable treatment in FEMA disaster assistance efforts, including grants for shelter, cash assistance, housing, repair grants, unemployment aid, food supplies, legal aid, and counseling. The Secretary of DHS may pre-position employees and supplies for precautionary evacuation measures in imminent disasters. Border patrol agents in Texas announced pre-screening for citizenship documents during a mock evacuation in 2008. Border patrol agents in Texas announced pre-screening residents for citizenship documents before allowing them to board evacuation buses in the event of a hurricane. DHS Border Patrol will assist in safe evacuations while upholding border security. Mixed-immigration status families' treatment during evacuations remains unclear. DHS has not issued a formal policy on pre-screening during emergency evacuations. During disaster aid applications, FEMA may request additional information like rental agreements or employment status to determine eligibility. Unauthorized aliens receiving aid are not immune from deportation, even if they qualify for assistance. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, many displaced aliens were afraid to seek help due to deportation fears. The administration's priority is providing essential assistance such as water, food, and shelter. The DHS provided assistance such as water, food, medical care, and shelter during disasters. They also arrested and deported unauthorized aliens affected by the 2005 hurricanes. In addition to emergency aid, FEMA funds the EFS Program for homeless individuals. The EFS program was a source of funding for service providers assisting unaccompanied alien children and families in 2014. The issue of \"quasi-legal\" migrants and PRUCOL policies has resurfaced. The issue of \"quasi-legal\" migrants embodied by PRUCOL has returned to the forefront, particularly in discussions about compensation for laid-off workers and tax refunds. Aliens with EADs and SSNs, but no authorization to reside in the US, pose a dilemma as they are allowed to work and have paid into the system. States' ability to offer in-state tuition to foreign nationals with Temporary Protected Status is also debated. Some argue that TPS holders are lawfully present under INA Section 244, while others point out limitations to this designation. Aliens with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) are not considered qualified aliens under PRWORA, which limits access to federally funded postsecondary education. The debate over states offering in-state tuition to TPS holders may depend on the involvement of federal funds. Congress has grappled with access rules for unauthorized aliens, sometimes leading to controversial issues like citizenship documentation requirements. Some argue that federal benefit programs are a magnet for unauthorized migration, while others believe that restrictions on benefits create a growing underclass of noncitizens. Congress must consider the cost-effectiveness of further limiting access to benefits and preventing fraudulent receipt."
