Neurons in the prefrontal cortex have stable temporal receptive fields and long timescales to support working memory. Spiking recurrent neural networks can replicate experimental findings related to working memory tasks, offering a way to study the emergence of neuronal timescales specific to working memory. In this study, a spiking RNN model is constructed to perform a working memory task and compared with the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys. Both utilize units with long timescales during the delay period to sustain stimulus. The RNN model uses units with long timescales during the delay period to maintain stimulus information. The number of these units is reduced in a non-WM task, indicating task-specific organization. The model is based on leaky integrate-and-fire units connected recurrently, with specific parameters defined at the NeurIPS 2019 conference in Vancouver, Canada. The synaptic filter was applied to presynaptic spike trains in a neural network model designed for a delayed match-to-sample task. The model consisted of 40 RNNs with 200 units each, optimized synaptic decay constants, and a mix of excitatory and inhibitory units. The RNNs were trained using a gradient descent algorithm before being mapped to LIF networks. The task involved presenting sequential input stimuli to a neural network model with fixed values. The network output was trained to approach either +1 or -1 based on the signs of the stimuli. The model was validated for investigating neuronal timescales in the prefrontal cortex. In comparing our model findings to a dataset of single-neuron spike recordings from rhesus monkeys performing DMS tasks, we analyzed 3257 neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for spike-count autocorrelation. The decay time constant of the spike-count autocorrelation was computed for each unit during the fixation period using a 50-ms moving window. For the experimental data, a spike-count matrix was created for each neuron with a minimum of 11 trials required for analysis. The average number of trials per neuron was 84.8 \u00b1 34.5. In the RNN model, 50 trials were generated for each unit. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between time bins with a maximum lag of 650 ms. An exponential decay function was fitted to the average coefficient values using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The inclusion criteria for the RNN model and experimental data included 0 < \u03c3 \u2264 500 ms, A > 0, and a first decrease in \u03c1 earlier than \u2206 = 150 ms. Timescales extracted from untrained RNNs were right-skewed, while trained RNNs and experimental data were heavily left-skewed, indicating predominantly long timescales. The RNN model and experimental data showed predominantly long timescales, with units encoding information robustly. Cross-temporal decoding analysis was used to investigate if units with longer timescales were involved in more stable coding. A high Fisher-transformed correlation value indicates reliable cue-specific differences in the network population. Analysis on short and long neuronal timescale subgroups revealed stronger cue-specific differences in the long \u03c3 subgroup compared to the short \u03c3 subgroup for both experimental data and the RNN model. The hierarchical organization of neuronal timescales corresponds to stable coding. Sensory areas have short timescales, while higher cortical areas require longer timescales for encoding and integrating information. Functional specialization emerges in spiking RNNs trained on a Go-NoGo task without working memory requirements. The RNNs trained on a Go-NoGo task responded to cue stimuli with specific outputs. The task did not involve working memory and focused on how sensory areas process information. Compared to RNNs trained on a working memory task, the RNNs for the Go-NoGo task had shorter autocorrelation decay timescales and contained fewer units with long timescales. The average timescales for the Go-NoGo task RNNs were faster than those for the working memory RNNs. The neuronal timescales of RNN models for Go-NoGo and DMS tasks are task-specific and possibly organized hierarchically. The timescales obtained were not largely driven by synaptic decay constants, as demonstrated by training RNNs with fixed decay constants. The timescale distributions were largely preserved for both models. The average timescales of RNN models for Go-NoGo and DMS tasks were significantly different when optimized for synaptic decay time constant. Increasing the decay time constant did not necessarily lead to increased neuronal timescales, suggesting that connectivity patterns may play a bigger role in governing task-specific timescales. In a study using a spiking RNN model of working memory (WM), it was found that the model and the primate prefrontal cortex both exhibited heterogeneous neuronal timescales. Units with long timescales were utilized to maintain stimulus information in WM tasks, while shorter timescales were observed in a non-WM task (Go-NoGo task). Future work will focus on characterizing network dynamics and circuit motifs of the DMS RNN model to understand the connectivity structures necessary for stable temporal receptive fields in WM."
