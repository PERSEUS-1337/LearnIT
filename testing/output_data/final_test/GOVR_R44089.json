    "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was created by Congress in 1934 to protect investors and regulate capital markets. One of the SEC's powers is to establish accounting standards for U.S. companies, who use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for financial reporting. The SEC relies on the private sector, specifically the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to establish U.S. GAAP. Many countries, including the EU, use IFRS for financial reporting. The SEC and FASB have been considering incorporating IFRS since the Norwalk Agreement in 2002 with the IASB. The SEC has been delaying convergence with IFRS since 2002, leading to uncertainty about adopting or maintaining U.S. GAAP. The report discusses the impact on investors and firms, congressional interest, and policy options in the U.S. GAAP versus IFRS debate. Appendices provide key definitions and acronyms. Accounting standards, such as U.S. GAAP and IFRS, are agreements on how financial statements should be valued and reported. U.S. GAAP is rules-based, while IFRS is principles-based. U.S. GAAP has become more rules-based over time, seeking clarity from regulators on implementation. IFRS is principles-based, providing a framework for decision-making without specific guidance like U.S. GAAP. The SEC has the authority to establish financial accounting standards but has historically relied on the private sector for this task. The SEC relies on the private sector to establish accounting standards, with FASB's U.S. GAAP considered authoritative. FASB is funded by fees from publicly traded issuers, with support fees subject to SEC review. In 2007, the SEC chief accountant required a MoU between SEC and FASB for budget authorization. The SEC signed a MoU with FASB, granting the SEC the authority to nominate and interview FASB members and FAF trustees. U.S. GAAP provides guidelines for financial reporting in the U.S., considered the \"gold standard\" due to its evolution since the 1930s. It emphasizes conservatism and is preferred by accounting practitioners over IFRS. The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was established in 1973 as a precursor to the IASB, aiming to create global accounting standards. While some countries initially used IASC standards, the adoption of IFRS by the IASB in 2003 led to over 100 countries converging with or adopting IFRS. The IASB, part of the IFRS Foundation, is responsible for establishing IFRS globally. Countries can adopt IFRS without modification or converge their local GAAP with IFRS. Adoption and convergence are two main ways countries incorporate IFRS. In China, IFRS is not required but Chinese Accounting Standards (CAS) have converged with IFRS. IFRS was customized for the Chinese market. Various organizations like FASB, AICPA, IASB create accounting rules but lack enforcement power in the US private industry. Financial statements benefit firms and investors by providing accurate information for capital allocation. Investors use financial statements to make investment decisions. Congressional interest in SEC actions is discussed in this report. The report discusses congressional interest in SEC actions regarding U.S. GAAP and IFRS standards for the U.S. capital markets. The SEC has the authority to establish accounting standards, but has relied on the private sector, like FASB, to set U.S. GAAP. The SEC oversees accounting standards in the U.S. and is considering a switch from U.S. GAAP to IFRS. The SEC's potential switch from U.S. GAAP to IFRS could have significant implications for U.S. firms and investors, which has sparked congressional interest in accounting convergence. Congress has shown interest through hearings, letters to the SEC, and previous legislation, with concerns raised about the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and the potential for a \"two-GAAP environment\" leading to investor confusion. The SEC's potential switch from U.S. GAAP to IFRS has sparked congressional interest in accounting convergence. Concerns include the existence of a \"two-GAAP environment, accounting arbitrage, investor confusion, and possible legal challenges. Previous legislation required the SEC to study the adoption of principles-based accounting standards, recognizing the benefits and limitations of both rules-based and principles-based standards. The SEC studied international accounting standards developed by the IASC in 1997 and 2012 but did not make specific policy recommendations on incorporating IFRS. Congress has not enacted legislation on incorporating IFRS, leaving the decision on accounting standards evolution to Congress, the SEC, or FASB. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act did not address accounting convergence issues. The SEC has not enacted legislation on incorporating IFRS, leaving the decision to Congress, SEC, or FASB. Congress is unlikely to act unless the SEC changes the status quo. Current senior leadership within the SEC has proposed three different approaches to incorporating IFRS without achieving consensus. SEC Commissioner Kara M. Stein proposed an approach in March 2015 for developing accounting standards responsive to the digital world to enhance global investment. SEC Chief Accountant James Schnurr suggested allowing IFRS-based financial statements as supplementary information to U.S. GAAP statements, seeking clarity on the SEC's stance on incorporating IFRS. The SEC is seeking clarity on incorporating IFRS into U.S. GAAP. A uniform global accounting standard like IFRS could benefit the U.S. economy by providing easier access to global capital markets for firms, potentially leading to improved capital allocation and lower cost of capital. The potential benefits of adopting IFRS or a similar global accounting standard include increased investments in U.S. firms, lower cost of capital, and greater market liquidity. However, it is uncertain if IFRS can achieve these benefits as U.S. GAAP already provides similar advantages and has been customized to meet the needs of the growing economy in the United States. The benefits of adopting global accounting standards like IFRS may not outweigh the advantages already provided by U.S. GAAP, which has been tailored to meet the needs of the growing U.S. economy. The institutional infrastructure and evolution of U.S. GAAP must be considered before making any changes to existing accounting standards. The report discusses how different accounting standards could impact U.S. investors and firms, with concerns raised about IASB. U.S. investors may find it challenging to adapt to IFRS after using U.S. GAAP for over 80 years. A 2012 SEC study found varying levels of U.S. investor knowledge of IFRS. Individual investors may struggle to keep up with IFRS adoption in the U.S. capital markets, facing financial challenges and uncertainties. Recent events, like the financial crisis, raised concerns about IASB's due process, with allegations of rushed decisions benefiting financial institutions. The adoption of fair-value accounting standards allowed firms to value assets higher than their actual worth, potentially harming investors in the long run. Concerns were raised in 2013 about IFRS rules enabling companies to hide increased risks on their balance sheets. FASB and IASB's response during the financial crisis may have prevented further erosion of asset values. The recent financial crisis may have prevented a more significant systemic crisis by slowing the erosion of asset values. Investors may have more confidence in U.S. GAAP due to consistent equity valuations, while IFRS allows for more management discretion in determining net income. Studies show that higher net income and stockholders' equity were reported under IFRS compared to U.S. GAAP by foreign private issuers and European companies. The study found that 82% of the largest European companies reported higher net income under IFRS than under U.S. GAAP. Concerns were raised about the influence of international accounting firms on IASB's standards and governance. The IFRS Foundation received significant contributions from these firms, leading to criticism from Members of the European Parliament for poor governance and close ties to the accounting industry. Sharon Bowles raised concerns about governance structures and transparency of bodies linked to the accounting industry. U.S. firms heavily rely on capital markets for financing, facing scrutiny from investors. U.S. GAAP has evolved over 80 years to serve market participants. IFRS was created to serve the interests of over 100 jurisdictions with varying GDPs and economic development levels. Not adopting or converging with IFRS could disadvantage U.S. firms in raising funds overseas. The SEC changed the requirement for FPIs to file Form 20-F in 2007, allowing them to file under IFRS to prevent foreign corporations from delisting due to additional costs. Foreign corporations may delist from U.S. exchanges due to costs of reconciling IFRS to U.S. GAAP. In 2014, over 5,000 companies were listed on U.S. exchanges, with nearly 1,000 FPIs. There are differing views on adopting IFRS in the U.S. Congress has policy options to consider for accounting standards. The report examines policy options for accounting standards in the U.S., including maintaining U.S. GAAP with joint standards with IASB, adopting IFRS as the U.S. standard, or allowing a hybrid option for U.S. firms to choose between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The report discusses the option of maintaining U.S. GAAP as the accounting standard for private firms in the United States. It highlights the need for coordination between FASB and IASB in responding to emerging issues and explains why maintaining U.S. GAAP may be beneficial for the U.S. capital markets. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of maintaining a responsive and independent U.S. accounting standards setter for U.S. investors and firms. It also addresses the SEC's potential reconsideration of a 2007 ruling allowing foreign firms to file under IFRS. Additionally, it explores the idea of creating a new alternative international accounting standard based on U.S. GAAP and highlights the interconnectedness of U.S. GAAP with tax laws and statutory reporting. The change from U.S. GAAP to IFRS may impact how tax liability is determined for U.S. firms with inventory. The U.S. tax code allows LIFO valuation, which IFRS does not permit. The issue of LIFO has been widely discussed in relation to IFRS adoption and was addressed at a SEC budget hearing. Statutory reporting is closely tied to financial reporting, with statutory reports often using GAAP financial information. Statutory reports provide different information than GAAP financial statements, focusing on an insurance firm's ability to pay claims or a bank's capital and liquidity. Both types of filings are valuable for investors and regulators, with statutory reports offering insights into specific industries for policymakers. The transition from U.S. GAAP to IFRS may impact tax liability for U.S. firms with inventory due to differences in valuation methods like LIFO. FASB addressed concerns of U.S. firms over the new revenue recognition standard by delaying implementation to December 15, 2017, aligning with IASB's standards. The alignment of the IASB's and FASB's revenue standards may impact the convergence of accounting standards, highlighting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. FASB's responsiveness to U.S. market concerns could influence the maintenance of U.S. accounting regulations. FASB revised its proposal for Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in three phases, while IFRS issued the new standard, IFRS 9, effective January 1, 2015. Recent U.S. debate has focused on the level of convergence desired between accounting standards. Differences in standards could benefit capital markets by promoting competition and evolution, potentially leading to improved financial reporting. The SEC changed requirements for foreign private issuers to file under IFRS in 2007. Congress and the SEC may need to consider mandating all listed firms to follow a common global accounting standard. The SEC may require all listed firms in the United States, including foreign private issuers, to report under U.S. GAAP or reconcile IFRS financial statements with U.S. GAAP standards. Creating an international version of U.S. GAAP (I-GAAP) could promote confidence in capital markets for countries similar to the U.S. economy. The adoption of I-GAAP could enhance confidence in capital markets by aligning with U.S. GAAP principles while incorporating input from other jurisdictions. Competing standards like I-GAAP and IFRS may lead to improved standards benefiting capital markets. To address criticisms faced by IFRS adoptees, I-GAAP adoptees may need to meet specific expectations on implementation, enforcement, and auditing. Jurisdictions must qualify to adopt I-GAAP, and an international FASB (I-FASB) could oversee its development and implementation. The establishment of an international FASB (I-FASB) to develop I-GAAP and determine qualifying countries could mirror the EU's admission process. Certification by I-FASB on compliance with I-GAAP for select countries could uphold its credibility. However, dual international accounting standards may hinder global convergence. Another option is the full adoption of IFRS as the U.S. accounting standard, with discussions on various adoption methods and related issues. The SEC can implement IFRS in two ways: by choosing a specific date for all public companies to start reporting under IFRS or by phasing it in over several years. The first approach may pose challenges due to resource constraints, while the second method mirrors past accounting standard changes in the U.S. Implementing IFRS over several years based on firm-revenue size or by industrial segment might allow stakeholders sufficient time to adapt to the new standards without significant disruption. Phasing in IFRS based on firm-revenue size with larger firms adopting first could be justified as they can absorb costs more readily. This approach could enable smaller firms to learn from larger firms and reduce conversion costs, although investor confusion may arise during the transition period. Implementing IFRS by specific industries over time could make it easier for stakeholders to evaluate company performance. However, industry specialization among auditors and consultants may not easily transfer between industries. Smaller firms may face challenges in converting to new standards simultaneously with larger peers. Transitioning to a new accounting standard like IFRS from U.S. GAAP would require significant resources for individual firms and the economy. Upgrading or purchasing new computer systems to maintain accounting records, reconciling financial statements under both standards, and providing disclosures for investors would incur one-time and ongoing costs. Maintaining legacy systems alongside new systems would also be necessary until the information from legacy systems becomes obsolete. Transitioning to IFRS from U.S. GAAP involves significant costs for firms and the economy, including updating computer systems, reconciling financial statements, and providing disclosures. Firms must weigh the benefits of having both sets of financial statements audited. Adopting IFRS may lead to unintentional misrepresentation in financial statements due to a learning curve for staff and auditors, potentially resulting in significant errors requiring financial statement reissuance. This could negatively impact a firm's stock price and ability to raise capital. Investors may lose confidence in U.S. capital markets if companies restate financial statements, leading to higher capital costs and limited credit availability. Leveraging knowledge from overseas firms that have adopted IFRS could help mitigate challenges for U.S. firms. Learning best practices from overseas regulators could aid in a smoother transition to IFRS. The roles of the SEC and FASB as accounting standard setters may need to be reconsidered if IFRS is adopted. The roles of the SEC and FASB as accounting standard setters may need to be reconsidered if IFRS is adopted in the United States. FASB's role could be diminished or redefined, possibly evolving into an advisory body to the SEC. If IFRS is adopted, firms may interpret and apply standards differently over time. A national standard setter could help mitigate differences and issue uniform guidance, especially for multinational firms operating in the U.S. without a standards body to provide guidance. In the context of the U.S. institutional infrastructure, multinational firms may be influenced by how standards are interpreted in other jurisdictions. Incorporating IFRS into U.S. financial reporting requirements can be done by allowing a choice between IFRS and U.S. GAAP or requiring firms to file under both standards. Another option is to allow supplemental IFRS reporting, as proposed by the SEC's chief accountant. Allowing firms to choose either U.S. GAAP or IFRS would give them flexibility but could make it challenging for investors to compare firms within the same industry. The choice of accounting standards within industries may lead to easier comparison within the same industry but could complicate comparisons across industries. Larger firms may have more influence over the standards followed by their industry. Firms might switch between standards for better results, similar to tax law provisions. Limiting how often firms can change accounting standards could be considered by Congress and regulators. The SEC or FASB could allow firms to switch financial reporting standards. Another option is for U.S. firms to file under both standards, which may be costly but could aid in transitioning to IFRS. Policymakers could mandate reporting under both standards temporarily before transitioning to IFRS permanently. This could pose challenges for accountants, auditors, and regulators who must understand the nuances of each standard. The adoption of IFRS does not automatically mean IAASB standards would be default in the U.S. SEC and PCAOB could determine auditing standards. Implementation of IAASB must consider legislation like SOX. A U.S. version of International GAAS (I-GAAS) could be created if IFRS is adopted. The SEC's Chief Accountant proposed allowing voluntary disclosure of IFRS financial information as a supplement to U.S. GAAP financial statements. It is unclear if full IFRS financial statements or selected financial data would be reported, and if the supplemental IFRS information should be audited. Including unaudited IFRS statements with SEC filings could attract overseas investors but may mislead investors who expect audited financial statements. The SEC and PCAOB could require disclosure of audited and unaudited financial statements in SEC filings. Mandating all financial information to be audited would increase costs for companies. Alternatively, firms could issue audited IFRS statements independently to attract more investors. This proposal aims to benefit U.S. firms interested in attracting overseas investors. The inclusion of two sets of financial statements in SEC filings could benefit U.S. firms attracting overseas investors, but may confuse investors if values differ. Key definitions include Adoption, Arm's Length, Capital Allocation, and Convergence. Convergence is the process of aligning accounting standards with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Conservatism Principle dictates that losses should be recognized if the probability is high, while gains should only be recognized if the likelihood is low. Due Process ensures fairness in legal matters, protecting both private and public rights. Cost of Capital considers the increased interest from investors. Cost of Capital refers to the potential decrease in a firm's cost of raising capital due to increased investor interest, leading to lower interest rates on debt or higher stock prices. Listed Firms are those listed on stock exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ. Market Liquidity refers to easily tradable assets without significant price changes. Principles-Based Accounting Standards offer decision-making frameworks without specific rules, while Rules-Based Accounting Standards rely on detailed rules for applying accounting principles. \"Accounting principles applied to economic events, widely used to describe U.S. GAAP.
