    "content": "The post-Katrina discussions have focused on the speed of rescue and relief operations. The Department of Defense's response timeline and decision points are being examined to determine if the response could have been accelerated. Procedural obstacles and administrative failures may have delayed the arrival of resources in the affected area. The report examines the Department of Defense's disaster response procedures, the use of the National Guard, funds appropriated, and issues for congressional consideration. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 states that the Secretary of Defense shall provide military support for domestic incidents as directed by the President. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security establish relationships for civil support coordination. DOD provides support when local resources are overwhelmed, as a last resort. The Secretary of Defense has authority over DOD's civil support provision. The Department of Defense, Homeland Defense (ASD/HD) is responsible for civil support coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) handles civil support operations in the United States, creating joint task forces with forces from all armed services. NORTHCOM has a Joint Interagency Coordination Group with liaison officers from DOD components and federal agencies, including DHS. Military Assistance to Civil Authorities includes Military Support to Civil Authorities during natural disasters. Support to Civil Authorities (MSCA) includes assistance during natural disasters, special security events, and man-made incidents with presidential or state emergency declarations. Military Support to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies (MSCLEA) involves support for counterterrorism and counterdrug operations. Military Assistance for Civil Disturbances is when the armed forces help suppress insurrections or riots. The Army Corps of Engineers provides civil support but is not under the supervision of ASD/HD or Northern Command. The ASD/HD or Northern Command provides civil support during emergencies primarily related to water navigation maintenance and flood control. Requests for military assistance must come from a Lead Federal Agency, typically FEMA. The ASD/HD evaluates requests based on legality, readiness, lethality, risk, cost, and appropriateness before forwarding them to the Secretary of Defense for approval. After the Secretary of Defense approves requests, they are sent to the Joint Director of Military Support within the Joint Staff, who then issues orders to Northern Command. A Defense Coordinating Officer (DCO) is deployed to the incident area, with a Joint Task Force (JTF-Katrina) established for large responses like Katrina. The DCO acts as the main contact for DOD resources for other agencies but does not control the Army Corps of Engineers or National Guard in certain statuses. The Corps of Engineers provides emergency support independently but can assist FEMA and JTF-Katrina. The National Response Plan allows for a proactive federal response to catastrophic events designated as Incidents of National Significance. The primary mission is to save lives, protect infrastructure, contain the event, and preserve national security. Requests for assistance may be expedited or suspended in extreme circumstances. The National Response Plan allows for a proactive federal response to catastrophic events designated as Incidents of National Significance. Federal response resources will deploy immediately for life-safety activities without delay in coordination with States. States are encouraged to notify and coordinate with local governments for a proactive Federal response. Collaboration between State, local, and Federal governments is essential for steady-state preparedness for catastrophic incidents. Secretary of Homeland Security Chertoff declared Hurricane Katrina an Incident of National Significance after it made landfall, rendering a proactive federal response under the NRP ineffective. The DOD Joint Homeland Security Doctrine allows for immediate military response to save lives, prevent suffering, or mitigate property damage without prior approval. Secretary Rumsfeld authorized NORTHCOM to respond to a FEMA request for an active hurricane season. Secretary Rumsfeld authorized NORTHCOM to deploy Defense Coordinating Elements (DCE) to FEMA's East Coast and Gulf Coast regions upon written request, specifying area, relief staging areas, funds, date, and duration. DOD began planning and deploying ships and personnel for Hurricane Katrina before specific requests from DHS or FEMA. Homeland Security and FEMA responded to Hurricane Katrina's approach, with NORTHCOM issuing warning orders prior to landfall. Louisiana and Mississippi declared states of emergency, and President Bush declared a federal emergency for Louisiana. NORTHCOM deployed Joint Task Force-Katrina after landfall, and President Bush declared a catastrophic emergency. JTF-Katrina was officially activated, and DHS declared Katrina an Incident of National Significance. Following the declaration of Hurricane Katrina as an Incident of National Significance, DOD medical airlift operations and troop deployments began. By September 7, DOD assets in the affected area included 42,990 National Guard personnel, 17,417 active duty personnel, and various military ships and aircraft. The National Guard has historical roots in colonial militias before the Constitution was adopted. With the adoption of the Constitution, the federal government gained authority over the militia, including the National Guard. The National Guard operates under both state and federal control, with governors able to order personnel to perform \"state active duty\" in response to disasters and civil disorders. National Guard personnel can operate under state control, are paid according to state law, and can perform disaster relief tasks. They are not restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act and can perform law enforcement functions. During Hurricane Katrina, out-of-state National Guard personnel were called to assist in Louisiana and Mississippi, outnumbering personnel from those states. During Hurricane Katrina, out-of-state National Guard personnel were called to assist in Louisiana and Mississippi, outnumbering personnel from those states. These personnel initially operated under state control but were later converted to Title 32 status for federal pay and benefits. Another way they can be activated is under 32 U.S.C. 502(f), allowing them to be ordered to perform additional duties without consent. During Hurricane Katrina, National Guard personnel were called to assist in Louisiana and Mississippi. They operated under state control initially but were later converted to Title 32 status for federal pay and benefits. This allowed them to receive legal protections and remain under the control of their governor. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau requested the retroactive transfer of all National Guard personnel to Title 32 status after Katrina to equalize pay and benefits. The purpose of the request was to equalize pay and benefits for all National Guard personnel, regardless of state laws. Federal funds were approved for National Guard personnel in Title 32 status to support Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. Iowa and Delaware chose not to convert their personnel to Title 32 status due to more beneficial compensation under state law. National Guard personnel can be activated in a federal status under the Insurrection Act, allowing the President to call them into service for various purposes. This includes suppressing insurrection, enforcing federal laws, and preventing interference with state and federal laws. Similar authority is granted under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12406. The President can call National Guard members into federal service under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12406 for various reasons, including repelling invasion, suppressing rebellion, or executing federal laws. National Guard personnel in federal status operate under the President's control, receive federal pay and benefits, and can perform law enforcement duties. They can also be ordered to federal active duty under other provisions of law. However, the usefulness of these authorities for responding to disasters is unclear as they are traditionally used for national security or training. The President can call National Guard members into federal service under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12406 for various reasons, including repelling invasion, suppressing rebellion, or executing federal laws. National Guard personnel in federal status operate under the President's control, receive federal pay and benefits, and can perform law enforcement duties. They can also be ordered to federal active duty under other provisions of law. However, the authorities for responding to disasters have constraints that limit their use for disaster relief operations. The President can call National Guard members into federal service under 10 U.S.C. 12304 for operational missions, with limitations on duties related to disasters, invasions, insurrections, and law enforcement. Certain emergencies like terrorist attacks have exceptions. Activation authorities have advantages and disadvantages for disaster response. Governors retain control over National Guard personnel in state active duty and Title 32 activations, aligning with federalism principles and governors' traditional disaster response role. In disaster response, state control of the National Guard can hinder coordination in multi-jurisdictional events. Federalizing the National Guard could improve efficiency but would limit governors' emergency response capabilities. Calling National Guard into federal service requires exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act or refraining from law enforcement duties. Congress revised statutes to address these challenges. Congress revised statutes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004 to allow certain National Guard officers called to active duty to retain their state commissions when commanding units with both active duty and reserve personnel. This change aimed to address coordination challenges in disaster response and improve efficiency without limiting governors' emergency response capabilities. National Guard officers on active duty can command both active duty and National Guard personnel. This dual-hatted command authority has been utilized at events like the G-8 summit, Democratic convention, Republican convention, and Operation Winter Freeze. The Administration proposed a hybrid command structure for National Guard and active-duty troops in Louisiana, but the governor rejected it. It is unclear if the lack of unified command affected military operations during Katrina. The Department of Defense received $1.9 billion between two supplementals. DOD received $1.9 billion between two supplementals for emergency evacuation and repairs at affected installations. The funds will be used for repairs, evacuation of military personnel and civilians, and mobilization of national guard personnel. FEMA reimburses DOD separately for rescue and relief operations. Damage at defense installations varies from minor to wholesale damage in New Orleans and Mississippi. The President submitted a base closure list to Congress in 2005, including an ammunition plant and Naval Station in Mississippi. The second Katrina supplemental allows DOD to transfer funds for evacuated residents from the U.S. Naval Home to the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home. DOD funds are appropriated to Operation and Maintenance, Defensewide, for various expenses. The appropriators approved the requested amount in both supplementals. The second Katrina supplemental allows DOD to transfer funds for evacuated residents from the U.S. Naval Home to the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home. The language added requires notification to key committees within five days of fund transfers, clarifying hurricane-related expenses from regular military operations. NORTHCOM initiated alert procedures before Katrina's landfall, deploying resources prior to FEMA requests. Speed of rescue and relief operations post-Katrina has been a key focus. The federal catastrophic emergency declaration and Incident of National Significance were declared on August 30, leading to delayed deployments of relief assets due to the storm's path and damage to infrastructure. DOD's response to Hurricane Katrina was incremental, with concerns about airport and highway damage affecting relief asset approach. The activation of JTF-Katrina on August 30 marked a gradual response to the deteriorating situation. The response to Hurricane Katrina was delayed, with the hospital ship USS Comfort not dispatched until August 31 and additional ground forces arriving on September 5. Congress may need to investigate if the delays were due to structural issues in disaster plans or ineffective execution. Questions arise about the National Response Plan and DOD's Joint Homeland Security Doctrine being too rigid, leading to slow responses. The principle that DOD is a supporting agency and last resort resource may have hindered a quicker reaction. The principle that DOD is a supporting agency and last resort resource may hinder proactive disaster response, as it prioritizes national defense over civilian operations. Current doctrine requires other agencies to be overwhelmed before DOD assistance is requested, raising concerns about their ability to assess and request resources effectively. In assessing the response to Katrina, determining reasonable expectations in the face of an unprecedented disaster is crucial. Shortcomings in relief efforts could have been avoided with better planning and execution, while some challenges were unavoidable due to regional infrastructure destruction. Predictability of the hurricane's impact was questioned, with repeated warnings potentially leading to a less proactive response. Governor Blanco's refusal to permit DOD's JTF-Katrina has been a topic of discussion. The controversy surrounding Governor Blanco's refusal to allow DOD's JTF-Katrina to take control of evacuation efforts and the National Guard in Louisiana has raised questions about the balance of state and presidential authority in disaster response. President Bush and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Warner are considering expanding the Department of Defense's role in such situations, including a review of the posse comitatus statute and DOD directives limiting military involvement in law enforcement activities. The use of active duty federal troops remains unclear.

The use of active duty federal troops remains unclear, and the effectiveness of state control over National Guard personnel in relief operations is still uncertain. Command coordination issues between military and civilian components may provide guidance for future operations.

Command coordination issues between military and civilian components may provide guidance for future operations. The availability of equipment, particularly for the National Guard, was a significant issue during relief operations for Katrina, with reports of inadequate numbers of tactical radios and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) due to equipment being left in Iraq by deploying units. The Department of Defense's Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) in early 2006 will consider its responsibilities and capabilities for catastrophic incidents, influenced by the controversies surrounding the federal response to Katrina. Equipment shortages, like tactical radios and vehicles, were noted during Katrina relief operations due to deployments in Iraq. The 101st Air Assault Division was not deployed to Katrina due to its deployment to Iraq. The future role, structure, force-level, and equipping of the National Guard may receive attention due to Katrina's demand on DOD resources. Suggestions have been made to reorganize the National Guard for domestic missions, such as focusing on support functions like logistics, communications, military police, and engineers. These recommendations were previously opposed by the National Guard Bureau. The United States Commission on National Security/21st Century recommended reducing the National Guard's focus on overseas combat deployments and increasing domestic incident capabilities. The National Guard leadership opposed this, emphasizing the importance of maintaining combat capabilities. The need for National Guard troops in Iraq supported their argument. Questions about personnel levels and equipping for civil support may arise, requiring investment to meet expectations. The study of Katrina relief operations could impact the Quadrennial Defense Review. The study of Katrina relief operations may influence QDR recommendations, raising questions about resource availability for simultaneous catastrophic events like Hurricane Ophelia. The potential vulnerability to terrorist attacks post-Katrina and the impact of ongoing operations on response efforts are also important considerations. The study of Katrina relief operations may influence QDR recommendations, raising questions about resource availability for simultaneous catastrophic events like Hurricane Ophelia and how these efforts were affected by ongoing operations on the Gulf Coast."
