    "content": "The \"Soledad Canyon Settlement Act\" is the short title of the Act. It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The Act defines terms such as \"City of Santa Clarita,\" \"City of Victorville,\" \"contracts,\" \"contract holder,\" \"County of San Bernardino,\" \"Map,\" and \"Secretary.\" The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The \"Victorville disposal area\" is a 10,206.05-acre land identified for disposal in the West Mojave Land Management Plan (2006) of the Bureau of Land Management. SEC. 3. APPRAISAL; COMPENSATION TO CONTRACT HOLDER. The Secretary must conduct a mineral appraisal within 90 days of the Act's enactment to determine the fair market value of contracts and the royalties the Federal Government would receive over a 10-year period. The Secretary must assume that the contract holder has all necessary permits and has commenced mining operations with maximum annual production volumes based on supply and demand projections. The Secretary will provide a list of approved appraisers for land appraisal within 90 days to determine the fair market value of the Victorville disposal area. The parties will select an appraiser and cover appraisal costs. The Secretary will offer compensation to the contract holder for canceling contracts, contingent on funds from the sale of the Victorville disposal area. The Secretary will offer compensation to the contract holder for canceling contracts, based on the fair market value of the contracts and projected revenues from the sale of the Victorville disposal area, minus projected lost royalties to the Federal Government over a 10-year period. The Secretary will negotiate compensation with the contract holder and the City of Santa Clarita if projected revenues are less than fair market value, providing amounts equal to the difference in the form of compensation to the contract holder and acceptable compensation to the City. The contract holder has 60 days to accept the compensation offer from the Secretary or negotiated agreement with the City of Santa Clarita. If no acceptance or agreement is reached within this time frame, the contracts will remain in effect with no further action taken. SEC. 4. SALE OF LAND NEAR VICTORVILLE, CALIFORNIA. The Secretary is required to sell the Victorville disposal area within 2 years of the Act's enactment through competitive bidding. A map of the area must be available for public inspection. Local land use authorities have the right to purchase certain land before it is sold. Before a sale of land under subsection (a), the Secretary must provide the local land use authority with a preemptive right to purchase any portion of the land identified as \"Area A\" and \"Area B\" on the Map. This preemptive right is valid for 30 days before the land is sold, allowing the authority to buy some or all of the United States' interest in the land. The local land use authority has the preemptive right to purchase land at fair market value determined by an appraisal. If they exercise this right, they must pay the full purchase price immediately. Failure to pay within the specified time period will terminate their preemptive right. Withdrawal and Reservation: The land described is withdrawn from public land laws, mining laws, and mineral leasing laws. The United States reserves the right to prospect, mine, and remove minerals from the conveyed land. Consultation is required before disposing of the land. Before disposing of land, the Secretary must consult with relevant parties. Proceeds from land sales will be deposited in a designated account for the purposes of implementing the Act. SEC. 5. CANCELLATION OF CONTRACTS. Upon completion of compensating the contract holder for each contract's value, the Secretary will cancel the contracts and withdraw the areas from further mineral entry. The compensation will be provided in 4 equal payments from the account. Contract CA-20139 will be canceled after the first 2 payments, and contract CA-22901 will be canceled after the remaining payments. Upon completion of the remaining 2 payments to contract holder under paragraph (1), the Secretary will cancel contract CA-22901. The Secretary will retain funds to cover projected lost royalties. Upon acceptance of compensation, the contract holder waives all claims against the United States related to contract cancellation."
