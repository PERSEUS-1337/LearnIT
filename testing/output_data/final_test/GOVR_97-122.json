    "content": "The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment has been central in more than 50 Supreme Court cases since 1978, balancing private property rights with societal needs. It ensures that private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation. Initially applied only to condemnation cases, where the government takes property through eminent domain, the focus shifted to determining fair compensation in the late 19th century. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation. Inverse condemnation actions allow property owners to sue the government for compensation when their property is taken or invaded. The key issue in takings actions is whether the government's actions constitute a taking in the constitutional sense, leading to the question of just compensation. The Supreme Court extended takings actions to include regulatory takings in 1922, recognizing that regulatory interferences with property rights can have significant economic consequences. This expansion opened up new legal possibilities for property owners and has influenced takings decisions since the 1970s. Regulatory takings have become more prevalent due to increased federal, state, and local regulation of private land use. Since the early 20th century, there has been extensive regulation of private land use through zoning and various restrictions. The Supreme Court's focus on takings issues intensified in the late 1970s, leading to a shift in the doctrine towards property owners. In the 1980s and 1990s, property owners saw significant victories in takings cases, but the Court's decisions in 2000-2005 marked a change in direction. The Supreme Court's focus on takings issues intensified in the late 1970s, leading to a shift in the doctrine towards property owners. In 2000-2005, the Court's decisions moved in a more government-friendly direction. The four takings cases decided during the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 terms favored the property owner. This report compiles Supreme Court decisions relevant to takings actions, excluding formal condemnation cases like Kelo v. City of New London (2005). Substantive due process decisions are included where cited by the Court in takings cases. No dissenting opinions or concurrences are mentioned for brevity. In 1978, the Supreme Court modernized regulatory takings law by emphasizing three key factors: the economic impact of the regulation, interference with investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government. For a more in-depth analysis of inverse condemnation law, refer to CRS Report RS20741. Since the Penn Central decision, the Supreme Court has refined takings jurisprudence, including criteria for per se takings and a case-by-case approach. Recent decisions emphasize a multifactor approach, recognizing four types of takings claims beyond government appropriations. The Supreme Court has refined takings jurisprudence since the Penn Central decision, recognizing four types of takings claims beyond government appropriations. A plaintiff challenging a government regulation as an uncompensated taking of private property may allege various types of takings, including physical, total regulatory, Penn Central, or land-use exaction violating Nollan and Dolan standards. Regulatory takings can occur without physical invasion or formal appropriation of property, as established in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1922. The Supreme Court's opinions on regulatory takings in the 1870s marked the acknowledgment that the Takings Clause constrains government actions beyond eminent domain. The Court initially believed \"inverse condemnation\" suits were limited to physical invasions or appropriations but later recognized cases involving restrictions on property use. The Supreme Court's opinions in the 1870s acknowledged that the Takings Clause limits government actions beyond eminent domain. Cases involving restrictions on property use were tested under due process, police power, or ultra vires theories."
