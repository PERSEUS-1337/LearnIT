    "content": "The Fair Housing Act (FHA) was enacted in 1968 to prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, and later added sex discrimination in 1974. Amendments in 1988 included protection against physical and mental handicap, familial status. There are ongoing proposals to extend protections to sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, income source, military status, and clarify disparate impact. The report provides an overview of discriminatory practices barred by the Fair Housing Act, legal tests for intentional and disparate impact discrimination claims, and specific types of discrimination such as discrimination against families with children and on the basis of sex, including protections for LGBT individuals. It also addresses the intersection of local zoning laws with fair housing regulations. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on various factors in housing, including race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. It applies to a wide range of housing types and transactions. The report also discusses enforcement of the act, remedies for victims of discrimination, and penalties for violators. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in real estate transactions related to residential properties, including loans, sales, brokering, and appraisals. HUD regulations detail prohibited housing practices such as steering, advertising, misrepresentations, and denial of access to services. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in real estate transactions related to residential properties, including loans, sales, brokering, and appraisals. It is unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with individuals exercising their rights under the FHA. Lawsuits have challenged fair housing practices in public and private housing, including discrimination in low-income public housing. For example, in a 2005 case, African American residents of public housing in Baltimore sued HUD and local agencies for race discrimination, leading to a court ruling against HUD for failing to address racial segregation adequately. The Fair Housing Act exempts certain properties from its regulations, such as single family homes rented or sold by private owners without a real estate agent. Religious groups and private clubs are also allowed to limit occupancy based on religion. The Fair Housing Act exempts certain properties from its regulations, such as single family homes rented or sold by private owners without a real estate agent. Religious groups and private clubs are also allowed to limit occupancy based on religion. Housing for older persons is exempt from discrimination based on familial status, allowing exclusion of families with children. The FHA does not restrict reasonable local, state, or federal occupancy restrictions. In City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc., a group home for adults recovering from addiction violated a city ordinance due to zoning restrictions. The Supreme Court ruled that the city's zoning ordinance violated the Fair Housing Act by not qualifying for the exemption regarding the maximum number of occupants in a dwelling. The ordinance set a numerical ceiling for unrelated occupants but not related occupants, which was deemed to preserve the \"family character\" of the neighborhood. The Supreme Court found that a city's zoning ordinance, which set occupancy limits for unrelated occupants but not related occupants, violated the Fair Housing Act by not qualifying for an exemption. Congress later enacted legislation allowing housing owners to implement reasonable occupancy requirements based on factors such as the number and size of sleeping areas or bedrooms. HUD issued final regulations in July 2015 to implement an FHA mandate aimed at reducing segregation and housing barriers. The regulations require covered entities to assess fair housing issues, use HUD housing data when making decisions, and involve the public in the process. HUD also concluded that a two-person occupancy policy per bedroom is generally reasonable under the FHA. The HUD issued regulations in July 2015 to address fair housing issues and involve the public in housing-related decisions. The regulations require covered entities to assess fair housing issues and use HUD data. FHA discrimination claims can be intentional or based on disparate impact, with different legal tests applied to each. The HUD issued regulations in July 2015 to address fair housing issues and involve the public in housing-related decisions. The regulations require covered entities to assess fair housing issues and use HUD data. FHA discrimination claims can be intentional or based on disparate impact, with different legal tests applied to each. Discrimination claims under the FHA can be supported by direct or indirect evidence, with courts applying different legal tests. Direct evidence shows a specific link between discriminatory animus and the challenged decision, while indirect evidence involves circumstantial evidence. Additionally, a different legal framework is applied to assess disparate treatment claims challenging statutes or local ordinances that discriminate against a protected class. When a plaintiff presents direct evidence of intentional discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove they would have taken the same action regardless. Disparate treatment claims under the FHA are evaluated using the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting scheme, where the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination. This includes showing membership in a protected class, qualification for a housing benefit, and denial of that benefit by the defendant. The defendant must provide evidence that the denial or revocation of housing benefit served a legitimate purpose after the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination. The plaintiff can still succeed on a disparate treatment claim by proving that the stated purpose was a pretext for discrimination. The denial or revocation of housing benefit may be considered a pretext for discrimination if laws differentiate between protected and unprotected groups, leading to claims of intentional discrimination. Plaintiffs can establish intentional discrimination by showing differential treatment of an FHA-protected class. U.S. courts of appeals differ on the disparate treatment tests defendants must meet in such cases. The Eighth Circuit applies a rational basis test for defendants to show a legitimate purpose for classification. The Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits require a more exacting test, showing the justification for discrimination benefits the protected class or relates to public safety tailored to individual concerns. The Supreme Court confirmed this interpretation in a 2015 decision. The FHA prohibits housing-related decisions with a discriminatory effect on a protected class, including disparate impacts that perpetuate segregation. The Supreme Court's ruling in Inclusive Communities affirmed the cognizability of disparate-impact claims under the FHA. The Supreme Court's ruling in Inclusive Communities affirmed that disparate-impact claims under the FHA are cognizable, aligning with HUD's regulations to establish uniform standards for determining when such practices violate the act. The Court adopted a three-step burden-shifting test for analyzing disparate impact cases. The Supreme Court's ruling in Inclusive Communities established a three-step burden-shifting test for analyzing disparate impact claims under the FHA. Defendants can counter a plaintiff's showing by proving a \"valid interest,\" and plaintiffs must demonstrate an available alternative with less impact. The Court emphasized the need for a robust causality requirement to prove that a policy directly led to the disparity. Additionally, limiting factors should be considered when assessing disparate impact claims. The Court emphasized the importance of carefully examining causality evidence in disparate impact claims under the FHA to avoid injecting racial considerations into housing decisions, imposing numerical quotas, and causing unnecessary litigation that could deter housing development for the poor. It may take years to fully understand the impact of the Inclusive Communities decision on future litigation. The Inclusive Communities decision emphasized caution in disparate impact claims under the FHA, potentially leading to fewer successful claims. While the FHA doesn't explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, bills have been introduced to extend protections. Discrimination against the LGBT community can still violate the FHA. The FHA can be violated by discrimination against the LGBT community. Landlords who discriminate based on gender stereotypes may be held liable. HUD recommends amending the FHA for sexual orientation protections and prohibits discrimination in specified programs based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. The 2012 regulations issued by HUD under Section 2 of the Housing Act of 1949 prohibit discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status in specified HUD programs. The FHA also prohibits discrimination based on handicap in housing. The definition of handicap under the FHA includes individuals who have had severe drug or alcohol problems that substantially impair a major life activity, even if they are not current illegal users or addicts. Recovering alcoholics and drug addicts can be considered handicapped. Discrimination on the basis of handicap includes not allowing reasonable changes to a housing unit for handicapped individuals to fully enjoy the premises. Landlords can require changes to be reverted but cannot increase security deposits for these modifications. The FHA protects handicapped persons from discrimination by requiring reasonable accommodations in housing rules and design specifications for accessibility. Landlords cannot increase security deposits for modifications but can require restoration costs to be paid into an escrow account. The Fair Housing Act protects individuals from discrimination based on their disabilities in housing. It is unlawful to inquire about an applicant's handicaps or those of their associates, but certain questions related to disabilities can be asked of all applicants. Other federal laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, also protect individuals with disabilities from housing discrimination. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) covers commercial facilities and prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in federally funded programs. The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 requires certain publicly owned residential buildings to be accessible to individuals with physical disabilities. The Fair Housing Act determines which statute applies to a particular facility regarding discrimination on the basis of handicap. The FHA protects group homes for the disabled from discrimination by certain zoning laws that treat them less favorably. Some municipalities try to restrict the location of these homes through occupancy limits, often affecting group homes for recovering drug users or other disabled individuals. The FHA protects group homes for the disabled from discrimination by certain zoning laws that treat them less favorably, such as occupancy limits that affect group homes for recovering drug users or other disabled individuals. Cities could violate the FHA's reasonable accommodation requirement by refusing to authorize a variance from such ordinances, leading to legal challenges. Determining if zoning ordinances violate the FHA requires a case-by-case assessment, making it difficult to predict court rulings. The Fair Housing Act protects group homes for the disabled from discriminatory zoning laws. Courts have varying standards for evaluating facial discrimination cases, with some requiring a rational relationship to a legitimate purpose and others demanding a more stringent justification beneficial to the disabled or related to public safety. Density restrictions are generally seen as inconsistent with the Fair Housing Act. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that spacing and notification requirements for group homes for the handicapped were discriminatory under the Fair Housing Act. The court required the state to demonstrate that these regulations were warranted by the specific needs of the handicapped individuals, which the state failed to do. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found that spacing and notification requirements for group homes for the handicapped were discriminatory under the Fair Housing Act. The state failed to demonstrate that the regulations were tailored to the specific needs of the handicapped individuals. The group home joint guidance emphasizes the need for reasonable accommodations, which must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Accommodations are considered reasonable unless they impose an undue burden or fundamentally alter the zoning scheme. Examples include allowing a deaf tenant to have a hearing dog in a pet-free apartment complex or providing a variance from an ordinance that prohibits certain actions. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on familial status, with exceptions for housing for older persons. Variances may be granted for group homes of handicapped individuals if they have minimal impact on zoning concerns. The 1988 amendments to the Fair Housing Act provide an exemption for housing for older persons, recognizing the need for tailored environments for senior citizens. This exemption applies to housing provided under state or federal programs for the elderly, housing intended for persons 62 years or older, or housing intended for persons 55 years or older that meets specific requirements. The Fair Housing Act provides an exemption for housing for older persons, with specific requirements such as having at least 80% of units occupied by individuals 55 or older. The Secretary of HUD, the Attorney General, and victims of discrimination can enforce the FHA's protections. HUD has primary enforcement authority through administrative adjudications, while the Department of Justice can also bring actions in federal court. Victims of discrimination have one year to file a complaint with the Secretary. The Fair Housing Act allows for complaints to be filed with the Secretary or initiated by the Secretary. The respondent must answer the complaint within 10 days, and the Secretary has 100 days to investigate. Conciliation may be attempted, and if warranted, a conciliation agreement can be reached. The Secretary must determine if there is reasonable cause to believe discriminatory housing practices have occurred. The Fair Housing Act allows complaints to be filed with the Secretary or initiated by the Secretary. If reasonable cause is found, a charge is filed on behalf of the harmed party. The case may be heard in federal court or by an administrative law judge. The ALJ must conduct a hearing within 120 days and make findings within 60 days after the hearing. The ALJ can order relief for a discriminatory housing practice, including monetary damages and civil penalties. A civil penalty of up to $10,000 can be imposed for a first offense. The Secretary can review the ALJ's orders, and parties can appeal to federal courts. Federal courts can affirm, modify, or set aside orders, and may grant temporary relief. Prevailing parties may receive attorney's fees. The Attorney General can bring a civil action in federal court for housing discrimination violations under the FHA. The court can provide preventive relief, monetary damages, civil penalties, and legal costs to prevailing parties. Individuals using force to interfere with housing rights can face legal action. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, national origin, handicap, sex, religion, or familial status. An \"aggrieved person\" can file a civil action within two years of the discriminatory practice. The court can award punitive damages, actual damages, and equitable relief if discrimination is found. The Attorney General can intervene in private suits of public importance.
