Recovered payments in audits must be returned to the PDP sponsor. Clinical decisions in audits involving professional judgment must involve a licensed pharmacist from the audit state. The pharmacy, practice site, or entity can use various healthcare facility records to validate pharmacy records and legal prescriptions. A valid prescription can be used to validate pharmacy claims during audits, including appeals, while ensuring proper procedures are followed. The PBM or auditing entity must accept pharmacy prescription records in electronic format for audits, without imposing stricter requirements than Federal or State laws. The auditing entity cannot disallow a payment for a claim due to clerical errors if there was no intent to commit fraud, as defined by law. The PBM shall not assess chargebacks if no financial harm to the patient or plan. No extrapolation or statistical techniques allowed in recoupment calculations. Audit period limited to 2 years from claim submission. The PBM or auditing entity must have a written appeals process for pharmacies, allowing a minimum of 60 days to respond to audit findings and the ability to submit documentation for appeals from preliminary and final reports. The PBM must provide a specific reimbursement rate for generics and a process for appealing this rate. The PBM must provide a specific reimbursement rate for generics, which is calculated using the actual amount paid to the pharmacy, excluding the dispensing fee, and must be based on a pharmaceutical pricing benchmark. The rate should include all generics dispensed, regardless of MAC pricing. A PBM must adhere to criteria when handling patient and claims data, including not transmitting data to a pharmacy owned by the PBM without the enrollee's consent. A PBM is prohibited from requiring plan enrollees to use a pharmacy in which the PBM has ownership interest or providing incentives to use such pharmacies. The PBM is prohibited from incentivizing the use of pharmacies in which it has ownership interest. Contracts with PDP sponsors must disclose reimbursement details to pharmacies. Effective January 1, 2015, PBMs must update reimbursement amounts for covered drugs to reflect market prices and disclose methodology to contracted pharmacies."
