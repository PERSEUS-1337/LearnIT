    "content": "The air cargo industry is a complex network connecting manufacturers, shippers, and freight handlers at airports. Although only a small percentage of shipments travel by air, they are typically time-sensitive and high-value items. In 2015, air freight made up 0.05% of all shipments but accounted for 6.1% of their value. Examples of air cargo include machine parts, electronics, jewelry, and perishable goods like flowers and fresh fish. Specialized items like scientific instruments and thoroughbred horses also require air transport. Air cargo, including specialized tools, equipment, and thoroughbred horses, is transported via bulk pallets or unit load devices. Shippers have no control over the route or aircraft used, as determinations are made by freight forwarders and airlines using logistics software. International air cargo relies on hub-and-spoke networks, with most shipments passing through large facilities in Europe and Asia. The air cargo industry experienced rapid growth in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, but saw little growth until 2017 when shipments surpassed pre-recession levels. In 2017, air cargo activity increased by over 10%, with the largest growth in international shipments to and from the United States, especially from Europe. The FAA predicts modest annual increases of about 3% in air cargo shipments over the next two decades, driven by steady economic growth. E-commerce could further boost demand for air freight shipments. In 2016, 22 billion pounds of freight cargo were shipped on domestic flights. In 2016, about 22 billion pounds of freight cargo were shipped on domestic flights, with FedEx and UPS collectively transporting 81% of all domestic air cargo. Additionally, approximately 19 billion pounds of international air cargo were transported to and from the United States, with FedEx and UPS carrying only 13.2% of this cargo. Passenger aircraft play a significant role in transporting air cargo internationally. Passenger aircraft play a greater role in transporting air cargo internationally than domestically. About 38.5% of air cargo on international routes to and from the United States is carried on passenger planes, compared to only 5.5% in the domestic market. This raises security concerns, as cargo shipments could be used to place explosive devices on international passenger flights. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) regulates security of air cargo shipments within the United States, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) oversees international air cargo shipments entering the country. Over the past decade, attention has been focused on securing cargo on passenger aircraft, including nonstop flights from foreign airports to the United States. TSA emphasizes the need for security measures along the cargo supply chain, with a focus on risk-based evaluation and physical screening of shipments. Compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements is essential to address potential threats of introducing explosive devices aboard passenger flights. The concern over the potential use of air cargo to introduce an explosive device aboard a passenger aircraft has led to stricter screening measures. U.S. policy now mandates 100% physical screening for all air cargo traveling within or to the United States on passenger aircraft. All-cargo aircraft are considered less attractive targets for terrorist bombings, and risk-based measures are still applied for vetting shipments on these aircraft. Historically, security measures for air cargo focused on hijackings and suicide attacks. In 1994, a FedEx flight engineer attempted to crash a plane into the company's headquarters. The concern over air cargo security led to stricter screening measures, with 100% physical screening now mandated for air cargo on passenger aircraft. All-cargo aircraft are considered less attractive targets for terrorist bombings. In 1994, a FedEx flight engineer attempted to crash a plane into the company's headquarters. The concern over air cargo security led to stricter screening measures, with 100% physical screening now mandated for air cargo on passenger aircraft. A hijacker attempted to take over a cargo aircraft to San Jose, CA, carrying weapons in a guitar case. The flight crew thwarted the hijacker's attempt, landing in Memphis despite sustaining serious injuries. The threat of explosives in air cargo remains a concern, with terrorists targeting U.S.-bound shipments. Explosive devices were found in packages shipped as air cargo from the UK to the US. The explosives were not initially detected but were found after a tipoff from a member of Al Qaeda. One package was found in England and another on a Qatar Airways passenger jet in Dubai. The packages were bound for the US via different routes. Authorities in the UK discovered explosive devices in air cargo bound for the US, containing PETN explosives capable of catastrophic damage to an airliner. The incidents raised concerns about the security of all-cargo aircraft and the motives behind the attempted attacks. The October 2010 plot revealed challenges in securing air cargo, as explosives were difficult to detect even with inspections using canines and detection equipment. Concerns arose about the effectiveness of routine screening methods and the ability to identify suspicious cargo from unusual sources like Yemen. Multiple international airports and cargo facilities were involved in the incident. The October 2010 plot highlighted challenges in securing air cargo due to difficulties in detecting explosives. The interconnected nature of the international air cargo industry requires collaboration among various stakeholders to address security concerns. A plot in July 2017 to bomb a passenger aircraft in Sydney revealed weaknesses in the air cargo system, emphasizing the need for improved security measures. Turkey to Australia undetected in an air cargo shipment prompted TSA and CBP to mandate 100% screening of air cargo from Turkey to the United States. The complexities of air cargo operations pose security challenges, but also make it less attractive for terrorists. The October 2010 air cargo bomb plot involved a \"dry run\" sending shipments to random Chicago addresses to gather information on setting timers for the bombs. Tracking shipments online provided only basic knowledge for the plotters. The \"insider threat\" to air cargo security has received considerable policy attention due to concerns about targeted attacks by individuals with access and knowledge in the industry. There is a history of organized criminal elements infiltrating air cargo supply chains in the United States, while overseas, there is growing worry about terrorist networks exploiting vulnerabilities in the supply chain. The crash of a Russian charter flight in Egypt in October 2015 has raised concerns about airport and air cargo security. El Sheikh International Airport in Egypt was the site of a bombing on a Russian charter flight in 2015. Investigators identified an airport mechanic as a suspect and two policemen and a baggage handler as possible accomplices. The insider threat to aviation is a recognized issue, with screening of airport workers recommended but not always implemented fully. TSA regulations from 2006 mandate access restrictions to cargo aircraft to deter individuals from introducing weapons or explosives. Cargo operations areas focus on deterring threats like weapons and explosives, with 100% screening of air cargo workers deemed too costly and complex. Efforts to address insider threats center on vetting air cargo and airport workers, including regulated workers and those in the Certified Cargo Screening Program. Most undergo TSA security threat assessments, while those with broader access must pass detailed background checks. Enhancing vetting capabilities is a priority. Enhancing vetting capabilities for cargo workers is crucial for threat detection. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 allow for more detailed records checks, but systematic reviews and improvements in vetting techniques are needed. TSA is also evaluating air cargo security programs in foreign countries and training them in aviation security measures. Ongoing challenges in air cargo and supply chain security include international cooperation and oversight of industry practices. TSA and CBP receive strong cooperation but enforcement overseas is left to other countries, which could lead to disagreements over security standards impacting foreign relations and trade. International air cargo relies on various operators and aircraft, with unscheduled charter service accounting for 13% of U.S. international freight traffic. The majority of international air cargo transits through a small number of major airports overseas before entering the United States. The United States has limited air cargo security measures in place, with a lack of screening requirements for all-cargo aircraft. Only about 50% of international shipments are screened before entering the U.S., and there has been little increase in physically screened cargo. Policy focuses on risk-based measures and vetting protocols rather than universal screening. The focus of U.S. policymakers and industry is on risk-based measures for air cargo security, using vetting protocols based on cargo manifests to identify high-risk cargo. These protocols, which trigger physical screening, are voluntary and not yet industry-wide. TSA acknowledges challenges in screening international cargo due to limited control over supply chains and diplomatic considerations. To address this, TSA developed a risk-based rating system and scheduling tool for prioritizing overseas air cargo facility inspections. In 2008, TSA signed agreements with the European Union and other parties on air cargo security. The TSA has signed agreements with the European Union and other countries on air cargo security, including a bilateral agreement with the EU and a quadrilateral agreement with the EU, Canada, and Australia. They work with ICAO to set global standards for cargo security, focusing on extensive screening and standardization of equipment. Risk-based strategies are used to assess cargo security, with a focus on preventing high-risk cargo from being transported on passenger aircraft and targeting all-cargo shipments for screening based on data provided on the air cargo waybill. The TSA is implementing the Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS) pilot program to screen all-cargo aircraft shipments. Legislation directs TSA to fully implement ACAS for all air cargo inbound to the United States. Known shipper programs are used for pre-screening cargo, developed in the mid-1990s to address compliance concerns. Key concerns raised by industry experts and Congress include the need for increased compliance with guidelines for shipping hazardous materials and deterring terrorists from using cargo for explosives. Congressional hearings after the 1996 ValuJet crash emphasized the importance of a comprehensive inspection program for air cargo safety. Recommendations from the FAA's Aviation Security Advisory Committee and the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security aimed to strengthen air cargo safety and security. The FAA implemented known shipper programs for air cargo security, which were later transferred to TSA with the passage of the ATSA in 2001. TSA established an industry-wide known shipper database in 2006 to vet shipments on passenger aircraft, ensuring only approved shippers can send cargo on these flights. H.R. 4176 would require TSA to review regulations on cargo placed on passenger aircraft, considering that all cargo now undergoes physical screening. The air cargo industry has opposed 100% screening, advocating for a risk-based system that prioritizes security risks and resources. The air cargo industry has advocated for a risk-based screening system that focuses on threat assessment, targeting capabilities, and incentives for shippers to enhance supply chain security. This approach aligns with TSA's former strategic plan before the mandate for 100% cargo screening on passenger aircraft. Industry recommendations include increased use of canine explosives detection teams, enhanced supply chain security, targeting based on CBP's Automated Targeting System, and accelerated research on security technologies. The air cargo industry advocates for risk-based screening focusing on threat assessment, targeting capabilities, and incentives for shippers to enhance security. CBP's \"advance manifest rule\" requires carriers to submit cargo information four hours before arrival in the US. Concerns arise regarding the timing of manifest analysis for high-risk cargo on inbound international flights. Flights from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean require manifest information before departure. CBP and TSA have increased notification requirements for flights from specific Middle Eastern airports. Under an emergency order issued by TSA, airlines must provide shipment information to CBP before loading cargo on U.S.-bound flights from specific Middle Eastern airports. This order affects flights departing from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The October 2010 attempted bombing incidents raised concerns about the adequacy of current manifest screening requirements for U.S.-bound flights. Congress may seek additional information on improving targeting capabilities through earlier transmittal of manifest information. Following the October 2010 incidents, TSA implemented additional screening measures for high-risk inbound international air cargo. Factors used to assess risk include country of origin, sender and recipient data, and other shipment characteristics. CBP and TSA are collaborating on the pilot testing of the Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS) system, initiated in response to the 2010 incidents. The Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS) system was initiated in response to October 2010 incidents and formalized in October 2012. The pilot program, extended multiple times, involves freight forwarders and airlines submitting cargo manifest data earlier than the regulatory requirement. CBP and TSA aim to determine the necessary data elements and timing for effective targeting. Despite slow progress towards industry-wide regulation, the concept has industry support and active participation. The Aviation Security Advisory Committee expressed concerns about the ACAS program in 2016, noting inadequate testing and resources from TSA. H.R. 2825 and H.R. 4176 propose regulations for risk-based vetting of high-risk cargo in inbound international air cargo. TSA faces challenges in overseeing foreign airports and off-airport air cargo facilities, suggesting the adoption of international standards for security. The TSA evaluates foreign air cargo security programs to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. Over 40 countries, including EU members, Japan, Canada, and China, have been found to meet these requirements. Efforts to enhance air cargo security focus on sharing timely shipment information for risk assessment. Harmonizing security data standards could make initiatives like the voluntary ACAS program a mandatory regulatory standard. The logistics industry is working to improve supply chain quality management and enhance air cargo security. Efforts involve better monitoring and tracking of shipments, with potential direct security benefits. Cooperative efforts with industry and international partners are key to achieving further improvements in air cargo security. Some policymakers argue for more comprehensive cargo screening to align with passenger and baggage screening standards, leading to incremental increases in physically screened cargo mandated by Congress post-9/11. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated 100% physical screening and inspection of all cargo on passenger aircraft by August 2010. Various screening methods were specified, but the act did not specify who should conduct the screening. TSA has interpreted the language to allow for approved methods beyond X-ray systems, explosives detection systems, and physical searches. The TSA has allowed airlines, freight forwarders, and other parties to conduct off-airport cargo screening to meet the 100% physical screening mandate. This approach, implemented through the Certified Cargo Screening Program, shifts the operational costs to industry stakeholders. The ability of airlines and freight forwarders to pass on these costs to shippers and consumers is a potential concern for Congress. The requirement to screen 100% of air cargo on passenger flights may disadvantage passenger airlines compared to all-cargo carriers. Screening challenges exist due to a lack of suitable technologies, leading to screening at the piece level in the supply chain. Screening pallets and containers can be complex, requiring shipments to be broken down for individual screening. The Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP) aims to simplify the screening process for air cargo by allowing it to be screened at various facilities before being tendered to air carriers or freight forwarders. TSA must approve screening procedures and supply chain security measures to prevent tampering with shipments. The program is voluntary, but widely adopted in the industry, with over 1,000 facilities certified by late August 2010. Cargo screening facilities and shippers are certified under the CCSP program. Employers must allow TSA to conduct security threat assessments on workers with access to air cargo. TSA anticipates collecting $5.2 million in fees in FY2018. Detection systems approved for screening air cargo are adaptations of technologies used for checked baggage. None of these devices are approved for screening palletized cargo. The limitations of explosives detection systems in air cargo screening have led to reliance on explosives trace detection and canine teams. Screening palletized cargo, which makes up 75% of all cargo on passenger planes, remains a challenge due to the lack of approved technology for screening pallets. This results in off-airport screening of cargo and reliance on supply-chain security measures to prevent tampering. Imaging systems at seaports and border crossings use various technologies to scrutinize cargo, but they are not suitable for air cargo due to limitations in threat detection capabilities. Neutron beam technologies offer automated explosives detection for containerized and palletized cargo, with a pilot program at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2005. The analysis scanner installed at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2005 for $8 million was meant to automatically screen cargo for various threats based on sub-atomic properties. Despite high detection rates, the pilot program was suspended in 2007 due to financial reasons. The technology is used in Singapore, Hong Kong, and El Paso, TX, but its high cost and large footprint have hindered its use in the air cargo industry. The current focus is on expanding the use of computed tomography (CT) technology for screening air cargo to improve security in the supply chain. H.R. 4176 proposes a pilot program to test CT technology and integrate it into domestic and international air cargo operations. CT systems have been limited in the past due to cost and size constraints, but mass spectrometry technology could offer an alternative for detecting explosive vapors. Technologies using mass spectrometry for analyzing explosive vapors show promise for efficient cargo screening. TSA has trained over 650 canine explosives detection teams deployed by law enforcement agencies, with TSA also having its own canine teams at busy airports. These teams dedicate 25% of their time to air cargo screening. TSA focuses on screening large bulk cargo at busy airports and has a program to approve explosives detection canine teams in foreign countries for aviation security. Canine programs in several countries have received TSA recognition. There is interest in deploying TSA-approved third-party canine teams for air cargo screening, but this concept was put on hold after a 2011 pilot project. TSA is now exploring options to reevaluate this concept. TSA is exploring options to reevaluate standards for third-party explosives detection canine teams for air cargo screening. Air cargo operators must adhere to TSA-approved security programs, including access control measures, background checks, and security training. Passenger airlines must implement TSA's Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program for transported cargo. The TSA-approved security programs for air cargo include the Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program for large freight aircraft, the Twelve-Five Standard Security Program for smaller cargo shipments, and the Indirect Air Carrier Standard Security Program for domestic freight forwarders. Additionally, the Certified Cargo Screening Program allows other components of the air cargo network to voluntarily participate in supply chain security measures. Options for preventing and detecting tampering in cargo shipments include tamper-evident packaging, cargo tracking technologies, and identifiers for screened cargo. Utilizing tamper-evident tapes and security measures at facilities can deter the introduction of explosives into air cargo. These measures are crucial for the TSA's Certified Cargo Screening Program to ensure the integrity of items from screening to loading onto aircraft. Tamper-evident seals and locks are used at cargo handling facilities for added security. Electronic seals with alarms are used on cargo containers to prevent theft and tampering. However, their limited transmission range may restrict their effectiveness outside of warehouse environments. The air cargo industry relies on tracking technologies like GPS and RFID for processing and security purposes. These technologies can help identify suspicious activities during transit. The use of tracking technologies like bar code scanning, RFID tags, and GPS trackers in the supply chain helps log shipments and detect anomalies for security purposes. RFID is suitable for tracking items in facilities, while GPS is ideal for tracking items in transit. These technologies can also aid in risk-based screening and security measures. The TSA uses identifiers like stickers, stamps, and tags to designate screened cargo for shipment on passenger aircraft. The security of these identifiers is crucial to prevent unscreened cargo from being passed off as screened. Additional safeguards, such as tracking screened status in shipping databases and allowing authorized individuals to access details through bar code scanning, can help validate the status of security-screened shipments. In-flight air cargo security focuses on preventing hijackings and bombings. Measures include protecting cockpit access, arming pilots, and considering blast-resistant cargo containers. Some cargo aircraft have hardened cockpit doors, but many do not. Protective barriers like metal gates are also used. The Saracini Aviation Safety Act of 2017 proposes installing protective barriers on all commercial transport aircraft, including cargo planes, to enhance cockpit security. United Airlines previously installed secondary barriers on some passenger aircraft but has not equipped replacement planes. Currently, no U.S. air carrier aircraft have these barriers. The FAA reauthorization measures in the House and Senate focus on installing secondary cockpit barriers on newly manufactured aircraft for passenger air carriers. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 allowed pilots to receive firearms training, but initially excluded all-cargo pilots from the program. In 2003, the statute was amended to include all-cargo pilots and flight engineers. Air carriers have been hesitant to participate in the program due to liability concerns. The FFDO program, funded at $25 million annually since FY2004, faces challenges such as liability concerns, training site convenience, restricted firearm carriage, and the dual role of federal flight deck officers. Congress has resisted funding cuts and may address these issues in the future. Blast-resistant cargo containers are being considered as an alternative security measure. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying blast-resistant cargo containers on passenger aircraft to mitigate in-flight explosion consequences. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 required TSA to establish a pilot program with incentives for airlines to participate. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 directed TSA to evaluate and implement a program for hardened cargo containers. The 9/11 Commission recommended blast-resistant cargo containers for passenger aircraft, but no program has been initiated due to industry skepticism over costs and limited cargo space reinforcement. The 9/11 Commission recommended blast-resistant cargo containers for passenger aircraft, but industry skepticism over costs and limited cargo space reinforcement has prevented any program initiation. Hardened containers were designed for long-haul wide-body aircraft, not universally compatible with narrow-body aircraft, limiting their utility. Lighter bomb-resistant bags may offer a viable alternative. Lighter bomb-resistant bags tested in the UK could be an alternative to blast-resistant cargo containers for air cargo security. Concerns arise over TSA's ability to oversee domestic and international air cargo security programs due to budget cuts and managerial changes. The Air Cargo Security Improvement Act of 2017 proposes the creation of an air cargo security office to address these challenges. Budget constraints may impact TSA's regulatory effectiveness. TSA's ability to regulate air cargo security may be impacted by budget cuts and staffing reductions. Funding for Air Cargo Security in FY2017 was $91 million, down from $123 million in FY2010. TSA currently has 615 full-time equivalent positions for air cargo oversight, conducting 3,000 random security inspections monthly. The agency also assesses cargo vulnerability at major airports. The decrease in funding and staffing for air cargo operations reflects cost-saving measures and a shift to other priorities, such as passenger screening. TSA's role is to ensure regulatory compliance among air carriers and freight forwarders, as well as shippers participating in the Certified Cargo Screening Program. Reducing security-related costs to industry is a challenge. Legislative language in the 115th Congress aims to address industry's security-related costs by requiring CBP to establish an Air Cargo Advance Screening program and TSA to develop standards for third-party canine cargo screening. This includes mandating physical inspection of high-risk air cargo before loading onto U.S.-bound aircraft. The bill proposes establishing a formal air cargo security office within TSA, reviewing existing regulations governing the CCSP, implementing a pilot program for CT screening of air cargo on passenger aircraft, and conducting a comprehensive review of TSA's approach to air cargo security."
