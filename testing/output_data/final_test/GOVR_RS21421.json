    "content": "The practice of mountaintop removal mining involves removing the top of a mountain to extract coal seams. This type of surface mining occurs in a 12 million-acre area across several states. Explosives are used to break the rock, and earth-moving equipment removes the spoil. Federal law requires excess spoil to be placed back in the mined areas, but this is often not achievable with mountaintop removal mining due to the increased volume of broken rock. Mountaintop removal mining generates excess spoil fills due to increased volume of broken rock, leading to stability concerns with spoil piles. Excess spoil is typically placed in valley fills, burying streams and creating wide, mile-long fills in Appalachia. This technique has been practiced since the 1960s and is prevalent in central regions. Mountaintop removal mining became prevalent in central Appalachia during the 1990s due to increased demand for clean-burning coal and depletion of surface coal supplies. The use of large surface mining equipment also contributed to its popularity. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows a 62% decrease in coal production at mines with mountaintop removal permits in Central Appalachia since 2008. The number of permits has also decreased by 37%. Mountaintop removal coal mining declined in West Virginia and Kentucky by 60% and 75% respectively from 2008-2014, while production in Virginia increased by 24%. Excess spoil from mining was placed in headwaters of streams, impacting ephemeral streams. Stream fills can now reach 250 million cubic yards, leading to stream elimination, chemical harm, and aquatic life impairment. EPA estimated that almost 1,200 miles of Appalachian streams were buried by surface coal mining from 1992 to 2010. The cumulative effects of surface coal mining operations include deforestation, accelerated sediment transport, increased algal production, and possible human health impacts. Regulation of valley fills associated with mountaintop removal mining falls under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the Clean Water Act, involving federal and state agencies with separate regulatory programs and permitting requirements. The Clean Water Act focuses on regulating discharges into waters of the United States, while the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act regulates a broad range of environmental impacts of surface coal mining. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) regulates environmental impacts of surface coal mining operations, including necessary approvals, inspection, and enforcement until reclamation is completed. SMCRA permits are issued by the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement or qualified states, ensuring compliance with performance standards for mining activities. These standards address disturbances at mine sites, water quality and quantity, and require reclamation to restore mined areas to their original state. Surface-mined areas must be reclaimed to resemble the original land configuration. Variance from this standard is allowed for mountaintop removal mining under certain conditions. The Clean Water Act (CWA) prohibits pollutant discharge into US waters without a permit from either the NPDES program (administered by the EPA) or the dredge and fill permit program (administered by the Corps). Mountaintop removal mining requires both permits for overburden discharge and mining activities. The Clean Water Act requires permits for pollutant discharge into US waters, with the NPDES program focusing on industrial operations and sewage treatment plants. Section 402 permits set effluent limitations based on pollution control technology and state water quality standards. The Corps and EPA work together for the Section 404 permit program, with the Corps issuing permits for mining activities. The Corps issues permits under Section 404 for the discharge of dredged or fill material, following environmental guidelines set by the EPA. The permits consider the full public interest by balancing the impacts of proposed activities on conservation, economics, flood hazards, land use, navigation, energy, mineral needs, and public welfare. The Corps has discretion in evaluating each permit application based on these factors. Section 404 permits are issued by the Corps for dredged or fill material discharge, considering factors like water quality degradation, environmental impact mitigation, and alternative options. Permits can be individual or nationwide, depending on the level of impact on US waters. Individual permits are required for discharges with more than minimal impacts. Nationwide permits cover a majority of Corps permits, with less regulatory burden than individual permits. NWP 21 allows disposal of excess overburden from mountaintop removal mining with minimal impacts. Its use in the Appalachian region has been controversial and faced litigation. The Obama Administration imposed new restrictions on NWP 21, prohibiting its use for constructing valley fills. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is involved in mountaintop removal mining by enforcing laws related to endangered species and consulting on projects affecting U.S. waters. Critics argue that valley fills from this mining practice destroy streams and wildlife habitats by altering flow regimes. Mountaintop removal mining causes environmental damage such as altered flow regimes, degraded water quality, cracked walls of nearby homes, dust, noise, and vibration from blasting, collapsed drinking water wells, and destroyed streams. It also leads to the relocation of communities. Environmental groups argue against valley fills under Section 404, stating that mining overburden pollutes waterways. The mining industry argues that mountaintop removal is necessary for surface coal mining in Appalachia due to the poor stability of the soil. The stability of the soil in the region makes underground coal mining impossible. Waste disposal in valley fills is necessary due to the steep topography. Critics challenge mountaintop removal mining permits, leading to regulatory changes. In 1998, a West Virginia citizen group sued the state and the Corps for failure to enforce environmental regulations related to mountaintop removal mining. The lawsuit focused on violations of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the Clean Water Act. As a result, federal agencies agreed to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement on the effects of mountaintop removal mining. The Corps agreed that proposed valley fills in West Virginia must be permitted individually for watersheds of at least 250 acres. A 1999 ruling reclassified mining spoil as \"waste material,\" subject to stricter CWA Section 402 permit requirements. A district court ruling was overturned on jurisdiction and state sovereignty grounds, stating that the stream buffer regulation was a matter of state, not federal law. In 2005, federal agencies released a final PEIS on the impacts of mountaintop removal mining and valley fills, offering three alternatives for improving regulatory coordination. The preferred alternative involved joint permit applications by OSM, the Corps, EPA, and state agencies to determine the size, number, and location of valley fills for proposed operations. The Corps would determine if a project falls under NWP 21 or an individual Section 404 permit. Over 70,000 public comments were received on the draft PEIS. Industry groups supported general permit authorizations, while environmental groups criticized the lack of limits on mountaintop removal mining. Agencies defended the alternatives in the programmatic EIS, stating they would enhance environmental protection. Changes to agency rules and guidelines were promised in response to feedback. Following controversies over proposed changes to regulations implementing CWA Section 404, the EPA and Corps aimed to redefine \"fill material\" and \"discharge of fill material\" to align with the Administration's stance on mountaintop removal mining. The proposal, initially introduced in 2000, was finalized in May 2002 by the Bush Administration, intending to provide clarity on regulatory definitions determining permit requirements under Section 404. The Clinton and Bush Administrations aimed to address confusion by revising definitions related to surface mining activities under CWA Section 404. Environmental groups argue that the revised rules inadequately regulate disposal activities, including coal mining waste. Senate oversight hearings were held to examine the changes. The 2003 draft PEIS called for changes to the stream buffer zone rule to align with the Clean Water Act. OSM proposed rule changes in 2004, prepared a new PEIS and revised rule in 2007, and issued a final revised buffer zone rule in 2008. The final rule required coal mining operations to minimize spoil outside the mined area and avoid disturbing streams and lands within 100 feet. The 2008 revised rule required coal mining operations to avoid disturbing streams and lands within 100 feet, with a focus on minimizing adverse impacts on fish, wildlife, and environmental values. The rule acknowledged that in some cases, placement of coal mine waste near streams may be unavoidable. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) clarified that the new rule regarding mountaintop removal mining activities should not lead to water quality violations. The rule aims to align with the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) rather than the Clean Water Act (CWA). Despite concerns from industry and environmental groups, the final rule is seen as maintaining the status quo of disposing mining spoil into valleys and streams. Critics argue that the rule may weaken environmental protections by making it easier for coal mine operators to obtain exemptions from stream buffer zone requirements. In 2009, the Obama Administration requested to vacate the 2008 stream buffer zone rule due to inadequate water quality and stream habitat protection. The court rejected the request, but in 2014, it ruled the rule violated the Endangered Species Act and vacated it. OSM withdrew the rule in December 2014. In 2009, the Obama Administration requested to vacate the 2008 stream buffer zone rule due to inadequate water quality and stream habitat protection. The court rejected the request, but in 2014, it ruled the rule violated the Endangered Species Act and vacated it. OSM withdrew the rule in December 2014. Controversies over OSM's revisions continued despite the withdrawal. In a separate litigation in Kentucky, a federal court ruled in 2002 that waste disposal from mountaintop removal mining into U.S. waters is not allowed under Section 404. In 2007, federal court overturned permits for mountaintop removal mining in West Virginia due to significant adverse impacts of valley fills. The Corps' mitigation plans were deemed insufficient, but in 2009, the court of appeals reversed the decision, finding the Corps' evaluation and mitigation plans sufficient under NEPA. The court of appeals ruled in favor of the Corps, allowing resumption of permitting activities in Appalachia. Environmental advocacy groups continue to challenge permits for surface coal mining projects in the region, particularly in West Virginia and Kentucky. Lawsuits have been filed to stop the Corps' use of Nationwide Permit 21 for mountaintop removal mining operations. The court ruled that NWP 21 violates the Clean Water Act by allowing activities with adverse environmental effects. The Corps was ordered to revoke previous authorizations for mountaintop removal mining in West Virginia. However, on appeal, the court found that the Corps had complied with the Clean Water Act. In a separate case, a district court ruled that the Corps' analysis of cumulative impacts for NWP 21 was inadequate. The court enjoined the Corps from using NWP 21 for mountaintop removal mining in West Virginia. The court decision requires halting mining operations under NWP 21 in West Virginia and Kentucky. Companies can seek individual permits or appeal. A federal appeals court invalidated the use of NWP 21 due to inadequate environmental review procedures. Environmental groups praised the court's criticism of the Corps' actions. In 2009, the Obama Administration announced administrative actions on surface coal mining operations in Appalachia, including NWP 21. In 2009, the Obama Administration took administrative actions on surface coal mining operations in Appalachia, including reviewing CWA Section 404 permit applications and signing a Memorandum of Understanding with EPA, the Corps, and the Department of the Interior. The Interior signed a Memorandum of Understanding and Interagency Action Plan to reduce environmental impacts of surface coal mining in Appalachia. The plan includes near-term and longer-term actions for improved coordination and transparency. Some actions have faced congressional criticism and legal challenges. EPA and the Corps also signed an agreement to expedite permit reviews for mining operations in Appalachia. EPA identified 79 projects for additional evaluation. EPA and the Corps developed a joint Enhanced Coordination Procedure (ECP) for evaluating 79 permit applications for mining projects in Appalachia. 50 applications were withdrawn, 8 permits were issued, and reviews were ongoing for the remaining projects. EPA stated that each project is likely to harm water quality. The EPA and Corps developed the Enhanced Coordination Procedure (ECP) for evaluating 79 permit applications for mining projects in Appalachia. 8 permits were issued, 2 had recommendation letters sent, and 1 was under review. The remaining 18 permits in Kentucky and West Virginia were pending, awaiting additional information. Coal industry groups and state officials challenged the ECP process in federal court, arguing it caused costly delays and violated regulations. They disputed the transfer of regulatory authority from the Corps to EPA and the screening process for permits subject to the ECP. In October 2011, the federal district court struck down the Enhanced Coordination Procedure (ECP) and the MCIR Assessment as an unlawful transfer of legal authority from the Corps to EPA. The Corps and EPA issued memoranda clarifying their roles moving forward, with the Corps continuing to process applications in accordance with permitting regulations and EPA Regions collaborating with the Corps. The 2008 stream buffer zone rule was addressed in a June 2009 MOU and IAP. The Department of the Interior requested a federal court to vacate the rule issued by the Bush Administration, but the court rejected the request, leaving the 2008 rule in place. Most states are still operating under the 1983 rule due to litigation over the 2008 revisions. In February 2014, a federal court vacated the 2008 rule due to OSM's failure. In February 2014, a federal court vacated the 2008 rule due to OSM's failure to consult with federal wildlife agencies. OSM identified regulatory options for revisions to the rule in November 2009, including stricter buffer zone requirements for mountaintop removal mining operations. OSM officials began developing a new rule and draft EIS, which would apply nationwide. Efforts to revise the rule have faced criticism for potential economic impacts and EIS quality, but OSM and environmental groups argue that a new rule is necessary to protect waterways from surface mining operations. The Stream Protection Rule proposed by OSM in July 2015 aims to protect waterways from coal mining activities nationwide. It expands beyond the existing stream buffer zone rules to cover the entire mine permit area. While not the most environmentally stringent option, it includes new requirements for baseline data collection and reclamation plans. The 2015 proposed Stream Protection Rule by OSM aims to protect waterways from coal mining activities nationwide. Stakeholder reactions varied, with mining industry groups criticizing the rule and environmental groups calling for stronger protections. OSM issued a final environmental impact statement for the rule in November 2016, indicating a final rule could be imminent. The Obama Administration's rules on stream buffer zones may remain in place if not overturned by the new administration or Congress. The Corps has allowed excess overburden disposal in mountaintop removal mining under Nationwide Permit 21, with proposed modifications to restrict its use in the Appalachian region. The Corps proposed to temporarily suspend NWP 21 for surface coal mining activities in the Appalachian region to quickly halt its use there. This would require evaluation through the Corps' individual permit review process, allowing for increased public and agency involvement. The Corps suspended the use of NWP 21 in the Appalachian region in June 2010 as an interim measure. Activities verified by the Corps before June 18, 2010, would continue until March 18, 2012. Approximately six operations were affected and had to apply for individual permits. In 2012, the Corps reissued all nationwide permits, including NWP 21 with modifications. The reissued NWP 21 in 2012 added limits for stream bed loss and prohibited its use for valley fills in surface coal mining. The mining industry criticized EPA for delays in permit reviews, impacting jobs and energy security. In 2010, EPA released interim guidance to strengthen environmental review of surface coal mining permits in Appalachia, aiming to clarify applicable criteria and tighten requirements without halting mountaintop removal mining. The EPA released guidance in 2010 to improve environmental review of surface coal mining permits in Appalachia, emphasizing minimal or zero filling of valleys with mining debris and setting strict limits on conductivity levels in affected waters. Conductivity levels can harm aquatic organisms as they rise. EPA has used this guidance in reviewing permit applications since late 2010, citing scientific evidence in comments and objections to coal mining projects in Kentucky and West Virginia. The EPA's 2010 guidance emphasized minimal filling of valleys with mining debris and strict limits on conductivity levels in Appalachian streams to protect aquatic life. Elevated total dissolved solids and conductivity levels from surface coal mining operations can adversely impact water quality. EPA set a limit of 500 \u00b5S/cm for conductivity in central Appalachia to prevent water quality violations. Environmental groups support this approach, while industry groups criticize it as arbitrary and uncertain. EPA sought public input for possible future changes. The EPA's 2010 guidance emphasized minimal filling of valleys with mining debris and strict limits on conductivity levels in Appalachian streams to protect aquatic life. Elevated total dissolved solids and conductivity levels from surface coal mining operations can adversely impact water quality. EPA set a limit of 500 \u00b5S/cm for conductivity in central Appalachia to prevent water quality violations. The EPA interim guidance also referenced two draft reports produced by EPA's Office of Research and Development that were used in preparing the guidance. EPA sought public comment to inform possible future changes. EPA's Science Advisory Board conducted evaluations of the EPA scientific documents and agreed with EPA's overall conclusions. The EPA's Science Advisory Board agreed with EPA's conclusions on the causal relationship between mountaintop removal mining/valley fills and harm to downstream water quality and biological impacts. The panel recommended strengthening comments on EPA draft documents, including setting a benchmark to avoid native species extinction in Appalachian streams. The Science Advisory Board supported the idea of developing a more protective conductivity benchmark to address the ecological effects of mining in Appalachian streams. They emphasized that conductivity and total dissolved solids are indicators of water quality but should not be used exclusively as surrogates. The Science Advisory Board supported using conductivity as an indicator of water quality, cautioning against over-reliance on it. EPA released final reports in 2011 after controversy over the 2010 interim guidance, with environmental advocates supporting it for stream protection from coal mining effects, while industry and some states opposed it, leading to lawsuits. The EPA released final guidance in 2011 for Appalachian surface coal mining operations, maintaining numeric limits on conductivity. The guidance incorporates flexibility based on public comments and experience since 2010, with specific conductivity limits recommended only for waters in West Virginia and Kentucky. The final document acknowledges the need for scientific verification before applying these limits to other waters. The final guidance for Appalachian surface coal mining operations in 2011 maintained conductivity limits with flexibility. EPA may suggest alternative permit conditions if strict limits cannot be met. Environmental groups support the guidance, while industry groups argue against EPA's expanded authority. In 2012, a federal judge ruled in favor of mining industry and state plaintiffs, stating that the guidance is not nonbinding as claimed by the government. The district court found that the guidance for Appalachian surface coal mining projects is being implemented as binding, affecting the permitting process. It was ruled that the guidance overstepped state authority by setting a conductivity criterion for water quality standards. The court's decision was appealed and overturned in 2014, with the court rejecting claims of EPA overstepping its authority in coordinating with the Corps during the permit process. The challenge to the conductivity guidance was dismissed as it was not considered a final agency action subject to judicial review. The court ruling declared that the guidance for Appalachian surface coal mining projects is voluntary and does not compel regulated entities to take any action. If a future permit is denied based on noncompliance with the guidance, the applicant can seek judicial review. EPA is directed to issue environmental guidelines for evaluating permit applications under CWA Section 404. EPA also has the authority to restrict the discharge of dredged or fill material if it determines the activity will have unacceptable adverse effects. In January 2011, EPA vetoed a permit for a mountaintop removal mining operation in West Virginia due to its significant environmental impact. The Spruce No. 1 mine would have buried over 7 miles of streams, impacted forestland, and degraded water quality. EPA has used its veto authority under Section 404(c) only 13 times since 1972, with none previously involving surface coal mining projects. EPA vetoed a permit for a mountaintop removal mining operation in West Virginia due to environmental concerns, including impacts on wildlife and water quality. The project had been modified to reduce impacts, but EPA determined it could still result in unacceptable adverse effects. The veto has been controversial, as it involved cancelling a permit previously issued by the Corps and has raised concerns about water quality uncertainty. The Mingo Logan Coal Company challenged EPA's veto of a permit for a mountaintop removal mining operation in West Virginia. A federal court ruled that EPA does not have the authority to invalidate a permit once issued by the Corps. EPA argued that the veto was justified due to unacceptable environmental impacts, but the court disagreed. In 2013, a federal appeals court upheld EPA's authority to retroactively veto Section 404 permits, stating that there is no temporal limit on the Administrator's authority to withdraw permits. The Supreme Court denied petitions to review the ruling, causing displeasure among industry and environmental advocates over the Obama Administration's actions on mountaintop removal mining. The coal industry and its supporters are upset by more stringent permit scrutiny and EPA's veto of a project. Environmental groups support the veto but want even stricter regulations on mountaintop removal mining. The Obama Administration's actions on Appalachian surface mining have faced mixed results in federal courts. EPA's authority was challenged in the development of permitting guidance and the veto of the Spruce No. 1 mine permit, with court rulings being overturned on appeal. Congressional interest in these issues has grown, leading to the introduction of bills addressing regulatory definitions and mountaintop removal mining. Legislation such as H.R. 1837, the Clean Water Protection Act, aims to reverse regulations defining \"fill material\" and restrict mountaintop removal. The Clean Water Protection Act (H.R. 1837) aims to restrict mountaintop removal mining by excluding certain pollutant discharges from the definition of \"fill material.\" Legislation like H.R. 5077 seeks to codify the current regulatory definition of fill material. The 113th Congress also included provisions to prevent the Corps from developing or implementing revised regulations on fill material definitions. The Clean Water Protection Act aims to restrict mountaintop removal mining by excluding certain pollutant discharges from the definition of \"fill material.\" Legislation has been proposed to codify the current regulatory definition of fill material, and provisions have been included in Congress to prevent the Corps from revising these definitions. EPA's veto of a Section 404 permit for the Spruce No. 1 mine in West Virginia has sparked controversy, leading to proposed legislation to remove EPA's authority to veto permits. Legislation was introduced in the 113th Congress to prohibit EPA from vetoing a project retroactively, specifically from using the 404(c) authority after the Corps has issued a permit. Another bill was introduced to limit 404(c) actions by barring EPA from issuing retroactive vetoes. In the 113th Congress, legislation was introduced to restrict EPA's 404(c) veto authority by prohibiting retroactive vetoes after a permit is issued by the Corps. Another bill aimed to limit 404(c) actions by preventing EPA from issuing retroactive vetoes. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to restrict EPA's 404(c) veto authority by prohibiting retroactive vetoes after a permit is issued by the Corps. Legislation such as S. 55 / S. 234, H.R. 896, and H.R. 1203 were discussed in oversight hearings by various House subcommittees in 2011 and 2012. The House Natural Resources Committee also held hearings on OSM's controversial efforts to revise the 2008 stream buffer zone rule, with concerns raised about potential job impacts on surface coal mining. In 2014, the House passed H.R. 2824 to limit the Secretary of the Interior's authority to issue a revised rule for at least five years. Legislation in the 114th Congress, H.R. 1644 / S. 1458, aimed to prevent OSM from releasing a revised stream buffer rule pending a study by the National Research Council on economic and scientific data in the rule. Additionally, H.R. 912 proposed a partial moratorium on mountaintop removal mining until health effects studies are completed. In the 114th Congress, legislation aimed to prevent OSM from releasing a revised stream buffer rule and proposed a partial moratorium on mountaintop removal mining until health effects studies are completed. In the same Congress, there was a moratorium on new mountaintop removal mining permits and expansion of existing permits. The Obama Administration did not present formal views on legislation affecting CWA permitting or SMCRA but opposed restrictions in an appropriations bill."
