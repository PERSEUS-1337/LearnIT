Federal policy makers are increasingly interested in promoting energy storage technology for grid efficiency, reliability, and reducing emissions in the transportation sector. The STORAGE Act of 2011 aims to provide investment tax credits for storage systems connected to the electric grid. The STORAGE Act of 2011 aims to provide investment tax credits for storage systems connected to the electric grid, promoting grid reliability and efficiency. Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner John Norris believes that storage resources offer unique value and will become increasingly critical in integrating variable energy sources. Energy storage technologies are becoming more critical for integrating variable energy sources. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu believes that advanced batteries for electric transportation will soon be more cost-effective and offer longer ranges. The federal government is paying attention to energy storage technologies, but challenges remain for their commercialization and widespread deployment. The recent bankruptcy of Beacon Power highlights commercial barriers to grid storage technology, while public concerns about fire risks from Chevrolet Volt batteries have been exaggerated. AES Corporation's investments in utility-scale battery storage show successful efforts to overcome technical challenges and market barriers. The wide range of storage technologies available makes it difficult to fully understand the potential of energy storage in electric applications. The diverse range of energy storage options poses challenges in understanding their capabilities and costs for various applications. Market structure and regulations also impact deployment, making it challenging to develop a research portfolio. Despite the need for storage technology improvements, there are multiple pathways to achieve this goal. This report aims to summarize the current knowledge on energy storage technologies for electric grid and vehicle applications. The report provides a structured comparison of energy storage technologies for electric grid and vehicle applications, highlighting key characteristics relevant to widespread use. It discusses how policy and market structure impact competition among technologies and includes 13 chapters covering various aspects such as background, storage technology applications, and current initiatives to address barriers. The report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides a comparison of energy storage technologies for electric grid and vehicle applications. It includes 13 chapters discussing storage technology applications, current barriers, and initiatives to address them. The report also references previous reports on electricity storage and battery manufacturing for hybrid and electric vehicles. Energy storage in electric applications can enhance the performance of the power grid, increase reliability, decrease costs, and facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources like solar and wind. It also supports a potential shift away from oil-based energy systems. The research was conducted by a team including experts from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Natural Resources Defense Council, funded in part by the Joyce Foundation. Energy storage technologies can help enhance the power grid, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and lower carbon emissions. The report categorizes storage technologies for electric grid and transportation sectors based on power discharge and energy management requirements. It provides an overview of current capabilities, costs, and potential improvements for each technology. The report categorizes grid storage applications based on power discharge and energy management requirements, discussing technical and cost improvements as well as non-technical barriers. It divides storage technologies into high power applications for rapid response and energy management applications for longer discharge periods. Some technologies are limited to short-term services, but still offer significant benefits in the grid. The rapid response category of grid storage technologies can be divided into short-term discharge (less than one minute) and longer-term discharge (up to about an hour). Short-term discharge services can often be provided by non-storage options like power electronics, while the primary challenge of renewables integration requires minutes to hours of discharge time. Capacitors and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) are currently capable of only providing short-term discharge, with research focused on increasing energy density and decreasing costs. Current efforts for grid storage technologies are modest, with no clearly defined pathway for SMES to be competitive for applications requiring extended discharge. Devices with up to one hour of discharge are needed for services like frequency regulation and contingency reserves. Flywheels and various battery types, including lithium-ion and aqueous batteries, have been demonstrated for these grid applications. Most aqueous chemistries are considered mature technologies. Research and development efforts on lithium-ion batteries are focused on reducing cost and weight for transportation applications, with potential spillover benefits to grid applications. Commercial vendors are working on gaining access to markets for frequency regulation and maximizing the response capabilities of technologies like flywheels and lithium-ion batteries. Grid storage devices for energy management can provide continuous discharge for several hours, useful for shifting energy during periods of low demand or high renewable energy generation. Pumped hydro storage (PHS) is a dominant technology with high reliability, efficiency, and long lifetime. It faces challenges due to siting and environmental opposition, but has large technical potential and many proposed plants exceed current capacity. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is a mature technology considered the lowest-cost option for electricity storage. Major development efforts are underway to demonstrate the technology in different geological formations, expanding its potential across the country. Research is also focused on CAES cycles that do not require natural gas fuel, while hydrogen and other electricity-derived fuels are being explored as alternatives. Hydrogen and electricity-derived fuels are potential storage options for electricity, offering long-term storage capabilities. However, they are currently inefficient and expensive, requiring further research to reduce costs and improve durability. High-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are a mature and commercially available option for electric grid applications, utilizing low-cost and abundant materials. High-temperature batteries like sodium sulfur are cost-effective but limited in scale. Other high-temperature chemistries are in various stages of development. Flow batteries, such as vanadium and zinc-bromine technologies, are also being researched. Thermal energy storage (TES) is an overlooked option with high efficiency, serving as an alternative to electricity storage. Thermal energy storage (TES) is used for electricity generation by storing thermal energy from the sun in molten salt. It is primarily applied in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, with ongoing research to develop higher temperature storage materials for increased efficiency and cost reduction. TES is also utilized for cold and hot storage in buildings to reduce peak demand. Cold storage for reducing peak demand in buildings is a mature technology with high efficiency and grid service capabilities. The main challenge lies in capturing its benefits in the current regulatory and market environment. Energy storage for transportation can be categorized into high power/rapid discharge and high energy/extended discharge systems, with high power devices improving fuel efficiency in hybrid electric vehicles. Currently, technologies for energy storage in transportation include lithium-ion and nickel-based aqueous batteries, capacitors, flywheels, and hydrogen. Hydrogen is being explored as a simple storage technology produced by splitting water using electricity and converting it to electricity to drive an electric motor via a fuel cell. The challenges of a hydrogen-based transportation system include developing a new fueling infrastructure with safety standards, high-pressure storage tanks, and expensive fuel cells for vehicles. Research efforts are needed to reduce costs and improve performance for large-scale hydrogen transportation. Other electricity-to-fuel pathways are also being considered. Other electricity-to-fuel pathways are being considered, but with limited research in the US. They face challenges of new fuel infrastructure and higher costs compared to fossil fuels. The primary alternative is battery electric storage in PHEVs and EVs, with a focus on reducing cost and increasing energy density of lithium-ion technology. Lead-acid and nickel metal hydride technologies are not likely candidates for future EVs due to energy density limits. Concerns exist about the availability of metals used in these technologies. In the United States, energy storage technologies are deployed to enhance the performance of the electric power grid by enabling efficient utilization of conventional power plants and supporting renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Concerns are raised about the availability of metals used in lithium-ion batteries and the potential of lithium-metal and metal-air batteries with higher energy density in the research phase. Electricity storage is crucial for grid flexibility and integrating renewables like wind and solar. It also enables greater use of electrified transportation, reducing U.S. dependence on petroleum. This report provides information on the current status and future potential of energy storage technologies. The report provides information on energy storage technologies for electric grid and electric vehicle applications, discussing key technical and market barriers, R&D efforts, and policy initiatives to overcome these barriers. It describes how existing storage technologies work, their applications, advantages, limitations, economic barriers, costs, safety, and effectiveness. The report evaluates the market readiness and R&D status of various storage technologies. It consists of 12 chapters, starting with an executive summary and background information. Each chapter discusses a different storage technology, including its overview, market status, performance, lifetime, costs, and R&D needs. Electric utilities are interested in energy storage technology for grid support, including load-leveling and renewable energy integration. Chapters 4-13 cover market status, performance, costs, R&D needs, and non-technical barriers. Chapters 2 and 3 provide a more in-depth understanding of the technological discussions. Electric utilities are exploring energy storage for grid support, including optimizing grid infrastructure and providing ancillary services. Energy storage can help avoid building new power lines and balance supply and demand in the evolving wholesale marketplace for competitive bulk power purchases. The potential for energy storage has grown in importance due to the strain on electricity demand. In the United States, there is approximately 22 GW of utility-scale electric storage capacity, mainly in the form of pumped hydro storage (PHS). PHS works by pumping water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir, releasing it through a hydroelectric generator when electricity is needed. This capacity was initiated in the mid- to late 1970s in response to price increases in oil and natural gas for peak electricity demand. During the 1970s, utilities developed pumped hydro storage (PHS) as an alternative to fossil-fueled generation due to restrictions on oil and gas use in new power plants. Research also focused on other storage technologies like batteries, capacitors, and compressed-air. Deployment of various storage types was expected to address daily and hourly load variations and peak demand. Deployment of pumped hydro storage (PHS) and other emerging storage technologies declined in the 1980s due to natural gas price reductions and improvements in natural gas turbines. Various technical, market, and regulatory factors have historically limited the deployment of electricity storage, including challenges in estimating and capturing the full economic value of storage. The deployment of utility-scale electricity storage in the United States has been restricted over recent decades, with limited projects beyond pumped hydro storage (PHS) and a single compressed-air energy storage (CAES) facility. Between 1990 and 2010, only 2 MW of new PHS was constructed compared to over 300 GW of new generating capacity. Energy storage offers various valuable applications for electric power grids, as highlighted in a 2010 assessment by Sandia National Laboratories listing 17 distinct applications and 26 associated benefits. The curr_chunk discusses various applications of electricity storage, categorizing them based on discharge time into high power rapid discharge and energy storage categories. It excludes applications like \"black start\" and supporting variable generation. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of valuing benefits of electricity storage technologies for power grid applications, such as load-leveling, regulation service, contingency reserves, and firm capacity. It highlights the difficulty in quantifying these value streams without sophisticated modeling. The emergence of wholesale electricity markets provides transparent data for utilities and independent power producers to evaluate opportunities for electricity storage. Most assessments show that commercially available bulk electricity storage technologies cost over $1,000/kW. Figure 1 summarizes the life-cycle value of storage applications in various studies and locations. The value of electricity storage can exceed storage costs in specific applications, with energy arbitrage revenues requiring a capital cost of less than $1,000/kW. Combining services like system capacity and energy arbitrage could support a device costing somewhat more than $1,000/kW. The value of electricity storage lies in regulation service and contingency reserves, which have higher potential value than energy arbitrage. Providing contingency reserves requires rapid response, making it technically challenging. Frequency regulation is demanding but offers the highest value opportunity for storage devices. Estimating the total market size for electricity storage in the U.S. grid is difficult, with hundreds of gigawatts of total applications identified, some of which overlap. The potential market for electricity storage is large and expected to grow with the increasing deployment of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Variable renewable generation can impact the grid operation, which can be mitigated with electricity storage. Variable renewable generation (VG) adds to the variability in electric power frequency and hourly generation supply requirements, increasing cycling and maintenance of conventional generators. Wind availability uncertainty can impact power system operation by affecting the response to net load variation. VG also widens the daily electricity demand range and may lead to curtailment. Variable renewable generation (VG) introduces variability in electricity demand, impacting conventional generators and transmission requirements. This can lead to cycling off generation units during high wind output and curtailment of renewable potential. New transmission is needed for remote resources like wind and solar, but construction is challenging. Storage could help reduce wind generation curtailment due to transmission constraints. The impact of wind generation on the grid is significant, with the need for conventional sources to meet the net load. The variability of wind power can result in a higher ramp range for load-following purposes. Despite the potential of storage technologies, there is debate over the necessity of electricity storage with moderate renewable penetration. Various wind integration studies have evaluated grid impacts and found that accommodating wind variability is relatively low cost. The low cost of wind variability on the grid, adding less than 10% to the cost of wind energy, has led to debates on the necessity of electricity storage with moderate renewable penetration. However, potential costs such as increased generator cycling and transmission expansion challenges have not been fully quantified. Consideration of these factors could increase the value of storage and enhance the value proposition for variable generation. The value proposition for storage in today's grid is likely to increase with renewables, expanding the market size for electricity storage. Combining dedicated storage with wind or solar generation plants has economic benefits, such as reducing variability in output and enabling energy arbitrage. The need for electricity storage in the grid becomes more significant as renewable energy penetration increases. Recent studies suggest that a 30% penetration of renewables on the grid is feasible without requiring storage for system reliability. However, economic limits may arise at high penetration levels due to mismatches between renewable energy supply and electricity demand patterns, leading to curtailed generation and reduced economic viability. Demand for electricity can lead to curtailed generation and decreased economic viability of variable generation sources. The cycling limits on conventional generators exacerbate this issue, as they must remain online to provide operating reserves when wind and solar generation is insufficient. The Western Wind and Solar Integration Study (WWSIS) shows that with 30% wind penetration, wind power supply almost entirely replaces conventional generation during high wind periods. This results in significant ramping of coal generators to meet demand, with wind providing about 32 GW even after exporting some of the generation to surrounding areas. Increasing wind generation capacity would further impact the grid. Increasing wind generation capacity can lead to significant wind generation curtailment when the load cannot absorb the excess generation. Studies show that at around 40% wind penetration, curtailment is limited, but beyond 50%, curtailment rates sharply increase. This raises concerns about the ability of conventional generators to reduce output, especially as variable generation displaces traditional units. Utilities in the United States are facing challenges with higher renewable generation penetration. Utilities in the United States are concerned about their systems \"bottoming out\" due to minimum generation requirements during overnight hours, which may limit the ability of thermal generators to reduce output. Cycling operations can damage generation equipment, and the costs of such cycling are difficult to quantify. Conventional power plants, except for certain peaking plants, have minimum up-and-down times and require several hours to restart at considerable cost. In some markets, electricity prices have dropped below the actual variable cost of producing electricity. The drop in electricity prices below production costs indicates power plant operators are willing to sell at a loss to avoid reducing output. As wind generation increases, unused energy becomes a problem, making electricity storage more appealing. However, the financial mechanisms for energy storage installations to recover costs are incomplete. The main barriers to energy storage deployment are establishing a positive benefit/cost ratio and capturing the economic value it provides. The emergence of restructured wholesale electricity markets has created new storage opportunities, but electricity storage still faces non-technical barriers to market acceptance. Before market restructuring, the value of ancillary services was hidden in utilities' costs. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and grid operators are recognizing the value of these services and the advantages of electricity storage in providing them. Electricity storage is valuable for providing grid support services, especially in fast response and limited energy delivery situations. However, the full value of energy storage is often underestimated in traditional regulated utility frameworks and wholesale electricity markets. Utility models struggle to accurately simulate power plant and storage system operation over multiple time scales, hindering the quantification of storage benefits. Additionally, wholesale markets do not fully capture the potential benefits of storage in the distribution system, such as deferring new equipment and reducing power line losses. Deploying storage in the distribution system may be challenging due to the regulated nature of utilities and limited mechanisms for energy storage operators to capture economic benefits. Utilities are risk averse and tend to rely on mature generation technologies rather than new ones, hindering the potential synergies between variable generation and storage. The deployment of new technologies for energy storage in the grid faces challenges due to market uncertainty, lack of incentives for risk-taking, and regulatory complexities. Conventional generation options like natural gas turbines remain the primary choice for load following and peak power generation. Bulk energy storage options like compressed air and pumped hydro face long development times and environmental challenges, making their deployment difficult. Regulatory treatment of energy storage is unclear, complicating financing for large storage projects. Customer-sited storage faces challenges in valuation and capturing value, with benefits exceeding centrally deployed storage. It provides load-leveling, ancillary services, reduced distribution losses, and increased grid capacity. Some large commercial and industrial consumers can benefit from time-of-use or demand-based rates, but many storage benefits, like ancillary services, are not captured, making it uncompetitive for many end users. Energy storage for the grid faces significant barriers in being evaluated economically compared to conventional grid options. Energy storage for the grid is perceived as less risky for utilities in both restructured and traditional markets. It faces competition from various options for grid flexibility, including demand response. New market mechanisms are being used to share generation and reserves, increasing power system flexibility. Regulatory and policy changes are needed for greater participation of load providing reserves and load shifting. Recognition of the potential value of energy storage for grid applications has led federal and state agencies to engage in storage R&D efforts, supporting studies to evaluate the benefits and unique advantages of fast response electricity storage technologies. There is a growing consensus that fast-response resources should be compensated a premium for regulation services in wholesale power markets. The Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission highlighted the value of storage technologies for providing quick and accurate responses in the electric system. This can reduce expenses in the regulation market and support the deployment of variable generation. Efforts are being made to appropriately compensate resources for their speed and accuracy in regulation response. Federal and local agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), have supported research and development programs for energy storage technologies in grid applications. DOE's budget for the Energy Storage Systems Program increased to $14 million in 2010, with additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Applied research has been supported through the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) program. Electricity storage demonstrations have received significant funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), totaling $185 million. State agencies, such as the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the California Energy Commission (CEC), have also supported various demonstration programs for energy storage technologies. These initiatives aim to enable energy storage to compete effectively with traditional generation assets. The creation of wholesale markets in 2007 allowed increased participation of electricity storage devices, following FERC's Order 890. ISOs and RTOs have since increased market access for energy storage, with FERC's Order 755 in 2011 requiring a new approach. The FERC issued Order 755 in 2011 to establish new tariffs for electricity storage, addressing discrimination against faster-ramping resources. Large-scale grid storage projects are taking advantage of ancillary service markets, with examples in New York and Chile. However, market rules are still evolving, and access to restructured energy markets in the United States is limited. Challenges remain in capturing multiple value streams and gaining access to distribution and customer-sited storage. One storage company has developed a business model where customer-sited storage is owned by the utility for peak generation and load shifting. The federal government offers financial incentives for grid storage technologies, including the DOE's Loan Guarantee Program and manufacturing tax credits. States also provide incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency devices. Certain renewable generators are eligible for a 30% federal investment tax credit. The federal government offers financial incentives for grid storage technologies, including a 30% federal investment tax credit (ITC) for certain renewable generators. A federal direct incentive program was proposed in 2010 for new storage investments, but other energy storage proposals have yet to be enacted. Government-mandated energy storage portfolio standards have been recently proposed. California's AB 2514 requires utilities to install storage devices to meet peak demand targets determined by the California Public Utilities Commission. Electrifying transportation aims to reduce oil dependence and vehicle emissions, with hydrogen fuel receiving attention. Alternative fuels can be produced using electricity centrally or near the source. Vehicle electrification can be achieved by splitting hydrogen from water atoms for use in modified internal combustion engines or fuel cell electric vehicles. Electricity can also be stored in batteries to power electric motors in battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, reducing dependence on petroleum-derived fuels. Shifting from gasoline to electricity for vehicle electrification can displace a significant amount of petroleum, with different types of vehicles impacting the power grid in various ways. Spare generating capacity could potentially electrify a large portion of gasoline vehicles, reducing the nation's oil imports. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated that in 2002, the bulk power system could have supported electrification of 37% of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs). Studies suggest that off-peak vehicle charging can accommodate a large number of vehicles, but on-peak charging may increase generation requirements during peak electricity demand. Vehicle electrification impacts the electric distribution system, with some areas facing capacity challenges and potential distribution system lifespan reductions due to increased loads. The distribution system may face capacity challenges and reduced lifetimes of transformers due to increased loads from electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Smart charging schemes could help mitigate these impacts locally. EVs and PHEVs generally emit lower greenhouse gases per mile compared to conventional vehicles, depending on electricity sources. Charging PHEVs with current grid emissions can reduce carbon emissions per mile by almost 60% compared to conventional vehicles. The impact of EV and PHEV penetration on air pollutant emissions is complex and varies based on electricity generation sources. PHEV penetration impacts air quality by reducing NOx and VOC emissions, with estimates varying based on electricity sources. The actual impact is complex, as PHEVs shift emissions from urban to rural areas where power plants are located. The shift of emissions from urban to rural areas due to PHEV penetration improves air quality in urban areas. Electric vehicles can provide grid services through controlled charging and vehicle-to-grid technology, acting as a distributed energy storage source for short-term response services. The role of electric vehicles in providing grid flexibility is limited by battery storage capacity and high cycling costs. V2G technology is still being researched due to low market penetration of EVs. Cost and availability remain primary barriers to EV deployment in the US. The costs of current EVs and PHEVs are high, with prices for the Leaf and Volt around $35,000 and $39,000. Fuel cell vehicles are projected for deployment in 2015, but it is uncertain when costs will be suitable for widespread adoption. Federal and state policies aim to promote battery electric and fuel cell vehicles, including R&D efforts and grants for manufacturing advanced battery systems. Tax credits are also provided for PHEV purchases. To encourage adoption, ARRA offers tax credits for PHEV purchases. Current federal and state incentives can be found at the Alternative Fuels & Advanced Vehicles Data Center. Challenges include the lack of infrastructure for vehicle fueling and charging, especially for hydrogen FCEVs and HEVs. For EVs, limited charging infrastructure and range hinder widespread adoption, along with electric rate structures. This report focuses on secondary batteries used to store energy chemically. Lead-acid batteries are commonly used for grid applications and vehicle SLI due to their low cost and mass production. They are also utilized by utilities for uninterruptible power supplies and grid support in demonstration projects. Sodium-beta batteries, including sodium-sulfur (NaS) units, have been deployed worldwide, with a focus on electric distribution deferral projects in the United States. NaS batteries can reduce peak demand on distribution systems and provide grid support services. Additionally, sodium-nickel-chloride batteries are in the early stages of commercialization for grid applications. \"Flow batteries, like vanadium redox and zinc-bromide, are in early commercial stages for grid applications. Other emerging battery technologies supported by DOE efforts are also being developed.\" The lead-acid battery consists of a lead dioxide positive electrode (cathode), a lead negative electrode (anode), and an aqueous sulfuric acid electrolyte. During discharge, electrodes convert to lead sulfate, consuming sulfuric acid. Recharging converts lead sulfate back to sulfuric acid, leaving lead dioxide on the cathode and pure lead on the anode. Vented wet cell designs release hydrogen and oxygen gases, while sealed wet cell designs prevent gas loss and reduce maintenance requirements. Lead-acid batteries can be converted back to water, reducing maintenance needs. However, overcharging or rapid charging can lead to gas generation surpassing water recombination, causing explosions. Different designs like \"valve regulated gel\" and \"absorbed glass mat\" use silica or fiberglass mat to prevent electrolyte leakage and improve safety. These designs operate under slight pressure but come at a higher cost than wet cells. Lead-acid batteries are the cheapest on a dollar-per-kWh basis but have low specific energy at around 35 Wh/kg. Lead-acid batteries have low specific energy at around 35 Wh/kg and poor cycle life. The cycle life is affected by rate and depth of discharge, with high depth of discharge leading to degradation. Lead sulfate accumulation on the anode during high rate, partial state-of-charge operation can also cause degradation. Sulfate accumulation on the anode can degrade lead-acid batteries, especially at high temperatures. Battery life decreases by half for every 8\u00b0C increase above ambient. Manufacturers' warranties indicate expected service lives of three to seven years for different types of batteries. Temperature also affects capacity, with lower temperatures reducing capacity. For many applications, battery efficiency is not a significant factor. The DC-DC efficiency of utility-scale lead acid batteries is estimated at 81%, while the AC-AC efficiency is around 70%-72%. Sodium-beta batteries use molten sodium for the anode, with two main types distinguished by their cathodes: sodium-sulfur with a liquid sulfur cathode, and sodium-nickel chloride with a solid metal chloride cathode. Both types utilize a beta-alumina solid electrolyte material that offers high ionic conductivity at high temperatures, typically around 300\u00b0C (572\u00b0F). This solid electrolyte prevents self-discharge and enables high efficiency in sodium-beta batteries. The technical challenges of sodium-beta battery chemistry stem from high temperature requirements, with a 300\u00b0C operating point necessary for insulation and active heating to prevent damage from freeze-thaw cycles and thermal expansion. The fragile electrolyte in Na-S cells poses a risk of explosion and fire if breached. Na-S batteries are used commercially for grid services with a DC-DC efficiency of about 85%. Calculating AC-AC efficiency is complex due to various factors. The DC-DC efficiency of sodium-beta batteries is around 85%. The AC-AC efficiency is estimated to be between 75%-80% for load-leveling services due to heat loss and power conversion equipment losses. The primary alternative to Na-S chemistry is the Na-NiCl2 cell, known as the ZEBRA cell, which offers advantages such as higher operating voltage and increased temperature range. ZEBRA batteries have been in development for over 20 years and are in the early stages of commercialization. Flow batteries use liquid electrolytes pumped through a stack with an ion-exchange membrane or electrode array. Energy is stored in active materials dissolved in electrolytes, passed through electrodes during charge/discharge. Electrodes are separated by an ion exchange membrane to keep electrolytes separate. Power and energy components can be sized independently, with electrolyte materials stored in external tanks for multi-MW applications. Power rating determined by battery stack size, energy rating by electrolyte storage tank size. The two main types of flow batteries in early commercialization are vanadium redox and zinc-bromine. Vanadium redox batteries use an ion-exchange membrane similar to fuel cells, with active materials dissolved in the electrolyte. Vanadium has the greatest degree of commercialization among electrolyte materials. Redox flow batteries offer benefits over conventional batteries, with potential cost-effective alternatives being explored in R&D. Redox flow batteries offer benefits such as unlimited energy storage, simplified construction, and mechanical recharging. However, they have disadvantages like complexity in electrolyte pumping and storage, low specific energy, and potential leakage across ion-exchange membranes. The challenge of cost-effectively manufacturing reliable ion-exchange membranes is a primary reason for limited development of some flow battery chemistries. Vanadium redox batteries have a claimed calendar lifetime of at least 10 years with over 10,000 cycles. An alternative to redox flow batteries is a flow battery where one active material is plated onto an electrode, with zinc bromine being the most developed chemistry. This configuration benefits from a low-cost electrolyte and slightly improved energy. Flow batteries have a cycle life of about 2000 cycles or 6000 hours of continuous operations. Commercial units have cycle life ratings from 1500 to over 2000 cycles. The round-trip efficiency for flow batteries is in the range of 70%-80%, with an AC-AC roundtrip efficiency estimated at 65%-72%. Lead acid batteries are the most mature and lowest-cost technology with an estimated cost of $150-$200/kWh in 2008. Additional costs for storage installation equipment must be considered. Lead-acid batteries are cost competitive for various applications, with estimated costs of $265/kW in 2003. However, newer estimates show higher costs. The cycle life of lead-acid technology is short, limiting its use to applications with few cycles per year. NaS battery costs are estimated at $350-$400/kWh and $450-$550/kW for the balance of plant. A large NaS project in the US suggests a cost of $2500/kW for a 7.2 hour device, excluding initial project costs. Cost estimates for vanadium and zinc-bromine batteries are uncertain due to limited data on large-scale installations. A 2004 estimate for a vanadium flow battery is $236/kWh and $566 for the balance of plant, totaling about $2450/kW for an 8-hour device. A 2003 estimate for Zinc-Bromine is $353/kWh and $576 for the balance of plant, or about $3400/kW for an eight hour device. More recent estimates suggest costs of about $780/kWh for the entire system, with projected costs of about $400/kWh for a next generation system. Recent estimates suggest that flow battery costs exceed $4000/kW for multi-hour devices, with a 2009 estimate placing costs at $1545-$3100/kW for a 4-hour device. Deployment at scale is necessary to establish accurate cost estimates, longevity, and operation requirements. A recent analysis shows various chemical pairs for battery types, with most having couple element costs of about $10/kWh or less. The costs of vanadium chemistry for grid storage are a challenge at close to $100/kWh. The Department of Energy's ARPA-E goal is $100/kWh for grid storage, including power conditioning equipment and installation. R&D efforts are supported for various battery technologies, including emerging chemistries. The Department of Energy's ARPA-E supports R&D efforts for various battery technologies, including emerging chemistries like alkaline, sodium ion, and liquid metal batteries. Federal battery R&D activities are listed in Tables 4 and 5, with a focus on lithium-ion and metal-air batteries for transportation applications. Grid battery technology R&D activities are also funded by other groups and private companies. The Stanford University's Global Climate and Energy Project has awarded grants for new grid-oriented battery technologies. Lead-acid batteries have poor energy density and short cycle life, but improvements can be made by enhancing electrolytes and using solid oxide flow battery systems. Adding carbon to electrodes or using a carbon anode can increase cycle life. Lead acid flow batteries dissolve lead in an aqueous methanesulfonic acid electrolyte to improve cycle life. The acid flow battery uses lead dissolved in an aqueous methanesulfonic acid electrolyte, eliminating the need for troublesome electrolyte separators. R&D efforts are focused on sodium-beta batteries, including a stacked planar cell design to reduce costs and improve energy and power efficiency. Planar designs face challenges with sealing and material selection. R&D efforts in flow battery technology focus on improving performance and developing new chemistries, such as vanadium redox cells seeking to decrease vanadium usage and increase energy density. Research also explores new redox couples like iron-chromium, zinc-chloride, and hydrogen-bromine for increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The development of flow battery technology, including new chemistries like vanadium redox cells, has reached commercialization but was discontinued. Achieving reliability and longevity for large-scale deployment is a key requirement, complicated by toxic electrolytes. Rechargeable alkaline batteries with zinc anode and manganese dioxide cathode face challenges with short cycle lives and capacity loss. Rechargeable alkaline batteries have a small market share due to short cycle lives and capacity loss. Modifications are being proposed to overcome cycling challenges, with one high-risk project supported by ARPA-E. Sodium ion batteries function similarly to lithium-ion batteries but use non-reactive electrode materials, allowing for room temperature operation. These batteries have the potential for low cost and high safety for grid applications, with cycle life exceeding 5000 cycles and 100% DoD. Emerging battery chemistries include nitrogen-air and liquid metal batteries, with potential challenges such as land use not well quantified. Estimates for land use range from 77 m2/MW for lead-acid to 850 m2/MW for a proposed flow battery. Availability of raw materials is a concern for some battery types, but less critical for grid applications. The chapter discusses various battery types for grid applications, with a focus on production and reserves of battery materials. While most materials do not pose major limitations, vanadium and antimony are exceptions due to resource constraints. Toxicity concerns exist for some materials like lead, necessitating proper collection and recycling efforts. Proper containment and mitigation are necessary for flow batteries to minimize potential health impacts. Various battery chemistries are in different stages of development and commercialization, showing competitive economics for power grid applications. Batteries are well-suited for ancillary services like frequency regulation but need to demonstrate long calendar and cycle life. They will compete with technologies like flywheels for short-duration services and require reduced capital costs for longer-duration applications. The chapter discusses battery technologies with potential for electric transportation, focusing on high energy density for longer drive ranges. R&D will improve performance and reduce costs for various battery types, with engineering advancements enhancing reliability. The distinction between vehicle and grid storage technologies may blur, but differences in specifications and development are significant. The chapter highlights significant differences in specifications and development of various battery types for electric vehicle applications. Nickel-cadmium batteries are not considered viable for large-scale deployment due to cost and toxicity issues, while nickel-metal hydride batteries are extensively used in current hybrid electric vehicles. These batteries primarily serve as a power resource for vehicle starting and acceleration, but have lower energy density compared to lithium-ion or emerging battery technologies. NiMH technology is unlikely to be widely used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles or battery electric vehicles due to low energy density. Hybrid electric vehicle sales have grown significantly in the last decade, with most using NiMH batteries until recently when lithium-ion batteries started being used. Lithium-ion batteries are popular for consumer electronics due to their durability, high energy density, light weight, and fast-charging capability. They are now entering the automotive market for hybrid and electric vehicles. Several manufacturers have developed lithium-ion batteries for this purpose. Several manufacturers including SAFT, LG Chem, SK Energy, Hitachi, AESC, A123, Enerdel, and Panasonic have developed high-power lithium-ion HEV batteries with benefits such as high power, efficiency, and long cycle life. Lower costs and enhanced safety are needed for significant impact in the transportation sector. Lithium-ion batteries are also being used in grid applications, with examples like an 8 MW system installed by AES in New York. Other battery technologies like lithium metal and metal-air are under development promising a tenfold increase in specific energy. Nickel-based aqueous batteries use a nickel oxyhydroxide cathode and a potassium hydroxide electrolyte. Differentiation lies in the anode material, with cadmium being toxic and limiting further deployment. NiMH cells use a complex metal alloy for higher specific energy and cycle life. The nickel-zinc battery offers higher specific energy, cycle life, and discharge rate than nickel-cadmium cells, but has poor low temperature performance and limited shelf-life. The use of metallic zinc as an anode improves cell voltage and capacity, but dendrite formation and swelling can lead to irreversible capacity loss. Nickel-based batteries, including nickel-hydrogen cells, have been used in aerospace applications due to their long life but are costly. Lithium-ion batteries operate by shuttling lithium ions between the anode and cathode via the electrolyte. Multiple combinations of cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes are used in Li-ion batteries. Most Li-ion battery development focuses on cathode technology, with anodes typically made of carbon-based materials. Improvements in anode performance can impact safety risks, especially during fast-charging at low temperatures. Three classes of cathode materials are commonly used: layered transition-metal oxides, spinels, and olivines. The main difference among cathode materials (layered oxides, spinels, and olivines) lies in their crystal structures. Layered oxide cathodes have drawbacks of cost and safety due to cobalt and nickel content, while spinel-based cathodes have lower energy content and manganese dissolution issues. Olivines offer improved safety and stability. Olivines offer better safety and stability compared to other cathode materials. The electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries is often exposed to conditions beyond its stability limits due to the wide voltage window. Building a protective layer known as the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on carbon anodes can help overcome stability issues. Tuning the electrolyte formulation to optimize the SEI layer is actively pursued. Optimizing the SEI layer in lithium-ion batteries is crucial for improving longevity. Cycle life is influenced by the depth of discharge, with potential for 3000 cycles at 80% DoD and 500,000 cycles at 4% DoD. Lithium metal anodes offer significant energy storage benefits but face challenges due to reactivity. Lithium-sulfur chemistry shows promise, with liquid sulfur cathodes being a key component. The lithium-sulfur cell consists of a liquid sulfur cathode supported by a porous carbon framework, an electrolyte, and a lithium metal anode. It offers high energy density potential due to sulfur's low molecular weight. The use of porous carbon supports helps with the low electrical conductivity of sulfur. The chemistry includes a natural mechanism to protect the cell from overcharge. The lithium-sulfur cell uses a shuttle reaction to protect against overcharge, but optimizing performance is complex. The formation of multiple intermediate compounds during charge and discharge makes stabilizing the cathode challenging. Lithium metal as an anode offers high energy but poses safety and long-term operation challenges due to significant volume changes during cycling. Metal-air batteries have the potential to be the highest energy density and lowest-cost energy storage solution. Oxygen from the atmosphere serves as the cathode, while a metallic anode is used. Safety concerns arise from the reactivity of metallic lithium when exposed to water. Metal-air batteries utilize oxygen as the cathode and a metallic anode for energy storage. Zinc-air systems have a high theoretical specific energy, surpassing lithium-ion cells, and offer sustainability and cost-effectiveness due to the abundance of zinc. The deployment challenges of zinc-air batteries include poor reversibility and cycling problems due to metal plating, as well as electrolyte evaporation. Lithium-air batteries have a high theoretical specific energy exceeding 11 kWh/kg and are of interest for automotive and mobile applications. However, the realized specific energy is only about 30% of the theoretical value, still surpassing Li-ion technology by an order of magnitude. The cost of current generation Li-ion battery packs for electric vehicles is estimated to be between $800 and $1200/kWh, with battery cells accounting for only 65% of the total cost. The necessary pack size for a small- to mid-size electric sedan is around 30 kWh, resulting in a battery cost of approximately $20,000, which exceeds the total cost of many vehicles in this class. The cost of Li-ion batteries for electric vehicles is estimated to be between $800 and $1200/kWh. Figure 10 shows the cost levels needed for fuel cost savings to offset initial incremental costs. Different types of vehicles have varying energy requirements. Battery costs should closely follow the projected curve for cost neutrality at $2.15/gallon fuel prices, but only need to reach $500-$700/kWh for future fuel costs. The study suggests that energy storage systems need to reach $500-$700/kWh to offset future fuel costs. Lithium-sulfur and metal-air battery systems are not mature enough to project battery pack costs. Cost challenges related to raw materials for various battery technologies are a significant factor in reaching DOE cost goals. DOE's R&D efforts focus on new materials and commercialization of battery technologies for vehicles. ARRA funding has been provided to incentivize deployment at scale. The ARRA funding has incentivized deployment of advanced battery technologies at scale. The Department of Energy has also awarded grants for battery R&D through programs like BEEST. Private sector R&D efforts in the US are led by the USABC, in collaboration with the DOE and major auto makers. The long-term targets for PHEV energy storage are outlined by the DOE's FreedomCAR program. The figure in Figure 12 shows key barriers to achieving long-term targets for battery chemistries. Nickel-cadmium and nickel-hydrogen batteries face challenges due to toxic cadmium and high cost. NiMH batteries need improvements in cold temperature performance, self-discharge rates, power, and cycle life. Cost is a concern, especially with nickel being a significant cost factor. Nickel-zinc batteries offer advantages over NiMH but are limited by poor cycle life due to zinc dissolution and plating issues. Research efforts are focused on improving cost and addressing these challenges. Efforts in industry, national laboratories, and academia are focused on improving cost, safety, energy density, cold temperature performance, and longevity of Li-ion batteries, a key focus of DOE vehicle technology R&D. Increasing manufacturing scale is seen as a way to reduce cost, with $2.4 billion in ARRA funds awarded to create a U.S. manufacturing base for electric vehicles. Scale-induced cost reductions are based on material commoditization, with active materials (anode, cathode, electrolyte) making up 20% of costs. Development of anodes and cathodes using lower-cost materials like iron is a potential route. Safety is a top concern in Li-ion battery markets due to past incidents like laptop fires and Chevrolet Volt crash tests. Efforts are being made to improve safety through electrode coatings, non-flammable electrolyte systems, and better thermal management. Other areas for improvement include low-temperature response, long-term degradation, and specific energy. Long-term improvements in Li-ion battery performance, including cell degradation and specific energy, can reduce costs. Efforts funded by ARPA-E, such as three-dimensional electrodes and solid-state batteries, show promise. Lithium titanate anodes offer high stability and safety benefits compared to graphite anodes. The use of lithium titanate in batteries improves safety and longevity but results in lower cell voltage and reduced energy storage capacity. Other metal-oxide anodes and silicon anodes are also being studied for their potential high specific capacity, but face challenges such as volume expansion during charge/discharge leading to capacity loss and reduced cycle life. Despite the promise of higher specific energy, significant work is needed to improve Li-ion batteries' specific energy and address issues like capacity decline and self-discharge. Ongoing efforts to improve Li-ion specific energy include new cathode structures with porous carbons, surface coatings for increased sulfur utilization, and new electrolytes for enhanced conductivity. The ARPA-E BEEST program awarded $5 million to develop lithium-sulfur batteries with a 300 mile range. Core challenges for metal-air batteries include active material obstruction. The core challenges for metal-air batteries include obstruction of the active electrode surface, volume change, and loss of uniformity during cycling. Protecting and stabilizing the anode is crucial for long-term performance and safety, especially with lithium. R&D efforts focus on reducing energy loss between charge and discharge at the air cathode using catalysts. Challenges also include electrolyte evaporation and air contamination, which can be addressed with ionic and solid electrolytes or closed/filtered air systems, but these solutions may increase cost and complexity. Metal-air batteries face challenges such as high cost, limited performance, and the need for higher energy density. Funding for research includes grants from ARPA-E and the Oregon Department of Energy. To achieve large-scale deployment, batteries with higher energy density and chemistries using abundant materials are needed. Currently, only a few battery types can meet the DOE target for electric vehicle battery packs. The potential deployment challenges for lithium-based batteries include scarcity of raw materials and the need for increased production rates. Material availability may also be a challenge for batteries using cobalt. Large-scale deployment of batteries could help electrify the transportation sector and reduce costs for PHEVs and EVs compared to conventional vehicles. The potential for advanced battery technology, including lithium-based and hydrogen energy storage systems, to reduce costs and improve performance in vehicles and grid applications is being explored through research efforts. Challenges such as raw material scarcity and engineering requirements need to be addressed to achieve this potential. Hydrogen is commonly used in fuel cell systems for higher efficiency than combustion engines. Fuel cells convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, with water and heat as byproducts. First significant use was in the Apollo space program. Hydrogen produced from natural gas is used in various industries, but R&D interest is focused on sustainable transportation fuel applications. R&D interest in hydrogen is for sustainable transportation fuel applications, including buses, ground equipment, and light duty vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles offer a cost-effective, clean alternative to gasoline. Commercial deployment phase reached with major automotive companies producing FCEVs. Commercially viable hydrogen fuel cell systems in forklifts. Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are gaining traction, with ongoing demonstration projects in the United States and other countries. Commercial deployment for ordinary consumers is expected in select areas by 2015. Costs for automotive fuel cell systems have significantly decreased to around $50/kW, thanks to R&D efforts. Industry and government support for FCEVs is strong internationally, particularly in states like California and Hawaii. However, barriers to large-scale deployment remain, including fuel cell durability, onboard fuel storage, and the need for new refueling infrastructure. Challenges to hydrogen storage for grid applications include capital costs and low round-trip efficiency. Fuel cell systems are commercial in niche markets, with applications in backup power, remote power, and combined heat and power for buildings. Current markets received approximately 24,000 fuel cell unit shipments in 2009, including forklifts and backup power units at telecom sites. Large grid fuel cell systems represented about 15 MW of electricity production capacity. Recent demonstrations have shown progress in storing and testing electrolytic hydrogen. In partnership with Xcel Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory is testing hydrogen production, storage, and conversion to grid electricity. Japan has installed over 3000 small residential systems for combined heat and power. Cost reductions in producing, storing, and delivering hydrogen for automotive markets will also benefit grid applications. The economic viability of hydrogen for grid applications will improve as fuel cell markets expand, bringing down costs through economies of scale and mass production. Hydrogen can be derived from various sources using different techniques, with electrolysis being a technically feasible method but with high lifecycle costs. The most common and cost-effective method of producing hydrogen today is steam methane reforming of natural gas. Grid fuel cell applications are currently fueled with natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen derived from natural gas. Electrolysis units are used in niche markets where high purity hydrogen is required. Electrolytic hydrogen systems, including alkaline and PEM electrolyzers, are used in niche markets like metallurgy, electronics, and power plants for on-demand high purity hydrogen production. These systems consist of electrolysis, storage, and fuel cells, with PEM electrolyzers operating similarly to PEM fuel cells but in reverse to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. They can quickly adjust power levels to meet varying demand. In a PEM electrolyzer, hydrogen and oxygen are separated by a solid membrane electrolyte, allowing hydrogen ions to move to the cathode where they combine with electrons to form hydrogen gas. Alkaline electrolyzer systems are well-established with large-scale installations, capable of producing up to 74,000 kg of hydrogen per day. Alkaline electrolyzers use potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte, transferring hydroxide ions through a hot liquid electrolyte. The core technology includes PEM or alkaline cell stacks, water supply system, water-gas separators, power supply, heat exchangers, hydrogen gas drying, and controls. Three types of hydrogen storage technology are physical storage, geologic storage, and material-based storage. High pressures are required due to the low volumetric energy density of hydrogen. Hydrogen storage for FCEVs requires high pressures for sufficient quantities to achieve comparable vehicle ranges. Advanced FCEV designs use compressed or liquid hydrogen tanks, with some vehicles achieving ranges exceeding 300 miles. Onboard storage improvements enhance commercial viability and vehicle-to-grid capability. Future FCEVs with 100 kW fuel cell systems could provide electricity for a large home for over 30 hours with a full tank. Above-ground tanks can store hydrogen for grid applications. Geologic hydrogen storage is feasible, with current systems in solution-mined salt caverns. Research is exploring storage in depleted natural gas reservoirs and aquifers. Material-based storage methods like metal hydrides are also being developed. Hydrogen storage methods in development include metal hydrides, chemical hydrides, high surface area sorbent materials, and various chemical storage types. Research is ongoing to determine the technical and cost potential of different material-based storage options. Government and industry focus on fuel cells over hydrogen combustion engines, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water. Current hydrogen production is mainly from hydrocarbon fuels like methane. Grid-oriented fuel cells being developed include proton exchange membranes, phosphoric acid, molten carbonate, solid oxides, direct methanol, and alkaline systems. Some systems can run on natural gas or biogas. The main focus for automotive fuel cells is the PEMFC, known for its ability to run under variable conditions and at low temperatures. Sizes for mobile applications range from 5-100 kW, much smaller than non-PEM fuel cells for grid applications. Each component in a hydrogen storage system must be evaluated separately for size and performance. The expected round trip efficiency of hydrogen storage systems is estimated to be in the range of 28%-41%, depending on technology advances. Electrolyzer size can vary from a few watts to over 1 GW, with the ability to combine stacks in parallel for increased production capacity. Alkaline and PEM electrolysis systems have conversion efficiencies between 61% and 81%, with potential for efficiencies closer to 50-45 kWh/kg in the longer term. Compression energy for storage may add about 4 kWh/kg to these values. High temperature electrolyzers based on solid oxide technology are currently under development. High temperature electrolyzers, based on solid oxide technology, aim for over 90% electrical efficiency. PEM electrolyzers can operate at part load for grid services but may face challenges with variable operation. Durability over the stack lifetime needs further demonstration, especially under variable conditions. High pressure automotive hydrogen tank systems have surpassed 2010 DOE goals for gravimetric density and approached goals for volumetric density. Ongoing R&D efforts focus on cost reductions for hydrogen storage systems, with geologic storage being a potential option. Mined salt caverns are considered favorable for storage due to their properties and relatively low costs. Hydrogen storage in underground formations allows for long duration storage and energy shifting, valuable in renewable energy scenarios. Fuel cell projects range from small to large scale applications. Fuel cell projects vary in size from a few watts to over 1 MW, with recent improvements in start-reliability, durability, and cost. The current electrical efficiency of a PEM fuel cell system is around 47%, with a target efficiency of 58%. PEM fuel cells have much higher conversion efficiencies compared to combustion engines. The lifetime for PEM fuel cells in grid applications is about 20,000 hrs, with a DOE target of 60,000 hours by 2020. Electrolysis costs are estimated at around $830/kW, with potential cost reductions as demand increases. Estimates for low temperature electrolyzer costs range from $340/kW to $384/kW when deployed at scale. The balance of plant, including control systems and power electronics, can make up 34% to 86% of the capital cost. Stack replacement costs are estimated at 35% of total purchased costs every seven years. Maintenance costs for low temperature electrolyzers are expected to be 1% to 3% of the total installed capital cost per year. Future cost estimates for carbon fiber tanks for vehicular storage range from $13 to $20/kWh for 5,000 and 10,000 psi tanks. Liquid automotive tanks could achieve $8/kWh of storage. Cost estimates for hydrogen storage in various forms range from $900 per kg for above ground tanks to $5-$24 per kg for salt caverns. Stationary fuel cell costs are currently around $3,000/kW, with potential costs after R&D and higher deployment volumes in the range of $400-$800/kW. Deployment of hydrogen fuel cell systems at scale is uncertain, with significant cost reduction potential. The current O&M costs for fuel cells are estimated at about $50/kW-yr, potentially dropping to $20/kW-yr as the technology becomes more established. One of the largest expenses for stationary fuel cells is the cell stack replacement cost, which is estimated to be about 30% of the initial capital cost after 20,000 hrs of use. Research and development activities in the United States are being funded and actively pursued, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy's Fuel Cell Technologies Program. The DOE sponsors research on electrolysis, focusing on materials, design improvements, manufacturing, and systems integration/testing. Catalyst materials and membranes are key areas for cost reduction and efficiency improvement. Design improvements include power conditioning systems and operation at higher pressure. Manufacturing advances needed for mass production include simplified designs, improved stack forming, low-temperature metal joining, quality testing, and safety equipment development. Research is needed to develop low-cost sensors, safety equipment, and procedures for PEM electrolysis systems. Improved system integration of auxiliary equipment, power conditioning, impurity removal, water management, and drying would enhance energy balance and reduce costs. R&D efforts are required to improve storage cost and manufacturability for transportation applications, including developing lightweight, manufacturable high-pressure tanks using conventional materials or advanced composites. These technologies could also be beneficial for grid applications. Investigation of geologic storage may provide additional insights. Investigation of geologic storage may reveal opportunities for lower-cost and larger-scale hydrogen storage systems for utility applications. Key R&D needs for fuel cells include materials research for improved durability and cost reduction, design enhancements for better performance, and manufacturing improvements for cost reduction and increased efficiency. Improved manufacturing is crucial for cost reduction and deploying fuel cell systems at a large scale. Research and development in high-speed and automated manufacturing are needed for sealing, coating, and component production. Testing needs to be streamlined for faster system acceptance. Low-cost sensors and safety equipment are essential for production and operation. Deployment challenges for hydrogen include fueling infrastructure development. The development of a new fueling infrastructure for hydrogen vehicles is a significant challenge due to the need for a many-fold expansion of the current infrastructure. While hydrogen can be transported by truck or through pipelines, the costs are high, especially during the early stages of market introduction. Blending hydrogen with natural gas is a viable option, and some natural gas pipelines can be converted to hydrogen pipelines if made of the right materials. Gas pipelines can be converted to hydrogen pipelines with the right materials. Near term developments like on-site production at refueling stations can help hydrogen adoption. Safety concerns exist with hydrogen as a transportation fuel, but it has advantages like fast dispersal after a leak and no toxic gases produced from burning. Hydrogen has drawbacks such as high ignition probability and wide flammability range, leading to leak ignition risks. It burns invisibly with no odor, increasing the danger of undetected leaks causing fires. High pressure systems are prone to leakage due to hydrogen's small molecular size, but it disperses rapidly. Explosive conditions can occur in contained systems at 18% concentration in air, but this is unlikely outdoors. Specialized sensors are needed for detection due to common odorants and flame enhancers poisoning fuel cells. Research is ongoing for alternative odorants to detect poison fuel cells. Hydrogen storage tanks have low release probability in collisions due to high impact strength. Precautions are necessary for hydrogen safety. Electrolyzers and fuel cells rely on expensive materials like platinum, iridium, and ruthenium for catalysts. Catalyst loading for PEM electrolyzers varies from 0.4 mg/cm2 to a few mg per square centimeter. Hydrogen production processes require specific catalysts like platinum, with loading ranging from 0.15 mg/cm2 or greater. Water usage for hydrogen production is around 3 gallons per kg H2, while cooling may need 0.1-300 gallons per kg H2 depending on plant size and cooling system. Other impacts like land use are yet to be fully quantified but are not expected to be significantly different from other storage technologies. Hydrogen storage and fuel cell technologies face technical and economic challenges for grid and transportation markets. Electrolytic hydrogen systems are expensive with lower efficiencies for grid applications. FCEVs face cost, durability, and infrastructure challenges for transportation. Fuel cells are in early stages of commercialization and require cost reductions for large-scale deployment. Progress in niche markets is driving technology advancements. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) is a utility scale electricity storage technology using high-pressure air in geologic formations. It has the lowest capital cost among bulk storage technologies and was first completed in 1978 in Huntorf, Germany for \"black start\" capability. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) technology allows for long duration storage with scalable energy capacity, providing efficient operation across various conditions. CAES can be scaled to megawatt or gigawatt levels, offering services like operating reserves and load following. Siting criteria for conventional diabatic CAES involve underground geological formations, requiring a comprehensive study for suitable geology assessment. Several specific CAES projects are in various stages of development in the United States, with developers interested in exploring additional ones. The success of future projects depends on addressing existing deployment barriers. The operation of a CAES system is similar to a combustion turbine, using grid electricity to run a compressor that raises air to high pressure. CAES involves a compressor \"train\" that raises air to high pressure and injects it into underground storage, typically in salt domes formed by solution mining. Intercooling is used to reduce storage volume requirements. Electric power can be regenerated by withdrawing air, combusting fuel, and expanding the combustion products through a turbine. Various CAES variants have been proposed. Several CAES variants have been proposed to improve heat management and reduce fuel consumption. These include storing heat generated during compression, compressing air isothermally, better heat integration, and novel turboexpander design. Aboveground air storage for small-scale applications is also being explored to avoid subsurface engineering requirements. The size of CAES facilities is determined by the availability of turbo-machinery equipment. CAES plants consist of one or more blocks of expander capacity, each ranging from 100-300 MW, allowing for flexibility as each block can run independently. The diabatic CAES output is managed by regulating air flow, resulting in high part load efficiencies and ramp rates. The existing U.S. plant has a single turbomachinery drive train with turnaround times of approximately 30 minutes, limiting its use for services requiring fast response. Proposed CAES plants aim to improve heat management and reduce fuel consumption through various methods. Proposed CAES plants feature a dedicated motor drive compressor and expander-generator to enhance response time for ancillary services and net load variability. CAES plants offer rapid ramp rates, with the McIntosh plant capable of ramping at 18 MW per minute. They can assist in renewables integration and address transmission constraints by co-locating with wind generation to reduce curtailment. CAES plants can assist in renewables integration by co-locating with wind generation, reducing the need for new transmission lines. While it may not be optimal to combine wind turbines and storage due to decreased storage device usefulness, in cases where transmission is difficult or expensive, the benefits of using storage as an alternative to transmission may outweigh the drawbacks. The efficiency of CAES is determined by the heat rate and charging electricity ratio, making it a hybrid system with varying performance metrics. The diabatic CAES plant has a typical heat rate of 3900-4400 Btu/kWh and a charging electricity ratio (CER) of 1.2-1.8. The CER indicates that CAES produces more electricity than it consumes, with natural gas making up the balance. Producing 1 kWh from a CAES plant requires 0.6 to 0.8 kWh of electricity and 3900-4400 Btu of natural gas fuel. The CER also considers losses and efficiency factors. The diabatic CAES plant has a typical heat rate of 3900-4400 Btu/kWh and a charging electricity ratio (CER) of 1.2-1.8. Turbine efficiency is crucial in the low-pressure expansion stage, where most power is generated. Increased turbine inlet temperatures can enhance CAES electrical efficiencies. Unlike other storage technologies, CAES in salt domes has virtually no decay or self-discharge of stored energy. Figure 20 compares the impact of heat rate and CER of CAES with conventional storage plant efficiency. The dispatch price of CAES and conventional storage plants for electricity generation varies based on natural gas prices and efficiencies. CAES incurs costs for compression and natural gas, while conventional storage plants only consider charging electricity. Conventional storage has an advantage at low off-peak electricity prices due to fixed natural gas costs, while CAES is advantageous at higher off-peak prices. CAES has additional advantages over other storage technologies in terms of capital costs. Maintenance is required for CAES similar to a combustion turbine. The existing CAES systems at Huntorf and McIntosh have high availabilities of over 95% after 20 to 30 years of operation. The capital cost of conventional diabatic CAES ranges from $600 to $1200/kW. Subsurface costs account for 5%-10% of the total project capital cost depending on geology. Maintenance is required for CAES similar to a combustion turbine. The capital costs for conventional CAES range from $600 to $1200/kW, with subsurface costs accounting for 5%-10% of the total project capital cost depending on geology. Comparing to natural gas combustion turbines, CAES turbomachinery costs are higher but could potentially decrease with high deployment levels. Variable and fixed O&M costs for CAES are $60/kW-year and $13/kW-year respectively, with potential increases in O&M costs for high duty cycle operations. CAES is a mature technology based on gas-turbine technology with two plants operating for over two decades. There are four areas of RD&D activities, with the potential for custom turbo-machinery development to improve efficiency. Future CAES designs may benefit from improved heat integration, specialized turbomachinery, better systems integration, and newer cycles. CAES output is changed by adjusting the air flow rather than the inlet temperature, leading to low heat rate and high part load efficiency. Specialized cycles can be employed for improved heat recovery and elimination of specialized combustors. Cost reductions can be achieved by using off-the-shelf technology in CAES designs, as seen in the proposed 150 MW plant by New York State Electric & Gas Corporation. Integration of a stand-alone CT into the CAES configuration can significantly reduce capital costs. The integration of a stand-alone CT into the CAES configuration can reduce capital costs significantly, estimated to be roughly half the cost of a conventional diabatic CAES system. However, this cost improvement may be offset by higher heat rate, reduced CER, operational flexibility, and limited availability of suitable geologies for deployment. Demonstrating CAES at commercial scale across various geologies could accelerate deployment in the near term. The development of commercial CAES projects in various geologies could accelerate deployment in the near term. Projects supported by ARRA and state agencies will demonstrate CAES in different geology types, including bedded salt in New York, an aquifer in Iowa, and a depleted gas field in California. Adiabatic CAES, where the heat of compression is stored for later use, is being pursued primarily in Europe. The approach of CAES plants in Europe is driven by concerns about CO2 emissions and natural gas supply security. Adiabatic cycles may not be cost-effective without high natural gas prices. Efficiency is a key metric for non-natural gas burning CAES plants, with round-trip efficiency estimated at 65%-75%. Isothermal CAES, a fuel-free approach, requires maintaining a constant temperature. DOE is supporting R&D proposals for isothermal CAES, but details are limited. It is too early to determine the merits of this approach, especially regarding part load efficiency. One proposed configuration for CAES cycles is aboveground CAES with air storage in high pressure piping, which is suggested for distributed short duration storage applications. The capital cost for aboveground CAES is higher compared to traditional salt dome storage, but small modular CAES systems without geologic constraints could be beneficial for high-value applications. Another approach is expanding air storage into subsea environments, utilizing anchored containment bags for underwater CAES concepts. Underwater CAES concepts use anchored containment bags to store high pressure air underwater, taking advantage of air buoyancy and subsea pressure gradient. CAES offers advantages like low capital cost, high efficiency, fast ramping capability, adaptability to various storage types, and a proven operational record. However, deployment has been slow due to market conditions, regulatory barriers, and the need to prove operation in different geologic formations. The Electric Power Research Institute and others have identified suitable geology for CAES in the continental US, but detailed geologic characteristics are needed to determine deployment potential. Extensive data and testing are required to assess a formation's adequacy for air storage, including aquifer permeability, porosity, and cap rock. An extensive survey of CAES geologies is necessary to assess deployment limits, including aquifer characteristics and challenges related to underground formation. Solution mining for cavern development requires significant water usage and brine disposal, posing concerns for some locations. Introducing air into geologic formations and cyclic loading present additional challenges for CAES operation. CAES deployment faces challenges related to geology and formation characteristics, but permitting for the subsurface component is similar to conventional natural gas storage facilities. Other deployment challenges include land, water, and environmental impacts, but CAES requires minimal unique materials and labor. The technology is commercially available with low costs for large-scale deployment. CAES is a cost-effective electricity storage technology suitable for large-scale deployment, offering grid flexibility and multiple services. Deployment barriers include the need for demonstration in various underground formations. Research efforts are needed to assess regional potential and refine geologic limits for CAES deployment. Research is needed to identify alternative CAES configurations that improve performance and reduce fuel use. Electrochemical capacitors store energy in an electric field at the surface of an electrode, offering fast response times but limited energy capacity for short-duration applications. They are commonly used in computer memory backup systems. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) are being researched for energy storage in hybrid electric vehicles due to their excellent cycle life and suitability for cycling-intense applications like transit buses and trains. The goal is to increase their energy density for grid and vehicle applications. Unlike traditional capacitors, ECs store energy in a different way, making them more suitable for these applications. Deployment in utility-scale or transportation applications is limited but there have been demonstration programs for both. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) store energy in an \"electric double-layer\" near the electrode surface, using capacitance as the primary energy storage mechanism. Unlike batteries, ECs do not rely on a \"faradaic\" process for energy storage, which can limit battery cycle life. There are two general classes of ECs, including the \"supercapacitor\" introduced by NEC in 1978 for backup power in computer and appliance applications. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) were introduced by NEC in 1978 for backup power in computer and appliance applications. They store energy using capacitance near the electrode surface, with three types of electrode materials suitable for ECs. The electrolyte can be aqueous or organic, and there are asymmetric or pseudo capacitors currently under development to increase energy density. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also known as asymmetric or pseudo capacitors, have a high power density of ~5-10 kW/kg and can charge/discharge quickly. However, their energy density of 1-10 Wh/kg is lower than most batteries. One proposed application is to use ECs in parallel with batteries to provide a current boost during high-demand periods, like vehicle acceleration. The cost-effectiveness of this system compared to using batteries alone is uncertain. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) have long lifetimes of around 10 years and tens of thousands of charge/discharge cycles with minimal performance degradation. Unlike batteries, ECs have a varying voltage range from full voltage to zero volts, requiring additional electronics for control. They exhibit 100% resistance growth and 20-30% capacity loss over 10 years and 500k cycles. ECs are ideal for pulse power applications and perform well in cold environments down to -40 o C. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) excel in cold environments, functioning down to -40 o C with high efficiency in charge/discharge cycles. They require minimal thermal management and are suitable for high-reliability applications with short bursts of power. Commercial ECs have specific energies around 5 Wh/kg, while lithium-ion batteries offer 20 times more energy at 70-200 Wh/kg. In power applications, energy requirements determine the size of the storage device, such as a 50 kW uninterruptable power supply needing just 10 kg of ECs for a 2-minute power supply. The power requirement for ECs is 10 kg, but the 2-minute energy requirement calls for 1700 Wh of energy storage, equivalent to 340 kg of ECs. Li-ion batteries are more power-constrained, needing 100-200 kg. ECs are best for short bursts of power, while Li-ion batteries are better for longer charge/discharge cycles. ECs have seen a 250% increase in energy density and a 50% cost reduction since 2000. Traditional ECs cost around $10/kW and $17/Wh. The manufacturer's usable power and energy costs are $20/kW and $24/Wh, with ECs being cheaper than Li-ion batteries on a power basis. However, on an energy basis, ECs may not initially appear cost competitive with Li-ion batteries, but are cheaper for applications requiring frequent cycling. Commercial ECs can tolerate 500,000 full depth-of-discharge cycles, making them more cost-effective for applications with frequent cycling compared to Li-ion batteries. ECs are cheaper than Li-ion batteries with frequent cycling. The cost comparison per unit energy throughput shows that ECs are the more economical option for cycling-intense applications requiring 100 or more cycles per day. Current research focuses on reducing material and device costs, increasing energy density, and improving power and life without sacrificing performance. Manufacturing costs can be reduced by increasing electrode capacitance through surface area and pore size optimization. Electrolytes with voltages beyond 2.7V are sought, with a focus on less toxicity. Optimizing asymmetric ECs could potentially increase energy density by 8 times. Carbon is the preferred material for electrodes due to its non-reactivity in most electrolytes. Nanotube and graphene structures are being explored as alternative electrode materials. Finished carbons can be expensive but have the potential to cost less in the future. The capacitive effect for storing energy occurs at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The capacitance for storing energy at the electrode/electrolyte interface is influenced by tailored pore shapes and sizes in finished carbons, resulting in a high specific surface area. Two effects contribute to double layer capacitance: the space charge layer and the Helmholtz layer. Suitable space charge layers require electrode wall structures with a thickness greater than 1 nm, while electrode pores must be large enough for ions to fit in the Helmholtz layer. Recent discoveries suggest that smaller pores may also provide increased capacitance. The impact of increased capacitance from tailored electrodes is expected to lead to new materials with greater energy density. However, conventional electrolytes have limitations in terms of operating voltage, with common electrolytes allowing voltages up to 2.7V. Electrode shrinking and swelling at high voltages can limit cycle life, similar to battery electrodes. The calendar life of EC devices is currently limited by electrolyte degradation, with pressure buildup inside the EC case. EC life beyond 10 years is uncertain, depending on exposure to high voltages and temperatures. Asymmetric designs in carbon-carbon ECs replace the positive electrode with battery-type electrodes like NiOOH, MnOOH, PbO2, and Li4Ti5O12 to increase energy density by eight times. However, this introduces material volume expansion issues and mechanical stress that can limit cycle life. Despite challenges, there is potential for further research and optimization of hybrid devices with promising configurations and electrochemical couples under investigation. Deployment challenges similar to traditional batteries exist. Electrochemical couples, like batteries, pose deployment challenges due to potentially lethal voltage levels. Aqueous electrolytes in ECs may contain hazardous materials, such as potassium hydroxide and flammable substances like acetonitrile. Proper disposal or recycling of ECs at end-of-life is necessary. Materials in current ECs include carbon, nickel, steel, aluminum, and plastics. Advanced asymmetric ECs would utilize multiple materials. In the near term, Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs) are limited to power-related applications for grid and transportation. They have high power density and are cost-competitive for rapid discharge applications. However, their low energy density and high cost per unit of energy stored make them uncompetitive for longer discharge times. To compete with batteries, ECs need to increase their energy density significantly. Capacitors need to increase significantly in energy density to compete with batteries for electricity storage in transportation. Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs) are suitable for high power, low temperature, and high cycle-life applications like trains and buses. Pumped hydro storage (PHS) stores energy by pumping water from a lower to a higher reservoir, providing firm capacity and load leveling capabilities. Pumped hydro storage (PHS) is a significant electricity storage technology used for load following and ancillary services. In the United States, 22 GW is deployed at 39 sites, with global capacity exceeding 127 GW. Despite no large-scale PHS development in the US since 1995, Europe and Asia have continued projects due to factors like low-cost natural gas and regulatory challenges. Despite a relatively static domestic capacity for the past 15 years, there is a renewed interest in building pumped hydro storage (PHS) projects in the United States. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued preliminary permits for 45 new plants, totaling about 35 GW of capacity, with proposed plants exceeding 40 GW. PHS involves two reservoirs connected by an underground shaft and a powerhouse with turbines and electrical equipment, utilizing reversible pump-turbine units for operation. Pumped hydro storage (PHS) plants in the U.S. typically have multiple reversible pump-turbines and require suitable topographical relief for siting. The total energy stored is determined by the upper reservoir volume and height difference. PHS facilities are often large, located in remote areas, and may utilize existing water bodies to avoid additional reservoir construction. Closed-cycle PHS plants require both upper and lower reservoirs to be built if a natural water source is not available. Closed-cycle PHS plants require a water source for operation, typically from nearby rivers or streams. Some plants use treated grey water or groundwater. Existing PHS installations in the U.S. range from less than 50 MW to 2,800 MW with energy capacities of 8-15 hours. Most PHS plants can ramp rapidly and provide ancillary services. Modern plants can quickly change pumping rates, but older plants may take up to 30 minutes to switch between pumping and generation. The round-trip efficiency of Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) plants in the U.S. ranges from 65%-80%, with proposed plants expected to exceed 80% efficiency. Efficiency improvements are made through upgrades like turbine replacements and control system upgrades. Transmission requirements and losses may slightly reduce the effective efficiency of PHS plants. The New York Power Authority upgraded its Belenheim-Gilboa plant to increase its operating range. PHS plants in the U.S. have high availability and few forced outages. New PHS deployments would likely include variable speed operation for faster grid response and higher efficiencies. The cost of new Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) plants in the United States varies due to geotechnical and geological factors. Development costs mainly involve reservoirs and underground components, with a trend of increasing costs for recent plants exceeding $1000/kW. Costs are typically reported in $/kW and include energy and power components. Several completed and proposed Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) plants worldwide have varying costs, typically reported in $/kW. In Europe, proposed plants range from $700/kW to over $3000/kW, with lower-cost projects often utilizing existing formations for reservoirs. New construction with an upper reservoir significantly raises costs, with engineering estimates for more generic PHS plants ranging from $2100-$4000/kW. Table 10 provides cost estimates for Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) plants, with figures ranging from $2100-$4000/kW by the Electric Power Research Institute and $5595/kW by R.W. Beck. The cost impact of using variable speed equipment in new plants is estimated to be between $50/kW to $200/kW. PHS is considered a mature technology with little active R&D, but incremental efficiency improvements are possible. Variable speed drive technologies can enhance the flexibility of existing and future plants. Some suggest a national screening of potential PHS sites to address the perception of limited available sites for new development. Older studies indicate the potential for PHS exceeds the current installed capacity in the United States. Although there is no single comprehensive estimate of PHS potential, older studies indicate hundreds of conventional PHS sites and over 1000 GW of capacity in 6 western states, with an additional 100 GW in eastern states. Efforts are underway at DOE national labs for new PHS resource assessment. PHS requires suitable topographical relief, with a lack of sites in much of the country. Proposals exist to extend PHS deployment in non-traditional areas and decrease PHS footprint. There are proposals to decrease the footprint of PHS by using underground formations like natural aquifers or mined caverns for the lower reservoir. Cost considerations have led to the majority of proposed plants using above ground reservoirs, but updated cost estimates are needed to assess the feasibility of underground PHS. Other approaches include saltwater PHS facilities in coastal regions and a new method involving hydraulically moving a large cylindrical structure. A new storage method involves moving a cylindrical weight inside an underground pipe to store and discharge electricity. The energy storage capacity is determined by the weight and height of the column. These systems can be located anywhere with suitable geology and have a small footprint. The roundtrip efficiency is expected to be around 75%-80%, comparable to conventional PHS systems. Barriers to PHS development include high capital costs, long construction times, and regulatory permitting challenges. The construction of new Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) projects can take 10-12 years due to permitting, construction times, and environmental concerns. Opposition and regulations can further delay projects, with some completed projects not operating for years due to issues like fish kills. The construction of new Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) projects can take 10-12 years due to permitting, construction times, and environmental concerns. There is significant opposition to new PHS development based on the amount of land area flooded for reservoirs, with flooded areas ranging from 1,200 m2/MW to over 4,000 m2/MW for older facilities. New plants like Eagle Mountain and Iowa Hill aim for lower flooded area requirements of about 1,100 m2/MW. Additionally, PHS facilities require new high-voltage transmission, adding siting challenges. The construction of new Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) projects can take 10-12 years due to permitting, construction times, and environmental concerns. To minimize environmental impact and opposition, closed-cycle PHS plants are becoming more prevalent as they do not interact with natural water bodies, reducing impact on aquatic life. These plants can utilize existing features like abandoned mines to reduce development costs. A water source is needed for a closed-cycle plant to fill the reservoir initially and compensate for losses during operation. Some proposed Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) plants may use recycled wastewater or groundwater to fill reservoirs, reducing environmental impact. Closed-cycle PHS plants could undergo a streamlined FERC permitting process, potentially cutting licensing and construction times to eight years. Safety risks for PHS projects are similar to other hydro projects, with the main risk being dam failure and flooding. An example of failure occurred at the Taum Sauk plant in 2005, resulting in property damage and injuries. PHS projects require minimal toxic or rare materials. Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) technology has low environmental impact, with minimal use of toxic or rare materials and no operational emissions. It is the only electricity storage technology deployed on a large scale globally, with deployment opportunities in the United States. Variable speed technology can improve efficiency, while closed-cycle plants can reduce environmental impact and permitting time. National research and development efforts are crucial for further advancements in PHS technology. Flywheel technology has advanced significantly over the last century, with composite rotors spinning at supersonic speeds in a low-pressure vacuum. These advancements result in high power and energy densities, high roundtrip efficiency, low frictional drag losses, and long operational lifetimes. National screening for new PHS development is crucial for assessing potential while considering environmental and land use constraints. Flywheels have high power and energy densities, low frictional drag losses, and long operational lifetimes. They are valuable for frequency regulation in power grids and are cost-effective for high power applications. However, they are more expensive for energy storage and may not compete in longer storage applications. Flywheels are also used in niche transportation markets and will compete with batteries and capacitors. Their market share will depend on technological advancements in each field. The rapid charging and discharging characteristics of flywheels make them ideal for providing power quality and frequency regulation to electric grids. Other applications include uninterruptible power supply devices for telecommunication and computing, as well as mobile applications like recycling regenerative braking energy. Current research focuses on increasing energy density to enable longer energy discharge, expanding their use in electric utility applications. Beacon Power is a key player in developing flywheels for frequency regulation. Beacon Power is a main company developing and deploying flywheels for frequency regulation. They have demonstrated projects in New England and New York, but filed for bankruptcy in 2011. Flywheels store kinetic energy and can regenerate electricity later. Increasing rotational speed is crucial for energy storage. Increasing a flywheel's rotational speed is crucial for storing energy efficiently. Flywheels use an electric motor to spin a rotor at high speed, with bearings connecting the rotor to the platform. The motor/generator converts electrical energy to kinetic energy to spin up the flywheel and regenerates energy later. The containment enclosure is designed to contain rotor debris. The enclosure of a flywheel is designed to contain rotor debris in case of failure and may also hold a vacuum to reduce air drag and standby energy losses. Flywheels are used for various applications with different power and energy requirements, categorized by their design discharge times. Applications range from 1 minute discharge times for uninterruptible power supply to 15-30 minutes for frequency regulation. Some long-duration flywheels with discharge times of several hours for load shifting have been considered but not commercially deployed yet. Flywheel energy density increases with rotor mass. Flywheel energy density scales with rotor mass and the square of rotor velocity. Flywheel power density depends on how quickly the rotor can be slowed down. Flywheel roundtrip efficiency is determined by instantaneous roundtrip efficiency and standby losses. Typical instantaneous roundtrip efficiencies range from 80% to 90%. Standby losses come from frictional losses on the spinning rotor, primarily from bearings and air drag. Frictional losses from bearings and air drag contribute to standby losses of 2%-3%/hr, managed by using the motor to maintain rotor velocity. Employing superconductive magnetic bearings can reduce losses to less than 0.5% per hour, but at a higher cost. Device temperature must be managed to keep the rotor within sustainable limits due to the transformation of kinetic energy into heat. Standby losses vary depending on the amount of time energy is stored, with applications like frequency regulation markets experiencing approximately 6,000 full charge/discharge cycles per year. Flywheels can have rapid response times, ramping to full power capacity in less than four seconds for frequency regulation. They offer competitive roundtrip efficiencies of 80% in applications with short energy storage times. However, efficiencies can decrease to 50%-70% when used for shifting off-peak generation to meet on-peak load. Despite minimal standby losses, managing device temperature is crucial to prevent overheating from kinetic energy transformation into heat. Flywheels have low maintenance costs, long lifetimes, and high operational reliability. They are designed to be cycled hundreds of thousands of times with minimal performance degradation. The most common failure mode is cracks in the rotor, which can be detected early by reduced performance. Flywheel sizes and efficiencies vary depending on the application. Flywheels have low maintenance costs, long lifetimes, and high operational reliability. They are designed for various applications with different design considerations and costs based on power and energy requirements. Current costs are influenced by experience from demonstration projects, with projected cost reductions in the future due to organizational learning and economies of scale. The cost of a 20MW/5MWh demonstration project in the New York ISO was $69 million in 2009. Beacon Power aims for a cost target of $25 million-$30 million for a frequency regulation plant with 15 minutes of discharge capacity. Long-term O&M costs are still being determined, with estimates of $10-$12/kW-yr for fixed O&M and about $3/MWh for variable O&M. Flywheel R&D focuses on improving energy density, reducing losses, increasing efficiency, and lowering costs through new rotor materials. The development of new rotor materials for flywheels has significantly increased energy density, with composite rotors achieving rim velocities over 1,000 m/s. Current flywheels operate at 25% to 60% of their maximum theoretical limits due to safety factors and design limitations. Active R&D in flywheel technology focuses on improving design and materials to increase energy density. This includes developing high tensile strength materials like carbon nanotubes and new rotor designs with larger diameters to increase rim tip speeds. These advancements aim to push flywheels closer to their maximum theoretical limits for improved performance. The use of larger diameter rotors and magnetic bearings at the rim can improve controllability and reduce engineering challenges for energy flywheels. R&D efforts in the United States by universities, national laboratories, and commercial companies aim to enhance energy density and reduce costs. Flywheel R&D focuses on reducing frictional drag and air drag on the spinning rotor. This is achieved by using magnetic bearings that levitate the rotor inside its housing, which can be static, active, or superconducting. Magnetic bearings help offset resistive losses by drawing constant current. Flywheel R&D at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and other institutions focuses on reducing frictional and air drag on the spinning rotor. Magnetic bearings, including superconducting ones, help offset resistive losses. Recent advancements in flywheel power electronics have improved efficiency and durability, driven by other industries. Future R&D will likely aim to further enhance flywheel energy density. Future flywheel R&D will focus on improving energy density, magnetic bearing technology, and reducing costs. Efficiency gains in power electronics and bearings will drive incremental improvements. New materials and design modifications could lead to larger energy density improvements. Flywheels have easy permitting, no hazardous chemicals, emissions, or water use, and can be assembled in factories for delivery using standard trucks. Flywheels can be assembled in factories and delivered using standard trucks. They have a modular nature and low maintenance requirements, allowing them to be sited virtually anywhere. The physical footprint of frequency regulation flywheels is about 50 kW/m2 and 10 kWh/m2. Flywheels can be located at substations or near urban load centers, with some being sited underground for safety. Flywheels are safe and reliable with diagnosable deterioration before failure. They do not contain toxic materials and have a long calendar life. Materials used in flywheels are abundant and not subject to material shortages. Neodymium magnets may have limited supply, but alternative materials can be used. Flywheel systems are currently being deployed. Flywheel systems are being deployed using basic utility engineering and construction labor force. They are competitive for frequency regulation, but will need to compete with batteries and supercapacitors. Other potential markets include transportation and ancillary services. Flywheel R&D is ongoing to maintain market dominance. Flywheel R&D aims to enhance energy density, reduce standby losses, and lower costs through new rotor materials and designs. Thermal energy storage in buildings, often overlooked, can offer high efficiencies exceeding 90% and shape end-use electrical demands effectively. One key application of thermal energy storage in buildings is to shape end-use electrical demands by using cold storage, particularly for air conditioning. This method involves operating refrigeration equipment at night to create and store energy in the form of ice or chilled water, which can then be used during the day to reduce the operation of cooling equipment and meet building cooling loads. This approach can lead to reduced distribution capacity and losses, higher efficiency, and potentially lower costs. Thermal energy storage (TES) in buildings involves using cold storage to shift electricity demand from day to night, reducing operating costs for building owners and decreasing aggregate electric demand during on-peak periods. TES can alter the electrical demand profile associated with building space conditioning systems and has potential benefits for load shaping in buildings that use electricity for heating. Thermal energy storage systems in the United States, including ice storage and chilled water storage, are not widely applied but offer potential for winter-peaking electric utilities. There are approximately a dozen manufacturers in the US, with most technologies being mature after refinements over the past three decades. Unitary ice thermal storage systems, a recent commercialization, integrate refrigeration systems with thermal energy storage modules. An estimated 4,500 thermal energy storage systems are currently operating in the US market. Thermal energy storage systems in the United States are not widely applied, with an estimated 4,500 systems currently operating. A consortium in southern California has begun installing distributed ice storage systems for load shifting and firm capacity. TES technologies are classified into two categories based on how they store energy. Thermal energy storage systems in the United States are not widely applied, with an estimated 4,500 systems currently operating. A consortium in southern California has begun installing distributed ice storage systems for load shifting and firm capacity. TES technologies are classified into two categories based on how they store energy: \"sensible\" energy change and \"latent\" energy change. Sensible energy change systems use the heat capacity of a working fluid to store thermal energy through temperature changes, while latent energy change technologies extract and absorb heat into a storage medium that undergoes a liquid-solid phase. Thermal energy storage technologies use a storage medium that undergoes a liquid-solid phase change to absorb and store heat. Ice is commonly used, but other substances like salt solutions or ethylene glycol-water mixes can also be employed. The process involves cooling the fluid below the freezing point of water during charging, causing it to freeze, and then warming it up during a melt period to release the stored heat. Heat storage using high-heat capacity materials like bricks is a simpler form of thermal energy storage. Thermal energy storage technologies involve using a storage medium that undergoes a phase change to absorb and store heat, such as ice or high-heat capacity materials like bricks. Hot storage has disadvantages compared to ice storage, as it is mainly used for space heating and has fewer utility benefits. Controllable water heating blurs the line between energy storage and demand response, providing load-leveling applications. Thermal energy storage (TES) can provide operating reserves and load-leveling. Adding TES to a building can reduce peak demand by allowing the refrigeration plant to idle during on-peak periods. Different operating strategies for cool storage systems can alter electrical demand for a facility. Thermal energy storage (TES) systems can significantly reduce electrical demand during peak periods, offering flexibility in achieving end-use objectives. TES efficiency is typically above 90%, with some systems even exceeding 100% energy effectiveness. Comparing TES to conventional alternatives is essential for evaluating its performance metrics. Thermal energy storage (TES) systems reduce electricity demand during peak periods by converting electricity into \"cold\" without the need for intermediate energy conversion. Heat losses in storage tanks are minimal, improving equipment efficiency for air conditioning. TES allows refrigeration equipment to operate at peak efficiency during all hours, especially at night when ambient conditions are cooler. Thermal energy storage (TES) systems improve refrigeration equipment efficiency by allowing it to operate at peak efficiency during all hours, reducing total energy consumption for cooling. An example at Kraft Foods Headquarters showed that a building with ice storage TES consumed less cooling energy and had a lower peak demand compared to a non-TES building. Thermal energy storage (TES) systems reduce energy consumption and peak demand, resulting in lower electric bills. TES devices have minimal maintenance requirements and can lead to fewer or smaller chillers in buildings, reducing O&M costs compared to non-TES systems. The cost of a cooling system with TES must be compared to the system without one. The cost associated with addition of a TES is partially offset by reductions in the size of active refrigeration equipment. Building thermal storage systems have been installed at a lower capital cost compared to non-storage system counterparts. The actual costs of storage systems vary depending on sizing strategy, with estimates ranging from $500 to $1,000 per kW for ice storage systems and $2000-$3000/kW for unitary ice storage systems. The state of cool storage technologies today can be described as \"semi-mature\" with recent estimates in the range of $2000-$3000/kW for thermal storage systems. Chilled water storage system costs range from $330-$1,350 per kW. Further development efforts could focus on advanced heat transfer fluids to improve TES performance. Efforts to improve ice storage systems include using nanoparticles or micro-encapsulated phase change materials to increase heat capacity. Advances in refrigeration technologies at lower temperatures can enhance energy efficiency. Communication and control optimization can maximize the benefits of thermal energy storage systems for grid and building cooling demands. The primary barrier to thermal energy storage (TES) deployment is the lack of technology awareness among end users, policy makers, and utilities. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, outreach efforts by EPRI and its member utilities through the Thermal Storage Applications Research Center (TSARC) drove a significant number of applications. However, by the mid-1990s, support for thermal storage outreach declined, leading to a decrease in visibility and application of the technology. The decline in awareness and application of thermal storage technology highlights the need for effective outreach efforts to promote its use. Building designers lack access to tools for quick systems analysis and often perceive the technology as adding complexity and risk. Greater awareness and suitable design tools are necessary to increase consideration of thermal energy storage as a design option. A cool storage system requires more space but can be overcome with proper planning and coordination. Thermal storage systems are cost-justified in high-demand cost scenarios. Limited quantification and recovery of benefits pose challenges. Time-of-use rates play a significant role in the adoption of thermal energy storage technology. One manufacturer has developed a business model for customer-sited storage owned by the utility. Thermal energy storage (TES) has advantages over conventional electricity storage devices, storing energy with higher efficiencies and reducing the need for transmission. However, TES is tied to certain risks like tank failure and discharge of chilled water. Thermal energy storage (TES) has advantages over conventional electricity storage devices, storing energy with higher efficiencies and reducing the need for transmission. However, TES is tied to an end use (air-conditioning), limiting its flexibility compared to other storage technologies. Barriers to deployment are not technical or economic, but rather limited awareness and access to benefits. Incorporating TES into concentrating solar power (CSP) plants allows for power dispatch beyond normal operational hours. Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants with thermal energy storage (TES) enable power dispatch beyond normal operational hours, functioning similarly to other energy storage technologies for the grid. CSP with TES increases utilization of power blocks, provides firm capacity, generates higher-value electricity, and potentially reduces the cost of energy. Commercially deployed CSP plants with TES include the Andasol parabolic trough solar plants in Spain and the Gemasolar power tower with molten-salt heat-transfer fluid and storage. Construction began in Arizona on a 250-MW parabolic trough CSP plant with six hours of thermal energy storage (TES) in 2011. CSP plants are incentivized by a 30% federal investment tax credit (ITC) and the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program. The first loan guarantee of $1.45 billion was used for the Arizona project, which utilizes molten salt as the storage medium. Other storage media considered include steam accumulators, solid ceramic particles, high-temperature phase-change materials, graphite, and high-temperature concrete. In a two-tank storage system, hot heat-transfer fluid (HTF) charges molten salt in the \"hot\" storage tank. The salt, initially in the \"cold\" tank, is reheated when needed to generate steam for the turbine/generator. This indirect system uses a different storage medium (salt) from the HTF (oil) in the solar field. Other options include direct storage using molten salt as the HTF. Thermal energy storage (TES) in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants can utilize molten salt or direct steam storage to improve performance. TES allows for load following, ancillary services, and increased energy and capacity value compared to systems without storage. CSP plants like Andasol 1 can operate well into the evening with 7.5 hours of full-load storage. Power towers, with higher operating temperatures, can efficiently charge and store molten salt for thermal energy storage. Gemasolar power tower in Spain operates for 6500 hours per year with a 74% capacity factor. The Solana project in Arizona is a 250-MW net trough plant with 6 hours of molten-salt thermal storage, achieving a 40% capacity factor. CSP trough and tower plants generate electricity at utility-scale levels, ranging from 10 MW to 50 MW. The single power block in these plants allows for easy incorporation of TES. Dish/engine CSP systems have less potential for TES due to their modular design and lower generating capacity. Thermal energy storage (TES) in CSP plants has high round-trip efficiency exceeding 90%. TES can only store thermal energy from the solar field, unlike other technologies that can store electricity from any source. A typical two-tank indirect TES system using molten salt has been estimated for cost in a trough system. The cost of thermal energy storage (TES) in CSP plants varies depending on the system used. Estimates for two-tank indirect molten salt TES in a trough system are around $240/kWh, while for a two-tank direct molten salt power tower, the cost is $72/kWh. Towers use about one-third less molten salt compared to troughs due to higher temperatures. TES costs are lower compared to other storage technologies, but direct comparisons are limited as TES must be tied to a single solar plant. The levelized cost of electricity for a trough plant is approximately 19 \u00a2/kWh. The DOE aimed to make CSP technology competitive with conventional generation technologies by 2020. The DOE's SunShot Initiative, launched in 2011, aims to make large-scale solar energy systems cost competitive without subsidies by 2020. The goal is to reach cost parity with baseload energy rates, enabling widespread adoption of solar electricity in the United States. Cost reductions in CSP technologies will come from economies of scale, increased production, and improvements in performance and costs of the solar field. The cost reductions in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technologies will also depend on improvements in performance and costs of the solar field and Thermal Energy Storage (TES). One key cost driver for TES is the small temperature difference between the cold and hot fluid, which increases the required storage medium volume. Various options for cost reduction and technology improvements exist, with a focus on developing new TES materials and storage methods. Operations and maintenance for TES systems are generally minimal, but the reliability of components like molten salt pumps may impact long-term maintenance. O&M costs for TES at Andasol plants in Spain, operational since 2009, are still being determined and will require several years of operation for accurate assessment. The DOE has identified Technology Improvement Opportunities (TIOs) for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technologies, focusing on high-temperature heat transfer fluids, low-cost storage fluids, phase-change materials, and thermochemical TES. Alternative TES materials like phase-change materials, graphite, and concrete offer greater energy density and lower cost. These materials are being developed for advanced storage systems like thermocline, which store thermal energy as solids. A thermocline is a stationary storage system where a heat transfer fluid flows through a packed bed or structure to transfer thermal energy to and from solid storage material. Research efforts in the US focus on advanced CSP thermal storage materials, with various projects funded by the DOE. Deployment of advanced TES technologies could significantly improve plant efficiency. Deployment of advanced TES technologies could significantly reduce costs for CSP systems, especially in areas with high direct normal radiation like the southwestern United States. The primary barrier to TES deployment is more related to the solar plant than the storage component. The use of molten salts in TES systems has minimal environmental impact and the tanks have a small footprint compared to the solar field. The molten salt used in thermal energy storage (TES) systems has minimal environmental impact and the tanks have a small footprint compared to the solar field. A failure of the tank would result in a spill contained by a wall or berm, with the salt quickly freezing into a non-hazardous solid. Material requirements for TES are not expected to be a significant constraint, but large-scale deployment may require development of new sources. The molten salt requirement for a 100 MW trough plant with six hours of storage using a two-tank system is about 57,000 metric tons, while a tower system would require less. Nitrate salts used in TES systems are mainly sourced from deposits in the Atacama region of Chile. Proven reserves of 29.4 million metric tons are based on exploration of only 16% of total reserves. Alternative sources of nitrite salts could include synthetic production via the Haber-Bosch process. New TES materials could provide alternatives to molten salts. TES is a commercially available option for large-scale deployment with higher efficiency than most other electricity storage technologies. Cost barriers remain for large-scale deployment of TES with CSP, but improvements in CSP plant efficiency and higher-temperature technologies can reduce energy costs and increase storage capacity. Power tower technologies are expected to demonstrate good reliability and performance, making CSP/TES a viable option to decrease solar resource variability. Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) devices store energy efficiently using superconducting wires. Recent research focuses on high-temperature SMES devices to reduce costs associated with low-temperature superconductors. Research and development have focused on high-temperature SMES devices using liquid nitrogen to lower system costs compared to low-temperature SMES devices. Demonstrations have shown high costs for low-temperature systems, with commercial units having large power capacities but short discharge times due to expensive superconducting coils and cryocoolers. An example includes a set of 3 MW/0.8 kWh distributed SMES units built in 2000 for Wisconsin Public Service Corporation to enhance voltage stability in northern Wisconsin. The distributed SMES units, trailer-mounted for optimal placement, are used by utilities to enhance voltage stability and power quality, and defer new transmission line construction. They are also utilized in industrial settings to eliminate voltage sags in power supplies. However, the high cost of SMES devices needs significant reduction to compete economically with alternatives like batteries and capacitors. SMES devices are large superconducting electromagnets that store energy in a magnetic field generated by electric current flowing through superconducting wire coils. Superconducting wire coils in SMES systems enable very strong magnetic fields with high energy densities. These systems consist of a superconducting coil, cryogenic cooling system, power conditioning system, and control unit. Different superconducting materials have varying temperature requirements for achieving superconductivity. Superconducting wire coils in SMES systems use low temperature superconductors (LTS) like niobium-titanium (NbTi) or high temperature superconductors (HTS) like (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O x (BSCCO) and YBa 2 Cu 3 O x (YBCO). LTS coils require cooling to 4.5\"K with liquid helium, while HTS coils need cooling to 77\"K with liquid nitrogen. Ongoing work aims to develop less expensive YBCO coils for HTS SMES devices. Superconducting wire coils in SMES systems use low temperature superconductors (LTS) like niobium-titanium (NbTi) or high temperature superconductors (HTS) like (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O x (BSCCO) and YBa 2 Cu 3 O x (YBCO). LTS coils require cooling to 4.5\"K with liquid helium, while HTS coils need cooling to only about 77\"K with liquid nitrogen. The power electronics unit converts AC electricity to DC for storage and discharge. SMES devices provide rapid power response and are designed for tens of thousands of charge/discharge cycles with long lifetimes. Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) systems have lifetimes of around 20 years. The roundtrip efficiency ranges from 96% to 98%, with cryocooler power loads typically at 1% of capacity for LTS SMES units. Efficiency can drop to 73% if discharged once per day, but remains above 95% if charged and discharged every hour. HTS SMES units could see cryocooler loads decrease significantly. The cost of commercial SMES applications is primarily driven by the superconductive coil and cryocooler costs, limiting the economic storage capacity. Power electronics costs range from $195-$325/kW, while superconductive coil and cryocooler costs range from $395,000-$740,000/kWh. A commercially produced SMES unit (10MW/2.8kWh, 1 second discharge) is estimated at $215/kW -$285/kW. The projected costs for SMES devices are based on demonstration projects, with potential cost reductions in the future through organizational learning and economies of scale. Costs increase with higher energy storage capacity, with a $1,000/kW device having 3.5-7.5 seconds of discharge and a $2,000/kW device having 8-16 seconds. SMES may only compete in power quality markets unless significant cost improvements are made. Superconductor and cryocooler costs need substantial reductions to compete with other energy storage technologies. Cost reductions are needed for SMES to compete with other energy storage technologies. O&M costs for SMES are estimated at $16-$26/kW-yr for fixed costs and about $11-$14/kW-yr for variable costs. Research is focused on developing HTS coil materials and improving cryocooler design. BSCCO HTS storage devices have been demonstrated, but YBCO devices have not. HTS systems are currently more expensive than LTS systems. Cryocoolers play a significant role in the variable O&M costs of SMES. SMES systems are an active area of research focused on reducing costs and improving performance. They are environmentally friendly, mobile, and require management of magnetic field exposure. Material constraints are not likely to limit SMES deployment. Niobium and titanium are used in SMES applications, with niobium being rare but sufficient for production needs. Titanium is a common element mined in large quantities annually. The elements needed for HTS material YBCO are not rare and will not hinder deployment. SMES systems are mainly used for power quality applications in utility and industrial markets. Costs for SMES are driven by superconducting coil and cryocooler expenses, which need to decrease significantly for SMES to compete in various markets. Research is focused on developing high temperature superconductor materials and improving cryocooler design for SMES. High temperature superconducting (HTS) units are exploring the use of less costly materials like YBCO, aiming to reduce costs for HTS magnetic energy storage systems. Efforts are focused on developing new HTS materials across various fields, with potential cost benefits for SMES in the future. However, substantial cost reductions are needed for HTS to compete in energy-intensive storage markets. Energy storage technologies include various types such as lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries, molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC), and sodium sulfur (NaS) batteries. These technologies play a crucial role in the energy sector, with ongoing research and development efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Energy storage technologies encompass a range of options including NiMH, NOx, NREL, NYSERDA, O&M, OCC, PAFC, PEM, PEMFC, PHEV, PHS, PSI, R&D, RD&D, RTO, SLI, SMES, SOFC, T&D, TES, TIO, TOU, TWh, UPS, V2G, VG, VMT, and VOC.
