    "content": "Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 605, which establishes the National Electric System Public Benefits Fund. The National Electric System Public Benefits Fund is established to provide matching funds to States for eligible public purpose programs related to conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, universal service, and research and development. The fund is administered by the National Electric System Public Benefits Board. The National Electric System Public Benefits Fund provides matching funds to States for programs related to conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, universal service, and research and development. Matching funds refer to an equal distribution of State and section-provided funds. The Secretary of Energy is defined as the 'Secretary'. 'State commission' and 'transmitting utility' meanings are from the Federal Power Act. Renewable energy includes various sources except for municipal solid waste incineration. Energy efficiency refers to cost-effective programs improving end-use electricity consumption efficiency. The National Electric System Public Benefits Fund supports programs for conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, universal service, and research. It includes efforts to transform markets, develop codes and standards, provide technical support, and offer financing for efficient end-use equipment. Programs promoting high-quality and affordable electric service for low-income consumers and those in rural or high-cost areas are also supported. A National Electric System Public Benefits Board will be established with 3 federal officers, 4 State commissioners, and oversight by the Secretary. Rules and procedures, including selecting a non-Federal fiscal agent, will be finalized within 180 days. Contributions from electric power generation facilities are required for transmitting power. The generation facility must contribute funds based on kilowatt hours transmitted to support eligible public purpose programs. Contributions should not exceed 2 mills per kilowatt hour and must be collected by transmitting utilities and transferred to the designated fiscal agent monthly. The Board will establish regulations for a Public Benefits Program within 90 days of the Secretary's rules promulgation. The Board will establish regulations for a Public Benefits Program, including criteria for eligibility of State public service programs. A non-Federal fiscal agent will receive and disburse contributions, and States can apply for matching funding for eligible programs. Matching funds can only be used for eligible programs, and expenditures will be audited regularly. The Board will establish regulations for a Public Benefits Program, including criteria for eligibility of State public service programs. A non-Federal fiscal agent will distribute contributions to States for eligible public purpose programs. States must apply for matching funds at least 3 months before the start of the calendar year and certify the intended use of the funds. The State must certify the use of moneys for eligible public purpose programs and specify the projected State support for the coming year. The Board will calculate the funds needed to match the State's support for the programs. If the requested matching funds exceed projected revenues, each State's funds will be reduced accordingly. The fiscal agent distributes matching funds to States for eligible public purpose programs designated by the State. The program established under this section should not replace existing programs supporting conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, universal service, or research and development."
