    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act.\" It includes findings and purposes related to the conservation and management of Dungeness crab. The Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act recognizes the successful conservation efforts of Washington, Oregon, and California for the ocean Dungeness crab fishery since the 19th century. These states have enacted laws and formed committees to promote coastwide conservation of the resource. The committee coordinates conservation and management actions, tribal treaty rights to crab are implemented through negotiations with Indian tribes, expiration of interim authority may affect State-tribal harvest agreements, and the Magnuson-Stevens Act requires federal fishery management plans. The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows individual States or interstate organizations to manage certain fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, like king crab in the Gulf of Alaska. The Sustainable Fisheries Act gave Washington, Oregon, and California limited jurisdiction over the ocean Dungeness crab fishery. The Pacific Fishery Management Council is required to report to Congress on progress in developing a fishery management plan for ocean Dungeness crab. The Pacific Fishery Management Council diligently carried out responsibilities by consulting with Indian tribes, Dungeness crab industry representatives, and fishery management agencies from Washington, Oregon, and California. The Council unanimously voted to amend the Sustainable Fisheries Act for permanent authority. The Pacific Fishery Management Council unanimously voted to amend the Sustainable Fisheries Act to provide permanent authority to the States of Washington, Oregon, and California to manage the ocean Dungeness crab fishery in their respective exclusive economic zones, recognizing the contributions of the states and the needs of Indian tribes. The Act aims to conserve and manage the crab fishery in the public interest. The Pacific Fishery Management Council amended the Sustainable Fisheries Act to give permanent authority to Washington, Oregon, and California to manage the ocean Dungeness crab fishery in their exclusive economic zones. This decision recognizes the contributions of the states and the needs of Indian tribes with tribal treaty rights to crab. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as exclusive economic zone, fishery, and fishing. SEC. 4. AUTHORITY FOR MANAGEMENT OF DUNGENESS CRAB. The Pacific Fishery Management Council amended the Sustainable Fisheries Act to grant permanent authority to Washington, Oregon, and California to manage the Dungeness crab fishery in their exclusive economic zones. Each of the States of Washington, Oregon, and California may enforce State laws governing fishing in the exclusive economic zone for Dungeness crab fisheries without a management plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. These laws apply equally to vessels operating in the exclusive economic zone. The State laws of Washington, Oregon, and California can enforce fishing regulations in the exclusive economic zone for Dungeness crab fisheries. These laws do not apply to vessels exercising tribal treaty rights and must align with a court decision in United States v. Washington, D.C. No. CV-70-09213. Additionally, any limited entry system for Dungeness crab fisheries in these states cannot be enforced against vessels legally fishing in the adjacent exclusive economic zone. No vessel may harvest or process Dungeness crab in the exclusive economic zone adjacent to Washington, Oregon, or California without a permit from any of these states or tribal treaty rights, as per the United States District Court decision. This section does not intend to diminish state authority, except as specified. The section does not reduce state authority under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to regulate fishing activities. Elimination of interim authority by striking subsection (d) in Section 112 of the Sustainable Fisheries Act."
