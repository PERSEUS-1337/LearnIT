    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that the FDA's 1977 conclusion on the risks of feeding livestock low doses of antibiotics was not acted upon, despite laws requiring action. The FDA's 2013 guidance on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in livestock is unlikely to reduce such use significantly due to a broad exemption for disease prevention. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have a significant impact on society, with costs estimated to be between $16.6 billion and $26 billion annually for healthcare and an additional $35 billion from lost productivity due to illnesses. In April 1999, a study by the United States Government Accountability Office found that salmonella, campylobacter, and E. Coli strains causing foodborne illnesses in humans are resistant to antibiotics due to their use in animals. Surveys in 1999, 2006, and 2011 by the USDA revealed high percentages of swine, cattle, and sheep farms administering antimicrobials for health or growth reasons. Many antimicrobials identified in animals are similar to drugs used in human medicine, such as tetracyclines, macrolides, penicillins, and sulfonamides. These drugs are used to treat serious diseases in humans, including pneumonia, scarlet fever, sexually transmitted infections, and pandemics like malaria and plague. In June 2002, a report by experts recommended limiting antimicrobial use in agriculture to therapy for diseased animals or prophylaxis in herds/flocks. In March 2003, the National Academy of Sciences emphasized the need to decrease inappropriate antimicrobial use in animals to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In 2010, a study in \u201cMolecular Cell\u201d showed low-dosage antibiotics lead to genetic mutation concerns in agriculture. Danish ban on nontherapeutic antibiotics reduced resistance in bacterial species. FDA reported high usage of antibacterial drugs in food animals compared to human health in 2010. In the United States, a significant amount of antibacterial drugs are used on food-producing animals, leading to the development of antibiotic resistance. A ban on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in these animals could help preserve antibiotics for human medicine. Denmark's ban on nontherapeutic antibiotics had minimal impact on animal health and only slightly increased production costs. The CDC reported that antibiotic resistance, caused by overuse or misuse of antibiotics in human medicine and agriculture, leads to at least 23,000 deaths and two million illnesses annually in the United States. In 2013, a study in \"The Journal of the American Medical Association\" linked antibiotic-resistant skin infections to hog farms in Pennsylvania. A 2014 study in \"Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology\" found a higher risk of MRSA in people near swine-feeding operations in Iowa. The FDA's monitoring system shows retail meat often contains antibiotic-resistant bacteria. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in food-producing animals has a direct negative impact on human health, increasing the risk of acquiring infections with resistant bacteria, especially in children. Many scientific studies confirm this link between antibiotic use in animals and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in people. The Legislature aims to address the overuse of antibiotics in livestock production to reduce the risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria spreading to Californians through food and other pathways."
