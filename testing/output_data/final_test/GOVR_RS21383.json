Ricin is often mentioned as a potential bioterror weapon and has been posed a terrorist and criminal threat. CBS News reported in 2010 that the Department of Homeland Security had uncovered a credible threat of attacks using poisons like ricin. Unknown individuals have sent letters and packages containing ricin to federal officials. Ricin is a potent plant toxin found in castor plant seeds. It blocks cell protein synthesis, leading to cell death, organ failure, and potentially death. The extraction of ricin from castor beans can lead to organ failure and death. Various methods for extracting ricin are available, with some producing crude preparations and others nearly pure ricin. Exposure to ricin can result in symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and shock. Ingestion of ricin can lead to death within three to five days, while injection can cause severe internal bleeding and tissue death, resulting in organ system collapse and death. Inhalation or ingestion of ricin can lead to organ failure and death. The lethal dosage depends on the route of exposure, with inhaled or injected doses as low as 3 to 5 micrograms per kilogram body weight being lethal. Detection methods for ricin release include automated air samplers and swab-type tests. Highly sensitive laboratory-based tests can also be used for detection. Health care workers diagnosing ricin poisoning may be a leading signal of a covert ricin attack. Laboratories in the CDC Laboratory Response Network perform confirmatory testing for ricin presence using various methods, including testing for castor bean components and ricin toxin. Detection systems in some locations can indicate the presence of ricin, but are not widely implemented in civilian settings. Testing for castor bean components and ricin toxin takes six to eight hours to complete. No ricin vaccine is currently available for the general public. The Department of Defense has conducted animal studies and human safety studies on vaccines for ricin. Research is ongoing in academic and private sectors to develop new vaccines. Passive prophylaxis, using antibodies from immunized animals, is effective against injected and ingested ricin. Vaccination is the most effective prophylaxis for inhaled ricin. No approved medicine specifically treats ricin exposure, requiring hospitalization and supportive care. Activated charcoal is recommended for ingestion cases to limit ricin effects. Ricin has been considered as a potential weapon since 1918, with reports of weaponization attempts by the US, UK, and Iraq. It was used in the assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov in 1978. Researchers are working on finding more effective treatments for ricin exposure. Individuals have been arrested and convicted for attempting to possess ricin, often through makeshift laboratories. In some cases, ricin has been sent to government officials, such as a letter intercepted in 2003 addressed to the Department of Transportation and an envelope intercepted in 2003 addressed to the White House. Ricin was also detected in the Dirksen Senate Office Building in 2004. Additionally, trace amounts of ricin were found in Afghanistan and an insurgent group in Iraq reportedly had access to ricin. Many experts believe that ricin would be difficult to use as a weapon of mass destruction due to logistical impracticality and technical barriers. While causing mass casualties is challenging, ricin could still be a formidable weapon in small-scale attacks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorize ricin as a Category B Agent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorize ricin as a Category B Agent due to its potential for moderate morbidity rates and low mortality rates. Ricin is considered a biological and chemical weapon, prohibited by international treaties such as the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention, which the United States is a party to. These agreements aim to prevent the development, production, and use of chemical and biological weapons. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 restrict the possession, transfer, and use of ricin. The USA PATRIOT Act limits ricin access to select researchers who undergo background investigations by the FBI. Facilities with ricin above certain thresholds must register with the Department of Health and Human Services and maintain security measures. It is legal to possess or transfer castor beans and plants; only isolated ricin is regulated. Castor beans and plants are openly sold in the US, with plants growing naturally in the southwest."
