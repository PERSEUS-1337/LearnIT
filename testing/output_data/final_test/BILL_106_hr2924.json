    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hedge Fund Disclosure Act\". The Congress finds that hedge funds operate outside US banking, securities, and futures laws. The recent crisis showed how major financial institutions' conditions are tied to hedge funds. Financial institutions invest in, lend to, and trade with hedge funds, often mirroring their strategies. Hedge funds use financial leveraging more than regulated entities. Hedge funds use high leverage, posing a threat to financial systems. Market forces, not regulations, should constrain excessive leverage. Government must prevent hedge fund failures from burdening the economy. The failure of one or more hedge funds does not severely burden the US financial system or payments system. Federal resources should not be wasted on saving collapsed hedge funds. Market forces need reliable information on hedge fund activities to properly function. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines key terms such as \"Board,\" \"Federal banking agencies,\" and \"unregulated hedge fund,\" specifying criteria for the latter. The curr_chunk specifies criteria for pooled investment vehicles with total assets over $20,000,000,000.

Unregulated hedge funds must submit quarterly reports to the Board, including total assets, derivatives position, and market risk measures. The Board will transmit these reports to relevant agencies and make them available to the public, while ensuring any proprietary information is sequestered as per regulations. The Board, in consultation with key agencies, will segregate certain information in a confidential section of reports. Regulations must be proposed and finalized within specific time frames to allow for public comment. The Board may issue orders to unregulated hedge funds to comply with proposed regulations. SEC. 5.
