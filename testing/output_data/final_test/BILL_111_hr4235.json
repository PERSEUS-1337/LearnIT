The Secretary determines interim payments for hospitals based on the number of residents trained during the hospital's most recent Medicare cost report filing period. Up to 25 percent may be withheld from each installment to prevent overpayment. At the end of each fiscal year, any changes in resident numbers are reconciled, and overpayments are recouped.
