    "content": "DeFINE is a new method for learning deep word-level representations efficiently in sequence models. It uses a hierarchical structure with skip-connections to reduce total parameters and training time while maintaining or improving performance. Compared to other methods, DeFINE results in a 6% to 20% drop in perplexity and reduces total parameters by half in Transformer-XL on WikiText-103. In the Penn Treebank, DeFINE improves AWD-LSTM by 4 points with a 17% reduction in parameters, achieving comparable performance with fewer parameters. DeFINE improves Transformer model performance by 2% and reduces parameters by 26% for machine translation. Neural models for NLP tasks require large vocabularies and employ a similar architecture with embedding layers. DeFINE introduces a more efficient word embedding method for neural sequence modeling, reducing parameters compared to standard methods while maintaining performance. This approach allows for lower-dimensional input and output mappings in sequence models, reducing computational burden without sacrificing performance. DeFINE introduces a hierarchical group transformation (HGT) to learn deep representations efficiently in sequence models. It replaces standard word embedding layers with more powerful representations, maintaining performance while reducing computational burden. The model incorporates a new skip-connection for improved information flow and can be used with various sequence modeling architectures. Transformer-XL, a state-of-the-art language model, benefits from DeFINE by learning input and output representations in low-dimensional space, reducing parameters significantly without impacting performance. Experiments show that both LSTM and Transformer models benefit from DeFINE, with LSTM models showing a 9 point improvement on the Wikitext-103 dataset using half as many parameters. When combined with adaptive input and output representations, DeFINE improves performance by about 3 points across LSTM and Transformer-XL models with minimal increase in training parameters. DeFINE enhances language models like AWD-LSTM and Transformer by reducing parameters without affecting performance. It improves efficiency in tasks like machine translation while maintaining quality. The majority of model parameters are in input and output layers, leading to computational load, which DeFINE addresses effectively. To reduce computational load in language models, weight-tying and factorization-based methods like projective embeddings and grouped embeddings have been introduced. Projective embeddings approximate large matrices with smaller ones, while grouped embeddings cluster input tokens by frequency for more efficient learning. The adaptive input method of Baevski & Auli (2019) generalizes projective and grouped embedding methods by proposing a factorization method for faster, memory-efficient training. DeFINE extends group transformation with the shuffling algorithm of Fisher & Yates (1943) to factorize layers, showing improved performance compared to existing methods. Recent advances in sequence modeling, like Transformers and multi-layer RNNs, highlight the effectiveness of deep architectures in NLP. DeFINE allows for learning deep representations of various token types, such as words, characters, or byte-pair encodings, extending beyond traditional word embeddings. The embedding layer in NLP research is typically seen as a simple function mapping words to a continuous space. While a shallow network can approximate this function, a deeper network may require fewer parameters to achieve a good approximation, as suggested by recent theoretical results. DeFINE is introduced as an effective method for learning deep word-level representations in high-dimensional space with minimal additional parameters. It is based on the Map-Expand-Reduce (MER) principle, utilizing a hierarchical group transformation (HGT) to transform input words to a high-dimensional space. A new connectivity pattern promotes feature reuse and improves gradient flow in the network. DeFINE is a method for learning deep word-level representations using the Map-Expand-Reduce (MER) principle. It involves mapping input words to a fixed dimensional vector, applying a hierarchical group transformation (HGT) to produce a high-dimensional vector, and then reducing it to a lower dimensional space to generate the final embedding vector. This process promotes feature reuse and improves gradient flow in the network. DeFINE utilizes a hierarchical group transformation (HGT) to efficiently learn deep word-level representations. HGT consists of a stack of layers with varying numbers of groups, starting with g max groups and decreasing by a factor of 2 at each level. This sparsifies connections in fully connected linear transforms. The hierarchical grouping mechanism in HGT sparsifies connections in fully connected layers, allowing for efficient learning with fewer parameters. It enables the N-th layer to access input data from multiple paths, leading to stronger representations compared to GLT layers. HGT is efficient and provides better access to input data. Linear and group linear transforms are special cases of HGT. HGT samples space between dimensions linearly to construct intermediate layers. Group transformation splits input into groups for independent processing. The DeFINE unit in HGT utilizes HGT transformations designed with the MER principle. Residual connections are effective for mitigating training issues as the depth of the DeFINE unit increases. A new skip-connection is introduced to establish direct links between layers in HGT and the input. The DeFINE unit in HGT utilizes sparse connections to efficiently learn word-level representations and maximize information flow. It chunks input and output vectors, mixes them, and feeds them to the next layer, promoting input feature reuse and establishing a direct link with the input for improved performance. This mechanism can be easily integrated with any sequence models. DeFINE unit can be integrated with sequence models like Transformer-XL, reducing network parameters by enabling the use of lower dimensions in the input layer. It learns deep word-level representations independently for each word, allowing for the creation of a lookup table to skip computations. DeFINE unit integrates with sequence models like Transformer-XL, reducing network parameters by using lower dimensions in the input layer. It learns deep word-level representations independently for each word, enabling the creation of a lookup table to skip computations. The performance of DeFINE is demonstrated on language modeling and machine translation tasks, comparing it with existing factorization methods. Ablations show the effectiveness of design decisions, with results presented for LSTM-based language models on the WikiText-103 dataset. Our method improves performance by about 3 points with only 1.25% more parameters. Scaling the depth of DeFINE from 3 to 11 layers further improves performance by 6 points, competing with RNN-based methods with fewer parameters. Our model outperforms existing methods like Dauphin et al. (2017) and Bai et al. (2018). The method presented in the study achieves similar performance to Dai et al. (2019) with 10M fewer parameters. DeFINE reduces computational burden with minimal impact on performance, as shown by Transformer-XL's performance drop of only 2 points while reducing parameters by 50%. The proposed method effectively learns word-level representations, as evidenced by a 5-point drop in performance for the original Transformer-XL with a similar reduction in parameters. Transformer-XL with DeFINE achieves comparable perplexity to a standard Transformer-XL with projective embeddings while using significantly fewer parameters. Table 2a and 2b demonstrate the effectiveness of adding DeFINE to improve results with low overhead and reduce parameters for similar performance. The study uses the Penn Treebank dataset and compares the model to AWD-LSTM, replacing the embedding layer with DeFINE unit. The proposed method enhances AWD-LSTM performance by 4 points and reduces parameters by 4 million. AWD-LSTM + DeFINE achieves comparable results to Transformer-XL without finetuning. The study uses the WMT 2014 EN-DE dataset for training and integrates DeFINE with the Transformer model. The implementation in OpenNMT-py for training and evaluation with recommended hyper-parameters shows improved performance and efficiency of sequence models across different tasks with DeFINE. Strong correlations between dimensions in the mapping layer of DeFINE are reduced over the expansion layers. In this section, an analysis of design choices using an LSTM-based language model is provided. The impact of different transformations is discussed, with HGT being as effective as linear transformation but learning fewer parameters. HGT also outperforms GLT in terms of perplexity improvement. When analyzing design choices in an LSTM-based language model, HGT is as effective as linear transformation but learns fewer parameters. The performance improves with increased depth N, but scaling width k does not show improvement due to redundant parameters. Residual connections in DeFINE have a positive impact on performance. In DeFINE, the dimension of each layer is fixed to k^2 for better skip-connections. The MER strategy projects vectors to a lower dimension before using a contextual model like LSTM. Experiments show that reducing dimensions doesn't significantly affect performance. DeFINE utilizes a deep, sparse network with skip connections for efficient word embeddings. Sequence models with DeFINE perform comparably or better with fewer parameters. Architectural decisions in DeFINE contribute to its effectiveness in neural sequence models. In future work, DeFINE can be applied to other sequence modeling tasks, enhancing pretrained language model architectures like ELMo and BERT. The components of DeFINE, such as MER, HGT, and mixing layers, can be utilized in neural architecture search processes to discover optimal configurations. The process involves chunking input data into groups and concatenating them before multiplication with weight matrices. DeFINE involves chunking input data into groups, concatenating them, and multiplying with weight matrices to produce a flattened vector. Different variants of DeFINE are illustrated in block diagrams. Training is done using GPUs with specific memory capacities. Adaptive inputs and adaptive softmax are used for classification in DeFINE. For experiments with RNN-based sequence models, adaptive inputs are used as a mapping function in DeFINE, along with adaptive softmax for classification. Weight tying is implemented between adaptive inputs and outputs. Transformer-XL utilizes projective embeddings and is trained using PyTorch (v1.2). Similar hyper-parameters as Merity et al. (2018a) are used for LSTM-based language models. The validation perplexity of Transformer-XL on WikiText-103 is plotted in Figure 6, showing that DeFINE enables similar performance with fewer parameters. The correlation map is computed by mapping every word in the vocabulary to a m-dimensional vector space and calculating the correlation map M as M = E T \u00b7 E. DeFINE aims to encode contextual representations efficiently by ensuring embedding dimensions are independent. Comparison of correlation maps between standard, projective, and DeFINE embeddings shows DeFINE approximates the standard layer effectively. Layer-wise comparisons further demonstrate DeFINE's efficiency in low-dimensional mapping space. DeFINE effectively approximates the standard embedding layer by reducing correlations in deeper representations. The groups at different expansion layers in DeFINE are independent, learning different representations of their input."
