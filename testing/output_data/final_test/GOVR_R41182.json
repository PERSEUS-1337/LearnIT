    "content": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided housing assistance through various programs where private owners developed and owned rental housing projects in exchange for affordable housing commitments. These programs created hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units from the late 1950s to the late 1980s, benefiting nearly 1.4 million families. Affordability restrictions on these properties began to expire in the 1980s, posing a risk to the availability of affordable housing. Efforts to maintain affordability of HUD-assisted properties as restrictions end are crucial to prevent displacement of low- and moderate-income tenants. This report focuses on preservation efforts for six specific HUD programs, including financing assistance through low-interest loans and rental assistance to property owners. The Section 202 loan program, active from 1959 to 1990, provided direct low-interest loans to property owners. The Section 202 loan program, active from 1959 to 1990, provided low-interest loans for affordable housing development. HUD also had the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program from 1961 to 1968, and the Section 236 program from 1968 to 1974, both supporting affordable housing projects with mortgage insurance and subsidy payments. These programs collectively financed hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units. The Section 236 program helped finance the development of approximately 400,000 units of affordable housing, with over 150,000 still having active loans insured through the program. Other rental-assistance programs covered in the report include the Rent Supplement program and the Rental Assistance Payment (RAP) program. Most contracts from these programs have been converted to Section 8 assistance, but some units still receive assistance. The Section 8 project-based program provided long-term rental assistance contracts to owners of newly constructed or rehabilitated properties. Roughly 1.2 million units still receive Section 8 project-based rental assistance. This report focuses on programs with expiring use restrictions, including Section 236 properties, due to concerns about private for-profit owners' interests in providing affordable housing. The report discusses six housing programs with expiring affordability restrictions, contrasting them with newer programs with longer restrictions. Past attempts by Congress to address housing preservation have had varying success. The report does not cover programs from the Department of Agriculture's Rural Housing Service. Figure 1 shows the universe of rental units created under the six programs. The report discusses housing units receiving rental assistance through various programs like Section 8, Rent Supplement, RAP, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR, Section 236, and Section 202. The diagram illustrates the overlap between these programs. Table A-1 in Appendix A provides a summary of the properties in assisted housing preservation. The report is divided into six sections, detailing programs with housing preservation issues, how affordability restrictions end, efforts to extend restrictions, and preservation priorities. The report discusses factors that interested parties consider when preserving assisted housing, data on properties and units in various programs, options for preservation, and HUD's history of using subsidies for affordable housing. Appendices include property summaries and a glossary of terms. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provided insurance on mortgages to developers, allowing them to charge lower rents to tenants. Later, the government began paying a portion of tenant rents directly to owners through programs like Section 8. Private owners received assistance from HUD through various programs for housing preservation concerns. HUD subsidized affordable housing production in the 1960s and 1970s with incentives to private developers. Through incentives to private developers, including low-interest loans and mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), building owners were able to charge affordable rents to low- and moderate-income families. In exchange for HUD assistance, owners agreed to maintain affordability for a set period. Programs like Section 202, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR, and Section 236 utilized these incentives. While initially lacking rental assistance, HUD has provided it over time to ensure affordability for low-income households. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program, part of the Housing Act of 1959, initially provided direct loans to nonprofit organizations to develop affordable housing for elderly households. In 1990, the program shifted to offering capital grants instead of loans. This report focuses on the loan program as affordability restrictions for properties funded by grants will not expire until around 2030. The Section 202 program initially provided low-interest loans for housing development until 1974, with units set aside for moderate-income and elderly households. Changes in 1974 introduced the use of the U.S. Treasury's borrowing rate for loans and added Section 8 rental assistance for low-income tenants, with contracts lasting 20 years. The Section 202 housing program has varying income eligibility based on the development phase. Units developed before 1962 have no income restrictions, while those from 1962 to 1974 serve low-income tenants. Units developed after 1974 cater to low- or very-low-income tenants. Approximately 216,204 units were developed during the loan phase, with 144,506 units currently having active loans. The Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program was established in 1961 to provide affordable housing. The BMIR program, part of the Housing Act of 1961, provided affordable housing for families with moderate incomes. Private lenders offered FHA-insured loans with low interest rates for multifamily rental projects. The program was replaced by Section 236 in 1968. BMIR units have income restrictions up to 95% of the area median income. HUD sets and adjusts BMIR rents based on property budgets. The Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program created 159,000 units in 845 properties, with 15,218 units in 124 properties currently active. The Section 236 program, part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, provided mortgage insurance for affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families from 1969 to 1973. The Section 236 program provided mortgage subsidies to building owners for affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families. Owners only paid a 1% interest rate on their mortgages through Interest Reduction Payments (IRPs), allowing them to charge lower rents to tenants. The Section 236 program offers affordable housing to low-income households, with owners able to prepay mortgages after 20 years. Tenants pay either basic rent or market rate rent, determined by the property owner and subject to HUD approval. Rent is based on 30% of income or the basic rent, whichever is higher, with some tenants receiving rent subsidies. The Section 236 program provides affordable housing to low-income households with rent subsidies available. Initially, subsidies were provided through Rent Supplement or RAP programs, later converted to Section 8 assistance. Approximately 155,449 units in 1,418 properties are insured through the Section 236 program, with as many as 249,000 units receiving IRPs. Owners can prepay mortgages and still receive IRPs through \"decoupling.\" The federal government began providing project-based rental assistance contracts to private property owners to target housing assistance to the poorest families while ensuring financial viability of properties. This assistance allowed tenants to pay lower, income-based rents. The Rent Supplement program, part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, subsidized rent payments for low-income households in federally assisted properties. HUD contracts with building owners covered the difference between tenant income and rent, with up to 20% of units in a building eligible for assistance. The Rent Supplement program, part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, subsidized rent payments for low-income households in federally assisted properties. Up to 20% of units in a building were eligible for Rent Supplement payments, later raised to 30%. Rent Supplement contracts were written for the duration of the HUD-insured mortgage and were converted to Section 8 contracts in the mid-1980s. At its peak, the program assisted 179,908 units, but today there are far fewer contracts remaining. The Rental Assistance Payment (RAP) program was created in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to provide additional rental-assistance contracts to Section 236 properties. RAP contracts were limited to 20% of a property's units and written for the duration of the FHA-insured mortgage or 40 years. Today, there are about 12,847 Rent Supplement units primarily in state-aided properties. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 created the Rental Assistance Payment (RAP) program for Section 236 properties, with contracts lasting the duration of the mortgage or 40 years. Most RAP contracts were converted to Section 8 contracts in the mid-1980s. The Section 8 program included new construction, substantial rehabilitation, and existing housing certificates to promote new housing development and subsidize rents in existing housing stock. HUD later expanded Section 8 project-based rental assistance to properties with HUD financing assistance. The Section 8 program involved long-term contracts with private property owners to construct or rehabilitate units for low-income tenants. HUD made housing assistance payments to cover the rent difference for tenants based on their income. Financing for these properties varied, including FHA-insured mortgages and state-based financing. The Section 8 program required a contribution towards rent based on adjusted income, not exceeding 110% of Fair Market Rent. Assistance was tenant-based, with certificates provided to eligible families to rent housing of their choice in the private sector. The Section 8 program provided rental assistance to eligible families, covering the difference between the tenant's contribution (30% of income) and the rent. The program also included a Moderate Rehabilitation component for housing repairs. Concerns arose in the 1980s about high per-unit costs and slow development times. In the 1980s, concerns arose about high costs and slow development times in the Section 8 program, leading to unused funding accumulation. This resulted in the repeal of certain segments of the program in the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 (P.L. 98-181), which introduced a new tenant-based housing voucher program. The Section 8 existing program was eventually replaced by the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. The Section 8 program was eventually replaced by the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, the largest direct housing assistance program today. Other forms of Section 8 project-based rental assistance were developed after the 1974 act, targeting properties constructed with HUD-assisted financing through various programs. HUD introduced the Section 8 Loan Management Set Aside (LMSA) initiative in 1976 to reduce claims on HUD's FHA insurance fund and lower rent burdens on low-income families. Financially troubled FHA-insured properties could receive up to 100% of their units' rental assistance, allowing tenants to pay income-based rents. The Section 8 Loan Management Set Aside (LMSA) initiative provided rental assistance to financially troubled FHA-insured properties, allowing tenants to pay income-based rents up to 100% of Fair Market Rent (FMR). The federal government covered the difference between tenant rents and a rent level to prevent default. Rents could be adjusted annually based on owner requests or an Annual Adjustment Factor (AAF). Section 8 contract terms were initially five years, renewable in five-year increments, but funding for LMSA was stopped in FY1994. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 expanded HUD's provision of Section 8 contracts in various circumstances. HUD facilitated the sale of FHA-insured properties acquired through foreclosure, including those from the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR and Section 236 programs. Rental-assistance contracts were provided to purchasers through the Section 8 Property Disposition program. In 1995, HUD transitioned to using Section 8 tenant-based vouchers instead of new property disposition contracts. The Housing Preservation Program incentivized owners of HUD-assisted multifamily properties to keep them affordable by entering into project-based Section 8 contracts. This program ran from 1987 onwards. The Section 8 project-based rental-assistance program incentivized owners to keep their properties affordable. It ran from 1987 to 1996, but was discontinued in 1997 for cost-saving reasons. Despite no new contracts being entered into, there are still roughly 1.2 million Section 8 project-based units under contract. These units were subsidized through various versions of Section 8, with different methods of subsidy. The Annual Contributions Contracts between owners and HUD outline the subsidized units, rent levels, and maintenance requirements. Owners of properties under the Section 8 project-based rental-assistance program must maintain their properties to HUD standards and contribute to a replacement reserve account. When contracts expire, owners can choose to renew with HUD or leave the program and charge market rents. Tenants receive vouchers if the owner ends the contract. Various reasons may lead owners to leave HUD subsidized housing programs. HUD subsidized housing programs may end in high-rent areas if owners decide to pay off mortgages or not renew Section 8 contracts to convert to market-rate housing or sell for profit. HUD can terminate contracts if properties deteriorate or owners violate rules. Affordability restrictions end when mortgages are prepaid, mature, or HUD terminates contracts. Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3) programs can end through prepayment or maturation. Contracts can end through mortgage prepayment or maturation. HUD inserted clauses allowing owners to prepay after 20 years without approval. For-profit owners can prepay, making up 62% of Section 236 housing stock. Owners became eligible to prepay by the mid-1990s. Prepayment eligibility depends on rental-assistance contracts. Owners without contracts can prepay, and tenants receive enhanced Section 8. Owners with Rent Supplement contracts cannot prepay their mortgages. For owners with Section 8 contracts, rental-assistance payments continue through the contract term, after which the owner can opt out of the Section 8 program. Income-eligible tenants receive enhanced Section 8 vouchers. Between 1998 and 2004, approximately 1,409 Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3) BMIR property owners prepaid their mortgages. Owners can also choose to convert units to market-rate housing at the end of the 40-year mortgage term, terminating any Rent Supplement contracts still in place. Section 8 contracts continue until their maturation. The Section 202 owners were given the option to prepay their loans with HUD permission under certain circumstances. However, they are required to continue operating the property under terms at least as advantageous to tenants as those under the original loan. If there is a rental-assistance contract in place, the property owner must continue to operate under the terms specified. In 2010, the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act allowed HUD to approve prepayment of existing Section 202 loans if owners agreed to maintain affordability for 20 years. Some properties financed between 1977 and 1982 have the right to prepay without HUD permission, but most units also received Section 8 assistance, ensuring tenant assistance continues even after prepayment. The prepayment of Section 202 loans in 2010 allowed for continued tenant assistance through Section 8 vouchers. Rent Supplement contracts terminate upon prepayment, while Section 8 contracts continue until expiration. Section 202 units may convert to market-rate housing after 40-50 years. Rent Supplement contracts end with the loan, and Section 8 contracts provide enhanced vouchers if not renewed. Unassisted units do not receive Section 8 vouchers at mortgage maturation. When Section 8 project-based housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts expire, property owners can choose to renew the contract with HUD or leave the program. Factors influencing this decision include the housing market, available options, and the owner's mission/profit orientation. If the property is in poor condition, HUD may choose not to renew the contract. Tenants are provided with vouchers when a HAP contract with HUD ends. When Section 8 project-based housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts expire, property owners can choose to renew the contract with HUD or leave the program. Owners of over 11,000 properties renewed their Section 8 contracts, while owners of 1,363 properties opted out. HUD has no authority to renew RAP and Rent Supplement contracts when they expire, leading to different outcomes for tenants. HUD assesses the physical and financial health of multifamily housing through REAC. Property owners must maintain their properties according to local building codes and UPCS to receive assistance. Inspections are conducted, and properties with scores below 60 are considered at risk. HUD assesses multifamily housing through REAC, assigning numeric scores. Properties below 60 are at risk and referred to DEC. Owners must make repairs within 60 days to avoid defaulting on assistance contracts. HUD can end Section 8 contracts, pursue foreclosure, or encourage property transfer. HUD has broad discretion in enforcing regulations for privately owned, HUD-insured properties. While most properties meet physical standards, those that fail inspections may have health and safety issues. Owners must submit financial statements for review by REAC to ensure financial health, proper fund usage, and compliance with agreements. HUD has broad discretion in enforcing regulations for privately owned, HUD-insured properties. If an owner mismanages federal funds, HUD can find them in default of the assistance contract, leading to financial penalties or contract termination. According to HUD's FY2009 report, most multifamily properties had no compliance issues. From 1998 to 2004, 2,385 properties with 182,945 units left the assisted housing stock due to HUD enforcement or foreclosure. When affordability restrictions on a HUD-assisted property end, low-income tenants may receive rent subsidies in the form of Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers to protect them from rent increases or help them find affordable housing. These vouchers allow families to pay 30% of their income towards rent in the private market, with HUD covering the remaining cost. Tenant protection vouchers are provided to families losing HUD-assisted housing and are portable if the family chooses to move. Tenant protection vouchers require families to pay the same rent as before, even if it exceeds 30% of their income. Enhanced vouchers can increase in value to help families stay in their units as rents rise. These vouchers are given to families losing assistance due to HUD enforcement actions or when certain contracts end. Enhanced vouchers are provided when owners opt-out of renewing project-based Section 8 contracts. Enhanced vouchers are provided to tenants in certain properties when owners prepay their assisted mortgages. Eligibility is based on low income, moderate incomes for elderly or disabled individuals, or living in a low-vacancy area. All eligible families receive enhanced vouchers following a prepayment, which convert to regular vouchers if they move. Some families may not receive tenant protection or enhanced vouchers when affordability agreements end. Properties with affordability agreements that require HUD approval for prepayment, such as those owned by nonprofits, limited-dividend owners, and certain for-profit owners, may not receive tenant protection or enhanced vouchers upon mortgage prepayment. Families in properties without Section 8 assistance or with assistance through the old RAP program also do not currently receive these benefits. Congress and HUD established a \"National Housing Preservation Task Force\" in the mid-1980s to address concerns about the potential loss of privately owned, assisted housing for low-income families. The \"National Housing Preservation Task Force\" was formed in the mid-1980s to address threats to the assisted housing inventory. The Task Force identified 645,000 vulnerable units out of 2 million. Congress enacted laws to incentivize property owners to maintain affordability, including the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Accountability Act (P.L. 105-65). The Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation Act (ELIHPA) and the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act are laws that addressed mortgage prepayments by private owners. These laws are no longer in effect, but properties that went through their preservation processes are still governed by the agreements established at the time. ELIHPA prevented owners from prepaying their mortgages in many circumstances. ELIHPA was a temporary measure to halt mortgage prepayments for certain property owners. It applied to properties insured under specific programs and required owners to obtain HUD approval before prepayment, even if their mortgage contract allowed it. Owners had to submit a notice of intent to prepay and a plan outlining proposed changes to the mortgage and affordability restrictions. The plan included proposed changes to the mortgage and affordability restrictions, with conditions set by HUD for prepayment approval. It aimed to prevent economic hardship for current tenants and maintain affordable housing availability in the community. ELIHPA provided incentives for owners to maintain affordability for minorities in the community by offering increased returns on investment, access to project reserves, additional Section 8 assistance, and capital improvement loans. Owners accepting incentives agreed to continue providing affordable housing for an additional 20 years. The ELIHPA law, initially set to expire in 1990, was extended by Congress until November of that year. It was then replaced by the LIHPRHA, a permanent preservation program that also restricted mortgage prepayment and termination of affordability restrictions for housing owners. LIHPRHA provided incentives for owners to offer affordable housing, differing from ELIHPA by introducing a third option for owners. LIHPRHA, like ELIHPA, offered incentives for owners to provide affordable housing. It allowed owners to sell their properties to qualified purchasers under certain conditions. Both laws required owners to notify HUD, state or local governments, and residents of their intentions. Tenant protections were established, including Section 8 vouchers for residents affected by property prepayment or sale. LIHPRHA, similar to ELIHPA, limited owners' ability to prepay mortgages and end affordability restrictions. HUD could only approve prepayment if it did not cause economic hardship, tenant displacement without cause, or affect housing supply for low-income households. LIHPRHA required owners to file a notice of intent to prepay with HUD and certify conditions for low-income housing. If owners prepaid, tenants could stay at the same rates for three years or receive half of moving costs if they left. Owners failing to meet conditions could maintain affordability with HUD incentives, sell to a qualified buyer, or convert to market rate housing in limited circumstances approved by HUD. LIHPRHA modified preservation incentives for owners who chose to maintain their properties as affordable housing. The incentives included increased Section 8 rental assistance, rent increases paid by tenants, HUD-insured loans, and grants for capital improvements. The program expanded eligibility for Section 8 assistance to families at 80% of area median income. However, LIHPRHA limited the total assistance that could be provided to a property. LIHPRHA created new options for property owners, including the sale to a qualified purchaser to maintain affordability. Owners had to submit a notice of intent to HUD and could sell to a \"priority purchaser\" within the first six months. LIHPRHA allowed property owners to sell to a \"priority purchaser\" within the first six months, and if not, to any priority purchaser, including nonprofits. If no buyer was found, owners could sell to for-profit entities agreeing to provide affordable housing. If still no buyer, owners could keep the property with incentives or convert units to market rate rent. HUD could provide rental incentives to purchasers. Concerns arose in the mid-1990s about the high cost of HUD's preservation efforts under ELIHPA and LIHPRHA. By FY1996, 751 properties with over 90,000 units had received preservation funding, with an average cost of $19,000 per unit. Legal issues were also raised by property owners contesting the laws, claiming violations of contracts and government takings. Lawsuits contesting ELIHPA and LIHPRHA have had mixed outcomes, with some cases being settled. In the mid-1990s, concerns arose about the high cost of HUD's preservation efforts under ELIHPA and LIHPRHA. By FY1996, 751 properties with over 90,000 units had received preservation funding, with an average cost of $19,000 per unit. Legal issues were raised by property owners contesting the laws, with some cases being settled. Lawsuits contesting ELIHPA and LIHPRHA have had varying outcomes, with settlements and decisions in favor of owners. Congress reinstated owners' right to prepay mortgages without HUD permission in FY1996, imposed funding caps in FY1997, and stopped funding preservation incentives in FY1998, effectively ending the LIHPRHA program. The prepayment ended interest reduction payments (IRPs) for Section 236 properties. Congress implemented IRP decoupling in FY2000, allowing owners to prepay mortgages but still receive IRPs. Owners must maintain property affordability for five years beyond receiving IRPs. IRPs can continue through the original mortgage term or longer with reduced amounts. Assisted housing properties faced financial distress in the late 1970s, risking default on HUD-assisted financing and potential federal financial losses. In response to potential financial losses and default risks on HUD-assisted financing for multifamily housing properties, Congress created the Operating Assistance for Troubled Multifamily Housing Properties program in 1978. The program aimed to restore financial soundness, improve management, and maintain low- to moderate-income housing. Eligibility expanded to include various assisted housing programs, such as Section 236 IRP, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR, Rent Supplement, Section 8, and Section 202 properties. The Operating Assistance for Troubled Multifamily Housing Properties program, created in 1978, aimed to restore financial soundness and improve management of HUD-assisted multifamily housing properties. It provided assistance through the Flexible Subsidy Fund, consisting of Section 236 excess residual receipts and loan repayments. Two programs were offered: the Operating Assistance Program (OAP) for temporary funding and the Capital Improvement Loan Program (CILP) for major capital improvements. The Flexible Subsidy program provided amortizing loans with a 6% interest rate to maintain affordability for properties. New authority for this program was last given in FY1995. The program became unnecessary after the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Accountability Act was created. ELIHPA and LIHPRHA focused on housing eligible for mortgage prepayment, not on renewing project-based rental-assistance contracts. In the mid-1990s, Section 8 contracts were expiring, requiring new budget authority for renewal. Concerns arose about the cost impacting HUD's budget and potentially leading to less funding for other priorities. Not renewing the contracts would save money but result in low-income families losing housing assistance. Many properties were FHA-insured and receiving above-market rents, raising the risk of owners defaulting on loans and causing financial losses for the federal government. In the mid-1990s, concerns arose about the cost impact of expiring Section 8 contracts on HUD's budget. Many FHA-insured properties were financially distressed and mismanaged. Congress designed the Mark-to-Market restructuring program to reduce federal subsidies, lower above-market rents, and restructure mortgages for effective operation with less income. This program aimed to benefit families, save costs for the government, and attract project owners. It was passed as Title V of the VA-HUD Appropriations Act for FY1998. The Mark-to-Market restructuring program was enacted to address concerns about expiring Section 8 contracts and financial distress in FHA-insured properties. It aimed to reduce federal subsidies, lower above-market rents, and restructure mortgages. The program was reauthorized multiple times, with different renewal procedures for owners based on property circumstances. The Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidebook outlines six options for property owners, including renewing at existing rents, Mark-to-Market restructuring for above-market rents, renewing at higher rents for below-market rates, special rules for exempted properties, renewal based on earlier initiatives, or opting out. The Mark-to-Market process targets FHA-insured properties with above-market rents, aiming to reduce rents to market rates. Mark-to-Market eligibility offers owners the choice to accept reduced rents and renew for one year (Mark-to-Market \"lite\") or accept reduced rents with debt restructuring (Mark-to-Market \"full\"). Full restructuring involves renegotiating debt and income to cover expenses, supported by FHA insurance fund. Renewals come with 30-year affordability restrictions. Mark-to-Market \"lite\" transactions for Section 8 properties involve annual rent adjustments using HUD's AAFs. Over 2,000 properties have undergone full Mark-to-Market restructurings, while nearly 800 have opted for \"lite\" transactions. Eligible properties must be in good condition, owned by for-profit entities, and able to terminate affordability restrictions without HUD approval in exchange for market-comparable rents. Owners who choose Mark-up-to-Market renewals must agree to contract terms of at least five years and have their rents adjusted annually using HUD's AAFs. Some properties are not eligible for this program, including those owned by nonprofits, financed with state or local funding, or participating in certain HUD programs. Exception projects are renewed at rents based on current rents plus OCAFs or the rent level needed to cover operating expenses. Owners can choose to renew their Section 8 contracts through Mark-up-to-Market, which requires a commitment to five-year renewals and annual rent adjustments using HUD's AAFs. Alternatively, owners can opt for a Rent Comparability Study (RCS) to renew their rents at current levels plus an OCAF adjustment or budget-based increase without the five-year commitment. Opting out of renewing requires owners to notify tenants and HUD at least one year before the contract ends. Owners must notify HUD in writing at least one year before the end of their Section 8 contract if they intend to renew or opt out. Tenants in properties where owners opt out are eligible for enhanced vouchers, which can cover the gross rent for the unit. Families must still contribute the same amount towards rent as before receiving the voucher. Tenants with enhanced vouchers can stay in their units as long as they comply with their leases and state/local laws. In recent years, Congress has implemented preservation policies through annual appropriations, starting with the FY2006 HUD appropriations law (P.L. 109-115). The first policy addresses HUD's treatment of properties with Section 8 project-based rental assistance contracts, requiring HUD to maintain these contracts when managing or disposing of properties owned by the Secretary due to foreclosure. This is a shift from previous practice of terminating contracts and replacing assistance with vouchers. If rental assistance for a property is not feasible, HUD can transfer it to another property or replace it. The FY2006 HUD appropriations law (P.L. 109-115) introduced preservation policies allowing HUD to transfer rental assistance contracts to another property or replace them with vouchers. Section 318 of the law authorized the transfer of mortgage debt, rental assistance, and use restrictions to another property under certain conditions. These authorities expire at the end of the fiscal year unless renewed. The FY2006 HUD appropriations law introduced preservation policies allowing HUD to transfer rental assistance contracts to another property or replace them with vouchers. The authorities have been extended through FY2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $250 million for retrofit investments in HUD-assisted multifamily properties, creating the Green Retrofit Program. Discussions around affordable housing preservation focus on properties at risk of being lost to the affordable housing stock due to various factors. Not all properties face the same level of risk, depending on factors like subsidy structures, property condition, ownership type, and location. Some properties, especially those owned by mission-oriented owners in good financial and physical condition, may not be at risk at all. Some properties may face risks of being lost to affordable housing stock due to factors like ownership motivations, financial distress, and economic disincentives. Owners may be bound by affordability agreements or face challenges finding buyers willing to commit to long-term affordability. Properties in good condition with mission-oriented owners may be less likely to be at risk. Some affordable housing properties are at risk of becoming unsustainable due to income and subsidy structures. Owners may have more profitable options at the end of affordability restrictions, leading to potential loss of affordable housing stock. Interventions may be needed to preserve these properties, but limited federal resources may require prioritization. The discussion in the next section focuses on the government's role in preserving federally assisted housing beyond its original contract term. The original subsidy programs have been replaced with Section 8 vouchers, which are seen as a more cost-effective and flexible form of assistance. There are proposals to replace federally assisted housing with vouchers due to their benefits in providing mobility and targeting assistance. The Section 8 voucher program is seen as a cost-effective and flexible form of assistance, providing families with mobility and housing choices. However, there are limitations as landlords are not required to accept vouchers, and accessible housing may not be available for elderly or disabled populations. Calls for the preservation and development of project-based housing assistance are supported due to the lack of statutory authority for creating new deeply targeted HUD-assisted housing. Limited funding and authority exist for developing new, deeply subsidized housing, with programs like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and HOME Investment Partnerships Block Grant providing some support for affordable housing developments. The federal government supports the preservation of existing federally assisted housing as it is often more cost-effective than building new housing. However, preservation can still be expensive, requiring funds for rehabilitation, improvements, and ongoing rental assistance. The preservation of existing federally assisted housing requires continued rental assistance to maintain affordability for low-income tenants and may also involve providing incentives to owners. Cooperation among building owners, tenants, the local community, and HUD is essential, with each party having their own interests in the preservation process. Property characteristics such as location, physical condition, tenant needs, and owner organization type can impact the cost and feasibility of preservation efforts. The factors influencing the decision to preserve federally assisted housing include property location, condition, tenant needs, and owner type. These factors can create different options for owners, affect preservation costs, and impact community interest in maintaining affordable housing. Limited federal resources may require HUD and Congress to prioritize preservation strategies based on cost-effectiveness and property value. Assisted housing properties offer benefits like proximity to public transportation, community assets, and affordable housing options. Losing these properties could force families to move from areas of economic opportunity to concentrated poverty. In rural areas, assisted housing may be the only affordable or rental housing available. Owners of well-located properties may be incentivized to convert them for more profit once affordability restrictions end, making it hard for displaced families to find comparable housing. Federally assisted properties in high-poverty, crime-ridden areas with limited amenities may limit tenants' opportunities. Preserving properties in desirable locations may be a higher priority than those in distressed areas. The physical condition of assisted properties can also impact their preservation feasibility, with some properties deteriorating to the point of failing housing quality inspections. Repairing these properties can be very costly. Physically distressed properties with low operating income may struggle with routine maintenance, leading to financial distress. Factors like design flaws and mismatched unit demand can contribute to high vacancy rates and further financial problems. Physically distressed properties with high vacancy rates can face financial distress due to imbalanced financing or subsidy structures. Owners who took advantage of tax deductions early on may struggle to maintain properties over time, leading to insufficient income for operating expenses and taxes. The decision to preserve a physically distressed property depends on various factors, including the level of financial distress and market conditions. The decision to preserve a physically distressed property depends on factors like deterioration level, design relevance, and tenant needs, especially for elderly or disabled tenants. Preservation may be preferred over providing Section 8 vouchers due to difficulties in finding suitable housing. Accessibility features and supportive services in HUD-assisted properties also support preservation efforts. According to CRS analysis, 62% of families in HUD rent-assisted properties are elderly and/or disabled. Property owners' characteristics may impact affordability after contracts with HUD expire. For-profit owners are more likely to sell or convert to market-rate housing compared to nonprofit organizations. In 2006, HUD found that 86% of owners who left HUD programs were for-profit organizations, while only 9% were nonprofits. Nonprofit owners have been less likely to leave HUD-assisted housing. Nonprofit owners are less likely to leave HUD-assisted housing due to their goal of providing affordable housing. For-profit owners may need more costly preservation incentives. HUD considers an owner's ability to maintain the property when deciding on subsidies. Weighing the costs and benefits of preserving assisted housing is challenging due to various stakeholders involved. Stakeholders involved in preserving assisted housing include owners, residents, local community leaders, government officials, HUD, and Members of Congress, each with differing views on costs and benefits. Residents may be concerned about displacement or improving living conditions, while owners focus on financial investments. HUD may view the property as a federal asset or a risk to the FHA insurance fund, and Congress members may prioritize preservation efforts. Some Members of Congress may find it important to maintain existing subsidies for project-based housing due to limited authority to create new ones, while others may see preservation costs as too high given their desire to limit discretionary spending. The heterogeneity of assisted housing stock complicates efforts to assess preservation costs and benefits, with properties varying in location, physical condition, population served, owner commitment, and subsidy status. When it comes to assisted housing preservation, owners can choose what to do with their properties within the constraints of federal, state, or local laws. Property owners cannot terminate rental-assistance contracts without providing at least one year's notification to tenants, allowing time for tenants to organize preservation efforts or prepare for subsidy changes. HUD historically determines which properties have access to preservation incentives. HUD determines which properties have access to preservation incentives, considering various types of assisted housing properties with different financing and rental-assistance contracts. The level of affordability, duration of affordability maintenance, and options at contract end vary based on the subsidy type. Data on Section 202 loans, Section 236, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR programs, and units with rental assistance are presented in the report. The report presents data on units receiving rental assistance through Rent Supplement, RAP, and Section 8 programs. There is overlap among the data in the three sections. Table 1 includes Section 202 units with rental assistance, also shown in Table 7. There are 2,786 properties with active Section 202 loans, most units receiving rental assistance. Majority of Section 202 properties have loans maturing in over 15 years. HUD inspects properties annually, biannually, or every three years. HUD inspects properties annually, biannually, or every three years based on their inspection scores. Properties with scores below 30 are referred to the Departmental Enforcement Center for corrective action. Properties with scores above 30 but below 60 may also be referred. Properties in poor condition risk default on HUD assistance contracts and loss to affordable housing stock. Less than 3% of Section 202 properties require referral to the DEC, while over 60% are inspected every three years. There are approximately 1,542 properties with mortgage insurance through Section 236 and Section 221d(3) BMIR programs. Upon maturation of Section 236 and BMIR insured loans, owners can convert properties to market use, allowing market-rate rents. Units with rental assistance will continue to receive assistance under the contract. If the contract is not renewed, residents will receive tenant protection vouchers. Residents in properties facing mortgage maturation may receive tenant protection vouchers or enhanced vouchers. Some FHA-insured, rent-restricted properties require corrective action due to low inspection scores. There are 17,207 properties with rental-assistance contracts with HUD, covering over 1.4 million units. In total, 88% of the 1.4 million units in rent-assisted properties are covered by rental-assistance contracts. Most properties have Section 8 assistance, with only 2% having RAP or Rent Supplement assistance. Some properties have a combination of rental assistance types. There are 15,870 RAP units, 12,847 Rent Supplement units, and 1.2 million Section 8 units. HUD has no authority to renew RAP and Rent Supplement contracts, only providing tenant protection vouchers upon contract termination. Rent Supplement contracts will mostly expire within five years, while RAP contracts will expire within ten years. Section 8 contracts can be renewed by owners. The ownership type of a property can indicate the likelihood of exiting an assisted housing program. Approximately 41% of properties are owned by nonprofit owners, 42% by for-profit owners, and 15% by limited-dividend owners. Limited-dividend owners may have the greatest incentive to leave the program. Property condition also plays a role, with most properties having high inspection scores allowing for inspections every three years, but 6% have low scores. Approximately 17,700 properties with federal affordability restrictions are set to end, totaling over 1.33 million subsidized units. HUD has no authority to renew contracts for nearly 29,000 units subsidized by RAP and Rent Supplement, with over 10,000 contracts expiring in the next five years. However, HUD can provide ongoing rental assistance through tenant protection vouchers. HUD cannot provide ongoing rental assistance to families in units with expiring RAP contracts, totaling over 16,000 units, with 10% expiring in the next five years. Properties with HUD-assisted financing lack tools to extend affordability agreements, except those with Section 8 contracts. Properties without Section 8 contracts, totaling 315, face challenges in extending federal affordability agreements. There are 8 contracts without the option to extend affordability agreements. Properties with FHA-insured loans and Section 202 loans totaling over 46,000 units have no rental-assistance contracts. Owners may increase rents once affordability restrictions end, with no federal law preventing them. Over half of the 1.2 million units with Section 8 assistance will have expiring rental-assistance contracts in the next five years. The federal government has limited preservation tools for rent-assisted properties, with HUD having the authority to renew expiring rental-assistance contracts and restructure debt for properties with FHA-insured financing. For-profit owners, especially those with limited-dividends, may opt-out of renewing contracts if they can get comparable rents and higher profits in the private market. HUD has limited preservation tools for rent-assisted properties, including the authority to renew expiring rental-assistance contracts and restructure debt for properties with FHA-insured financing. Earlier preservation laws granted additional tools that are no longer available due to concerns about cost and property owners' rights. Calls have been made to adopt policies that encourage preservation and expand HUD's preservation tools. Policies and proposals aim to encourage housing preservation by providing incentives for owners and restrictions on owners. State and local governments, along with advocates, have increased efforts in affordable housing preservation through setting aside funds and prioritizing incentives. The report discusses federal preservation policy options for affordable housing, including incentives for owners such as reducing debt, increasing rent subsidies, accessing reserve funds, and providing rehabilitation funds. Owners receiving incentives are typically required to extend affordability restrictions for a certain period. HUD could be given explicit authority to subordinate or forgive loans made to property owners, such as Flexible Subsidy loans, to reduce owners' debt and free up funds for property improvements. This could be done in cases of refinancing, allowing owners to use loan proceeds for rehabilitation instead of debt repayment. Additionally, HUD could make partial payments from the FHA insurance fund to reduce owners' financial burden. HUD may also have the authority to make partial payments from the FHA insurance fund to reduce debt on FHA-insured properties. Increased rents or rent assistance could help owners pay for property improvements or continue providing affordable housing. Property owners with rental-assistance contracts may access reserves for reinvestment in the property. Expanding access to reserves for property owners could incentivize maintaining affordable housing. HUD could provide loans or grants for property improvement. Owners could be encouraged to sell to preservation purchasers to ensure affordability. Incentives for selling to preservation purchasers include exit tax relief and financial assistance to aid in purchasing properties. Funding options for preservation purchasers include technical assistance, pre-development grants, direct grants, loans, and rental-assistance contracts. Imposing requirements on property owners, such as limiting selling options and expanding tenant notification, can also help preserve affordable housing without costly incentives. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, laws were enacted to limit owners' ability to end affordability restrictions, leading to legal challenges. Options for property owners include right of first refusal for preservation purchasers to prevent conversion to market-rate housing. The owner must offer the property to an organization that will maintain affordability or accept a fair market offer from a preservation purchaser. Tenants may have the right of first purchase or refusal, allowing them to buy the property they live in. Tenants could also enforce HUD contracts to prevent property deterioration. Tenants could have the standing to enforce contract rules, ensuring better property maintenance and avoiding HUD enforcement actions. Private right of action, similar to fair housing law, would empower tenants in negotiations with property owners. Notification requirements for property conversions or sales to maintain affordability are proposed to be expanded, allowing residents to organize for potential property purchase or contest a sale. Current law mandates a minimum notification period of 150 days before prepaying an FHA-insured mortgage and one year before not renewing a Section 8 contract. In some cases, a property may not be preserved due to its physical condition or location, and options include transferring Section 8 assistance to another property or providing ongoing assistance to residents. Transferring assistance involves moving rental-assistance contracts or affordability restrictions to a better-suited property to preserve existing assistance, as new contracts are not authorized. HUD has limited authority for these transfers, with potential for further expansion. Expanded Enhanced Voucher Eligibility allows tenants to receive vouchers in certain circumstances to provide ongoing rent assistance and protect them from rent increases. There have been proposals to expand eligibility for these vouchers to groups currently not eligible. Funding for expanded eligibility was included in the FY2012 appropriations law. In the 111th and 112th Congresses, preservation bills and policy changes were introduced to protect properties with expiring affordability restrictions. HUD issued notices to help owners rehabilitate and preserve properties, and a Rental Assistance Demonstration was proposed to preserve subsidized units. HUD began publishing notices in 2010 to enable multifamily property owners to make improvements and preserve affordable units. One notice allows HUD to subordinate Section 202 loans for rehabilitation needs, with owners required to enter extended use agreements. Another notice gives HUD authority to defer repayment of flexible subsidy debt to assist in preservation efforts. HUD allows multifamily project owners to defer repayment of flexible subsidy debt to preserve properties. Owners can request deferral when refinancing a loan if funds are insufficient to pay off the debt. They must demonstrate the deferral is necessary for project preservation and agree to an extended use agreement for at least 20 years. Another HUD notice permits owners to convert efficiency units to one-bedroom units. HUD allows multifamily project owners to convert efficiency units to one-bedroom units, even if it results in fewer total units in the building. This conversion is permitted when owners demonstrate that the local market demands it and that it will improve the property's financial position. Additionally, HUD proposed a new Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) in its FY2012 budget to convert rental assistance programs to Section 8 project-based rental assistance. Under the proposed legislation, Rent Supplement and RAP assistance contracts could be voluntarily converted to new Section 8 contracts, allowing units to maintain their subsidies. HUD requested $200 million for the conversions in its budget. The FY2012 appropriations law included a modified version of RAD, limiting participation to public housing and Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation properties. The Housing Preservation and Tenant Protection Act (H.R. 4868) is an extensive preservation bill. The Housing Preservation and Tenant Protection Act (H.R. 4868) was introduced in the House in 2010, similar to a draft preservation bill from 2009. It included provisions for rehabilitating Section 221(d)(3) BMIR and Section 236 properties with maturing mortgages. The bill was approved by the House Financial Services Committee but not considered on the House floor before the end of the 111th Congress. The Housing Preservation and Tenant Protection Act (H.R. 4868) aimed to provide loans for property rehabilitation, extend voucher protections to tenants, create a Preservation Exchange Program, authorize conversion of contracts to Section 8, and establish a right of first refusal for HUD to maintain affordability. H.R. 4868 aimed to maintain affordability of HUD-assisted properties by allowing owners to request project-based assistance, extending contracts for at least 20 years. It also provided tenant protection through funding for tenant organizations, a private right of action for tenants, and authorization for various preservation incentives dependent on Appropriations Committees for funding. The draft legislation in 2009 relied on the Appropriations Committees for funding new initiatives. Low-income housing advocates and industry organizations gave feedback during hearings, with controversy over provisions like right of first purchase and private right of standing for residents. Property owners were concerned about these provisions, while tenant advocates supported them. In 2010, Congress passed the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act (P.L. 111-372). In 2010, Congress passed the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act (P.L. 111-372), allowing owners of older Section 202 developments to refinance without the requirement of a lower interest rate and reduced debt service. The law also extends the term of affordability to 20 years beyond the original loan term and introduces a new \"preservation project rental assistance\" program for owners who refinance to maintain affordability. The FY2012 HUD appropriations law (P.L. 112-55) included provisions for the preservation of Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation properties and funding for tenant protection vouchers. It also authorized the conversion of certain properties with maturing mortgages or expiring contracts. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL33508. The FY2012 HUD appropriations law (P.L. 112-55) included provisions for preserving Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation properties, funding tenant protection vouchers, converting properties with maturing mortgages or expiring contracts, and extending various housing programs."
