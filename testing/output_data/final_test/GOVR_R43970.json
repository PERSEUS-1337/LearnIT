For FY2016, ITA requested $58.3 million and 248 FTEs for this unit, a slight increase from the previous year.

For FY2016, ITA requested $80.7 million and 348 FTEs, an increase from the previous year. USITC is an independent agency with investigative responsibilities related to international trade. The USITC administers U.S. trade remedy laws, provides independent analysis on tariffs and trade, and maintains the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Its activities include investigating dumped and subsidized imports, conducting safeguard investigations, and adjudicating disputes on intellectual property rights. The agency serves as a federal resource for trade data and policy information, providing analysis to Congress, the President, and USTR to develop U.S. trade policy. The USITC plays a key role in U.S. trade policy by providing independent analysis and maintaining trade data. Its budget request for FY2016 was $131.5 million, with the House recommending $86.5 million and the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommending $84.5 million. The USTR, responsible for developing U.S. international trade policies, had a FY2016 appropriation of $88.5 million, 32.7% less than the Administration's request. It negotiates trade agreements, resolves disputes, and leads FTA negotiations like the TPP. The USTR is leading negotiations for the T-TIP and monitoring existing FTAs. The FY2015 CJS Appropriations Act provided $54.3 million for USTR. The Administration's FY2016 request was $56.3 million and 240 FTEs, a 3.7% increase. The House recommended $54.3 million, 3.6% less than the request. The Senate committee-reported bill recommended $54.3 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended consolidating USTR into the Department of Commerce. The FY2016 appropriation for USTR is $54.5 million, slightly higher than the FY2015 amount and lower than the Administration's request. Congress has funded specific trade-related programs under CJS agencies, addressing China trade enforcement, trade promotion, and the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center. Some of ITA's funding has been dedicated to antidumping and countervailing duty enforcement activities since 2004. China Compliance was established in 2004 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act to enforce U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws. The FY2016 appropriation for China antidumping and countervailing duty enforcement was recommended at $16.4 million. The ITA's China Countervailing Duty Group was created in FY2009 to handle duties on imports from non-market economy countries. The FY2016 appropriation includes $16.4 million for China antidumping and countervailing duty enforcement and compliance activities. SelectUSA, part of ITA's Global Markets unit, coordinates investment-related resources across federal agencies to promote the United States as an investment market. ITA requested $20.0 million for FY2016 for the SelectUSA program, with the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommending up to $10.0 million for the program.

SelectUSA, part of ITA's Global Markets unit, coordinates investment-related resources across federal agencies to promote the United States as an investment market. President Obama signed Executive Order 13601 to establish the ITEC for advancing U.S. foreign trade policy through strengthened enforcement of trade rights. The ITEC is led by a Director designated by USTR and a Deputy Director designated by the Secretary of Commerce. The Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC) coordinates trade enforcement matters among various government agencies. It works closely with the International Trade Administration (ITA) to address economic issues. The FY2016 budget request for the ITEC was $15.0 million, with the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommending up to $10.0 million. Issues that Congress may have considered while debating the FY2016 funding levels for the three CJS trade-related agencies included approving a one-time 55.6% increase in funding for USITC, consolidating commercial and trade-related agencies for efficiency, providing additional funding for ITA's SelectUSA program and ITEC, and continuing funding for ITA's China antidumping and countervailing duty enforcement activities."
