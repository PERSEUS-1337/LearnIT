    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Utah Recreational Land Exchange Act of 2004\". Congress finds that the area surrounding the Colorado River in Grand County, Utah, and Dinosaur National Monument in Uintah County, Utah, contains scenic values, archaeological resources, wildlife habitat, and opportunities for public recreation. Utah owns parcels of land in the area granted under the Act of July 16, 1894, to be held in trust for public institutions. These state trust lands are scattered among federal land in a checkerboard pattern. The State trust land in the Colorado River corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and Book Cliffs area contains significant natural and recreational values, including Westwater Canyon, Kokopelli and Slickrock trails, natural rock arches, wilderness study areas, and viewsheds for national parks. The presence of State trust land in the Colorado River corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and the Book Cliffs area complicates land management for the United States and Utah. Developing resources in these areas conflicts with their recreational and natural values. The United States can transfer land to Utah in exchange for State trust land without compromising interests. The Act aims to exchange Federal land with limited recreational and conservation values for Utah State trust land with important recreational, scenic, and conservation values in the Colorado River Corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and the Book Cliffs area. This exchange is in the public interest and will benefit both the United States and the State of Utah. The Act aims to exchange Federal land with limited recreational and conservation values for Utah State trust land with important recreational, scenic, and conservation values in the Colorado River Corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and the Book Cliffs area. This exchange is in the public interest and will benefit both the United States and the State of Utah. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"Federal land\" as land in Grand and Uintah Counties, Utah, and \"non-Federal land\" as State trust land in the Colorado River corridor and near Dinosaur National Monument in Utah. The curr_chunk specifies the State trust land in Uintah County, Utah near the Book Cliffs area. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and the State refers to the State of Utah. The Act allows for the exchange of land between the State of Utah and the United States. The State must offer non-Federal land to the Secretary within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The exchange must be completed within 330 days, with a possible extension if agreed upon by both parties. SEC. 5. EXCHANGE VALUATION, APPRAISALS, AND EQUALIZATION. The Federal land and non-Federal land to be exchanged must have approximately equal value as determined by appraisals following specific standards. The appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land for exchange must be conducted by independent third-party appraisers selected by the Secretary and State from an approved list. Comparable public and private sales must be considered during the appraisal process. The appraisal process for Federal and non-Federal land exchanges must be conducted by independent third-party appraisers within 120 days, considering public and private sales for valuation. Adjustments may be made for mineral revenue sharing obligations. The appraiser must submit completed appraisals for review within 120 days of selection. The Secretary and State must independently approve or disapprove the appraisal within 90 days. If there is disagreement on the value of a parcel of land, the Secretary and State will determine the value according to specific guidelines. According to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, if the Secretary and the State cannot agree on the value of a parcel within 1 year, a Federal district court will have jurisdiction to determine the value. The value of a parcel under clause (i) must be determined within 1 to 3 years after the enactment of the Act. If the final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, parcels of non-Federal land will be removed from the exchange to equalize the values. If the final appraised value of Federal land exceeds that of non-Federal land, the values can be equalized by removing parcels of Federal land or adding additional State trust land to the non-Federal land. The additional land must be appraised according to a Federal acquisition process and accepted by the Secretary. After a land exchange, the status and management of the land will be determined. The non-Federal land acquired under this Act will become part of the Federal administrative unit where it is located. Mineral revenues from the acquired land will be subject to the Mineral Leasing Act. Federal land is withdrawn from public land laws, mining laws, and mineral leasing laws. The acquired non-Federal land will become part of the Federal administrative unit where it is located. Grazing permits for domestic livestock on the acquired land must continue under existing terms and conditions. The holder of a grazing lease, permit, or contract has a preference right to renew it upon expiration. The State can cancel a grazing permit if the land is used for non-grazing purposes. Land conveyed by the State can still qualify as a base property for a Federal grazing permit or lease. The exchange of land under this Act must be in the public interest. The Secretary and State must provide records on hazardous materials for review. Costs for remedial actions on acquired land will be paid by responsible entities under applicable law."
