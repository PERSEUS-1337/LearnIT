    "content": "President Obama's FY2014 budget request for Energy and Water Development was released in April 2013, totaling $34.4 billion. The House and Senate approved bills with different amounts, but Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, extending funding through January 15, 2014. The Bipartisan Budget Act eased spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015. The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, containing funding for Energy and Water Development programs. The bill includes funding for various agencies and projects, with FY2013 appropriations considered in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25) established spending limits for FY2012-FY2021 and mandated a deficit reduction plan by January 15, 2012. Due to the failure to enact legislation, automatic spending cuts through sequestration were triggered, starting on January 2, 2013. The process required across-the-board cuts in defense and nondefense funding as specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) established spending limits for FY2012-FY2021 and mandated a deficit reduction plan. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made significant changes to the BCA procedures in FY2013, including delaying the joint committee sequester and reducing the dollar amount by $24 billion. President Obama ordered the sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made changes to BCA procedures, affecting budget totals for energy and water development appropriations from FY2007 to FY2014. Tables provide details for different titles and agencies, with discussions on key issues. The Energy and Water Development bill funds the civil program of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil program, funded through the Energy and Water Development bill, has attracted congressional attention due to its economic, environmental, and water resource development impacts. Recent changes in Corps appropriations include earmark moratoriums and reductions for some projects. Flooding events have also affected Corps projects, leading to supplemental funds being allocated by Congress. In FY2013, Congress provided $4.718 billion to the Corps, slightly less than the Administration's request of $4.731 billion. However, in FY2014, Congress allocated $4.876 billion to the Corps, exceeding the President's request of $4.826 billion. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended higher funding amounts for the Corps in FY2014 compared to the Administration's request. P.L. 113-76 ultimately provided $5.468 billion for the Corps, with a debate over earmarks and specific project allocations. Since FY2010, Congress has not provided additional project-level funding through earmarks due to moratoriums. Instead, they have allocated extra funding for specific categories of Corps projects not included in the President's budget, with limited guidance on allocation. This practice continued in FY2014, with many authorized Corps projects remaining unfunded or incomplete. The backlog of authorized projects, with estimates ranging from $20 billion to over $80 billion, raises policy questions on funding priorities. Recent budget requests have included limited new studies and construction starts, with FY2014 seeking funding for four new construction starts and 10 new studies. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for New Starts in FY2014. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for New Starts in FY2014, while the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with the Administration's request for additional new studies and construction starts. P.L. 113-76 allows for up to nine new study starts and four new construction starts. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund has a surplus balance, but the Inland Waterway Trust Fund is facing a shortfall and a curtailment of activities. Both trust funds require annual appropriations. In 1986, Congress enacted the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) to recover operation and maintenance costs at U.S. coastal and Great Lakes harbors from maritime shippers. The tax revenues are deposited into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for harbor dredging. In 1990, the HMT rate was increased to 12.5 cents per $100 of cargo value. HMTF annual expenditures have remained flat while collections have increased. The maritime industry seeks to spend down a large surplus in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) by enacting a \"spending guarantee\" through proposed bills H.R. 335 and S. 218. Some harbor channels are not being maintained properly, causing issues for ships with deep drafts. This could impact funding for other Energy and Water Development activities under congressional budget caps. The Administration's FY2014 budget requested $890 million from the HMTF, with an estimated end-of-year balance of over $8.9 billion. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1 billion. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1 billion for HMTF expenditures, $110 million more than the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not specify a funding level for the HMTF. P.L. 113-76 does not specify a specific amount of HMTF funds for FY2014, but more than $1 billion in eligible expenditures may occur. Expenditures for construction and rehabilitation projects on inland waterways have been cost-shared between the federal government and users through the Inland Waterway Trust Fund. Since FY2007, there has been a shortfall in the Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF), with Congress taking measures to ensure temporary solvency by appropriating federal funds or limiting expenditures to fuel tax revenues. The IWTF is expected to have a balance of $70 million at the end of FY2013, but funding for eligible work is still expected to exceed available funding. Past proposals for fees to increase IWTF revenues have been opposed by users and rejected by Congress. In 2011, users proposed increasing the fuel tax by $0.06-$0.08 per gallon to fund IWTF projects, which has been opposed by the Obama Administration. The Olmsted Lock and Dam project is expected to use most IWTF revenues over the next decade, leading to limited funding for other projects without a new revenue source directed by Congress. The Administration requested limited appropriations for IWTF projects for FY2014, with funds coming from fuel tax revenues and the General Fund of the Treasury. An additional $80 million in new revenues from a user fee was assumed. The majority of funds were proposed for the Olmsted Project. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees disagreed with the user fee proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee disagreed with the user fee proposal for IWTF projects in FY2014, proposing to exempt the Olmsted Project from cost sharing requirements. P.L. 113-76 reduces the IWTF costs for the Olmsted project from 50% to 25% in FY2014. Funding for Olmsted would come entirely from the General Fund of the Treasury. The Corps portion of the Energy and Water bill typically includes funding for ecosystem restoration projects like the Everglades in South Florida. Funding for Corps environmental business line activities, including ecosystem restoration projects, has remained consistent in recent budgets. The Administration requested $449 million for ecosystem restoration projects in FY2014, with a reduction in funding for Everglades restoration. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $83.6 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with the Administration's request. P.L. 113-76 allocated $46.6 million for these activities. The bill allocated $46.6 million for Corps' Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs), smaller projects that do not require specific studies or authorizations. The Administration requested $29 million for five CAPs, with no funding proposed for four CAPs. The House Appropriations Committee suggested $33 million for eight CAPs, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $50 million for eight CAPs. The Energy and Water Development bill allocated $53 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA) and the Bureau of Reclamation. The total discretionary FY2014 Title II budget request was $1.050 billion, with the House recommending $965 million and the Senate recommending $1.099 billion. P.L. 113-76 provided $1.113 billion for Title II activities. Reclamation's FY2013 operating plan accounted for sequestration's effects, with funding for Title II activities at $1.014 billion. The FY2014 budget for the Bureau of Reclamation and CUPCA was $1.014 billion. The request included an offset of $53.2 million for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, resulting in a net discretionary authority of $996 million. Additional funding is expected from permanent and other funds. The Administration requested $3.5 million for CUPCA, $17.4 million less than FY2013. Reclamation may be responsible for oversight of CUPCA. The Senate agreed with the President's request, while the House kept CUPCA as a separate account and provided $8.7 million. The House bill retained CUPCA as a separate account and allocated $8.7 million for the project, including $1.3 million for Secretary of the Interior expenses. The Bureau of Reclamation is responsible for building large dams and water diversion structures in the West for irrigation and water supply purposes. Reclamation manages over 300 storage reservoirs in 17 western states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. The Bureau of Reclamation is the largest wholesale supplier of water in the 17 western states and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation facilities provide flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but operations are controversial due to their impact on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The agency's budget consists mainly of individual project funding lines, with the largest account being Water and Related Resources, covering construction, operations, and maintenance. The current moratorium on earmarks affects Congress's ability to direct funding to specific Reclamation projects. The Obama Administration requested $791 million for the Water and Related Resources account for FY2014, a decrease of $57 million from the FY2013 enacted amount. The House-passed bill provided $812 million for Water and Related Resources, and the Senate Appropriations Committee provided $946 million for this account in its recommendation. P.L. 113-76 included provisions related to Reclamation drought response and authorities. The Obama Administration requested $791 million for the Water and Related Resources account for FY2014. P.L. 113-76 included provisions related to Reclamation drought response and authorities, extending authorization for emergency drought relief programs and Calfed Bay-Delta Authorization Act. The CVP in California is a complex water project with limited deliveries often sparking debates. In recent years, Reclamation has had to limit water deliveries and pumping from CVP facilities due to drought and environmental restrictions. Previous attempts to prevent implementation of Biological Opinions (BiOps) in the CVP have not been enacted, but measures to lessen the impact of these restrictions are under consideration. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund was authorized by the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act in 2009. The San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act of 2009 established a fund for fisheries restoration and water management, funded by a reallocation of Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts and other sources. $88 million was provided without further appropriation, but the balance of mandatory appropriations is expected to be exhausted in FY2014. Reclamation has also proposed $26 million in discretionary funding for FY2014. The House Appropriations Committee did not allocate $26 million for San Joaquin River restoration activities in FY2014. However, the Senate Appropriations Committee provided $26 million for this purpose under the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project. The funding was included in the Water and Related Resources account. The explanatory statement for P.L. 113-76 followed the Senate's approach. Reclamation has consolidated funding for water conservation programs into the WaterSMART Program. The FY2014 WaterSMART Program, part of the Department of the Interior's water conservation focus, had a $35.4 million request. The House bill recommended cutting funding for two components, while the Senate proposed an $8 million increase for WaterSMART grants. P.L. 113-76 allocated nearly $49 million for these activities. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, fossil energy R&D, and environmental cleanup. The FY2013 continuing resolution funded DOE programs at $25.1 billion, with the Administration's FY2014 request totaling $28.9 billion. H.R. 2609 allocated $24.9 billion, S. 1245 proposed $28.2 billion, and the final appropriations bill, P.L. 113-76, provided $27.3 billion for DOE programs. President Obama prioritized energy efficiency and renewable energy. President Obama has emphasized the importance of energy efficiency and renewable energy for jobs, economic growth, and U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Despite his efforts to increase funding for these programs, Congress has consistently reduced the budget requests. The FY2014 DOE budget requested $2.78 billion for EERE programs, representing a significant increase from previous years. The FY2014 DOE budget requested $2.78 billion for EERE programs, emphasizing the need for efficient fund utilization. EERE planned to implement Active Project Management, using cooperative agreements for projects to enable greater oversight. The approach included go/no-go milestones, quarterly reviews, and early termination for underperforming projects to maximize taxpayer return on investment. Five broad initiatives were highlighted, including the Grid Integration Initiative. The Grid Integration Initiative, part of EERE's programs, aims to address electric grid integration barriers for renewable energy generators, electric vehicle charging, and building efficiency. EERE plans to issue an $80 million project announcement jointly funded by Solar, Vehicles, and Buildings programs. Additionally, the EV Everywhere Grand Challenge aims to make plug-in electric vehicles as affordable and convenient as gasoline-powered vehicles by 2022. The DOE has various initiatives such as the SunShot Grand Challenge, Clean Energy Manufacturing Initiative, and Wide Bandgap Semiconductors for Clean Energy Initiative aimed at achieving cost-competitive solar power, improving U.S. competitiveness in clean energy manufacturing, and developing high-power-conversion electronics. The DOE is developing revolutionary technology for electric drivetrains, solar inverters, and high-efficiency motors. The House Appropriations Committee recommended cutting EERE funding by half and merging it with EDER. Management and program directives were included in the committee report on H.R. 2609. In floor action on H.R. 2609, amendments cut EERE funding by $9.5 million and the Solar Program by $15 million. A prohibition on enforcing light bulb efficiency standards was extended. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended slightly higher FY2014 funding for EERE. The DOE program aims to reduce petroleum use, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollutants through hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. Funding requests varied between the House and Senate bills, with the final appropriation being $5 million less than FY2013 levels. The program also supports the development of a domestic bioenergy industry to reduce oil dependence and promote renewable biofuels. The DOE program aims to develop biofuels, bioproducts, and biopower to reduce oil dependence, greenhouse gas emissions, and stimulate economic development in rural areas. The program focuses on converting raw biomass to solid pellets or \"green crude\" bio-oil for easy transport. Goals include developing biofuels that meet production targets of the Renewable Fuel Standard, such as biomass-based hydrocarbon fuels, hydrocarbons from algae, and biobutanol. The DOE program aims to develop non-food \"drop-in\" biofuels like renewable gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to reach a wholesale finished-fuel cost under $3 per gasoline gallon-equivalent by 2017. DOE requested $282 million in FY2014 for Bioenergy programs, with increases for conversion technologies, low-cost carbon fiber initiative, and integrated biorefineries. Additionally, $45 million was requested to support commercial demonstration-scale, military-grade fuel production from biomass through collaboration with the USDA. The DOE requested $356 million for the Solar Program in FY2014, an increase of $83 million from FY2013. The concentrating solar power subprogram would focus on thermal storage for grid integration, while the balance of systems subprogram would work with state and local governments to reduce soft costs. Funding for systems integration would also increase, with a focus on power electronics for better grid integration. The House bill recommended a $118 million cut (43%) from the FY2013 level, while the Senate bill proposed a $37 million increase (14%). The final appropriation was $16 million less than FY2013. For the Wind Program, DOE requested a $56 million increase over FY2013. Nearly half of that increase would have gone to technology development and testing, mainly for wind power plant optimization modeling. Funding for offshore wind would have grown by over $10 million, and the technology application subprogram would have increased by nearly $20 million. The House bill recommended a $118 million cut (43%) from the FY2013 level, while the Senate bill proposed a $37 million increase (14%). The final appropriation was $16 million less than FY2013. For the Wind Program, DOE requested a $56 million increase over FY2013, with a focus on technology development and testing, including offshore wind projects and optimization modeling. The Geothermal Program saw a requested increase of $24 million for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and strategic R&D support. The House bill recommended a $6 million (16%) cut from the FY2013 level for the Water Power Program, while the Senate bill proposed an increase of $24 million (68%) over FY2013. The final appropriation was $10 million higher than the FY2013 level. Water power technologies utilize marine and hydrokinetic resources to generate electricity, with a focus on developing MHK power facilities. DOE requested $55 million for the Water Power Program, including funding for MHK RD&D and demonstration infrastructure development. The funding for MHK RD&D, demonstration infrastructure development, and light-weight materials in manufacturing was increased by $3 million from the FY2013 level. The program is part of the 10-year EV-Everywhere Challenge aiming for plug-in electric vehicle affordability and convenience by 2022, focusing on advanced battery technology and cutting national oil use. The program aims to reduce national oil use by 16% by 2020, achieve a fuel economy of 62 mpg for cars by 2025, and increase heavy-duty truck fuel economy by 50% by 2015. To support these goals, DOE sought a $264 million increase in funding for the EERE FY2014 program, with a focus on battery and electric drive research. This includes $70 million for battery cost reduction, $40 million for advanced power electronics R&D, and funding for lightweight materials research. The House bill recommended a $24 million (8%) increase over the FY2013 level, while the Senate bill proposed an increase of $104 million (34%) for R&D on lightweight materials and deployment of alternative fuel vehicle community partner projects to support the EV Everywhere initiative. The final appropriation for the energy efficiency program was $21 million less than the FY2013 level. The program aims to reduce energy use by 50% by 2030 through improving building components, strengthening market pull, and raising energy efficiency levels for new equipment and buildings. DOE requested a $300 million budget for FY2014, with a focus on emerging technologies subprogram and supporting competitive demonstration projects for commercialization. The FY2014 budget requested funding for demonstration projects in advanced building controls and air conditioning technologies, as well as research on building energy control systems integration with the electric grid. The House proposed a $82 million cut, while the Senate suggested a $23 million increase in funding. The final appropriation for the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) was $29 million less than the FY2013 level. The AMO aims to reduce energy use in manufactured goods by 50% over 10 years through advanced materials and industrial processes. The DOE requested $365 million for AMO programs, a $256 million increase from FY2013. The DOE requested a $365 million budget for the Advanced Manufacturing Office, with a focus on Advanced Manufacturing R&D Facilities, Next Generation Manufacturing R&D Projects, and Industrial Technical Assistance. The proposed increase included funding for clean energy manufacturing R&D facilities to support the creation of new Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes. The DOE plans to invest $70 million-$120 million into Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes (CEMI) to improve U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing clean energy products. The institutes would provide affordable access to cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities and technology use in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Another R&D facility, the Critical Materials Hub, focuses on technologies to better utilize rare earth elements and eliminate materials vulnerable to supply disruptions. The DOE requested $25 million to extend the Critical Materials Hub's operation for a third year, focusing on rare earth elements essential for clean energy technologies. Additionally, the DOE requested an increase of about $60 million for advanced R&D projects under the Next Generation Manufacturing Projects subprogram, targeting technology areas with high impact on clean energy manufacturing and competitiveness. This increase would support new project competitions in specific technology areas such as additive manufacturing, wide bandgap semiconductors, low-cost carbon fiber materials, and other beneficial technologies. The House bill recommended a $41 million (37%) increase over the FY2013 level, while the Senate bill proposed an increase of $107 million (98%) over FY2013. The final appropriation provided $71 million more than the FY2013 level for low-cost carbon fiber materials and other clean energy technologies. The final appropriation provided $71 million more than the FY2013 level for the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), which helps federal agencies achieve energy efficiency goals. The House bill recommended $18 million, a cut of $10 million, while the Senate bill proposed $30 million, an increase of $2 million over FY2013. The DOE requested $185 million for administrative costs, a $30 million increase over FY2013. The EERE reorganization includes consolidating information technology and implementing an active project management system for grants. The House bill proposed a $41 million cut, while the Senate bill suggested a $30 million increase. The final appropriation was $23 million less than FY2013. DOE sought $36 million for Program Support, with $7 million for clean energy technology commercialization and $4 million for impact evaluation. The House bill recommended a $14 million cut, while the Senate bill proposed a $4 million increase. The Senate bill proposed a $4 million increase over FY2013, but the final appropriation was $12 million less than FY2013. The program aims to help state and local governments overcome barriers in providing home energy services to low-income families. DOE requested $184 million, citing the need for new funds as states have used up Recovery Act funds. The House bill recommended a $10 million cut, while the Senate bill proposed a $120 million increase. The final appropriation was $110 million higher than FY2013, supporting administrative and program activities at state energy offices. The DOE requested $57 million for state energy offices, with a focus on cutting state energy use by 1% annually. The final appropriation provided $3 million more than FY2013. Additionally, the DOE requested $169 million, including $20 million for a new Electricity Systems Hub to address grid challenges. Notable increases were sought for three subprograms. The FY2014 appropriation for nuclear energy research and development is $889.2 million, 21% above the Obama Administration's request. This includes funding for advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, infrastructure support, and safeguards and security, totaling $131.7 million above the FY2013 level. The House bill recommended a $9 million cut, while the Senate proposed a $17 million increase. The final appropriation was $15 million higher than FY2013. In FY2013, funding for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho facilities was under a separate appropriations account but included in the Nuclear Energy account in FY2014. The Administration proposed cuts for Reactor Concepts, Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies, and Fuel Cycle R&D, which were mostly rejected in the final appropriation. Small Modular Reactor Licensing Technical Support saw a 4.5% increase in the request and an additional $40 million in the final appropriation. The House-passed bill allocated $656.4 million for nuclear energy, excluding certain funds. The House-passed bill allocated $656.4 million for nuclear energy, excluding the Administration's proposed shift of $94.0 million for Idaho safeguards and security. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the same total as the Administration request. The Administration's FY2014 nuclear R&D budget request aligned with DOE's Nuclear Energy Research and Development Roadmap, focusing on improving reactor reliability, safety, and lifespan. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed DOE to update the Nuclear Energy Research and Development Roadmap within 180 days to reflect lessons learned from Fukushima, advances in small modular reactors, and the new nuclear waste strategy. The Reactor Concepts program area includes the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) demonstration project and research on advanced reactors. Funding is also allocated for developing advanced small modular reactors and enhancing the sustainability of existing commercial light water reactors in FY2014. The FY2014 appropriation for the Reactor Concepts program is $113 million, with the House voting for $86.5 million and the Senate supporting the Administration's funding level. The program includes the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) project, aimed at producing high-temperature heat for electricity generation and other industrial processes. DOE did not request funding specifically for the NGNP project in FY2014, despite the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizing its construction. The DOE decided not to proceed with a demonstration plant design for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) at this time due to obstacles like low natural gas prices and private-sector unwillingness to share costs. Research activities under the NGNP program will be shifted to the Advanced Reactor Concepts subprogram in FY2014, with funding increased to $60.0 million to cover research on high-temperature gas reactors. The Advanced Reactor Concepts subprogram under the NGNP Program is developing Generation IV reactors to improve nuclear power performance. These reactors use high-energy neutrons and various heat-transfer fluids. International collaboration continues through the Generation IV International Forum. The House bill proposed increasing funding for Advanced Reactor Concepts to $45 million. The Light Water Reactor Sustainability subprogram received $30.0 million, higher than the Administration's request and FY2012 appropriation. It aims to extend the life of existing commercial light water reactors beyond 60 years, focusing on reactor material aging, safety margins, efficiency improvements, and longer-life fuel research. The Light Water Reactor Sustainability subprogram received increased funding to extend the life of existing commercial light water reactors. There is a growing interest in small modular reactors as a cost-effective alternative to large conventional nuclear reactors. These reactors range from 40 to 300 megawatts and use various technologies, including high-temperature gas and light water technology. The FY2014 DOE appropriation for licensing small modular reactors is $110 million, 36% above the Administration request. The program focuses on LWR designs and will cost DOE $452 million over six years. Support includes design certification, standards, and licensing, with at least half the costs to be covered by DOE. In 2010, the DOE announced a program for small modular reactor (SMR) design and licensing, with industry partners covering half the costs. Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) led the first award in November 2012, receiving $226 million over five years. NuScale Power received a second award in December 2013 for an innovative SMR design. The FY2014 appropriation allocated $85 million for B&W and $25 million for NuScale. An additional $23 million was appropriated for the Reactor Concepts program. The FY2014 budget allocated $23 million to the Reactor Concepts program for SMR advanced concepts R&D, focusing on technologies for longer-term deployment. Small modular reactors represent a shift from larger reactors, with proponents citing economic viability through factory assembly and minimal on-site fabrication. The House and Senate panel approved the Administration's funding level for this program. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts long-term research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. The FY2014 appropriation for the program is $186.5 million, above the Administration request. The range of technologies studied includes direct disposal of spent fuel. The Fuel Cycle R&D Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, including direct disposal and recycling. The program aims to provide options for future decision-makers on nuclear waste management. Funding addresses recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, which proposed alternatives to the Yucca Mountain repository. The Fuel Cycle R&D Program focuses on managing spent nuclear fuel, including direct disposal and recycling. Funding is allocated for implementing a strategy in response to the Blue Ribbon Commission report, including developing plans for a \"consent-based siting process\" for nuclear storage and disposal facilities. Other research areas include advanced fuels, fuel cycle options, technologies to prevent nuclear material diversion, and increasing nuclear fuel resources. The final appropriation for nuclear fuel resources includes $60.0 million for accident-tolerant fuels and $71.1 million for the Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies program, which supports new reactor designs and fuel cycle technologies. The Administration had requested $37.1 million for Advanced Fuels. The Joint Explanatory Statement for P.L. 113-76 does not specify funding levels for the functions in the NEET program, including Crosscutting Technology Development, Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation, and the Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation. The Modeling and Simulation Hub aims to create a computer model of an operating reactor for better understanding of nuclear technology. The FY2014 appropriation included funding for the National Scientific User Facility. The Obama Administration requested $420.6 million for the Fossil Energy Research and Development Program in FY2014, representing a 17% decrease from the FY2013 appropriation. The final appropriation provided $562.1 million, 25% more than the Administration request and almost 10% more than the FY2013 appropriation. The FY2012 Fossil Energy Research and Development program under the Obama Administration focused on coal with an emphasis on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. The program aimed to demonstrate advanced clean coal technologies and build near-zero atmospheric emissions power plants that capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) through various sub-programs such as Carbon Capture and Carbon Storage. Additionally, an Advanced Energy Systems sub-program aimed to improve the efficiency of coal-based power systems for CO2 capture. The Advanced Energy Systems sub-program focuses on improving the efficiency of coal-based power systems for CO2 capture. The Cross-Cutting Research activity bridges basic and applied research for innovative systems. The FY2014 final version appropriates more funding for FE R&D, with specific allocations for Coal, Carbon Capture, and Carbon Storage, including support for Enhanced Oil Recovery. The FY2014 final version appropriates funding for various energy research programs, including $57 million for Carbon Storage, $99.5 million for Advanced Energy Systems, $41.9 million for Cross Cutting Research, $50.0 million for NETL Coal Research and Development, $120.0 million for Program Direction, and $20.6 million for Natural Gas Technologies. The FY2014 final version appropriates funding for various energy research programs, including $12.6 million for hydraulic fracturing research and development, with $6 million allocated for joint research with EPA and USGS. $15 million is designated for Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies, focusing on improving economic viability, safety, and environmental responsibility for offshore exploration and production. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in Louisiana and Texas provides security for U.S. oil supplies against disruptions. It fulfills U.S. obligations under the International Energy Program and has a maximum capacity of 727 million barrels. The federal government stopped purchasing oil for the SPR in 1994 and began adding to it with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil in 2000. The RIK Program was phased out in 2009. In 2011, the President ordered an SPR sale, reducing inventory to 695.9 million barrels. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 rescinded funds in the \"SPR Petroleum Account\" and repealed authority to accept oil through royalty-in-kind. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 prohibited waiver of the Jones Act for transporting crude oil from the SPR. The Administration requested $189.4 million for FY2014 to operate the SPR. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 allocated $5.071 billion to the DOE Office of Science for FY2014, representing an 8.3% increase from the previous year. The Office conducts basic research in various program areas and is a significant federal funder of research in the physical sciences. The FY2013 current plan amount was $4.681 billion, with the Obama Administration seeking $5.153 billion for the Office of Science in FY2014. The Senate Committee on Appropriations supported the requested amount, while H.R. 2609 proposed $4.653 billion. The Joint Explanatory Statement (JES) accompanied P.L. 113-76, adopting provisions from both House and Senate reports. H.Rept. 113-135 raised concerns about the percentage of funding for ongoing projects, with provisions in P.L. 113-76 limiting this practice. The FY2014 Office of Science funding under P.L. 113-76 cannot be used for multiyear agreements under $1,000,000 unless fully funded. The budget increases for the Office of Science have been driven by the \"doubling path\" policy since FY2006, but actual funding levels have not met authorized levels. The current authorization ended in FY2013, and it is uncertain if policymakers will continue this trend. The FY2014 funding for the largest Office of Science program, Basic Energy Sciences (BES), is $1.713 billion, which is $162 million more than the FY2013 funding level. The Administration initially requested $1.862 billion for BES in FY2014, with most of the increase going towards scientific user facilities and Energy Frontier Research Centers. Construction funding for LINAC Coherent Light Source-II (LCLS-II) would have increased by $65 million, while funding for National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) would have decreased by $125 million. The House and Senate committees differed on funding levels for various programs within the Department of Energy in FY2014. The House provided $1.583 billion for Basic Energy Sciences (BES), while the Senate recommended $1.805 billion. They also disagreed on funding for Fuels from Sunlight and Battery and Energy Storage Energy Innovation Hubs, with the Senate recommending the requested $24 million each and the House not specifying. The Senate recommended $100 million for Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs), while the House proposed $60 million. Neither committee provided the requested one-time funds for EFRCs. The House report provided funding for certain BES activities, including NSLS-II Experimental Tools and LCLS-II two-tunnel upgrade. The JES allocated funds for Fuels from Sunlight, Battery and Energy Storage Energy Innovation Hubs, EPSCoR, and EFRCs. It also included funding for major equipment and facilities such as Synchrotron Radiation Light Sources and High-Flux Neutron Sources. The FY2014 budget request included $10 million for LCLS-II construction and $76 million for LCLS-II construction funding. The largest increase in the budget request was for the Fusion Energy Sciences program, with a focus on funding facilities such as the U.S. contribution to ITER. Funding for domestic fusion activities, including the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, would have decreased under the request. Enacted funding for Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) in FY2014 is $506 million, a $128 million increase from FY2013. Concerns have been raised about the impact of ITER's funding on domestic fusion programs. The House included $22 million for the Alcator C-Mod, while the Senate excluded funding for the project. The Senate recommended $458 million for FES, with specific allocations for various fusion programs. The House and Senate appropriations committees requested an updated project baseline and cost schedule for ITER. The Senate specified that U.S. funds for ITER would not be available until the DOE submits these materials. The House proposed $218 million for ITER in FY2014, while the Senate recommended $184 million. Both committees directed the DOE to submit a 10-year plan for the FES program, allocating $306 million for domestic fusion programs, including funding for the National Spherical Torus experiment, DIII-D, and Alcator C-Mod. Additional funding was provided for various FES activities, such as High Energy Density Laboratory Plasmas. The Joint Explanatory Statement (JES) does not specify a funding level for Fusion Simulation program but directs DOE to submit a plan with research goals and resource needs. $200 million is allocated for ITER in the JES, with U.S. cash contributions limited to $23 million until certain conditions are met. P.L. 113-76 includes $798 million for the Office of Science's High Energy Physics program in FY2014, $70 million more than the FY2013 level. The Administration initially sought $777 million for this program but DOE restructured the budget request to shift funding towards existing facilities and experiments. The House and Senate committees recommended funding for various projects in the High Energy Physics program in FY2014, including the Muon to Electron Conversion Experiment (Mu2e) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope camera. The House proposed $773 million for HEP, while the Senate recommended $807 million. Both committees allocated $35 million for Mu2e. Additionally, the House included $8 million for the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project engineering and design, while the Senate report suggested $20 million for LBNE project engineering and design and $10 million for research and development. The Joint Explanatory Statement provided $15 million to support sustaining operations. The Joint Explanatory Statement (JES) allocates $10 million for research and development, $15 million for sustaining operations at the Homestake Mine, $10 million for Accelerators Stewardship, and $26 million for the LBNE project. FY2014 funding for Biological and Environmental Research (BER) is $610 million, $50 million more than the FY2013 level. The Administration's requested increase for BER would have supported Foundational Genomics Research, Terrestrial Ecosystem Science, and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility. The request aimed to reduce funding in Radiological Sciences and establish a new Mesoscale to Molecules program. The House proposed a $67 million reduction in BER funding for FY2014, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the requested level. The House report supported biomass research and recommended $75 million for BioEnergy Research Centers. The Senate report recommended $321 million for Biological Systems Science and $304 million for Climate and Environmental Sciences. The JES allocated $75 million for BioEnergy Research Centers and $5 million for nuclear medicine research. In FY2014, JES allocated $75 million for BioEnergy Research Centers, $5 million for nuclear medicine research, and $500,000 for universities to engage in climate analysis. Nuclear Physics received $570 million in funding, with increases directed towards Medium Energy Nuclear Physics operations and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University. Funding for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility was also included in the budget request. In FY2014, funding for the 12GeV CEBAF Upgrade decreased, while funding for the FRIB increased to support construction activities. The House proposed $552 million for Nuclear Physics, while the Senate recommended the requested level. Both committees suggested $55 million for FRIB construction, $26 million for the 12 GeV CEBAF Upgrade, and $165 million for 22 weeks of RHIC operations. The Senate also recommended $17 million for the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System. JES allocated $165 million for RHIC operations and $55 million for FRIB, with ASCR receiving $479 million in funding, an increase of $74 million. In FY2014, funding for Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) increased to $479 million, up by $74 million (18.2%) from the previous year. The Administration's request was $466 million, with the Senate recommending $494 million. The increase in funding was mainly for exascale computing, with the Senate allocating $150 million for this purpose. The House proposed $432 million for ASCR. In FY2014, funding for Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) increased to $479 million, with the Senate recommending $494 million. The House would have provided $149 million for Leadership Computing Facilities, $62 million for High Performance Production Computing, and $33 million for ESNet. The Senate recommended $6 million for the Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (CSGF). The JES allocated $93 million for the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, $67 million for the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, and $66 million for the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. The DOE budget for FY2014 allocated funds for various research initiatives, including $379 million for ARPA-E to support energy technology projects. The JES also funded the CSGF under the Office of Science's Workforce Development program. The FY2014 ARPA-E request included two research thrust areas: Transportation Systems ($197 million requested) and Stationary Power Systems ($148 million requested). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided $280 million to ARPA-E in FY2014, an increase of $29 million over the FY2013 funding level. H.R. 2609 would have provided $70 million, while S. 1245 proposed $379 million for the energy research program. ARPA-E was directed to evaluate the success of projects and report findings to the Appropriations Committee. The FY2014 appropriation includes no funding for DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), which was tasked with disposing of highly radioactive waste. Funding for OCRWM ended in FY2010, leading to the closure of the office and halting activities at the Yucca Mountain site. The Obama Administration has determined that developing the Yucca Mountain repository is not feasible and is seeking alternative waste management strategies. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a \"consent based\" approach for developing nuclear waste facilities, suggesting a new organization manage the process with access to the Nuclear Waste Fund. DOE released a strategy in 2013 in response to the Commission's report, calling for a pilot interim storage facility for spent fuel to open by 2021. A storage facility for spent nuclear fuel from closed reactors is set to open by 2021, with plans for a larger facility by 2025. A permanent underground waste repository is expected to be selected by 2026 and operational by 2048. The DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy is now responsible for waste management activities, with funding allocated for implementing the waste management strategy. The final appropriation for the Fuel Cycle R&D program was $21.4 million above the requested amount, with no specified funding for the Used Fuel subprogram. The House bill criticized the termination of the Yucca Mountain project and proposed adding $25 million for it, while the Senate approved the proposed funding level for Used Fuel without mentioning Yucca Mountain. The FY2014 budget request included a proposal to change the nuclear waste funding system along the lines proposed by the Blue Ribbon Commission. Discretionary funding would continue to pay for \"regular and recurring\" expenses of the nuclear waste program, supplemented by mandatory appropriations from nuclear waste fee revenues starting in FY2017. The FY2014 budget proposed changing nuclear waste funding to include mandatory appropriations from waste fee revenues. DOE filed a license application for Yucca Mountain but faced challenges in withdrawing it due to NWPA requirements. The licensing process for Yucca Mountain was ordered to be halted due to budget limitations, with no funding provided for FY2012-FY2014. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the NRC must continue work on the license application if funding is available. DOE faced challenges in meeting waste disposal deadlines, leading to court decisions in favor of nuclear utilities seeking compensation for damages. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims estimates liability payments exceeding $20 billion if waste removal from reactor sites begins by 2020. DOE's Loan Programs Office offers loan guarantees for energy projects under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. No additional funding for loans and guarantees was requested for FY2014, but $42 million was allocated for administrative expenses. The DOE Loan Programs Office administers two major loan guarantee programs: Section 1703 for innovative clean energy technology and Section 1705 for renewable energy, electric transmission, and advanced biofuels. $42 million was allocated for loan guarantee administrative expenses, $6 million below the Administration request, offset by $22 million in fees. An additional $6 million was appropriated to the vehicle manufacturing loan program with no offsets. Eligible technology categories include renewable energy, advanced fossil energy, advanced nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and pollution control. The Section 1705 program, established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, provides loan guarantees for renewable energy and electric transmission technologies. DOE can guarantee up to 80% of construction costs for eligible projects, reducing lender risk and allowing for below-market interest rates. Currently, there are pending loan guarantee commitments totaling $10.33 billion for nuclear projects under Section 1703, and final loan guarantees totaling $14.4 billion have been issued for 24 projects under Section 1705. Final loan guarantees totaling $14.4 billion have been issued for 24 projects under Section 1705. The first loan guarantee was issued to Solyndra Inc. in September 2009, with a total of $535 million. Solyndra's bankruptcy in 2011 raised concerns about the Administration's management of the program. Title XVII requires upfront coverage of estimated future government costs from defaults on guaranteed loans. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that subsidy cost payments for loan guarantees may be too low by at least 1%, leading to an adjustment in appropriations bills. Subsidy costs for Section 1703 loan guarantees are typically covered by project sponsors, except for those under ARRA which had $6 billion allocated for subsidy costs. The Section 1705 subsidy cost appropriation was reduced by $2 billion for the \"cash for clunkers\" program and $1.5 billion for the Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act. This left $2.5 billion available, with $1.9 billion obligated by the end of FY2011. Federal loan guarantees under the Section 1703 program require an authorized level in an appropriations act. The initial cap was set at $4 billion under the FY2007 continuing resolution, with additional authority provided for specific technologies. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provided $170 million with no expiration for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program. It also authorized up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for these projects, in addition to the $32.8 billion in existing authority for all technologies. This funding is available to projects that applied under the expiring Section 1705 before February 24, 2011. The DOE loan guarantee program, as modified by the FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act, includes a $8.3 billion ceiling for non-nuclear technologies under Section 1703, $2 billion for unspecified projects from FY2007, $18.5 billion ceiling for nuclear power plants, $4 billion for uranium enrichment plants, and $1.183 billion ceiling for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Additionally, $170 million is allocated for subsidy costs for renewable energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees under Section 1703. The DOE loan guarantee program includes funding for various projects such as non-nuclear technologies, nuclear power plants, uranium enrichment plants, and renewable energy projects. The program also administers the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program to support automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers. Funding for subsidy costs and direct loans has been allocated to support these initiatives. The ATVM Loan Program, administered by the DOE Loan Programs Office, has issued five loans totaling $8.4 billion for vehicles with improved fuel economy. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, operated by the NNSA within DOE, ensures the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. Funding for these programs is detailed in the Weapons Activities account. NNSA manages the nuclear weapons complex, consisting of laboratories and production sites. Proposed changes for FY2014 include creating an Office of Infrastructure and Operations. NNSA proposed changes for FY2014 to the nuclear weapons complex, including eliminating RTBF and reallocating functions to Site Stewardship and a new Nuclear Programs. P.L. 113-76 retained RTBF, kept Site Stewardship funding similar to FY2013, and did not fund Nuclear Programs. There were proposed shifts in programs like Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response and Domestic Uranium Enrichment Research. The nuclear weapons complex currently has eight sites, but was larger during the Cold War. During the Cold War, the nuclear weapons complex was larger in terms of sites and personnel. Despite post-Cold War reductions, Congress has been pushing for further changes such as fewer personnel, increased efficiency, and enhanced security. The President provided Congress with a classified report outlining plans to maintain delivery platforms, sustain a safe nuclear weapons stockpile, and modernize the complex with an $80 billion investment over the next decade. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion over the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. The revised Section 1251 report projected costs for weapons stockpile and infrastructure at $85.4-$86.2 billion for FY2011-FY2020, with a request of $7,577.3 million for Weapons Activities in FY2013. Despite criticism, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended and funded the requested amount in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated a sequester unless certain actions were taken by Congress. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated a sequester due to Congress not taking certain actions. The Office of Management and Budget calculated sequester amounts for programs in FY2013, which included an across-the-board rescission. The FY2014 request included out-year figures, and the projected Weapons Activities requests for FY2015-FY2018 were close to the amounts projected in a previous report. This program involves work directly on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, such as monitoring their condition, maintenance, R&D, and dismantlement. The Defense Stockpile Work (DSW) involves Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for existing warheads like B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs, W76 warhead for Trident II missile, and B61 mod 12. Funding for LEPs in FY2013 was $218.3 million for W76 and $324.4 million for B61. FY2014 requested $537.0 million for B61-12 LEP to continue development engineering. Production unit planned for FY2019. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $560.7 million for the first production unit in FY2019, addressing a funding gap resulting from program efficiencies. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $369.0 million, expressing concerns about the LEP option proposed. NNSA requested $235.4 million for the W76-1 LEP, intending to complete production by FY2019. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $248.5 million to address funding issues. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount of $248.5 million for the W76 LEP. NNSA requested $72.7 million for the W78/W88-1 LEP, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $50.0 million for a study of W78 life extension. The LEP aims to create a common interoperable warhead for both land-based and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for the W76 LEP and expressed concern about the cost for the LEP, directing NNSA not to preclude a separate LEP for the W78. P.L. 113-76 provided funding for the W78 life extension study and the W88 Alteration 370 program. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended the requested amount for the W88 Alteration 370 program. Stockpile Systems program involves routine maintenance, replacement of limited-life components, surveillance, and assessment for all weapon types in the stockpile. The FY2013 appropriation for Stockpile Systems was $518.8 million, which decreased to $454.5 million for FY2014 due to advancements in the W78/W88 study and Alt 370. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $282.8 million, with funds for warhead surveillance moved to a new Surveillance budget line. The FY2014 appropriation allocated $454.5 million for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) as the number of warheads continues to decline. The FY2014 budget for dismantlement and disposition of warheads was $54.3 million, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending an increase to reduce the backlog in disposing nuclear components. Stockpile Services, including Production Support and Plutonium Infrastructure Sustainment, provides the foundation for production. Stockpile Services is crucial for the nuclear security enterprise, supporting production, logistics, and research activities for various weapons types. The FY2014 budget request was $910.2 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $1,180.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $838.5 million, citing concerns over unnecessary increases in certification and the inclusion of certain funds in Stockpile Services. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $838.5 million for Stockpile Services in the budget, moving programs and reducing funds for R&D Certification and Safety. Tritium Readiness was also moved from the Readiness Campaign to Stockpile Services. These efforts provide scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile. Campaigns like the Science Campaign aim to improve warhead performance assessment, readiness for nuclear tests, and maintain scientific infrastructure in nuclear weapons laboratories. The Science Campaign within the nuclear weapons laboratories received increased funding in FY2013 and FY2014, with a focus on Advanced Certification, Primary Assessment Technologies, and Dynamic Materials Properties for pit re-use in LEP designs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for FY2014, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $374.7 million. P.L. 113-76 provided $369.7 million and directed NNSA to commission a study on the use of insensitive high explosives in future LEPs. The Engineering Campaign funds activities to assess and improve nuclear and non-nuclear engineering components without underground testing. In FY2013, $127.7 million was appropriated, with a request of $149.9 million for FY2014. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $90.0 million and suggested moving funds to a new Technology Maturation Campaign, but P.L. 113-76 provided the requested amount. The Technology Maturation Campaign was not included in the funding provided by P.L. 113-76. The Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign aims to create high temperatures and pressures for weapons-related research. The National Ignition Facility plays a key role in conducting high-energy density physics experiments. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the world's largest laser and a key component of the Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign. Despite initial controversy and technical challenges, NIF conducted successful target shots in support of High Energy Density Stockpile Stewardship. However, the facility faced criticism for its high costs and lack of progress towards achieving fusion ignition. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is an expensive platform for high energy density physics experiments. The Lawrence-Livermore National Laboratory announced an improved experiment at NIF in August 2013, achieving three times the neutron energy previously recorded. Funding for NIF in FY2013 was $446.7 million, with a decrease in FY2014 to $401.0 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $514.0 million due to NNSA's request. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $514.0 million for the National Ignition Facility (NIF), with an increase in funds for Facility Operations and Target Production. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $528.4 million, including moving funds for NIF operations from Site Stewardship to Facility Operations and Target Production. The Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons for weapon behavior determination. The Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign develops computational models for nuclear weapon behavior. Some analysts question the reliability of simulations for certifying warhead safety and advocate for a return to testing. Funding for FY2013 was $545.8 million, FY2014 request was $564.3 million, and the appropriation was $569.3 million. The Senate recommended $600.6 million, with $69.0 million for the exascale initiative to improve supercomputers. The Tritium Readiness Campaign received increased funding in FY2014, with $91.7 million allocated for enrichment of reactor fuel and production preparation. Nonnuclear Readiness funds were realigned to Component Manufacturing Development. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funds for this campaign, redirecting them to Directed Stockpile Work. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended replacing the Readiness Campaign with the Technology Maturation Campaign, allocating $253.7 million for it. The FY2014 appropriation provided no funds for Component Manufacturing Development, moved Tritium Readiness to Stockpile Services, and provided $55.4 million for Nonnuclear Readiness. NNSA would abolish this program in its FY2014 request, transferring its programs to the newly created Nuclear Programs and Site Stewardship. Total FY2014 request for these programs was $2,450.5 million. P.L. 113-76 retained RTBF and provided $2,067.4 million. The FY2014 request for the Readiness Campaign and Technology Maturation Campaign was $2,450.5 million. P.L. 113-76 provided $2,067.4 million for RTBF, which includes Operations of Facilities and Construction subprograms. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement project at Los Alamos National Laboratory, involving the RLUOB and NF buildings, was a controversial activity in the Weapons Activities account. The NNSA requested funds for the CMRR Nuclear Facility in FY2012, but construction activities were not funded. NNSA proposed deferring construction for at least five years, citing existing infrastructure's capacity to support plutonium chemistry and physics. Studies are ongoing to determine long-term requirements, with a focus on maximizing use of existing facilities. The NNSA is relocating nuclear materials to maximize the use of existing facilities, resulting in an estimated cost avoidance of $1.8 billion from FY 2013 to FY 2017. The CMRR-NF did not receive funding for FY2014, and NNSA is exploring a strategy for producing pits. The Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) at the Y-12 National Security Complex aims to replace old facilities and conduct operations involving enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and naval reactors. The FY2013 appropriation for UPF was $312.8 million. The FY2014 appropriation for the Uranium Capabilities Replacement Project (formerly UPF) was $325.8 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about cost escalations and project management issues. A space fit issue led to over $500 million in additional costs. The FY2014 appropriation was adjusted to $309.0 million to support continued facility design and explore cost-saving alternatives for uranium infrastructure needs at Y-12. The Uranium Capabilities Replacement Project in FY2014 focused on processing and managing Special Nuclear Materials, with goals to supply required quantities, recycle, recover, and store these materials. It included elements such as Nuclear Operations Capability, Capabilities Based Investments, and Construction, with a budget request of $744.5 million. The FY2014 budget request for the Uranium Capabilities Replacement Project was $744.5 million. The House Appropriations Committee criticized NNSA's use of the budget category and selectively funded activities under Nuclear Programs using the existing budget structure. The Senate Appropriations Committee renamed accounts for greater clarity and recommended $688.0 million for Nuclear Operations and Capital Construction, with $439.0 million for major capital construction projects. P.L. 113-76 did not provide funds for Nuclear Programs but allocated funds under RTBF. The FY2014 budget request for Nuclear Programs was $1,706.0 million, with $1,660.8 million allocated for Enterprise Infrastructure. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $154.8 million for Site Stewardship, with certain programs not funded. The NNSA requested funding for infrastructure under Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities, excluding site facility operations, maintenance, or recapitalization within Site Stewardship. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $1,535.9 million under Site Operations and Maintenance instead of Site Stewardship. Weapons Activities include programs like Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear weapons, with a FY2014 request of $219.2 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $210.0 million for this purpose. The FY2013 appropriation for Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response was $232.8 million. In FY2014, the program was transferred to Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation for aligning NNSA funding. The House Appropriations Committee did not fund it under Weapons Activities, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $260.2 million and opposed the transfer. P.L. 113-76 provided $228.2 million for the program under Weapons Activities. Defense Nuclear Security funds protective forces, physical security, and construction. The Defense Nuclear Security program provides funds for protective forces, physical security systems, and personnel security to protect NNSA personnel, facilities, nuclear weapons, and information from various threats, including terrorism. In FY2014, the program became standalone with a budget of $679.0 million, including $14.0 million for a security upgrade at the Device Assembly Facility. Security enhancements were implemented in response to a security breach at Y-12 in July 2012. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $665.0 million for the program. The NNSA CIO Activities program for FY2013 aimed to consolidate cyber security and information technology programs, including cyber security, enterprise secure computing, and Federal Unclassified Information Technology. The FY2013 appropriation was $141.6 million, with a FY2014 request of $148.4 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $150.0 million for the program, renaming the budget line Information Technology. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $150.0 million for the Information Technology and Cyber Security (ITCS) budget line, which was also renamed. The National Security Applications program received $9.5 million in FY2013 and activities were transferred from Weapons Activities to Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation in FY2014. Legacy Contractor Pensions were affected when the University of California operated Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. When the two labs were privatized, the contracts included provisions for larger pensions for UC employees, funded by NNSA. The FY2013 appropriation was $170.2 million, and the FY2014 request was $279.6 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended the amounts, with concerns about escalating pension costs. The FY2014 appropriation provided $62.0 million for Domestic Uranium Enrichment Research, Development, and Demonstration program, moving it from Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation to Weapons Activities. Additional funding for FY2014 was contingent on a clear strategy from the Department to ensure the supply of tritium and enriched uranium for defense needs. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs, under the National Nuclear Security Administration, support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide. Funding for these programs in FY2013 was $2,243.1 million after the sequester. Funding for Nuclear Nonproliferation programs in FY2013 was $2,243.1 million. The FY2014 request was $2,140.1 million, including proposed transfers of two programs. The final bill did not include the transfers, appropriating $1,954 million for Nuclear Nonproliferation. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $429.6 million in FY2013 and the FY2014 request was $388.8 million. The House bill supported the request, while the Senate recommended $408.8 million. The final bill for Nonproliferation and International Security programs in FY2014 appropriated $398.8 million, with a request of $141.7 million. The International Materials Protection and Control program received $369.6 million, reflecting a shift to a sustainability phase with Russia. The final bill for Nonproliferation and International Security programs in FY2014 appropriated $398.8 million, with a request of $141.7 million. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to convert surplus weapons plutonium into fuel for power reactors in the US and Russia. Controversy arose over the necessity of a pit disassembly project in the US. The FY2012 request for the Fissile Materials Disposition program was $892.2 million, but the final bill appropriated $685.4 million with no funding for the PDCF project. The FY2013 request was $921.3 million, with no funding for the PDCF as NNSA planned to use existing facilities for pit disassembly. The MOX facility cold start-up caused an increase in funding, but the FY2013 appropriation was $631.6 million, with $401.0 million for the MOX project. In FY2013, the MOX appropriation was $401.0 million out of a total FMD appropriation of $631.6 million. The estimated total cost for the facility increased to $7.7 billion, with plans to evaluate alternatives for plutonium disposition. The House bill approved the requested $502.6 million for FMD programs, including $320 million for the MOX plant, while the Senate funded the facility at $430.6 million, rejecting a pause in construction. The Appropriations Committee rejected a pause in MOX construction, funding the facility at $430.6 million and total FMD programs at $669.2 million. The final appropriations bill provided $343.5 million for MOX construction and a total of $526.1 million for the FMD program. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors worldwide from using highly enriched uranium, dispose of excess nuclear materials, and protect nuclear materials from theft or sabotage. The FY2013 appropriation for this program was $460.7 million, with the FY2014 request at $424.5 million. The final bill appropriated $442.1 million for the program. The Manhattan Project's legacy of wastes and contamination led to the establishment of the DOE's Office of Environmental Management in 1989. This office is responsible for cleaning up former nuclear weapons production facilities, managing radioactive and hazardous wastes, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, decontamination of buildings, and safeguarding facilities. Additionally, the office oversees the cleanup of DOE facilities involved in civilian nuclear energy research. Efforts to clean up the environmental legacy of nuclear weapons production and civilian nuclear energy research represent the largest environmental liability in the United States, surpassing the cleanup liability of Department of Defense facilities. Annual appropriations of billions of dollars are needed for ongoing cleanup efforts, sparking interest in Congress about the long-term financial liability. The protection of public safety, human health, and the environment in a cost-effective manner is a recurring issue in the appropriations debate. The Department of Energy has identified over 100 facilities in 30 states involved in nuclear weapons production and energy research. Cleanup remedies are in place for most sites, with long-term stewardship managed by the Office of Legacy Management. Some smaller sites were transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers in 1997 for cleanup under the FUSRAP program. The cleanup of nuclear weapons production and energy research facilities is funded by the Corps under the FUSRAP program. Once cleaned up, sites are transferred back to DOE for long-term stewardship. DOE expects cleanup to continue for years, requiring billions of dollars. As of FY2013, cleanup was completed at 90 facilities in 30 states, with 17 facilities still undergoing cleanup. Cleanup of nuclear weapons production and energy research facilities funded by the Corps under the FUSRAP program is expected to continue for decades at larger and more complex facilities. The Hanford facility in Washington has the longest cleanup timeframe, possibly extending until 2066. The estimated costs for completing cleanup at 17 facilities range between $187.0 billion and $223.4 billion, with challenges in managing high-level radioactive wastes contributing to funding needs and lengthy time frames. DOE periodically revises its cost estimates for cleanup projects, which have varied by billions of dollars over the years. The current estimates are several billion dollars higher than the previous year. The costs are presented as a range to account for uncertainties in the cleanup process, including decisions on remediation actions and waste disposal methods. Long-term stewardship costs are not included in these estimates, adding further uncertainty due to maintenance and monitoring requirements post-cleanup. The DOE allocates funds for environmental cleanup, including Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning. Long-term stewardship costs for maintenance and monitoring post-cleanup are not included in cost estimates, adding uncertainty. Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to clean up federal facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. $5.83 billion was appropriated in FY2014 for these cleanup efforts, with varying amounts proposed by different sources. This funding was an increase from the previous year's appropriations for the Office of Environmental Management. The FY2014 appropriations of $5.83 billion for the Office of Environmental Management aimed to attain cleanup milestones across DOE facilities, with the President's request of $5.62 billion deemed sufficient for this purpose. Cleanup milestones are enforceable measures for completing specific actions at individual facilities to meet requirements. The enacted FY2014 appropriations of $5.83 billion in P.L. 113-76 provided additional resources, an increase of $208.9 million above the request. The House and Senate had differing views on the funding, with the House aiming to sustain cleanup progress while the Senate expressed concerns about potential missed milestones in various states. The bill did not include the $463 million requested by the President for the Defense Environmental Cleanup account. The President proposed to resume assessments on nuclear utilities in FY2014 to generate additional revenues, subject to reauthorizing legislation. Both federal payments and nuclear utility assessments originally financed the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The Office of Management and Budget estimated an existing balance of $3.5 billion in the fund. The Office of Management and Budget estimated a $3.5 billion balance in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund from past nuclear utility assessments and federal payments. $598.8 million was appropriated in FY2014, leaving $3.0 billion for future appropriations. Without additional revenues, a shortfall of $11.8 billion is projected for the cleanup of federal uranium enrichment facilities by FY2020. DOE remains responsible for cleanup costs even if the fund is fully expended. Funding priorities varied in the FY2014 appropriations debate. In the FY2014 appropriations debate, funding priorities for the Office of Environmental Management varied. Table 15 shows appropriations for FY2014 compared to previous years, including the net total program funding level. The President proposed resuming federal payments to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2014, but Congress did not approve it. The Office of Legacy Management administers long-term stewardship of facilities without a continuing mission, including sites transferred from DOE to the Army Corps of Engineers under the FUSRAP program. The Corps handles initial operation and maintenance for two years post-cleanup before transferring sites back to DOE for long-term stewardship. The Office also manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel at DOE facilities without a continuing mission. The federal government manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel at DOE facilities. The Office of Legacy Management has been funded through DOE's Other Defense Activities account since FY2009. In FY2014, $177.0 million was allocated for the Office of Legacy Management, an increase from the previous year. During FY2014, the Office of Legacy Management plans to manage closure sites, add new sites for long-term stewardship, and address funding needs through program efficiencies. Funding needs are expected to increase over the next decade as more facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term stewardship. The total number of facilities administered by the Office of Legacy Management is projected to increase to 129 by FY2020. The Office of Legacy Management's long-term funding needs are challenging to estimate due to the lengthy time horizons involved in cleanup and monitoring contaminant levels. Stewardship may be required indefinitely at sites containing radioactive wastes, making it difficult to predict the financial liability for long-term stewardship. Land use restrictions and institutional controls may also be necessary to prevent harmful exposures at facilities not cleaned up for unrestricted use. The DOE's Power Marketing Administrations were established to sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Priority for PMA power is given to \"preference customers\" such as municipal utilities and cooperatives. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power to \"preference customers\" at the lowest possible rates. The PMAs cover their expenses, repay debt, and receive federal investment. The FY2014 budget request for PMAs was $85 million, continuing a change enacted in FY2010. SWPA requests $11.9 million in discretionary funding. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) require discretionary funding: SWPA requests $11.9 million and WAPA requests $95.9 million. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover operating costs in FY2011. Additionally, $400,000 is requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance. P.L. 113-76 appropriated $85 million for PMAs. BPA is self-funded and receives no appropriations, funding activities through borrowing authority increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003. ARRA further increased BPA's borrowing capacity by $3.25 billion. The ARRA increased BPA's borrowing capacity by $3.25 billion, bringing the total authority to $7.7 billion in bonds outstanding to the Treasury. WAPA also received borrowing authority for new transmission lines for renewable energy resources. Independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include NRC, ARC, and Denali Commission. NRC was appropriated $1.0559 billion for FY2014. The NRC was appropriated $1.0559 billion for FY2014, which included funding for safety regulation, licensing of commercial nuclear reactors, and oversight of nuclear materials users. The budget request also included funds for new reactor activities, with several new reactor construction applications being submitted due to factors like volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives provided by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The NRC received funding for safety regulation, licensing of commercial nuclear reactors, and oversight of nuclear materials users in FY2014. Several new reactor construction applications were submitted, but some were withdrawn due to falling natural gas prices. The NRC issued licenses for four new reactors in Georgia and South Carolina. The Obama Administration wanted to cancel the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository project, leading to a motion to withdraw the license application. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered the NRC to continue reviewing the Yucca Mountain license application using leftover funding. The NRC's FY2014 budget request included $571.9 million for regulating operating reactors, reactor safety inspections, license renewals, and oversight of security exercises. The Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan led to increased concern about U.S. nuclear power plant safety, prompting NRC to establish a task force to review its regulatory system. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended a requirement for NRC's funding. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended a requirement for NRC's funding, with 90% of the budget offset by fees on licensees. Expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund for waste repository licensing and general homeland security are not subject to the offset. The FY2014 appropriation resulted in a net appropriation of $125.2 million, $3.2 million below the FY2012 enacted level."
