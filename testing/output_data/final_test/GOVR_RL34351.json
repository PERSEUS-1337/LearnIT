    "content": "In 2007, Canada and Brazil filed WTO cases against certain U.S. farm programs for exceeding subsidy limits and providing prohibited subsidies. A single panel was established to hear both cases, but by late February 2008, the case had stalled due to disagreement on panel arbitrators. The WTO case between Brazil, Canada, and the U.S. stalled due to disagreement on panel arbitrators. Brazil could ask the WTO director-general to compose the panel but did not. Brazil and Canada agreed to postpone the case pending U.S. offer to cut agricultural subsidies. No date set for case resumption. If resumed, a panel would be formed with six months to rule. Appeals and disagreements could prolong resolution. The importance of the WTO case to the U.S. agricultural community is significant as U.S. agriculture heavily relies on international markets. In FY2008, U.S. agricultural exports reached a record $115.5 billion, representing 30% of gross farm income. The report provides background on the Canadian and Brazilian WTO cases, detailing the charges against U.S. farm programs and the U.S. response. It also discusses the implications of the case and the potential role of Congress. Each section can be read independently for specific information. The section provides a historical record of Canada's and Brazil's WTO cases against U.S. farm programs, focusing on wheat and corn disputes. In 2005, Canada extended its disagreement to the corn sector, alleging unfair subsidization and dumping of U.S. corn in Canadian markets. Despite a ruling in favor of the U.S., Canadian corn producers continued to raise concerns. In January 2007, Canada requested consultations with the United States regarding concerns about unfair subsidization of U.S. corn. The charges included U.S. farm support prejudicing Canadian corn producers, exceeding WTO commitments, and containing WTO-illegal subsidies in export credit guarantee programs. Canada's case was influenced by previous trade complaints and a WTO ruling in a case brought by Brazil against the U.S. cotton program. Canada requested consultations with the United States in January 2007 over concerns about unfair subsidization of U.S. corn. This was driven by domestic political concerns, pressure from corn-producing interests, and a desire to influence the 2007 U.S. farm bill debate. Other factors included the suspension of Doha Round negotiations and the settlement of a softwood lumber dispute with the U.S. This marked the first step in instituting a WTO dispute settlement case against the U.S. Following Canada's request for consultations with the United States over unfair subsidization of U.S. corn, an official dispute settlement case number (DS357) was assigned, initiating the WTO DSU process. Several other WTO members joined the consultations as interested third parties. Despite failed consultations, Canada temporarily halted further action in the dispute settlement proceeding. Canada temporarily paused its WTO dispute (DS357) against U.S. corn subsidies, waiting for Doha Round trade negotiations. In June 2007, Canada requested a panel to hear its case against U.S. farm programs, dropping the serious prejudice charge. The U.S. blocked this request, but Canada could make a second request in the future. Brazil introduced a new challenge against U.S. farm programs in July 2007, following successful WTO dispute settlement rulings against U.S. cotton programs. The challenge builds on previous panel rulings and the lack of progress in the Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations. Negotiations on U.S. farm programs show little progress, prompting consideration of legal action through WTO dispute settlement. Brazil aims to influence U.S. farm bill debate for lower support. Canada initiated a similar case, with Brazil joining initially but later pursuing its own more detailed case for a stronger voice in the dispute settlement process. Following Brazil's request for consultations, several other WTO members\u2014Canada, Guatemala, Costa Rica, the European Communities (EC), Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Thailand, India, and Nicaragua\u2014requested to join the consultations as interested third parties. Brazil and the United States held consultations on August 22, 2007, but failed to resolve the dispute. By late 2007, Canada and Brazil coordinated efforts to request the establishment of a panel at the DSB meeting, which was blocked by the United States. At the DSB meeting in November 2007, the United States blocked a new panel request, but in December 17 meeting, a single panel was established to hear cases from Canada and Brazil against U.S. farm programs. The panel meeting was agreed to be public, but by February 2008, the case stalled due to disagreement on arbitrators. Brazil could ask the WTO director-general to compose the panel if no agreement was reached within 20 days. In late April 2008, Brazil and Canada agreed to postpone their case against U.S. farm programs, hoping for progress in the Doha Round negotiations. The postponement's duration is uncertain, but if resumed, a panel will be formed within 45 days by the DSB. Both Canadian and Brazilian cases raise charges against U.S. agricultural subsidies. The United States has agreed to submit annual notifications of their farm program outlays to the WTO, with specific spending limits for \"amber box\" programs. U.S. domestic support outlays have remained within WTO spending commitments, but Canada and Brazil argue that some U.S. program payments were either omitted or incorrectly notified. Canada and Brazil argue that the United States has exceeded its total spending limits in certain years due to disputed payments and subsidies not included in the U.S. AMS calculation. This claim is based on a previous ruling from the U.S.-Brazil cotton case regarding certain U.S. farm program payments not qualifying for the WTO's green box exemption. The United States has agreed to submit annual notifications of farm program outlays to the WTO, with specific spending limits for \"amber box\" programs. The United States has notified its PFC payments as fully decoupled and green box compliant in its WTO notifications. Canada and Brazil argue that PFC and DP payments do not conform with WTO green-box rules and should be included with U.S. amber box payments. Additionally, they argue that several other U.S. program payments were incorrectly notified as exempt from the U.S. AMS limit. The United States has notified various farm support programs as green box compliant, including indemnity and Tree Assistance programs for natural disasters, emergency crop market loss assistance payments, and CCP payments. Brazil and Canada argue that some of these payments should be classified as amber box spending and counted against the spending limit. The United States recommends CCP payments be eligible for the blue box instead. Brazil and Canada argue that several U.S. farm support programs were not notified, including loans, fuel tax exemptions, deductions from taxable income, cooperatives, export subsidies, and irrigation subsidies. They claim that when these payments are included in the U.S.'s amber box, it exceeds the spending limit. The U.S.'s outlays excluded from notifications are included in the amber box, potentially exceeding spending commitments in multiple years. Canada and Brazil lack specific details for direct comparisons. CRS calculations suggest U.S. spending limits would be exceeded in two years with additional payments. Including market loss assistance and CCP payments could exceed limits in five years. Brazil and Canada argue U.S. export credit guarantee program is a WTO-illegal export subsidy. In the U.S.-Brazil cotton case, a WTO panel found U.S. export practices problematic. In the U.S.-Brazil cotton case (DS267), a WTO panel found that U.S. export credit guarantees function as export subsidies due to financial benefits not covering operating costs for all commodities benefiting from U.S. support programs. The panel recommended removing these prohibited subsidies by July 1, 2005, but a compliance panel in 2007 found the U.S. had not fully complied. Then-U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns vowed to defend U.S. farm programs against challenges. The U.S. Trade Representative declared in early 2007 that the United States would vigorously defend U.S. farm programs against any possible WTO challenge by Canada. The official stated that U.S. farm programs were designed to be in compliance with its WTO obligations and believed that the panel would agree. Provisions in the 2008 farm bill brought the export credit guarantee program into compliance with WTO rules by eliminating the \"subsidy\" component. The 2008 farm bill brought the export credit guarantee program into compliance with WTO rules by eliminating the \"subsidy\" component, including repealing the GSM-103 and Supplier Credit Guarantee Program. The bill also removed the 1% cap on loan origination fees for the GSM-102 program and capped the credit subsidy at $40 million annually. However, the issue of disqualification of direct payments from the WTO's green box AMS exclusion was not addressed in the bill. The 2008 farm bill addressed compliance with WTO rules by eliminating certain subsidy components. However, the issue of disqualification of direct payments from the WTO's green box AMS exclusion was not resolved. This could have implications on U.S. commodity programs and future challenges from countries like Brazil and Canada. Congress may need to make changes to comply with WTO rulings on farm policy, including adjusting or removing planting restrictions on base acres receiving direct payments. Countries facing negative WTO rulings have options such as eliminating or reducing subsidies, decoupling subsidies from adverse effects, making compensatory payments, or facing trade retaliation. WTO cases can lead to punitive sanctions, but formal proceedings can be lengthy. Formal WTO cases can result in lengthy proceedings, with the U.S.-Brazil cotton case taking over five years to reach a conclusion. Market watchers question the relevance of expending legal resources on historical AMS violations. The U.S. may not need to address historical AMS violations due to high commodity prices. Long-term projections suggest low government support, keeping domestic support within limits. The outcome of the Doha Round trade negotiations could impact Canada and Brazil's case against U.S. farm programs. Congress is likely monitoring the WTO AMS dispute closely. Developments in the WTO AMS dispute may lead to Congress holding hearings on agricultural trade negotiations, including the possible renewal of Trade Promotion Authority legislation. This would provide Members with a platform to discuss the U.S.-Brazil/Canada AMS trade dispute and its implications for U.S. farm policy."
