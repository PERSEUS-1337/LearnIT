    "content": "The current HPAI outbreak, discovered in December 2014 in the Pacific Northwest and California, is believed to have been introduced from Eurasia by wild birds migrating along flyways. It is primarily infecting egg-laying hens in Iowa and turkeys in Minnesota, with cases in several other states. Outbreak strains have been found in domestic flocks and wild birds across multiple states. APHIS reported in June 2015 that wild birds likely introduced the virus into U.S. poultry flocks, citing lapses in biosecurity practices. APHIS reported that lapses in biosecurity practices contributed to the spread of the AI virus in U.S. poultry flocks. Colder temperatures in spring 2015 favored transmission of the virus, but new cases slowed in summer. USDA is preparing for a potential resurgence of HPAI in the fall as migratory birds fly south. APHIS updated surveillance plans for migratory birds in June 2015 to monitor the spread of the virus. The collaboration of APHIS, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, state and local governments, and the private sector aims to detect and monitor HPAI in migratory birds. From December 2014 to June 17, 2015, there were 223 cases of HPAI in domestic flocks, resulting in the euthanization of 48 million birds, mostly chickens. Iowa and Minnesota were heavily affected, with millions of birds euthanized. Additionally, backyard flocks in 11 states were impacted, totaling around 10,000 birds. In 11 states, 20 cases of avian influenza affected backyard flocks, totaling about 10,000 birds. The virus is eliminated through depopulation of poultry, authorized by the Animal Health Protection Act. USDA follows a five-step process to address HPAI, including quarantine, eradication, monitoring, disinfection, and testing. APHIS, along with state and local animal health officials, euthanize, disinfect, and test poultry farms for AI virus. Poultry owners are compensated for euthanized birds, and APHIS covers cleaning, disinfecting, and testing costs. Once a presumptive positive for HPAI is confirmed, a flock plan is developed and signed by the producer, state official, and APHIS. USDA compensates producers under the AHPA for implementing the flock plan. USDA compensates producers for birds euthanized due to HPAI under the AHPA. Payment is based on fair market value determined by USDA appraisers. Producers are not compensated for birds that die before HPAI confirmation or for lost income from idle barns. If producers choose to assist in eliminating HPAI, they must sign a compliance agreement with APHIS. During an outbreak crisis, states develop HPAI response plans tailored to their specific needs. APHIS collaborates with states and poultry producers to determine the best course of action based on factors like flock size and depopulation method. Euthanized birds can be disposed of through composting, landfills, burial, or incineration. It takes about 30 days for composted bird carcasses to be cleared of the virus. Repopulation of barns or hen houses can only begin at least 21 days after thorough cleaning, disinfection, and environmental testing. The surrounding area must also be evaluated for reinfection risk before restocking. Producers must have written approval from APHIS and state officials to restock a facility after assessing the risk of reinfection. Restocking requires following surveillance, movement, and biosecurity requirements. If done without approval, APHIS will not provide indemnity if the flock becomes infected again. Restocking varies by operation type; egg-laying hen operations phase restocking to establish age variability for year-round egg production, taking 18 months or more. Turkey operations restock with birds of similar age for market readiness. An HPAI outbreak causes income disruption for producers, with existing indemnities only partially addressing the issue. While most HPAI strains are not easily transmissible to humans, influenza viruses can mutate and transfer genes, prompting public health officials to monitor H5 avian influenza strains for increased human infection risk. The CDC reports no human infections linked to the current HPAI outbreak, but human infections with other AI strains have occurred, mainly in individuals with close contact with infected birds. The CDC, NIOSH, and OSHA advise farm workers and responders to wear protective clothing, practice good hygiene, and participate in health monitoring after exposure to infected poultry. CDC has developed guidance for monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment of infections in humans. They have also issued guidance for the use of antiviral medications and requesting supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile if needed. Additionally, CDC has developed an HPAI virus strain for vaccine production. The CDC has developed an HPAI virus strain for vaccine production, and USDA has received approval to use additional funds of nearly $700 million for HPAI. APHIS has committed over $500 million to help control the spread of HPAI. The USDA has committed over $500 million to control the spread of HPAI, with $190 million for indemnity payments. The annual appropriation to APHIS for avian health is about $52 million. The avian health program includes AI prevention and control activities, disease surveillance, and the National Poultry Improvement Plan. The FY2016 agriculture appropriations bill includes $55 million for avian health, $3 million more than FY2015. The House bill includes $5 million additional funding for the APHIS portion of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up the FY2016 agriculture appropriations bill, providing APHIS with $52 million for avian health. The cost of the HPAI outbreak to the poultry industry is estimated at nearly $1.6 billion. The HPAI outbreak has caused significant economic losses in the poultry industry, with estimates reaching $1.6 billion. This includes $530 million for turkeys and $1.04 billion for egg-laying hens. The impact extends to other sectors like feed and trucking, leading to higher prices for consumers. Nearly 7.8 million turkeys were euthanized, amounting to 3% of the total production in 2014. USDA forecasts a 3% decrease in turkey meat production for 2015 due to HPAI, resulting in higher wholesale prices. USDA raised its forecast for national wholesale turkey prices for 2015 due to the HPAI outbreak slowing turkey production into 2016. Fewer poults are being placed on feed for growout through May, with affected operations coming back online in June after cleaning and testing. Thanksgiving supply disruptions are expected to be minimal as the industry has had time to prepare. Cold storage data shows a 3% increase in whole turkey supplies compared to last year. USDA reported a 5% decrease in egg-laying hens on U.S. farms in May 2015. USDA reports a 5% decrease in egg-laying hens on U.S. farms in May 2015, with Iowa being the hardest hit. Hens euthanized due to HPAI make up 11% of the total U.S. egg-laying flock. Egg production is forecasted to decline by 4% in 2015, leading to a 19% increase in egg prices. Wholesale egg prices peaked at nearly $2.50 per dozen in early June, but prices stabilized by the end of June. The shortage of breaking eggs from infected farms in Iowa caused an increase in table egg prices in retail and food service sectors. Food manufacturers bid up egg prices to divert supplies to the breaking market. H.E.B. limited egg purchases to prevent commercial buyers from depleting retail stocks. USDA certified five Dutch establishments to ship pasteurized egg products to the US. Broiler meat production is expected to increase by 5% in 2015. Trade implications of HPAI have impacted the broiler sector. The USDA's cold storage data at the end of May 2015 shows a 21% increase in broiler meat stocks compared to a year ago, leading to lower broiler meat prices. In 2014, the United States exported over 4 million metric tons of poultry meat, with broiler meat accounting for the majority. Forecasts for 2015 predict lower broiler meat, turkey, and egg exports compared to the previous year. In 2015, U.S. poultry exports have seen a decline, with broiler meat exports down by 9% and turkey exports down by 17%. However, egg exports have increased by 11% due to strong shipments to Mexico. Following the HPAI findings in December 2014, several trading partners have imposed bans on U.S. poultry imports. China, Russia, and South Korea, which were top destinations for U.S. poultry meat in 2014, have banned all imports. Regional bans are acceptable based on OIE guidelines. If USDA implements a vaccine strategy for HPAI, it could impact trade later this year. The U.S. poultry industry may face trade disruptions if a vaccine strategy for HPAI is implemented. Some trading partners have threatened to halt all trade until the U.S. strategy is evaluated. Senate committees have held hearings on the HPAI outbreak and its impact on the poultry sector, discussing lessons learned and future challenges. An HPAI outbreak is expected in the fall during wild bird migrations. The upcoming HPAI outbreak in the fall is expected to spread through the four flyways, potentially affecting poultry-producing regions untouched by the current outbreak. APHIS is preparing for a worst-case scenario of 500 HPAI cases in 20 states, focusing on vaccine use, biosecurity, timeliness, indemnification, and stakeholder communications. The OIE recommends depopulation of poultry flocks to eliminate the AI virus, but some countries may opt for vaccination. The OIE recognizes that some countries may choose vaccination as part of their HPAI containment strategy. Vaccination aims to protect birds from infection, reducing disease incidence. It can be used in emergencies or as a routine measure in endemic areas, following OIE recommendations closely. An exit strategy must be included, as vaccination is a last resort in HPAI control and can mask disease transmission. The OIE recommends countries plan to transition back to culling after using vaccination for HPAI control. USDA has not approved an HPAI vaccine yet, with current vaccines only 60% effective in chickens. The Southeast Poultry Research Lab is working on developing vaccines for fall use. The challenge for vaccine development is finding one effective against circulating H5 strains, as strains change over time. Countries using H5N1 vaccines have seen effectiveness diminish, resistance develop, and negative impacts on poultry product exports. USDA, not state officials, decides on vaccine strategy. APHIS expects an effective vaccine by late fall. Trading partners may ban U.S. poultry shipments if a vaccination policy is adopted, conducting risk assessments before allowing shipments to resume. APHIS is working with other countries to address concerns. APHIS is engaging with other countries to mitigate trade impacts if USDA changes its policy on vaccination for HPAI. SEPRL is researching to distinguish immunity in birds from infection or vaccination. The poultry industry is divided on using vaccines for HPAI outbreaks, with concerns about trade issues and potential decrease in egg output from handling hens during production. Some sectors are ready to adopt vaccines as a tool against HPAI. USDA's June 2015 report identified pathways for HPAI transmission. The report identified pathways for the transmission of HPAI, including lax biosecurity measures such as sharing equipment between infected and non-infected farms. Environmental factors like air samples containing the virus could also contribute to spread. Despite increased biosecurity measures in the poultry industry, perfect USDA audit scores may not fully protect against AI. Regulations like the Egg Safety Rule require certain biosecurity measures, but concerns remain about the effectiveness of these practices. The largest egg farm in Iowa received a perfect score on a USDA biosecurity audit before being infected with HPAI. Recommendations include enhancing biosecurity at the barn level, adding filtration systems, and reevaluating biosecurity programs for future outbreaks. APHIS will hold a meeting in Iowa to discuss biosecurity issues with state veterinary officials and poultry groups. APHIS is working on speeding up the depopulation process of AI infected birds by suggesting shutting off ventilation and increasing heat in barns. They are also exploring alternative methods with the poultry industry and the American Veterinary Medical Association. Disposal of dead birds post-depopulation remains a challenge for poultry producers. In Iowa, there are concerns about disposing of euthanized poultry due to fear of virus contamination. States and the poultry industry are expected to reassess disposal plans for a potential fall outbreak. Egg producers are worried that indemnity payments do not reflect the true value of lost egg production. Regulations for HPAI appraisals for payments are based on fair market value and future production, while regulations for LPAI outbreaks address future production in a different section. The LPAI regulations address future egg production for laying hens and concerns have been raised about indemnity payments for poultry producers, especially contract growers. Witnesses suggest that producers need additional options like insurance policies to cover losses from outbreaks. The 2014 farm bill directed USDA to study insuring poultry producers for catastrophic events, but the study has not been submitted yet. Some producers faced communication issues with APHIS personnel, leading to frustration and delays in containment efforts. APHIS plans to address communication issues in the future. APHIS plans to improve communication by assigning one employee to work with each producer during outbreaks and embedding an employee with contractor teams."
