    "content": "The Administration proposed to terminate the RRW program for FY2010, with no funds requested. Both House and Senate committees recommended striking Section 4204a of the Atomic Energy Act related to RRW. The House passed the defense bill with this provision. There is a consensus on maintaining nuclear warheads, but they deteriorate with age, requiring the Life Extension Program to replace components. The NNSA did not receive RRW funds in the recommendations. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) expresses concerns about the Life Extension Program's ability to maintain warheads long-term due to variations in components. A study suggests warhead components could last 85 to 100 years, potentially delaying the need for replacements. Congress funded the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program in 2005, but the Administration proposed to terminate it in FY2010. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program was funded by Congress in 2005 to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons. The program aims to increase confidence in warhead performance without nuclear testing and achieve various goals such as ease of manufacture, cost reduction, safety enhancement, and environmental impact reduction. Congress has outlined multiple objectives for the RRW program to enhance weapon capabilities over the long term. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program aims to achieve 20 goals by trading characteristics important during the Cold War for those of current importance. The Department of Defense (DOD) has approved this tradeoff as existing warheads are too tightly designed to be modified. RRW would design new warheads to replace existing ones, unlike Life Extension Programs (LEP) which make minimal changes. Supporters believe RRW will allow for replacing a large stockpile of nondeployed nuclear warheads with fewer, more reliable ones and restructuring the nuclear weapons complex. The Defense Science Board task force recommends proceeding with the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program over the Life Extension Programs (LEP) for long-term reliability and security. Critics question the feasibility and necessity of RRW, citing concerns about potential costs and risks. External reviews of the program have raised doubts about its effectiveness and impact. The House Appropriations Committee directed NNSA to have the JASONs conduct an independent peer review of the RRW designs. The review includes evaluating the RRW design against congressional requirements and DoD's military characteristics. The JASONs will also assess the feasibility of designing and deploying a new nuclear warhead without underground nuclear testing. The report was due by March 31, 2007. The NNSA and JASONs submitted reports to Congress and NNSA respectively regarding the RRW program. The American Association for the Advancement of Science also studied the program's potential risks and infrastructure development. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a report on RRW's relationship with SSP and LEP, due March 1, 2007. The report on Stockpile Life Extension Programs and RRW's feasibility and implementation was delivered to Congress on May 5, 2008. It emphasized the need for the United States to invest in the RRW program to ensure the viability of its nuclear deterrent. The report also highlighted the importance of using newly manufactured pits for the RRW program until adequate pit production capacity is achieved. The report emphasizes the need to invest in the RRW program for the nuclear deterrent's viability. Existing pits should be used for warhead replacement or life extension programs. Gravity bomb designs offer the most feasible options for improvements. Congressional reports link RRW to broader issues like strategy and nonproliferation. The report discusses LEP challenges, post-Cold War opportunities, RRW pros and cons, program developments, and congressional actions on budget requests. Options and issues for RRW are also presented. The curr_chunk discusses the maintenance of nuclear warheads due to parts deterioration and the need for nuclear testing. Materials like uranium, plutonium, high explosives, and plastics degrade over time, impacting the warhead's integrity. Chemical reactions and material decomposition pose challenges, requiring constant monitoring and maintenance to ensure weapon reliability. The curr_chunk highlights the impact of aging on nuclear warhead components, emphasizing the need for maintenance and monitoring to ensure reliability. Chemical reactions and material degradation can affect the integrity of the warhead, necessitating ongoing attention to prevent malfunctions. Additionally, the experience gained in dealing with corrosion and deterioration over the years has contributed to improving nuclear weapons engineering. The impact of aging on nuclear warhead components is a concern, but some believe it has been overstated. Designers did not intend for weapons to deteriorate after a certain period. The goal of Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship is to predict component life for scheduled remanufacture, ensuring reliability for decades. The enduring stockpile shows no clear evidence of warhead deterioration, but plans for remanufacture assume it is inevitable. Aging problems have been addressed in newer warheads, and as knowledge of warhead performance increases, labs can correct and forestall issues. Plutonium deterioration was a concern, but its impact on performance has been slower than feared. The primary stage of nuclear weapons has credible minimum lifetimes exceeding 100 years with clear mitigation paths for those with shorter lifetimes. During the Cold War, deterioration problems were limited due to the introduction of new warheads before the old ones reached the end of their service lives. Since the end of the Cold War, three trends have emerged regarding warhead deterioration: increased understanding through tools like SSP, systematic identification and elimination of design errors, and extended aging time for warheads. While understanding of deterioration has improved, it remains a concern due to design compromises made to meet safety parameters and other constraints. Design compromises were made to meet safety parameters and constraints in warhead design, leading to systems designed close to performance cliffs. This approach increased the difficulty and cost of certifying warhead remanufacture and maintaining warheads. The evolution away from tested designs results in increasing uncertainty in long-term certification. Maintaining warheads without nuclear testing is a challenge due to the complexity of replacing deteriorated components with newly made ones. The debate over remanufacturing weapon components has been ongoing for decades. In a 1978 letter to President Carter, three weapons scientists argued for the possibility of remanufacturing despite potential restrictions by EPA or OSHA. They suggested stockpiling certain materials used in weapons manufacture that may disappear from the commercial scene in the future. The 1987 report by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory highlighted the challenges of exact replication of older weapon systems due to material variations, unavailability, unexpected failure modes, and lack of precise documentation. The end of the Cold War led to budget cuts, personnel reductions, and a test moratorium, causing turmoil in the defense establishment. The focus shifted to ensuring the survival of the Complex. The DOE's nuclear weapons management shifted focus to survival of the Complex. Congress directed the establishment of a stewardship program to preserve US nuclear weapons competencies. Billions of dollars have been allocated for the Stockpile Stewardship Program, using various methods to understand nuclear weapons. The Complex conducts experiments and examines warheads to enhance understanding of nuclear weapon science. It improves computer codes for simulating weapons performance and analyzes data from past tests. The program monitors warheads for signs of deterioration through routine surveillance, examining 11 warheads of each type per year. One warhead is destructively evaluated annually. The Enhanced Surveillance Program supports surveillance to analyze and predict aging effects on weapon materials. Routine surveillance detects warhead problems, which are fixed through the Life Extension Program to extend stockpile lifetime. Warhead components are categorized into those part of the nuclear explosive package (NEP) and those that are not. The NEP is the explosive part of the warhead, distinct from other components. Non-NEP components can be modified under LEP for advanced electronics or safer materials, while NEP components must be replicated using original designs and materials due to the nuclear testing moratorium. Long-term concern focuses on NEP components, as warheads contain thousands of components that may need refurbishment in an LEP. The Life Extension Program (LEP) for warheads involves refurbishing thousands of components, some of which are difficult to fabricate. The process requires extensive analysis and detailed work, taking many years to complete. For example, the LEP for the W76 warhead aims to extend its life by 30 years, with activities including design, qualification, certification, and production. Additional work focuses on ensuring the refurbished warheads meet military requirements and improving manufacturability of components. The Stockpile Stewardship Program has advanced understanding of weapons science and aging, ensuring the safety and reliability of the current stockpile without the need for nuclear testing. This is supported by past nuclear tests, scientific experiments, engineering analysis, and improved warhead surveillance. The program's success is attributed to the professional judgment of laboratory directors and their staff. The United States faces debate over the need for nuclear tests to validate stockpile stewardship tools and computer models. Advocates of a different approach to warhead maintenance, such as the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), challenge the notion that changes must be minimized. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) has been successful in maintaining warhead reliability without nuclear testing. Advocates of Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) argue that the current Life Extension Program (LEP) is not suitable for maintaining warhead reliability in the long term. They propose shifting from warhead refurbishment to warhead replacement to ensure a sustainable nuclear enterprise. The three nuclear weapons laboratories emphasize the need for sustainable warheads to avoid the choice between nuclear tests or reduced confidence in reliability. Advocates of RRW argue for warhead replacement over refurbishment due to changes in threat, strategy, and missions. Current warheads lack longevity, cost-effectiveness, and precision guidance capabilities, making them unsuitable for current circumstances. They also have high yields, limited effectiveness against certain targets, and do not minimize collateral damage. Advocates of Life Extension Programs (LEP) argue that the stockpile should be maintained despite criticisms about its size, political implications, and physical security concerns. They believe that LEP can address the need for warhead replacement and continue to ensure precision guidance capabilities. Advocates of Life Extension Programs (LEP) argue that criticisms of LEP are vague and that confidence in existing nuclear weapons has actually increased over time due to advancements in scientific capabilities. Advancements in scientific capabilities have increased confidence in existing nuclear weapons over time. Critics argue that new weapons like the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator may not offer significant new capabilities and that fulfilling current mission requirements of the existing stockpile should be a priority. The RRW program aims to address potential \"birth defects\" in new warheads, questioning the need for a larger stockpile. Current warheads have adequate performance margins that can be improved with new delivery systems. Doubts exist about reducing physical security costs with RRWs, as the current high level of security is deemed sufficient. The nuclear stockpile was designed to meet Cold War requirements, emphasizing high explosive yield per unit of warhead weight. The RRW program aims to transform the stockpile to reflect changes post-Cold War and meet future requirements. NNSA and DOD are revisiting tradeoffs to adapt to new constraints and ensure safety and reliability of warheads. RRW advocates claim it can secure major gains with negligible sacrifices. Cold War warhead requirements emphasized high yield-to-weight ratio for ballistic missiles. The high yield-to-weight ratio of Cold War warheads allowed missiles to carry more warheads to distant targets or make each warhead more effective. The W88 warhead for the Trident II (D5) missile used a conventional high explosive for greater energy per unit weight, enabling submarines to stand off farther from targets and improve survivability. Sacrifices in safety and materials were accepted to maximize yield-to-weight. The RRW project aims to replace some W76 warheads with the higher weight of W88, resulting in less yield per unit weight. The added weight is allocated to design features for improved use control and production ease. The current W76-1 LEP is seen as satisfactory in terms of technology, schedule, and cost by Barry Hannah, chairman of the RRW POG. The W76-1 Life Extension Program (LEP) made changes and upgrades to components without risking the warhead's basic design. Efforts were made to replicate the original manufacturing process for materials and components, including \"Fogbank.\" Changes were also implemented to increase margins and address potential problems or uncertainties. One such change was an improved system for supplying boost gas to the weapon, ensuring the W76-1's extended life. The W76-1 LEP made upgrades to components without changing the warhead's design. The system to supply boost gas was improved for an extended life. Lessons from W76-0 aging process were applied to W76-1. Opted for W76-1 LEP over WR-1 RRW due to production concerns and safety options. The Navy's need for safety and surety options was not as compelling as other services due to heavy guard on SLBM warheads. Between 1945 and 1992, the US conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests for weapons design, adding confidence in weapon functionality. WR1 aims to provide high design confidence without nuclear testing. Advocates of RRW express concerns about current warheads having \"thin\" margins, potentially eroding further with minor changes from LEPs, reducing confidence in warheads that may require testing to restore. In contrast, advocates of LEP have growing confidence in current warheads despite the absence of testing, citing the JASON study on pit aging as delaying the need for new pit manufacturing and potential testing risks. RRW missile warheads like WR1 would necessitate new pit manufacturing, posing risks of design or manufacturing defects. The manufacture of new pits and any new product runs the risk of design or manufacturing defects, which could lead to testing. Some believe that neither RRW nor LEP provides confidence in the stockpile. RRW uses untested designs, while LEPs move warheads away from tested designs. To restore confidence, some suggest resuming a nuclear test program with lower rates and yields than during the Cold War. Performance, safety, reliability, and meeting military standards have always been crucial for nuclear weapons. During the Cold War, meeting delivery system schedules was also critical. Cost reduction is now a higher priority in nuclear warhead design, with WR1 offering features to lower manufacturing, security, and dismantlement costs. Concerns are raised about the increasing cost of maintaining existing warheads, including the need to build expensive plants for materials no longer commercially available. Delaying pit manufacture for decades is suggested by LEP supporters. The RRW program, linked to a costly upgrade of the nuclear weapons complex, may involve manufacturing thousands of new warheads and dismantling old ones, adding significant costs. A study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science suggests that the RRW program could increase costs in the short term without guaranteeing long-term savings. During the Cold War, hazardous materials were used in nuclear weapons production, leading to environmental contamination and health risks. ES&H concerns have grown within the Complex, leading to a strong interest in minimizing the use of hazardous materials in warheads and their production. RRW advocates aim to reduce hazardous materials in warheads, simplifying manufacturing processes and increasing safety. Substitution of safer materials is a design goal, with arguments for improved worker safety and environmental impact. Existing manufacturing processes are well understood and incorporate proper safety precautions. Some have raised concerns that Complex personnel are not adequately challenged due to the lack of new-design warheads being produced and slower refurbishment pace. Skill development and transfer must now be an explicit goal of the nuclear weapons program. RRW advocates argue that the new design requires designers to balance various tradeoffs simultaneously, while LEP constrains choices for the nuclear explosive package. The nuclear weapons complex has a history of expansion and contraction in response to changing demands. Supporters of Life Extension Programs (LEP) argue that it employs similar tools as new designs. RRW advocates see it as a way to address the transformation of the Complex. Representative David Hobson supports RRW for this purpose. Representative David Hobson, Chairman of the House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, sponsored the FY2005 energy and water bill (H.R. 4614) emphasizing the need to redirect the DOE weapons complex to support a new nuclear strategy. He viewed the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) as crucial in reshaping the nuclear weapons stockpile and Complex. Thomas D'Agostino, NNSA Deputy Administrator, also supported RRW as a key to transforming the Complex into a responsive infrastructure. Thomas D'Agostino, then NNSA Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, emphasized the importance of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) in transforming the nuclear weapons stockpile and infrastructure. The RRW aims to enhance the resilience of the nuclear enterprise to emerging threats, improve manufacturing processes, and reduce the reliance on environmentally hazardous materials. It is seen as a key enabler for achieving a more efficient and responsive infrastructure, as well as opportunities for a smaller stockpile. The NNSA proposed a \"Complex 2030\" plan to restructure the Complex by consolidating fissile material, eliminating redundancies in R&D facilities, and completing Complex reconfiguration by 2030. Advocates claim that the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) would allow for a simpler, smaller, and less costly Complex. The Complex would need to support current warheads and RRWs simultaneously, leading to a stockpile-in-transition. The NNSA proposed the \"Complex 2030\" plan to restructure the Complex by consolidating facilities and production. Another plan by the SEAB task force suggested more consolidation, including a Consolidated Nuclear Production Center (CNPC) for all nuclear weapon components. Representative Hobson expressed concern about DOE's decision to focus on Complex 2030 over analyzing the SEAB plan. If the Department does not conduct a fair analysis of reform alternatives and instead pushes for a biased process to achieve its preferred outcome, funding for Complex 2030 efforts, including the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, will not be supported. The RRW program requires modernization, consolidation, and downsizing of the weapons complex. Concerns have been raised by Representative Visclosky about the link between RRW and Complex transformation, questioning the nuclear weapons complex's dedication to downsizing. The DOE must develop a modernization plan for downsizing the nuclear weapons complex. NNSA's Complex Transformation plan aims to consolidate materials, close buildings, reduce the complex's size, and dismantle warheads faster. The link between Complex Transformation and the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program is unclear, with no funding provided for RRW in FY2008. The plan is independent of whether the stockpile consists of legacy designs or RRW concept designs. The Nuclear Weapons Council approved forming a DOD-DOE Project Officers Group (POG) for the RRW program in March 2005. The POG includes representatives from NNSA, nuclear weapon labs, Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. Strategic Command, Navy, Air Force, and Lockheed Martin. Observers from other agencies and nuclear weapon plants also participate. The POG was tasked with conducting an 18-month design competition starting in May 2005. The Nuclear Weapons Council approved an 18-month design competition for the RRW program in March 2005. Two teams were tasked to provide warhead designs consistent with program objectives. By February 2006, both teams were confident in their designs meeting military requirements without nuclear testing. Preliminary designs were completed in March 2006, emphasizing safety and manufacturing ease. The Nuclear Weapons Council approved an 18-month design competition for the RRW program in March 2005. Two teams provided designs, and the council selected the California team's design in March 2007. The selection was based on higher confidence in certifying the design without underground testing. The RRW program selected a design closely tied to previous underground testing for a submarine-launched ballistic missile replacement warhead. The focus was on providing military capability similar to the W76 warhead, with the Navy as the POG chair and the Air Force as co-chair. The design could also be used on land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles as a backup option. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program aims to provide a more reliable warhead design for both submarine-launched ballistic missiles and land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. The program seeks to reduce the number of warhead types and obsolete production technologies, with a target date for the first production unit (FPU) of RRW set for 2012. NNSA requested $88.8 million for FY2008 for a design definition and cost study. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program aimed for a 2012 target date for the first production unit (FPU), but a Nuclear Weapons Council memorandum in March 2007 suggested a target of 2014 plus or minus two years. Congress would annually decide on funding for the program, which involved plants and labs collaborating on design information and manufacturing processes. The contribution of the plants would evolve as designs matured. The NNSA instructed laboratories to cease technical work on RRW and document progress after funds were eliminated by the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Navy-led RRW POG was conducting a design and cost study with Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia National Laboratories refining the design and estimating costs. The congressionally mandated Advanced Certification Campaign is drawing on previous work to increase confidence in warhead certification. The FY2009 and FY2010 requests for RRW funding were discussed, with a focus on developing reliable replacement components for the existing stockpile without underground tests. The House Appropriations Committee reported the FY2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, H.R. 2419, with a \"qualified endorsement\" of RRW contingent on meeting current military requirements. The committee did not support RRW if it led to new weapons for new missions, viewing it as part of a Sustainable Stockpile Initiative. The committee focused on RRW in its discussion of Weapons Activities, linking it to various programs and using its potential to reduce or delay other requested programs. The RRW weapon is designed for ease of manufacturing, maintenance, dismantlement, and certification without nuclear testing, aiming to transition the weapons complex into a more efficient modern complex. This will phase out multiple redundant Cold War warhead designs, leading to long-term savings. The committee recommended establishing a Federal Advisory Committee on the Reliable Replacement Warhead initiative to maintain reliable nuclear deterrence with a smaller stockpile after 2025. They suggested reducing the budget for Directed Stockpile Work by $137.3 million and increasing RRW funding to accelerate planning efforts. The committee recommended increasing RRW funding from $9.4 million to $25.0 million to accelerate the planning effort for a competition between NNSA weapons laboratories. They also recommended eliminating $4.0 million for studying the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, citing threats to Congressional and public support for sustainable stockpile initiatives. Additionally, the committee opposed reducing the test readiness posture from 24 to 18 months, adding RRW as a reason against the shorter timeframe. The committee recommended reducing Test Readiness funds from $25.0 million to $15.0 million and redirecting ASCI funding to maintain current life extension production capabilities. They also recommended eliminating funding for the Modern Pit and expressed concerns about the confidence in the Science-based Stockpile Stewardship program. The committee recommended eliminating funding for the Modern Pit Facility and the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement. They suggested focusing on lengthening the life of the stockpile and delaying construction until a long-term plan is determined. The House Armed Services Committee supported the Reliable Replacement Warhead program in the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Bill. The committee recommended providing the requested amount for RRW and outlined key goals for the program. The bill passed the House with no amendments related to RRW. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile, reduce the need for nuclear testing, maintain design parameters, develop a responsive nuclear weapons infrastructure, and decrease the size of the stockpile through improved warhead reliability. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile. It seeks to reduce the need for nuclear testing, maintain design parameters, develop a responsive nuclear weapons infrastructure, and decrease the size of the stockpile through improved warhead reliability. The program also aims to use expertise in the nuclear complex to develop reliable replacement components and potentially serve as a cost-effective and reliable long-term replacement for current Stockpile Life Extension Programs. The Nuclear Weapons Council is required to submit interim and final reports on RRW, assessing characteristics of warheads, impact on LEPs, potential reduction in warhead numbers, and design criteria to minimize the need for nuclear testing. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile. The committee's Democratic members are willing to explore the concept of the RRW program but do not yet embrace it. They believe that RRW must reduce the need for nuclear testing, lead to arsenal reductions, avoid new mission requirements, increase nuclear security, and support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended providing the amount requested for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, aiming to increase warhead security and reliability while reducing the need for nuclear testing. NNSA Administrator Brooks presented goals for RRW, including developing replacement components for nuclear warheads on a schedule that would enhance safety and reliability. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program to enhance warhead security and reliability while reducing the need for nuclear testing. The committee supported the goals of reducing costs, increasing infrastructure responsiveness, and boosting confidence in the stockpile. The NNSA Administrator was required to submit a report on RRW funding activities. The defense authorization conference bill included provisions to ensure the nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe, secure, and reliable. The conferees support the Reliable Replacement Warhead program to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile. The program was endorsed by the Senate Appropriations Committee and recommended increased funding. The Committee acknowledges that RRW is in early development and encourages NNSA to incorporate its benefits into the stockpile as soon as possible. $25,351,000 was recommended for RRW to accelerate planning. The Committee recommends $25,351,000 for RRW to accelerate planning and design for a comprehensive strategy to improve existing weapons. The bill passed the Senate with no changes to the RRW provision and was signed into law providing $25.0 million for RRW. Conferees emphasized goals and requirements of the RRW program, including a decision on the design to use for the first reliable replacement warhead. The RRW program aims to improve existing weapons within military requirements and past nuclear test parameters. Congress supported RRW in the FY2006 budget cycle with funding recommendations from various committees to enhance manufacturing practices, reduce costs, and increase performance margins to reduce the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The RRW program received increased funding in FY2007, with a budget request of $27.7 million, up from $24.8 million in FY2006. Outyear budgets for FY2008 to FY2011 were also outlined. The FY2007 budget document contained numerous references to RRW, indicating its growing momentum and connection to various sites and programs. The RRW program is linked to various sites and programs within the Complex, drawing on resources beyond its own budget. The program is supported by different programs aiming to make progress in providing experimental data and certification methodologies from FY2007-2011. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program is supported by various programs within the Complex to provide experimental data and certification methodologies necessary for the evolving stockpile, including efforts to improve safety and surety of high explosives. Enhanced Surveillance and Enhanced Surety programs will also support RRW components assessment. Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign simulations are crucial for these efforts. The ASC simulations play a key role in helping the NNSA determine the effects of changes to current systems and uncertainties in future systems like the RRW. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign involves hiring personnel and procuring equipment to support pit manufacture. The RRW Feasibility Study aims to identify designs that will maintain confidence in the stockpile's safety and reliability. Los Alamos and Livermore are planning experiments to support certification of RRW pits. The Joint DOE/DOD RRW Project Officer's Group (POG) oversees a design competition for a RRW warhead with the goal of FY 2012. They assess technical feasibility, design definition, manufacturing, and cost assessment to meet study objectives. The POG will establish preferred RRW design options and recommendations to the NWC Standing and Safety Committee. In FY 2007, activities include detailed design and cost estimates of RRW concepts for surety enhancements and certification without nuclear testing. The RRW budget will increase when the RRW option is selected and starts development and production engineering activities. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 increased the amount requested by $20.0 million to support a second RRW design competition. NNSA was required to submit a plan for transforming the Complex to achieve a responsive infrastructure by 2030, with a focus on producing replacement warheads under the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) was tasked with preparing a study on Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties for the nuclear stockpile. The study aimed to assess whether this method could be applied to the Reliable Replacement Warhead program to reduce the likelihood of underground nuclear weapons testing. NAS planned to deliver a classified version to DOE and Congress in July 2008, with an unclassified version to follow. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) held the ninth meeting for the project at Los Alamos National Laboratory on August 13-15. NAS plans a phase 2 study on using archived underground nuclear test data for QMU. The House Appropriations Committee supports the RRW as part of comprehensive weapons complex reforms, criticizing NNSA's Complex 2030 plan. It recommended $52.7 million for RRW, directing NNSA to engage the JASON Defense Advisory Group to evaluate RRW designs and analyze its feasibility. The JASON study on the operationally-deployed nuclear weapon is scheduled to submit a preliminary report by March 1, 2007, an executive summary by August 1, 2007, and the final report by October 1, 2007. The House passed the bill for RRW provisions with no amendments, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $62.7 million for RRW and urged NNSA to accelerate the transition to a responsive infrastructure. The Committee is pushing for a responsive infrastructure and expeditious RRW design. They aim to reduce legacy systems and start replacing them with RRW designs. A second design competition for RRW is underway, with a focus on having at least two certified warheads. Funding of $10.0 million is allocated for this competition, with a production goal of 2014. Additionally, $4.0 million is added to speed up the deployment of surveillance devices in the RRW design. The Senate did not take further action on the bill placed on the legislative calendar in June 29. Instead, funds for Energy and Water Development were included in a continuing resolution. The DOE's FY2007 operating plan allocated $35.8 million for RRW. The NNSA presented details of the DOD-NNSA plan for RRW in the FY2008 budget request. The NWC decided in November 2006 that RRW for submarine launched ballistic missiles is feasible and should proceed to Phase 2A design definition and cost study. RRW is to be adopted as the strategy for maintaining a long term safe, secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent. The document directed the initiation of a conceptual study for an additional RRW design to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear deterrent. The shift in strategy from a Life Extension Program to a RRW program will require substantial planning and resource realignments between the Departments of Defense and Energy. An RRW budget adjustment will be requested at the end of FY 2007. The budget approach for FY2008 includes maintaining a relatively level DSW budget with RRW development funded through reductions in resources required to support legacy weapons. Projected RRW budget figures are as follows: FY2008, $88.769; FY2009, $99.787; FY2010. The Navy's budget for the RRW program includes figures for FY2008 to FY2012, totaling $725.1 million. This funding is for the development of various components such as arming systems and integration with the Trident II missile. Contracts are planned to be awarded in October 2007 and 2008 for specific amounts of the requested funds. The House Armed Services Committee marked up its portion of the FY2008 defense authorization bill, H.R. 1585, with provisions related to RRW. The bill passed the House with provisions for a congressional commission on U.S. strategic posture, including recommendations for nuclear weapons strategy and force structure. The House Armed Services Committee marked up its portion of the FY2008 defense authorization bill, H.R. 1585, with provisions related to RRW. The bill passed the House with provisions for a congressional commission on U.S. strategic posture, including recommendations for nuclear weapons strategy and force structure. The committee emphasized the need for a debate on the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategic posture and called for clear policy objectives before committing to new programs. Additionally, there was a reduction in the Navy's request for RRW funds from $30.0 million to $5.0 million. The House Armed Services Committee supports better design definition of RRW in Phase 2a study during fiscal year 2008. There was a reduction in NNSA's RRW funds from $88.8 million to $68.8 million. The committee believes it is too soon to judge if RRW program can achieve objectives set by P.L. 109-163. Focus should be on analysis to describe how RRW program will achieve these objectives in fiscal year 2008. The committee supports better design definition of RRW in Phase 2a study for FY2008, with limited funds allocated for this purpose. They question the need for a Consolidated Plutonium Center and suggest reusing existing pits for RRWs instead. In March 2007, Thomas D'Agostino stated that existing pits might be suitable for RRW bombs but not RRW ballistic missile warheads. A study was required to assess pit reuse for RRW and the feasibility of remanufacturing warheads with existing pits. The study aimed to determine if using existing pits would reduce the need for new pit production. The committee reduced the B61 LEP account by $4.2 million and directed NNSA to not start a new B61 LEP while examining pit reuse feasibility for warhead remanufacture. The Energy and Water Development Subcommittee eliminated NNSA funds for RRW in the FY2008 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill markup. The markup emphasized the need for a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy and stockpile plan before any new facilities or Reliable Replacement Warhead are considered. It is crucial to establish a future nuclear weapons strategy to determine the requirements for the stockpile and nuclear weapons complex plan. The administration should outline a comprehensive course of action before funding is allocated for new nuclear weapons production. The House Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating all NNSA funds for RRW due to concerns about the program's scope and impact on nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The committee expressed displeasure at the RRW design competition and questioned the need for new nuclear warheads at this time. The House Appropriations Committee recommended halting NNSA funds for the RRW program, citing concerns about its impact on nuclear nonproliferation efforts. They questioned the need for new nuclear warheads and called for a comprehensive strategy before further development proceeds. The House Appropriations Committee recommended halting NNSA funds for the RRW program, questioning the need for new nuclear warheads and calling for a comprehensive strategy. The House passed the bill, leaving RRW provisions unchanged. The Senate Armed Services Committee's National Defense Authorization Bill would reduce the Navy's RRW request and recommended no funds for RRW activities beyond phase 2A in fiscal year 2008. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing funding for the RRW program by $43.0 million and limiting FY2008 work to Phase 2A and below. They emphasized the need for extensive research before progressing further and raised policy concerns about developing a new warhead. The committee stressed the importance of advancing technical work alongside policy discussions before making any decisions on RRW development, manufacturing, or deployment. The committee discussed policy concerns regarding the development of a new nuclear warhead and emphasized the need for additional steps and policies to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons. This included accelerating reductions in the stockpile, formalizing a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing, strengthening the nonproliferation regime, and renewing commitments to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Section 1061 of S. 1547 required a revised nuclear posture review to address various aspects of nuclear forces, deterrence policy, targeting, arms control, nuclear delivery systems, the nuclear weapons complex, and the stockpile, including plans for replacing or modifying warheads. Section 3122 of S. 1547 expressed the \"Sense of Congress on the Nuclear\" issue. Section 3122 of S. 1547 focuses on the United States' nuclear nonproliferation policy and the Reliable Replacement Warhead. It emphasizes commitments to reducing nuclear weapons, working with other states to decrease reliance on nuclear weapons, and ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported on the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, expressing divided views on the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. They recommended $66.0 million for NNSA for RRW to complete Phase 2A, but wanted more analysis and debate before proceeding with Phase 3. The committee called for a bipartisan commission to evaluate the role of nuclear weapons in future strategic posture. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, but called for more analysis and debate before proceeding with Phase 3. They also proposed a bipartisan commission to evaluate the role of nuclear weapons in future strategic posture. The Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and State urged Congress to fully fund RRW for FY2008, emphasizing the essential role of nuclear weapons in maintaining deterrence. The Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and State emphasized the importance of the Reliable Replacement Warhead program for maintaining deterrence and avoiding the need for underground nuclear testing. Representatives Skelton and Tauscher expressed support for the program but questioned the assertion that delays in RRW would necessitate maintaining a large stockpile of nuclear weapons. The Authorization Act for FY 2008 raises concerns about the feasibility of the Reliable Replacement Warhead program and the potential need for underground nuclear testing if delays continue. Representatives Hobson and Visclosky criticize the program's reliance on RRW as the only solution for nuclear weapon concerns. The Administration's assertion linking funding for RRW to nuclear testing is deemed irresponsible. The Administration claims that the existing legacy stockpile is at risk, potentially requiring a resumption of testing for warhead performance. The House Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating the Navy's $30.0 million request for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW). Senator Feinstein introduced a bill requiring the President to report on nuclear policy and posture reviews by specific dates. The bill requires a report on nuclear posture review by March 1, 2010, and delays funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program until reports are submitted to Congress. Congress may delay Phase 3 decision to FY2010 or beyond for various reasons, including waiting for reports on U.S. strategic posture and nuclear posture review. Interest also lies in the approach a new presidential administration may take on RRW in 2009. The Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia National Laboratories suggest continuing Phase 2A of the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program through FY2008 and FY2009 to allow for in-depth study of safety, cost, and manufacturing issues. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing Navy RRW funding by $15.0 million in the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. The JASON Defense Advisory Group delivered a classified report on RRW to Congress on September 28. The JASON report on the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program highlighted the need for further development in certification and physical understanding of surety mechanisms. Recommendations were made to ensure new manufacturing processes do not impact performance, including establishing a peer review with periodic examination by an independent organization. The JASON report praised NNSA's approach to developing a Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and stated that with enhancements, the RRW could be certified for the stockpile without underground nuclear testing. NNSA Administrator Thomas D'Agostino expressed satisfaction with the panel's assessment and emphasized the need for continued funding for the RRW R&D effort. Representatives Visclosky and Hobson also supported the findings of the JASON report. Hobson supported the JASON report's findings on the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and emphasized the need for completing recommended work before considering the RRW's role as a nuclear deterrent. DOD appealed for $15 million in funding for the Navy's RRW effort to begin Phase 2A activities in FY2008. DOD requested $15 million for the Navy's Phase 2A activities related to the RRW effort. The funds are for risk reduction analysis and preliminary development of an AF&F subsystem for weapons associated with the Mk5 aeroshell on the TRIDENT II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile System. The W88 warhead is currently housed in the Mk5 aeroshell, and a future W88 LEP will require AF&F replacement. The new AF&F subsystem will be the same regardless of the nuclear explosive package used. The Navy plans to use RRW funds for Mk5A life extension efforts, with the new AF&F subsystem to be used with the life-extended W88 and WR1. FY 08 RRW funding is on hold, but once released, it will support risk reduction analysis and development of the AF&F subsystem for weapons on the TRIDENT II D5 system. The Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) is supporting efforts for the life extension program of the MK5/W88 nuclear weapon system by pursuing various technology areas such as safety architectures, memory, ASICs, thermal battery development, analog electronics, radar receivers, and fuze modeling. The defense appropriations bill included $14.455 million for the Navy for RRW on November 6. The House and Senate approved the conference report for the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act, providing $66.0 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger supported the research and design of RRW, along with other prominent figures. The design work for RRW was considered a small cost and not a commitment to proceed with construction. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act allocated $66.0 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program. Provisions included restrictions on advancing RRW beyond Phase 2A in FY2008, establishment of a bipartisan commission to examine U.S. nuclear policy, and a requirement for a new Nuclear Posture Review by December 2009. Additionally, a study on the use of existing pits in the RRW program was mandated. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act allocated $66.0 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, with provisions for a bipartisan commission on nuclear policy and a new Nuclear Posture Review. The House and Senate agreed on the conference report for H.R. 1585, which was later vetoed by President Bush due to Iraqi economic issues. The revised bill, H.R. 4986, was signed into law on January 28, 2008. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) eliminated NNSA RRW funds, providing no funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead as proposed by the House. Congress believes a new strategic nuclear deterrent mission assessment is needed for the 21st century. The NNSA is directed to develop a long-term scientific capability roadmap for the national laboratories. For FY2009, DOE requests $10.0 million annually for FY2010-FY2013 to mature the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program. Representative Peter Visclosky emphasizes the need for a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy and a revised stockpile plan. Eliminating NNSA RRW funding may lead to a more costly full-life extension program for nuclear weapons without modern safety and security measures. The Department of Energy requests $10 million annually for FY2010-FY2013 to mature the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. This funding is necessary for design refinement to address certification questions and document completed work. The Department of Defense and Joint DoD-DOE Nuclear Weapons Council support efforts to enhance safety, security, and reliability of the nation's nuclear deterrent. In February 2008, NNSA Administrator Thomas D'Agostino testified that the RRW study is crucial for reviewing the nuclear posture and addressing concerns about stockpile maintenance, warhead surety, and nuclear skills. General Kevin Chilton emphasized the need for a modern warhead focusing on reliability, safety, security, and maintainability. Some opposed the RRW study, while others highlighted the importance of improving warhead surety. Some experts oppose the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, questioning the need to spend billions on new warheads for minimal security gains. Former Senator Sam Nunn believes building new warheads would hinder nonproliferation efforts. The Navy's FY2009 budget request for RRW has been reduced to $23.3 million. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended retaining NNSA's funding for RRW in the FY2009 defense authorization bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended retaining NNSA's request for RRW but eliminating the Navy's request in a press release of May 1, 2008. The House Armed Services Committee recommended redirecting funds from NNSA and Navy for RRW to higher priority nuclear weapons research. The committee found the Navy's request premature and not executable in fiscal year 2009. The House Armed Services Committee redirected funds from NNSA and Navy for RRW to higher priority nuclear weapons research, eliminating funds for RRW and authorizing $13.3 million for integrated AF&F systems research. The committee supported research on certification and stewardship critical to SSP, recommending adding $10.0 million within Advanced Certification to address JASON review issues and other SSP challenges. On May 22, Representative Stevan Pearce offered an amendment to increase funding for RRW by $10.0 million in Title XXXI, Department of Energy National Security Programs. The amendment failed, and the House passed the bill 384-23. The House and Senate had an informal conference on the defense authorization bill, resulting in a bill with no RRW funds for the Navy or NNSA. The FY2009 energy-water appropriations bill, signed into law as P.L. 110-417 on October 14, 2008, had no RRW funds for the Navy or NNSA. The House Appropriations Committee eliminated the $10.0 million NNSA request for RRW, expressing skepticism about the benefits of a new warhead design. The Committee will not fund a new generation of warheads without a clear plan for nuclear reductions and a specific glide path to a smaller force of nuclear weapons. They also question spending on warheads that claim to avoid the need for nuclear testing while the Administration does not support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The Committee insists on replacing Cold War strategies with a modern nuclear deterrent strategy before considering funding for new programs or changes to the nuclear weapons complex. The committee approved the bill for the FY2009 energy-water appropriation without NNSA funds for RRW, as plans for nuclear reductions and a modern nuclear deterrent strategy were not submitted as required. Funding for NNSA and other agencies was made available through a continuing resolution. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, did not provide NNSA funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) project. The bill was signed into law on September 30, 2008, and subsequent appropriations acts also did not allocate funds for RRW. The Administration requested $23.3 million in RRW funds for the Navy. The Administration requested $23.3 million in RRW funds for the Navy in the Department of Defense appropriations bill, but the bill eliminated Navy RRW funds for FY2010. The program was included in a list of programs to be terminated due to not being consistent with Presidential commitments to move towards a nuclear-free world. The FY2010 defense authorization bill passed both the House and Senate, with no funds allocated for the RRW program. The energy and water development appropriations bills also did not contain any funds for RRW, leading to the termination of the program. The RRW program was terminated due to lack of funding in the FY2010 defense authorization bill and energy and water development appropriations bills. Previous issues related to RRW in the report have become moot and were deleted. The RRW program was terminated in FY2010 due to lack of funding. Various sources discuss the need for a reliable replacement warhead and potential funding for nuclear deterrence. Democrats are open to a new arsenal as long as it is linked with the Test Ban Treaty ratification. Various sources discuss the need for a reliable replacement warhead and potential funding for nuclear deterrence. Various sources discuss the need for a reliable replacement warhead and potential funding for nuclear deterrence. The program includes strategic command urging quick nuclear weapons modernization, Congress's critical role in the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) Program, and reports on the feasibility and implementation of the program. The Congressional Defense Committees were provided reports on the National Security and Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century, the Design Selected for Reliable Replacement Warhead, and the Feasibility of Using Existing Pits for the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program. These reports were prepared by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy in consultation with the Nuclear Weapons Council. The report to Congressional Defense Committees discusses nuclear weapons design, operation, and production, including key terms and facilities. It mentions that most nuclear weapons have a two-stage design, with the first stage being similar to the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The primary stage of a nuclear weapon contains a pit with fissile material, surrounded by explosive to trigger implosion. Neutrons are injected to initiate a chain reaction, but the explosion drives the plutonium outward, stopping the reaction. The primary stage of a nuclear weapon contains a pit with fissile material surrounded by explosive to trigger implosion. Boost gas, a mixture of deuterium and tritium gases, is injected to increase the fraction of plutonium fissioned. The fusion reaction generates energy and boosts the fission chain reaction. A metal radiation case channels energy to the secondary, containing fission and fusion fuel, which releases most of the energy of a nuclear explosion. Thousands of nonnuclear components are needed to make the nuclear explosive package into a usable weapon. The nuclear weapons complex consists of government-owned contractor-operated sites that design, test, and manufacture nuclear explosive packages. This includes sites like Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Y-12 Plant, Kansas City Plant, Savannah River Site, Pantex Plant, and the Nevada Test Site. These sites are responsible for creating the components needed to turn a nuclear explosive package into a militarily usable weapon. The Nevada Test Site, now used for non-nuclear weapons experiments, is managed by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to maintain and refurbish existing nuclear weapons. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) ensures the preservation of U.S. nuclear weapons expertise through advanced capabilities and experimental facilities. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) involves work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring, maintenance, refurbishment, and R&D. It also includes campaigns for scientific and engineering support, and funds infrastructure and operations at nuclear weapons complex sites. The program aims to maintain expertise without nuclear testing, but does not rule out the possibility if needed. The United States has maintained its nuclear stockpile without testing since 1992, with the Stockpile Stewardship Program focusing on monitoring, maintenance, refurbishment, and R&D of nuclear weapons. Testing may be considered only in cases where a problem cannot be resolved in any other way."
