    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Timber Management Improvement Act of 1993\" and includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that timber management policies impact allowable sale quantities for national forests, with factors like protecting the northern spotted owl leading to reductions in available federal land for timber harvesting. Increasing timber management investments on non-protected lands could offset declines in allowable sale quantities due to spotted owl protection. The Act aims to identify timber management investment opportunities on Federal timberlands in California, Oregon, and Washington. The K-V fund, established in 1930, has been increasingly used for wildlife habitat and watershed improvement projects since 1976. The Act aims to expand financial assistance programs for timber investments on non-Federal timberlands in California, Oregon, and Washington. It also ensures that funds from the 1930 Act are available for timber management investments on Federal timberlands. The Act aims to expand financial assistance programs for timber investments on non-Federal timberlands in California, Oregon, and Washington, and ensures funds from the 1930 Act are available for timber management investments on Federal timberlands. SEC. 3 focuses on a timber management investment study. The Act aims to expand financial assistance programs for timber investments on non-Federal timberlands in California, Oregon, and Washington. The report prepared by the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior will display yields and costs of timber management investment opportunities, including reforestation and timber stand improvement. It will present yield and cost information for different timber site productivity classes. The report required by the Act will include information on timber site productivity classes, forest conditions, and land suitability for timber production. It will also detail why certain lands in Forest Service Regions 5 and 6 are classified as unsuitable for timber production. The report will address opportunities for land exchanges to consolidate Federal landholdings in California, Oregon, and Washington for reforestation and timber stand improvement. Advisory boards will ensure unbiased reports on timber management investment opportunities. The Bureau of Land Management will establish advisory boards to consult on the draft report required by the Act, ensuring diverse representation. Private and public timberland owners will be consulted in preparing the report. The report required by the Act must consult with private and public timberland owners to identify timber management investments, costs, and yields. The information gathered should protect corporate cost information and be submitted to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. PRIVATE FOREST LANDS.\n\nAmendment to the Cooperative Forest Assistance Act of 1978 allocates $1,500,000 for planning, reforestation, and timber stand improvement in California, Oregon, and Washington to manage timber resources affected by the northern spotted owl's threatened status. Assistance focuses on counties with designated habitat conservation areas for the owl's protection and recovery.\n\nSEC. 5. KNUTSON-VANDENBERG ACT. SEC. 5. KNUTSON-VANDENBERG ACT amends the Act of June 9, 1930 to include reforestation of BLM lands administered by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management in the same manner as national forest lands. It also amends reforestation under the K-V Act by specifying timber management provisions."
