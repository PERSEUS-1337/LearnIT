    "content": "Georgia has a history of being incorporated into empires, including the Russian Empire in the 19th century. It gained independence briefly in 1918 before being part of the Soviet Union until 1991. Located in the South Caucasus region, Georgia borders Russia, Iran, and Turkey. It has unresolved conflicts with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, while its neighbors Armenia and Azerbaijan are in a territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. Georgia has two Russian-supported regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with ethnic groups closely identifying with Russia's North Caucasus. After a war in 2008, Russia recognized their independence and stationed military forces. Georgians speak their own Caucasian language and belong to the autocephalous Georgian Orthodox Church. Georgia is considered one of the most democratic post-Soviet states by observers. The House considers Georgia to be the freest post-Soviet state, followed by Ukraine, Moldova, and Armenia. Georgia has a parliamentary system of governance with the prime minister as the most powerful executive. The president has the power to veto legislation and dissolve parliament. The current prime minister is Mamuka Bakhtadze, while the president is Salome Zurabishvili. The parliamentary chairman of Georgia is Irakli Kobakhidze, a former professor of law and politics. Georgia has a unicameral legislature with 150 members elected for four-year terms. The ruling party, Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD), won a significant majority in the 2016 parliamentary elections, controlling over 75% of seats. GD lost its supermajority in February 2019, raising concerns about checks and balances in the government. In the 2016 parliamentary elections in Georgia, the ruling party Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD) won a significant majority with over 75% of seats. The main competitor was the United National Movement (UNM), which received 27% of the party vote. After infighting, the UNM fragmented in 2017, with most deputies forming a new party called European Georgia-Movement for Liberty. Another bloc, the Alliance of Patriots of Georgia-United Opposition, also entered parliament. Local elections in 2017 showed GD's dominance, winning in all 73 districts with 56% of the vote. In the most recent local elections in Georgia, the ruling party Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD) won in all 73 districts with 56% of the vote. They also secured more than 92% of majoritarian seats, giving them a total of 77% of seats in local councils nationwide. The UNM and European Georgia won 27% of the vote combined, while the Alliance of Patriots won 7%. The most recent presidential elections saw Salome Zurabishvili winning with 60% of the vote in the second round, supported by GD, while UNM candidate Grigol Vashadze received 40%. Observers considered the elections to be competitive but flawed. Observers noted instances of official pressure against state employees to support Zurabishvili, incidents of ballot box stuffing, and concerns about mass vote-buying related to Prime Minister Bakhtadze's announcement. The U.S. Department of State expressed concerns, stating that these actions are not consistent with Georgia's commitment to fair elections. There have been signs of internal tension within the ruling party Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD), with many believing that GD founder Ivanishvili still wields influence behind the scenes. Ivanishvili formally returned to politics as GD's party chairman in 2018. In 2013, Ivanishvili stepped down as prime minister. He returned to politics as GD's party chairman in 2018 due to internal divides. Prime Minister Kvirikashvili resigned citing disagreements with Ivanishvili, followed by anti-government protests. Bakhtadze succeeded Kvirikashvili in June 2018. In February 2019, GD faced parliamentary defections over a dispute on judicial appointments. Eight MPs, led by Eka Beselia, left GD to establish a new faction. In 2018, eight MPs left the GD government to form a new faction, while two MPs joined the Patriots of Georgia faction. Ex-President Margvelashvili, initially allied with GD, later criticized the government and vetoed legislation. He chose not to run for reelection in 2018, and GD initially did not nominate a presidential candidate. Eventually, they supported Zurabishvili, despite previous criticism of her comments. Government officials criticized Zurabishvili for comments blaming Georgia's ex-leadership for the 2008 war. A dispute within the ruling party arose over judicial reform, particularly the nomination of judges to the Supreme Court. Some MPs were concerned about corruption and ties to the UNM party. The Supreme Court nominees withdrew their candidacies amid concerns of corruption. The Constitutional Court has been a focus of disputes over bias. In July 2018, the Court ruled on marijuana use, leading to strict limitations imposed by parliament. Georgia's parliament convened a State Constitutional Commission for additional reforms after GD won a supermajority in 2016. Georgia's State Constitutional Commission drafted reforms to transition to a parliamentary system, which were passed by parliament in September 2017. Opposition parties and civil society groups opposed the changes. President Margvelashvili vetoed the amendments, but parliament overrode the veto and the reforms became law after the 2018 presidential election. The main change is the abolition of the directly elected presidency in 2023, with the president to be indirectly elected by a college of electors. The Georgian parliament passed reforms in 2017 to transition to a parliamentary system, abolishing the directly elected presidency in 2023. The new system includes electing the president indirectly by a college of electors and holding parliamentary elections based on party lists. The implementation of the fully proportional system was delayed to 2024, seen as an attempt to prolong the ruling party's dominance. Opposition parties pushed for the change to be implemented earlier, citing the need for greater opposition representation in parliament. The Council of Europe's Venice Commission provided a \"positive assessment\" of Georgia's political system reforms, noting the delay in implementing the proportional election system to 2024 as a major obstacle. The reform was seen as a positive step towards consolidating democracy and improving the country's constitutional order. Georgia has been recovering from economic decline since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with a GDP of around $16.7 billion in 2018. Georgia's economy has shown strong growth in recent years, with GDP increasing at a rate of 4.8% in 2017 and 2018. The IMF predicts continued growth of around 4.9% annually from 2019 to 2021, attributing this to domestic consumption, external demand, and policy efforts. Poverty rates have decreased, but further efforts are needed for inclusive growth and economic resilience. Georgia's economy has shown strong growth, with GDP increasing at a rate of 4.8% in 2017 and 2018. Poverty has declined, with 22% of the population living in poverty in 2017. Unemployment is around 14%, and remittances from labor migration make up around 11% of GDP. The IMF approved a $285 million loan to support economic reforms focusing on financial stability and infrastructure investment in 2017. The IMF approved a $285 million loan for Georgia in 2017 to support economic reforms focusing on financial stability and infrastructure investment. Georgia has improved its energy security by rehabilitating hydropower plants and constructing new ones. Its main trading partners include Turkey, Russia, Azerbaijan, and China. Trade with the EU accounts for 27% of total trade. Georgia's main exports are copper ores and beverages. Georgia's main trading partners are Azerbaijan, Russia, Armenia, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Key exports include copper ores, beverages, motor vehicles, and iron and steel. Free trade agreements with the EU and China could boost export-led growth. The IMF suggests diversifying agricultural exports and improving quality. Tourism has seen significant growth, with 4.8 million international visitors in 2018, mainly from neighboring countries. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Georgia has been increasing, averaging $1.64 billion a year from 2014 to 2018. Most of the FDI came from Azerbaijan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Turkey, with key sectors being transport, communications, finance, construction, and energy. Georgia aims to attract FDI in sectors like tourism and agriculture to ensure growth in foreign markets and become a key transit hub for the East-West trade route. A major new deepwater port and free industrial zone in Anaklia are being constructed to support this goal. A consortium is building a new deepwater port and industrial zone in Anaklia, Georgia, near the Russian-occupied region of Abkhazia. The port, set to open in 2021, is Georgia's largest infrastructure investment. The government is also investing in road and rail infrastructure. Georgia aims for closer integration with the EU and NATO, with strong public support for membership in both organizations. In 2014, Georgia signed an association agreement with the EU, including a Free Trade Area and visa-free travel. The EU provides significant foreign aid to Georgia annually. In 2017 and 2018, the EU provided over \u20ac120 million annually in aid to Georgia. The benefits of the EU free-trade agreement for Georgia are unclear. Georgian exports to the EU increased by 17% from 2014 to 2018, but the share of exports to the EU remained the same at 22%. Georgia has close relations with NATO, with the NATO-Georgia Commission established in 2008 for cooperation. NATO has provided support to Georgia to bolster its defense capabilities. Georgia has a strong partnership with NATO, contributing troops to missions in Afghanistan and Kosovo. In 2015, a Joint Training and Evaluation Center was opened in Georgia to enhance interoperability and operational readiness through training and exercises. Georgia has a strong partnership with NATO, contributing troops to missions in Afghanistan and Kosovo. In March 2019, the second joint NATO-Georgia exercise was held, with some NATO member states also participating in annual U.S.-Georgia military exercises. Despite efforts for closer integration with the EU and NATO, Georgia has not seen improvement in its near-term prospects for membership in these organizations. NATO members agreed in 2008 that Georgia would become a member, but Georgia has not been granted a clear path to NATO membership. Many observers believe Georgia's lack of a clear path to NATO membership is due to concerns about heightened war risk with Russia, which occupies 18% of Georgia's territory. The secessionist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke away in the 1990s, worsening Georgia's relations with Russia. Moscow is believed to support these regions to prevent Georgia from joining NATO. Relations deteriorated further after ex-President Saakashvili sought closer integration with the West. Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 to prevent Georgia from reestablishing control over South Ossetia. Russia recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states and has since tightened control over the regions by constructing border fencing, imposing transit restrictions, and establishing military bases. In 2016, Russia formed a military forces agreement with Abkhazia, and in 2017, a similar agreement was reached with South Ossetia. Since 2012, the Georgian government has improved economic ties with Russia, leading to an increase in exports. However, conflicts over Abkhazia and South Ossetia remain unresolved. The EU monitors compliance with cease-fire agreements in Georgia, but is not allowed to operate in the breakaway regions. Efforts to address conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia involve various international organizations and mechanisms, including the Geneva International Discussions and Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms. However, progress in rebuilding ties and resolving issues has been limited, with periodic suspensions of participation. In 2018, the Georgian government introduced a peace initiative, but challenges persist in addressing the conflict and facilitating the return of internally displaced persons. In 2018, the Georgian government introduced a peace initiative and legislative amendments to engage with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The US and EU support the initiative, but it's uncertain if Russia and the regions will accept it. Despite improved relations with Russia, public support for closer integration remains low in Georgia. Pro-Russian parties performed poorly in the 2016 elections, with only the Alliance of Patriots entering parliament, but they did not campaign for membership in the Eurasian Union. Less than 30% of respondents in a 2018 survey supported joining the Eurasian Union. Georgia is a close ally of the United States. Georgia, a close ally of the United States, has deepened its strategic partnership with the US since Russia's invasions in 2008 and 2014. The US supported Georgia's NATO aspirations before the 2008 war and continues to stand by this commitment. In 2017, Vice President Pence reaffirmed support for Georgia's NATO membership. The Trump Administration supports Georgia's NATO membership aspirations and condemns Russia's occupation of Georgian territory. The United States stands by Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, calling on Russia to comply with the 2008 cease-fire agreement. The U.S. government supports Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, calling on Russia to comply with the 2008 cease-fire agreement and reverse its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. Congress also expresses firm support for Georgia and does not recognize territorial changes effected by force. The FY2019 foreign operations appropriations prohibit foreign assistance to governments that recognize Abkhazia or South Ossetia and restrict funds from supporting Russia's occupation of these territories. The 2014 Ukraine Freedom Support Act provides for sanctions against Russian entities transferring weapons to Georgian territory, while the Georgia Support Act expresses support for Georgia's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. The proposed act requires reports on U.S. security assistance to Georgia, cybersecurity cooperation, and combating Russian disinformation. It also mandates sanctions for human rights abuses in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Previous resolutions have shown strong support for Georgia's territorial integrity and condemned Russia's intervention and occupation. The United States does not recognize Russia's sovereignty over any part of Georgia. Resolutions in support of Georgia's territorial integrity have been passed by the Senate and House.

Additionally, Georgia was awarded a $295 million grant from the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation for infrastructure development. The U.S. also provided increased military aid to Georgia after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

For FY2019, Congress appropriated $35 million in FMF and $2 million in IMET funds, along with additional defense funding for maritime and counter-WMD capacity-building assistance. The United States has increased defense cooperation with Georgia postwar, refraining from approving defensive arms sales due to concerns about deterrent effect, potential Georgian offensives, and relations with Russia.
