    "content": "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, allowing funds to be drawn from the Treasury only through appropriations. Budget legislation can vary in detail, giving agencies flexibility in how they spend funds. Agencies can shift funds between accounts through transfer authority and reprogramming, subject to statutory restrictions. The terms reprogramming and transfer are distinct budgetary actions with different statutory limitations. Understanding the structure of accounts is necessary to differentiate between the two actions. For example, in FY2013, the Department of Justice had multiple accounts, such as FBI and ATF. A transfer would occur if funds allocated for FBI were used for ATF expenses. The Department of Justice Appropriations Act includes funding for various activities such as criminal litigation, civil litigation, and legal education for U.S. attorneys. Reprogramming occurs when funds are shifted from one activity to another within the same account, depending on the structure and contents of the appropriations accounts involved. This report provides an overview of transfers and reprogramming, statutory limitations, and requirements for congressional notification. It discusses possible issues for Congress regarding agency reporting, oversight, burden of notifications, misuse of authorities, and financial management of transferred funds. Transfers involve moving budgetary resources within or between agencies, subject to specific conditions. An agency or department can only transfer budgetary resources with statutory authority, as outlined in 31 U.S.C. Section 1532. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) states that all transfers require statutory authority, including transfers between agencies, accounts within the same agency, and to working funds. Without statutory authority, an agency cannot use budget authority from one account to fund programs typically funded by another account. Transfer authority allows agencies to move funds between accounts, but only with statutory authority. This authority can be broad or narrow in scope, apply to all agencies or select ones, and may have a specific dollar limit or be indefinite. It can be provided in authorizing statutes or appropriations acts, with restrictions on its use. Transfer authority in annual appropriations acts allows agencies to shift budget authority between accounts with specific limitations. Notification to Congress is required a certain number of days before funds are transferred. Department-wide and agency-wide transfer authorities are typically found in \"General Provisions\" sections with restrictions on the total amount that can be transferred in a fiscal year. The Department of Commerce has transfer authority with limits on the amount that can be transferred between accounts in a fiscal year. The total amount of transfers cannot exceed 5% of the department's total appropriation for FY2013, and no single account can be increased by more than 10% through transfers. The Department of Commerce allows for account-specific transfer authorities, with a maximum increase of 10% of the original appropriation. Transfer authority can be limited to a specific dollar amount or indefinite based on available funds. For example, in FY2012, the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture were authorized to transfer up to $50,000,000 for wildland fire management programs. Transfer authority in authorizing statutes may be indefinite with respect to amount, limited to available funds, and often accompanied by specific restrictions on usage. For example, in FY2012, the Secretary of the Treasury had indefinite authority to transfer funds for debt collection costs. Restrictions on transfer authority may be imposed by subsequent legislation, allowing executive agencies to transfer funds when responsibilities are transferred between agencies. Appropriations available for transferred functions can be used by the receiving agency for the intended purpose. The provision allows executive agencies to transfer funds when functions are transferred by law, such as in cases of governmental reorganization like the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The transfer of funds ceases once the function transfer is complete. The HSA included provisions authorizing the transfer of funds from departments to DHS for coordinated funding of activities. The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 allows the CIA to transfer funds for specific functions like intelligence collection and evaluation. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 grants the Director of National Intelligence authority to manage transfers and reprogramming of intelligence-related funds. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allows the President to authorize transfers of foreign assistance funds in the national interest. Reprogramming involves shifting funds within an appropriations account for different purposes. Reprogramming of funds is generally permitted unless restricted by statute. GAO states that agencies have the authority to reprogram funds when lump-sum appropriations are enacted without restrictions. However, agencies cannot misuse reprogramming to circumvent transfer prohibitions without statutory authority. Reprogramming of funds is generally permitted unless restricted by statute. Agencies may have limitations on reprogramming actions imposed by annual appropriations acts or other statutes. For example, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013, established restrictions and notification requirements on reprogramming actions by DHS. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013, imposes restrictions and notification requirements on reprogramming funds, including limitations on eliminating programs or activities, increasing funds for denied programs, or contracting out functions without prior notification to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Nonstatutory understandings, developed in consultation with agencies, are informal agreements that may influence agency behavior but are not legally binding. These understandings may be integrated into agencies' internal budget execution policies. Certain nonstatutory information in explanatory statements may be \"incorporated by reference\" in appropriations acts. The Appropriations Act, 2012, incorporated allocation tables specifying funds for Department of Energy projects. Nonstatutory materials can be treated as part of the statutory text if the intent is clear. The referenced allocations in the explanatory statement become legally binding, requiring agencies to obligate and expend appropriated amounts accordingly. Transferred and reprogrammed funds retain original restrictions, regardless of the receiving account's limitations. This general restriction is outlined in Title 31, Section 1532 of the U.S. Code. Transferred amounts are available for the same purpose and subject to the same limitations unless specified by law. The agency must adhere to three principles when using appropriated funds: amounts must be within what was appropriated, funds must be used for their intended purpose, and funds can only pay for obligations made during the specified time period. These principles also apply to transferred or reprogrammed funds, with additional restrictions imposed by relevant statutes. The limitations and restrictions on transfer authority or reprogramming provisions are discussed using a three-principle framework: amount, purpose, and timing. Statutes may place caps on the amounts that can be transferred, known as \"not-to-exceed\" limitations. For example, in FY2012, the Environmental Protection Agency was authorized to transfer up to $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Transfers may be limited to specific purposes or activities. Quality Agreement programs, projects, or activities may have limitations on transfers, such as not exceeding a certain percentage of the total budget authority. For example, the Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 2012, restricted transfers to not exceed 5 percent of any appropriation, with no appropriation to be increased by more than 10 percent. Similar restrictions may also apply to reprogramming funds, often used for congressional notification thresholds. Statutes may also mandate specific dollar amounts for transfers. Statutes may mandate specific dollar amounts for transfers between accounts, including provisions for interagency fund accounts and administrative expenses. These transfers are typically automatic and follow special accounting procedures established by OMB and Treasury. The general restriction in 31 U.S.C. Section 1532 applies to policy restrictions in appropriations acts, such as prohibiting funds for specific activities like first-class travel. Unless Congress specifies otherwise, these policy restrictions remain in effect. The policy restrictions in appropriations acts, such as prohibiting funds for specific activities, remain in effect unless specified otherwise. New restrictions on fund use may be imposed by transfer authority provisions, limiting funds to higher priority items or prohibiting funding for previously denied projects. The general restriction in 31 U.S.C. Section 1532 also applies to the period of time for which appropriated funds are available. Transfer authority provisions may limit funds to higher priority items or prohibit funding for denied projects. Funds provided for a single fiscal year remain available only for that fiscal year, even if transferred to an account with multi-year funds. \"Parking\" or \"banking\" funds to extend availability is prohibited unless authorized by law. Transfer authority with a proviso can extend the period of availability of appropriated funds. Agencies may need to notify Congress before certain transfers. Transfer and reprogramming actions require agencies to notify Congress prior to carrying out certain transfers or reprogramming transactions. This notification is often required a certain number of days in advance, as specified in annual appropriations acts. For example, the FY2012 Department of State Appropriations Act mandated that reprogramming actions exceeding $1 million must be notified to the Committees on Appropriations 15 days in advance. Transfer authority provisions may also include language treating transfers as reprogrammings. Transfer and reprogramming actions require agencies to notify Congress in advance, with specific dollar thresholds triggering notifications. Transfers may be treated as reprogrammings, subject to the same limitations and notification requirements. Agencies have internal procedures for transferring or reprogramming funds, which may require approval from agency heads, department secretaries, and sometimes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Procedures vary by department, for example, the U.S. Air Force requires approval from the Deputy Assistant Secretary before notifying Congress. The transfer of funds within agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Director of National Intelligence requires multiple approval stages, including consultation with affected agencies and adherence to OMB guidance. Executive branch agencies must follow OMB Circular A-11 for reprogramming requests. The OMB Circular A-11 requires executive branch agencies to provide reprogramming requests to OMB in advance for review. OMB may take longer to review requests that are not coordinated or lack supporting materials. Agencies are instructed to consult with OMB Resource Management Office for utilizing transfer and reprogramming authorities to balance mission priorities. Transfers and reprogrammings may trigger accounting or financial management procedures. Transfers and reprogramming of appropriations allow agencies to adjust budgets throughout the fiscal year, with OMB apportioning funds and requiring agencies to submit reapportionment requests for transfers over a certain threshold. This process helps agencies manage changing circumstances and prevent premature exhaustion of funds. Transfers and reprogramming of funds provide agencies flexibility to carry out essential functions of programs. When done in accordance with authority, it can enhance operational efficiency while adhering to congressional intent. However, deviations from applicable authorities may lead to funds being used contrary to congressional intent, impacting oversight. The sections below highlight issues for Congress regarding agency use of transfer and reprogramming authorities. Agencies must notify Congress before transferring funds between appropriations accounts, with reprogramming actions triggering notification only for larger amounts. Larger transfers, like the Department of Defense's $7 billion request in FY2012, are more visible and subject to oversight. Smaller transfers may be less evident due to fewer notification requirements. Congress may need to consider expanding agency reporting of transfers and reprogramming actions to increase oversight. Currently, some departments handle reprogramming actions internally without notifying Congress, leading to limited oversight. Members not on the Appropriations Committees may have restricted access to information on these actions. Options to enhance reporting could involve changing current notification procedures. Options to enhance reporting of transfers and reprogramming actions for congressional oversight include lowering notification thresholds, expanding notification to authorizing committees, and requiring public disclosure of information. While additional reporting may help identify misuse of funds, expanding reporting requirements could make reviewing actions more challenging. Congress should consider the impact on the number of notifications and oversight effectiveness if modifying existing notification requirements. The GAO report suggests that adjusting reporting thresholds could reduce the number of notifications submitted, without significantly changing oversight. However, there is no consensus on the best way to modify the system. Overreliance on reprogramming may increase administrative and oversight burdens, as seen in instances of unsound budgetary planning. In 2003 and 2004, the Army Corps of Engineers reprogrammed funds over 7,000 times, moving over $2.1 billion among projects. GAO recommended eliminating excessive reprogramming actions and improving financial management. Misuse of transfer authorities can lead to overspending, as seen in a DHS case where $5.1 million was reprogrammed without proper notification. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) violated the Antideficiency Act by reprogramming funds for the U.S. Secret Service program, making the funds \"unavailable for obligation.\" Proper recording and tracking of fund transfers are essential to prevent budgetary adjustments exceeding legal limits and ensure accurate financial management. Double-counting of transactions must be avoided to maintain the correct amount of available budget authority. Proper recording of fund transfers is crucial to prevent budgetary errors and ensure accurate financial management. Failure to record transfers accurately can lead to under- or over-estimating budget resources, affecting budget planning and oversight. Gradual transfers during reorganizations may pose challenges for financial management and auditing. Transfers of functions and activities within executive agencies can be made with the approval of the President. The head of the agency determines the amount needed for transfers within the agency, while the President determines the amount for transfers between agencies. Transfers of functions and activities within executive agencies can be made with the approval of the President. A balance transferred is credited to an appropriation account, merged with existing amounts, and accounted for as one. New appropriation accounts can be established for this purpose. Withdrawal and credit of funds between accounts require authorization by law and are subject to the same limitations. Transfer of funds and employees within the Department of Defense can be made with the approval of the President. Balances of appropriations can be transferred to the receiving department or agency and used for the intended purpose. The transferred balances are credited to the appropriate account or a new account can be established. When a function, power, or duty is transferred from one department or agency of the Department of Defense to another, civilian employees needed for that function may be transferred with approval. Balances of appropriations can be merged with existing funds in a new account and used as one fund, subject to specific limitations. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 allowed for the transfer of functions from multiple federal departments to the Department of Homeland Security, resulting in the abolishment of certain government entities. Transferred employees increase the authorized strength of the receiving department while reducing the strength of the transferring department. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 abolished government entities like the Office of Science and Technology and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, transferring their functions to new entities within DHS. The act included provisions for transferring funds from these departments to DHS during the transition period. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions and funds from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to DHS, as outlined in sections 2508 and 2509 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990. Unexpended funds were to be transferred to the Director of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services for allocation to the appropriate component of the Department. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorized unexpended funds transfers for specific purposes within the Department. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget has broad authority for incidental transfers and additional dispositions of personnel, assets, and liabilities to achieve the Act's purposes. The Secretary of Defense may transfer funds for Department of Defense operations not funded in advance, up to $200,000,000 per fiscal year. Transfers can only be made from available appropriations and must reimburse accounts for incremental expenses incurred. The Secretary of Defense can transfer funds for Department of Defense operations up to $200,000,000 per fiscal year from available appropriations. The authority provided for transfers is in addition to any other transfer authority, but cannot be used for activities denied authorization by Congress. Transfers increase the authorized amount for the receiving account. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to transfer appropriations for Defense intelligence elements to designated accounts. These accounts can also receive transfers from the Director of National Intelligence and reimbursements from transactions between Defense intelligence elements and other entities. Appropriation balances can be refunded back to the originating accounts. The Secretary of Defense can transfer appropriations for Defense intelligence elements to designated accounts, which can also receive transfers and reimbursements. Appropriation refunds can be made back to the originating accounts. Transfers must be recorded as expenditure transfers and funds remain available for the same purpose and time period as the original appropriation. Funds can only be obligated and expended in accordance with applicable laws. The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency may provide support to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, including administrative and contract services, as authorized by law. The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency may provide security police services to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency under agreed terms with the Secretary of Defense. Personnel can be detailed indefinitely, and support can be reimbursable or nonreimbursable. Transfer of funds is authorized. The Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency may transfer funds to the Central Intelligence Agency for administrative and contract services or personnel detail. Transfer of funds is authorized under specific procedures and limitations. The Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has the authority to transfer funds to the Central Intelligence Agency for administrative and contract services or personnel detail. The transferred funds must be used for higher priority items based on unforeseen military requirements and cannot be used for items denied funds by Congress. The Secretary of Defense must notify Congress of each transfer made under this authority. Limitations on requests to Congress for reprogrammings state that funds can only be transferred for higher priority items based on unforeseen military requirements. The Central Intelligence Agency is authorized to transfer funds with approval for authorized functions. The Central Intelligence Agency is authorized to transfer funds for authorized functions without limitations on appropriations. Additionally, the Agency can exchange funds and reimburse other Government agencies for personnel services without restrictions. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) with authority over transfers and reprogramming of intelligence funds, previously handled by the Secretary of Defense or the CIA Director. The Director of National Intelligence must approve all fund transfers or reprogramming, except as specified by procedures. The Director of National Intelligence has the authority to transfer or reprogram funds within the National Intelligence Program, with consultation and approval requirements in place. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established limits and restrictions on this transfer authority, including the need for consultation with the Director of the CIA and other intelligence agency heads in certain circumstances. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 allows the Director of National Intelligence to transfer or reprogram funds within the National Intelligence Program, with consultation requirements in place. The act also established restrictions on funds transfer and reprogramming, including consultation with the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Transfers must be for higher priority intelligence activities, support emergent needs, improve program effectiveness, or increase efficiency. The transfer or reprogramming of funds within the National Intelligence Program must meet specific criteria, including not exceeding $150,000,000 in a fiscal year and not terminating an acquisition program. Transfers can be made without certain limitations if approved by the department head or the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The authority to transfer or reprogram funds within the National Intelligence Program can be delegated by the department head or the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Funds transferred or reprogrammed shall remain available for the same period as the appropriations account. Procedures for congressional notification of fund transfers or reprogramming must be followed, including providing a report explaining the nature of the transfer or reprogramming. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allows the President to transfer foreign assistance funds as needed. The congressional intelligence committees must be promptly notified of any transfers or reprogramming of funds that would not have otherwise required notification. The President can transfer up to 10% of funds for any provision of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for necessary purposes, with a limit of increasing the total by 20%. This authority cannot be used to augment certain appropriations or finance activities typically funded from appropriations. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-189; 87 Stat. 714) amended the FAA to provide the President with the authority to transfer up to 15% of funds between provisions for necessary purposes. This transfer authority is in addition to the existing 10% transfer authority under Sections 610(a). The Foreign Assistance Act of 1973 amended to allow the President to transfer funds between provisions, with a limit of 25%. Additional reporting requirements were added in the FY2003 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. No funds from this Act can be transferred to any U.S. department, agency, or instrumentality. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1973 allows the President to transfer funds between provisions, with a limit of 25%. Funds appropriated by this Act can be allocated or transferred to agencies of the United States Government. The President must consult and provide a written policy before transferring funds under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allows for the transfer of funds between agencies of the United States Government, with oversight by the Office of the Inspector General for the receiving agency. Funds can be used for program and financial audits, with provisions for the cost of such audits. The Rural Development Disaster Assistance Fund was established in the Treasury in 2008, allowing the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer unobligated balances from previous appropriations for disaster response programs. The Secretary of Defense shall establish the \"Department of Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund\" to provide funds for recruitment, training, and retention of acquisition personnel. The Secretary may transfer unobligated balances from previous appropriations to the Fund. The Department of State is authorized to transfer unobligated balances from appropriations for research, development, test, and evaluation, or operation and maintenance to a fund to offset adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or overseas wage and price changes. The Secretary of State may transfer unobligated funds to the Buying Power Maintenance account, limited to $100,000,000. Transfers are treated as reprogramming of funds and must follow specific procedures. This authority applies to funds appropriated after the fiscal year. A working capital fund is established for the Department of Labor, available without fiscal year limitation, for various services and supplies. The fund must be reimbursed in advance from available funds. The Department of Labor establishes a working capital fund for centralized services, to be reimbursed in advance from available funds. The Secretary of Labor may transfer up to $3,000,000 annually to the fund for equipment acquisition and financial management improvements, with a limit of $20,000,000 in the fund's unobligated balance. The \"Foreign Currency Fluctuations, American Battle Monuments Commission, Account\" is established in the Treasury for the purpose of covering expenses exceeding the budget due to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Unobligated balances from appropriations for salaries and expenses can be transferred to the Account within two fiscal years. The unobligated balance from appropriations for the Department of Justice can be merged with the Working Capital Fund for capital equipment, data processing systems, and financial management improvements. Transfers must be made within five fiscal years after the funds are appropriated. Funds allocated in fiscal year 1992 and beyond require notification to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees as per section 606 of the Act."
