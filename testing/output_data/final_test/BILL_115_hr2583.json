It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The Act, titled the \"BUILD Resilience Act of 2017,\" defines key terms such as \"eligible entity,\" \"National Center,\" and \"resilience\" as the ability to prepare for and adapt to disasters and shocks. The \"BUILD Resilience Act of 2017\" defines key terms like \"resilience grant,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State\" in relation to disaster preparedness and adaptation. The \"BUILD Resilience Act of 2017\" defines key terms related to disaster preparedness and adaptation, including the Community Resilience Grant Program. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will implement a Community Resilience Grant Program to help communities enhance resilience to chronic stresses and acute shocks by improving infrastructure and housing. Grant amounts will be awarded competitively to eligible entities in areas affected by major disasters in the past 5 years. Amounts from the grant can be used for various resilience activities. The Community Resilience Grant Program allows for the use of grant amounts for authorized activities under specific sections of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The Secretary must consult with relevant agencies before awarding a grant to prevent duplication of assistance. The Community Resilience Grant Program requires recipients to match at least 50% of the grant amount with non-Federal funds, which can include non-monetary contributions. Eligible entities must submit applications outlining plans for the use of grant funds. The Secretary requires resilience grant applications to include a detailed plan for fund usage to address long-term infrastructure and housing resilience. Grants are awarded competitively based on transparent criteria outlined in the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989. The Secretary establishes criteria for selecting grant applications based on greatest need and other factors, including increasing resilience and capacity for successful implementation. The Secretary considers applications with approved resilience or mitigation plans from other Federal agencies sufficient for grant approval if accompanied by a detailed description of fund usage. The Secretary will consider awarding resilience grants to eligible entities in all regions of the United States. Priority will be given to applicants with innovative plans to increase community resilience to extreme weather, focusing on infrastructure, housing, and economic resilience. Amounts allocated to eligible entities will be treated as CDBG funds.
