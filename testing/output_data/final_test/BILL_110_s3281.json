    "content": "The Act titled \"Drive America on Natural Gas Act of 2008\" includes a section on the Renewable Fuel Program. The Drive America on Natural Gas Act of 2008 includes an amendment to the Clean Air Act defining renewable fuel as fuel produced from renewable biomass used to replace or reduce fossil fuel in transportation fuel. The Drive America on Natural Gas Act of 2008 includes an amendment to the Clean Air Act that allows for the generation of credits for renewable and nonrenewable natural gas, including compressed and liquefied natural gas when used as transportation fuel. The Drive America on Natural Gas Act of 2008 allows for credits for natural gas as transportation fuel. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new qualified alternative fuel motor vehicle credit for dual-fueled automobiles. The amendment specifies that the vehicle must be capable of operating on alternative fuel, gasoline, or diesel fuel. SEC. 4. NATURAL GAS VEHICLE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. The section defines key terms like Administrator, Natural gas, and Secretary. It outlines a program for natural gas vehicle research, development, and demonstration focusing on improving and developing cleaner and more efficient natural gas vehicle engines. The program focuses on integrating natural gas engines into various vehicles, expanding product availability, demonstrating proper vehicle operation, developing codes and standards, improving fueling station infrastructure, and certifying fueling stations. The program aims to certify natural gas fueling station infrastructure, improve onboard fuel storage systems, develop new storage materials, certify onboard storage systems, and use natural gas engines in hybrid vehicles. The Secretary will coordinate with the Administrator to streamline certification of conversion systems and work with industry in program development. The Secretary will coordinate with the natural gas vehicle industry to ensure cooperation between public and private sectors. The program will be conducted in accordance with specific sections of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. A report on the implementation of this section must be submitted to Congress within 2 years. Appropriations are authorized as necessary for the program. SEC. 251. DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-EMISSION NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION-FUELED VEHICLES. SEC. 251 defines key terms related to alternative fuels and vehicles, including alternative fuel, alternative-fueled vehicle, bi-fueled vehicle, convert, and OBD system. The curr_chunk discusses a computer-based diagnostic system in vehicles to monitor engine components and emissions control. It also defines terms like program and small volume manufacturer. The curr_chunk discusses a program to assist States in developing alternative-fueled vehicles, specifically benefiting small volume manufacturers. The Administrator will waive fees for small volume manufacturers certifying and converting alternative-fueled vehicles, waive recertification requirements for vehicle conversion kits under certain conditions, and adjust OBD system regulations for flexibility. The EPA will provide flexibility to small volume manufacturers in reprogramming OBD systems for alternative fuel use, allow more vehicles in a single engine category for cost-efficient emission testing, waive liability for bi-fueled vehicles' gasoline system compliance, offer guidance on converting older vehicle models. State responsibility in the program includes developing less burdensome regulations for certifying emissions of alternative-fueled vehicles and submitting proposed regulations to the Administrator for review by December 31, 2012. State programs must submit proposed regulations to the Administrator for review. If the Administrator finds that the regulations would result in an equally effective but less burdensome system for certifying emissions of alternative-fueled vehicles, the State may implement the regulations for small volume manufacturers from 2014 to 2018, with the requirement of submitting annual reports and undergoing periodic inspections. The program for certifying emissions of alternative-fueled vehicles includes periodic inspections and oversight determined by the Administrator. The program will terminate on December 31, 2013, unless the Administrator chooses to continue it in consultation with the States and promulgates necessary regulations. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the program. SEC. 252 of the Clean Air Act waives recertification requirements for natural gas vehicle conversion kits if the kit and vehicle model remain unchanged. Emission certification system requirements are also waived for older natural gas vehicles over 10 years old or with over 120,000 miles."
