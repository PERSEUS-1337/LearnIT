    "content": "The \"Justice for Amy Act of 2014\" is also known as the Mandatory Restitution Act. Section 2259 of title 18, United States Code is amended to mandate restitution for offenses under this chapter, regardless of the defendant's economic circumstances or victim compensation from insurance. The court shall calculate the victim's losses for child pornography offenses, including medical services, therapy, transportation, housing, and child care expenses. Restitution is mandated for offenses under this chapter, regardless of the defendant's economic circumstances or victim compensation from insurance. The court shall calculate the victim's losses for child pornography offenses, including medical services, therapy, transportation, housing, and child care expenses, lost income, attorneys' fees, and other costs incurred. Restitution is mandated for offenses under this chapter, and a defendant convicted of a child pornography offense shall be jointly and severally liable for the victim's losses. A defendant convicted of a child pornography offense or related sexual abuse offense may bring a civil action for contribution against others found liable for the victim's losses. A defendant convicted of a child pornography offense or related sexual abuse offense may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States for contribution against others who have committed a related sexual abuse offense against the victim. The identity of the respondent in the civil action shall be kept confidential unless released by the Court to a law enforcement agency for law enforcement purposes. In a civil action, the court will determine if the respondent is liable or enters into a settlement agreement. The court will also decide if the petitioner is entitled to contribution and if the respondent committed a related sexual abuse offense against the victim. In a civil action, the court will determine liability or settlement. If the respondent committed a related sexual abuse offense, they are jointly liable for the victim's losses. Each liable party must pay an equal percentage of the losses. In case of a settlement, if the petitioner hasn't paid the victim in full, they must do so under a restitution order. The order of restitution requires the respondent to pay the victim directly for their losses, including medical services and therapy. The order of restitution includes payment for medical services, therapy, transportation, housing, child care, lost income, attorneys' fees, and other losses caused by the offense. Restitution for offenses under this chapter is enforced according to section 3664. The term 'related sexual abuse offense' refers to offenses against victims of child pornography related to its production, distribution, possession, or viewing. The term 'victim' includes individuals harmed by crimes under this chapter, with provisions for minors, incapacitated individuals, and legal representatives. The defendant cannot be named as a representative or guardian in cases involving related sexual abuse offenses. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of this Act's enactment on the Department of Justice's efforts to collect restitution for child pornography victims."
