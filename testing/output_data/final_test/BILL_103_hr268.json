Section 21A(i) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act is amended to provide additional funding of up to $25 billion until April 1, 1994. This funding is in response to the President's request and is separate from previous amounts allocated. The funding will be reduced by the savings from the supervisory goodwill buy-back program. The Secretary will reduce the obligation by the net reduction in Corporation expenditures from the supervisory goodwill buy-back program under section 15 of the Home Owners' Loan Act. SEC. 3. REDUCTION OF RTC LOSSES. The purpose of this section is to reduce taxpayer funds needed by the Resolution Trust Corporation by eliminating potential losses related to supervisory goodwill in healthy savings associations. It also specifies that this does not apply to litigation involving savings associations that are not qualified. Establishment of Supervisory Goodwill Buy-Back Program under the Home Owners' Loan Act to address supervisory goodwill between non-qualified savings associations and the United States. Establishment of a Supervisory Goodwill Buy-Back Program under the Home Owners' Loan Act to address supervisory goodwill between non-qualified savings associations and the United States. SEC. 15 introduces the program. Upon determining the need for a conservator or receiver for a savings association, the Director will assess if the association is qualified and pay the replacement amount from available funds. This process involves reducing supervisory goodwill. Upon receipt of a payment, a qualified savings association must reduce its supervisory goodwill. A qualified savings association is defined as one that is deemed viable by the Director and has agreed to waive any claims against the Federal Government related to changes in supervisory goodwill treatment. The term 'replacement amount' for a qualified savings association is the lesser of the determined amount or the minimum amount needed for the association to be adequately capitalized. The 'determined amount' is set by the Office of Thrift Supervision based on the association's circumstances. The capital requirements for a qualified savings association are determined based on the supervisory goodwill of the association as of specific dates. If the association meets all fully phased in capital standards after receiving funds, those standards will apply regardless of other laws. The Office of Thrift may impose additional requirements. The Office of Thrift Supervision may set additional capital requirements for qualified savings associations to ensure compliance with all applicable standards. The Director will impose an annual assessment on viable savings associations until the total amount paid equals or exceeds the required aggregate amount. The Director will impose an annual assessment on savings associations based on viability, profitability, and supervisory goodwill, ensuring the total amount paid equals or exceeds the required aggregate amount. All amounts received by the Director will be transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of reducing the national debt. Savings associations are restricted from making capital distributions or paying dividends until assessments equal or exceed replacement amounts received. The Office of Thrift Supervision may establish requirements for qualified savings associations to ensure safe operation. The Resolution Trust Corporation will provide necessary funds to the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Director will promptly determine the applicability of the Act to savings associations. The Act allows for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for savings associations that have not yet been appointed as of the enactment date."
