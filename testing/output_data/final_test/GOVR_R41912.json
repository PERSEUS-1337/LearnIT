    "content": "Over the past decades, sustainable energy and environmental issues have gained attention in international development assistance. Donor countries, like the United States, are targeting projects that address economic growth indicators. This integration is reflected in various international conventions. The World Bank Group (WBG) focuses on economic growth indicators including financial viability, social inclusivity, and environmental sustainability at local and global levels. The United States influences WBG policy through voting power, advocacy, reporting requirements, and financial leverage to promote greater environmental sustainability in development assistance. The U.S. Congress has significant input on environmental issues within the World Bank Group (WBG), with a long-running debate over WBG's environmental practices. Environmental groups have campaigned since 1983, leading to congressional hearings and annual investigations by various committees. Witnesses include U.S. and affected country environmental groups, as well as U.S. officials involved in WBG institutions. The U.S. Congress has passed laws to influence environmental practices at the World Bank Group (WBG) since the mid-1980s. Legislative guidance in authorizing legislations and annual foreign operations appropriations bills aims to promote sustainability goals at WBG institutions. The International Financial Institutions Act of 1977, as well as annual appropriations acts, provide the primary legislative framework for U.S. interaction with the WBG. The U.S. Congress has passed laws to influence environmental practices at the World Bank Group (WBG) since the mid-1980s through various annual appropriations acts found in the U.S. Code, Title 22, Chapter 7. The U.S. Code includes sections related to energy, environmental issues, guidance for sustainable resource use, environmental protection, public health, indigenous peoples' status, environmental impact assessments, information exchange systems, loans supporting environmentally beneficial policies, and greenhouse gas accounting for climate change mitigation. The World Bank Group (WBG) has incorporated U.S. Congress guidance on environmental practices in lending reforms. In 2009, WBG announced plans to revise its energy and infrastructure lending strategy. Despite initial progress, the Energy Sector Strategy faced debate and stalled in the WBG Committee on Development Effectiveness. The Energy Sector Strategy (ESS) faced debate and stalled in the WBG Committee on Development Effectiveness. Jim Yong Kim's appointment as the 12th President of the World Bank Group in 2012 led to the discontinuation of the ESS process. Efforts to revise energy and infrastructure lending have been integrated into broader initiatives of the new administration, aligning with the WBG's mission of poverty alleviation and sustainable development. The proposed strategy aims to address the lack of access to electricity and modern energy resources for 1.4 billion people worldwide. Demand for primary energy is projected to rise by 80% in lower-income countries by 2035, requiring an additional annual investment of $36 billion for universal electricity access. Approximately 3 billion people still rely on traditional solid fuels, leading to 2 million deaths annually from indoor air pollution. Lower-income countries may bear up to 80% of future climate change costs. Energy-saving policies and low-emission technologies are seen as sustainable solutions to meet future energy needs and mitigate environmental issues. Achieving these goals could significantly help eradicate poverty and hunger. The World Bank's environmental strategies aim to eradicate poverty, hunger, promote gender equity, combat disease, and ensure environmental stability. However, critics argue that many of the WBG's lending practices support projects with negative environmental implications, such as road construction, large dams, fossil-fuel power generation, mining, and agricultural projects that harm the population they are intended to help. The World Bank Group's lending for energy infrastructure projects totaled $13 billion in 2010, including investments in power generation, transmission systems, and energy efficiency programs. Energy lending accounts for 17% of the WBG's investment portfolio and has steadily increased over the past decade. The World Bank Group's Infrastructure Action Plan revitalized engagement with the energy sector. Initiatives like the Infrastructure Recovery and Assets Platform and the Infrastructure Crisis Facility led to significant growth in commitments. 2010 saw record financing for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low carbon projects, with a 62% increase in low carbon commitments. Total lending for energy projects in 2010 was $13 billion, accounting for 17% of the WBG's investment portfolio. In 2010, the World Bank Group saw a 62% increase in low carbon financing, reaching $5.5 billion. This accounted for 42% of all commitments, with renewable energy and energy efficiency financing also reaching all-time highs. However, critics pointed out that the \"low carbon financing\" category also funded fossil fuel projects. The focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors decreased from 39% in 2009 to 26% in 2010, while new fossil fuel thermal power generation increased to $4.3 billion. During 2010, the World Bank Group increased low carbon financing by 62% to $5.5 billion, with renewable energy and energy efficiency financing also at record levels. However, critics noted that this funding also supported fossil fuel projects. The WBG introduced initiatives such as the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit, Climate Investment Funds, Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, and Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery to promote energy access and sustainable development. The World Bank Group introduced initiatives like the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit, Climate Investment Funds, Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, and Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery to promote sustainable development. Many lower-income countries view the WBG primarily as a financial institution for poverty alleviation and economic development, not for addressing environmental issues. They may be interested in low-cost, high-growth energy and infrastructure technologies for rapid benefits to their populations. Some may doubt the ability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind to meet the increasing demand for electricity affordably and reliably. They may prefer traditional fossil fuels over renewables, even if it harms long-term sustainability. Industrialized countries may see environmental regulations as hindrances to economic growth and sovereignty. Some in higher-income countries prioritize economic growth over investing in low-carbon technologies. Some observers oppose foreign aid, arguing that it hinders economic growth in developing countries by creating dependency and corruption. Recent U.S. Administrations have supported the environmental efforts of the World Bank Group, including updating environmental policies and strategies for sectors like energy and palm oil. The United States is also working to enhance the International Finance Corporation's environmental and social initiatives. The United States is focused on strengthening the International Finance Corporation's environmental and social standards, as well as the World Bank's lending practices to promote lower carbon development pathways. Concerns persist about the disconnection between the WBG's policies and its actions. Many countries suggest practical guidance for the WBG's engagement in the energy and environment sector should align with regional and country programs and its Strategic Framework for Development and Climate Change. Environmental observers criticize the WBG's history of energy and infrastructure lending, claiming it undermines its credibility in combating environmental degradation and climate change. Environmental groups point out inconsistencies between the WBG's rhetoric on climate change and its operational policies, noting that while there has been increased financing for renewable energy, fossil fuel lending still makes up a significant portion of its portfolio. Environmental groups criticize the World Bank Group (WBG) for its significant investments in fossil fuels, arguing that the WBG's definition of \"clean energy technology\" includes provisions for natural gas and coal-fired power generation. Critics claim that the WBG misrepresents its practices in reporting energy access, sustainable development, and clean energy projects, with a heavier focus on fossil fuels than officially reported. Additionally, they argue that the WBG fails to accurately account for fossil fuel investments in lending categories such as \"transmission and distribution\" and \"policy and technical assistance.\" Critics argue that the World Bank Group's investments in fossil fuels are not accurately reported, with a significant portion being channeled through financial intermediaries. They claim that the WBG misrepresents its funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, which are largely financed by external donor funds not structurally part of the WBG. Many observers warn that the World Bank Group's continued investment in fossil fuel energy and infrastructure could undermine gains in renewable energy, divert resources from energy access in poor communities, and shift focus away from energy efficiency. The WBG's core mission is poverty alleviation and sustainable development, and it aims to finance energy projects that align with these goals. The World Bank Group has identified the need for a new energy policy to provide reliable energy for economic development, extend energy access, ensure environmental sustainability, and address climate change. They are preparing an updated energy sector strategy to replace outdated frameworks from the late 1990s. The World Bank Group conducted consultations from January to July 2010 with 2,100 participants to revise the Energy Sector Strategy. The revised strategy was presented to the WBG Board Committee on Development Effectiveness in April 2011 but stalled during debate. The draft energy sector strategy for the organization is pending posting on the website. There are reports of modifications to the strategy to reach consensus in CODE, with concerns over coal provisions causing a stalemate. Efforts to revise energy and infrastructure lending have been integrated into broader initiatives under the new administration since the appointment of Jim Yong Kim as the World Bank Group President in 2012. The World Bank Group's Energy Sector Strategy (ESS) is a 10-year document covering lending and investment activities in its sub-institutions. The ESS focuses on alternatives to coal-fired power generation and does not include activities at regional development banks or other international financial institutions. The World Bank Group's Energy Sector Strategy (ESS) aims to identify alternatives to coal-fired power generation. It eliminates loans for new coal-based power projects in middle-income countries but allows for consideration in low-income countries under strict guidelines. Financing is available to improve the efficiency of existing coal plants and for natural gas projects with lower emissions potential. The World Bank Group's Energy Sector Strategy (ESS) supports natural gas projects with lower emissions potential as a complement to renewable energy. It also allows for environmentally and socially sustainable large-scale hydropower projects in developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Additionally, the ESS proposes a greenhouse gas emissions analysis program for new power generation projects starting in 2012. The World Bank Group's Energy Sector Strategy (ESS) aims to increase lending for clean energy projects, with a focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and low carbon technologies. The WBG supports greenhouse gas monitoring to address global climate change and promote sustainable development. The number of governments with renewable energy targets has doubled since 2005, with over 100 countries now having policies in place. The World Bank Group's Energy Sector Strategy (ESS) prioritizes energy efficiency initiatives to increase energy efficiency in all economic sectors. The ESS aims to expand access to modern energy services and support clean energy projects to address global climate change and promote sustainable development. The ESS aims to expand access to modern energy services, targeting 65-80 million people by 2020, including 8-12 gigawatts of additional generation capacity in Sub-Saharan Africa. This initiative supports basic services, education, healthcare, and entrepreneurial opportunities in developing economies. Additionally, the ESS aims to improve household fuel and distributed energy programs to reduce energy poverty impacts. The ESS aims to promote initiatives like solar-based energy services, high-performance cook-stoves, and sustainable biomass-based energy production to decrease energy poverty impacts. It also supports improving household fuel sources to alleviate health burdens from indoor air pollution and empower local communities. Gender equity and innovative policies are promoted to address high fuel prices and energy shortages. The ESS aims to promote innovative policy tools, transparent market designs, new financial models, and private sector participation to address investment barriers in lower-income countries affected by high fuel prices and energy shortages. The World Bank Group's funding is tied to donor country governments, limiting its resources and sparking debates on financial disbursements among lending institutions, contributing governments, recipient countries, and civil society stakeholders. The World Bank Group's position between environmental groups, higher-income countries, and lower-income countries is influenced by policies like the ESS. Critiques of the WBG's energy lending practices and the ESS include concerns about coal provisions being seen as discriminatory by countries like China. The World Bank Executive Director for Brazil criticized the ESS's coal provisions as \"discriminatory\" and warned against preventing middle-income countries from accessing loans for new coal plants. He argued that banning coal would harm the poorest countries that rely on it for energy access. Some countries also raised concerns about the WBG's focus on markets and private sector for developmental assistance, calling for more promotion of technology transfer for renewable energy. The provisions in the March 16 draft of the WBG ESS align with policy guidance from higher-income donor countries, including the United States. Criteria for new coal-fired power generation and brownfield coal retrofits are consistent with U.S. Treasury Guidance from December 2009. Greenhouse gas accounting follows mandates from the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009. The U.S. also supports large-scale hydropower projects with certain conditions. The March 16 draft of the WBG ESS has received positive reactions from environmental groups, with coal provisions being seen as a victory. However, concerns remain about possible loopholes in the strategy, such as undefined terms like \"brownfield\" and funding for emerging technologies that could indirectly support coal. Stakeholder engagement is desired to address environmental and social impacts of large dams and hydropower projects. The proposed Energy Sector Strategy before the World Bank Group Committee on Development Effectiveness and the Board of Executive Directors is a potential vehicle for the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Administration to address concerns regarding energy and infrastructure lending in lower-income countries and its effect on poverty alleviation and environmentally sustainable development. The final version of the ESS depends on negotiations in CODE and a subsequent vote by the Board of Executive Directors. This debate coincides with other institutional initiatives, including environmental and social safeguards, a new results-based lending platform, and a request for increases in the capital base. The final version of the Energy Sector Strategy (ESS) may impact negotiations on various initiatives at the World Bank Group (WBG), including environmental and social safeguards, a new results-based lending platform, and requests for capital base increases. The U.S. Congress plays a significant role in determining U.S. involvement in the WBG by setting contribution levels and influencing voting on policies and projects. The U.S. Congress plays a key role in managing WBG authorization legislation and appropriations. Legislative mandates can direct U.S. representatives on voting, advocating for policies, submitting reports, and influencing WBG policies. The U.S. Congress influences World Bank Group policies through funding decisions and attaching stipulations. The World Bank Group bases its lending on economic development levels. The U.S. Treasury Department provided guidance to multilateral development banks on engaging with developing countries on coal-fired power generation in 2009. The U.S. Treasury Department provided guidance to multilateral development banks in 2009 on engaging with developing countries on coal-fired power generation. The guidance covers a range of issues including alternatives analysis, power sector policy reform, and capacity building. It aims to supplement other MDB operational policies and help determine U.S. interactions with the MDBs as they update relevant sector strategies and operational policies. Key provisions include ensuring consideration of no or low carbon options before appraising coal-fired power projects and supporting the use of best internationally recognized practices. The guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2009 for multilateral development banks on coal-fired power generation includes considerations for no or low carbon options, best technology for reducing emissions, and offsetting actions for projects in different country categories."
