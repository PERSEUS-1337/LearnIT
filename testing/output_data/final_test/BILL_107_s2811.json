    "content": "The \"Emergency Forest Rescue Act of 2002\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that fire and land management policies have contributed to the increasing severity of wildfires. A large proportion of Federal forest land is in serious degradation due to diseased or dying trees caused by insect infestation, invasive plant species, and natural disasters. The drought conditions of 2002 are worsening the situation, making Federal forest land more susceptible to wildfires. The devastation caused by wildfires is a significant threat to both Federal forest land and communities located nearby. The combination of drought and diseased trees increases the severity of wildfires, posing a greater risk to public health and safety. It is crucial for Federal agencies managing forest land to have the authority to declare emergency mitigation areas. The authority can declare emergency mitigation areas on Federal forest land with dangerous tree buildup due to disease or natural disasters to reduce wildfire threats and protect nearby communities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"designee\" refers to the Chief of the Forest Service, the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, or the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. An \"emergency mitigation area\" is an area designated by the Secretary under section 4(a). \"Federal forest land\" includes any forest land under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. The \"Secretary\" is either the Secretary of Agriculture for Federal forest land under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service, or the Secretary for other Federal forest land. In the case of Federal forest land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Secretary of the Interior is responsible. SEC. 4. EMERGENCY MITIGATION AREAS. Designation of emergency mitigation areas on Federal forest land experiencing severe drought and tree mortality due to various factors is considered an emergency circumstance. The Secretary can request alternative arrangements, including timber harvesting, to protect the area. The Secretary of Agriculture or a designee can request alternative arrangements to protect trees in emergency mitigation areas from threats like disease, insect infestation, or natural disasters. They are exempt from certain requirements under the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act."
