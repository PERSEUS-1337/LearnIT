    "content": "Growing recognition of the crucial role that technological innovation plays in the U.S economy has led to increased congressional activity regarding intellectual property laws, particularly focusing on the operation of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Concerns have been raised about the USPTO's ability to process the large number of patent applications it receives, leading to a backlog of unexamined applications. Some experts suggest implementing \"deferred examination\" to help alleviate this issue. The USPTO reviews each patent application filed, unlike some foreign patent offices that require a request for examination. Deferred examination can be beneficial for inventors who may choose not to pursue patents due to various reasons. Deferred examination allows inventors to decide not to pursue patents, which helps the USPTO process applications faster. However, it can lead to marketplace uncertainty as firms may not know if their products will infringe on deferred patents. The report discusses the positive and negative consequences of deferred examination on innovation in the US and suggests design parameters for deferred examination systems. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to promote science and arts through patent protection. Inventors can apply for patents through the USPTO, with applications reviewed by examiners. Some applications are not published if the inventor opts out of foreign patent protection. Deferred examination speeds up the patent process but can create uncertainty in the marketplace. The report explores the impact of deferred examination on innovation and proposes guidelines for such systems. The USPTO examiner determines if an invention in a patent application meets legal requirements for a patent, including enabling others to make and use the invention without undue experimentation and disclosing the best mode of practicing it. The invention must also meet substantive standards set by the patent statute to be patentable. The invention must meet four primary requirements to be patentable: falling within a patentable subject matter category, being useful, novel, and nonobvious. The USPTO grants patent rights to exclude others from using the invention without permission. Infringers can be held liable for damages and may be enjoined from further infringement. Patent protection lasts for 20 years from the filing date. The patent term is based on the filing date, and the patentee gains enforceable legal rights once the USPTO allows the application to issue as a granted patent. Various provisions in the Patent Act can modify the 20-year term, including examination delays and delays in obtaining marketing approval. Patent owners must enforce their rights through litigation in federal courts, where issued patents have a presumption of validity. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, and the Supreme Court can review cases. The USPTO faces challenges due to the increasing number of patent applications, with an inventory of over 1.2 million applications awaiting review. The Supreme Court has discretionary authority to review cases from the Federal Circuit, which handles most patent appeals. The USPTO is experiencing long delays in reviewing patent applications, with an average wait time of 25.8 months in 2009 compared to 13.6 months in 2000. This backlog may worsen in the future, impacting high technology industries by creating uncertainty and devaluing patents, especially in fast-paced sectors like consumer electronics. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke criticized the lengthy patent approval process as unacceptable, causing problems for inventors and entrepreneurs. USPTO Director David Kappos highlighted the negative impact of patent application delays on inventors and entrepreneurs, stating that each delayed patent represents lost job opportunities. Current law allows for patent term extensions due to USPTO delays, potentially resulting in patents with terms exceeding 20 years. The USPTO has implemented initiatives to address the backlog of unexamined patent applications. The USPTO has hired many new examiners to address its backlog of unexamined patent applications, but the recent economic downturn has limited new hiring. The agency proposed rules in 2007 to reduce examination burdens by limiting the number of claims that could be filed. The USPTO proposed rules in 2007 to limit the number of claims and continued applications in patent applications. These rules were met with opposition and were ultimately rescinded in 2009. Recently, the USPTO announced a program to reduce the patent application backlog. The USPTO has a program to reduce the patent application backlog by allowing applicants to expedite the examination of one application by abandoning another. This program has seen limited participation as the agency explores new ways to manage the patent examination system. In 2009, the USPTO considered adopting deferred examination for patent applications. This system allows applicants to defer examination for up to 36 months by paying a $130 processing fee. Unlike the current system where patents are automatically reviewed, deferred examination requires applicants to make an affirmative request for examination. Deferred examination requires applicants to make an additional request for examination within a specified period, or the application is deemed abandoned. Many patent-granting nations use deferred examination, with some applicants never requesting examination. The number of unexamined applications increases with longer deferral periods. For example, the European Patent Office requires examination within six months of publishing the European Search Report. In contrast to the European Patent Office's six-month period for examination request, the Japan Patent Office operates under a three-year deferral period, resulting in a lower examination rate. The Canadian Intellectual Property Office also allows for a five-year deferral period, leading to a dropout rate of about 35% of filed applications. Other patent offices have reported similar dropout rates due to applicants choosing not to pursue their applications further. Dropout rates for patent applications can be influenced by various factors such as marketplace changes, regulatory developments, and technical advancements. Some inventors may find that their inventions do not meet patentability standards after reviewing a Search Report provided by patent offices. Lack of funding or being out of business can also lead to applicants abandoning their applications. The potential adoption of deferred examination in the U.S. has sparked controversy. The adoption of deferred examination in the U.S. is a controversial topic among patent professionals. Supporters believe it would reduce the workload for the USPTO by allowing inventors to abandon applications, freeing up resources for undeferred applications. The potential application dropout rate is uncertain, but some believe it could benefit the USPTO. Some observers believe that reducing the USPTO workload through deferred examination could be significant. Proponents argue that the US already operates under a de facto deferral regime due to increasing application pendency rates. Deferred examination is seen as beneficial for products subject to lengthy regulatory approval delays in the life sciences industry. The FDA approval process for drugs and medical devices is crucial before they can be sold to the public. Innovators may need to file a patent application early on to attract funding, but the final product design is uncertain until later. Delayed patent examination allows for better alignment with the final product design. Some products may not receive FDA approval, leading to unused patents. Deferred examination could optimize government resources for products that may not ultimately be approved. Deferred examination is a system used by leading patent offices for many years. Advocates believe it could optimize government resources for products that may not receive regulatory approval. However, there are concerns that it may increase uncertainty in the marketplace and not realize its intended benefits. Deferred examination could result in substantial claw back from the public domain when patents issue years after filing. There are concerns that some applicants may strategically manipulate the deferral system to obtain patent coverage of competitors' products, potentially leading to the emergence of \"submarine patents.\" Deferred examination in the USPTO has been a topic of debate, with concerns about the potential increase in unexamined applications and long examination pendencies. Some believe that implementing deferred examination could lead to further uncertainty in the system, while others argue that the high dropout rates seen in foreign systems may not be replicated in the United States. The United States is seen as a favorable market for patents due to its strong enforcement tradition. This may explain why there is low usage of deferred examination at the USPTO, with fewer than 200 applications deferred since 2000. Factors contributing to this low usage include lack of awareness of the provision and long application pendency rates. The potential impact of a deferred examination system on USPTO revenue is uncertain. AIPLA Executive Director Q. Todd Dickinson notes that the risk to income depends on fees, dropout rates, and loss of other fees. While lower initial filing fees could increase patent filings, inventors may be less careful in preparing applications. A deferred patent examination system may lead to an increase in poor-quality filings, raising concerns among some BIO members. Designers could manipulate system parameters to maximize advantages and minimize disadvantages, such as the period of deferral. Leading foreign patent offices offer varying maximum deferral periods. Leading foreign patent offices offer varying maximum periods of deferral, ranging from approximately two years at the European Patent Office to seven years at the German Patent and Trademark Office. Longer deferral periods may result in a higher number of applications not undergoing examination, leading to marketplace uncertainty. In deferral systems, the applicant typically requests examination, but some systems allow third parties to do so as well. If a third party activates this right, the applicant must either proceed with examination or abandon the application. Some commentators suggest imposing a fee to prevent abuses of activation rights in the patent application process. Designers of deferred examination systems must decide on the scope of application and whether deferral should be opt-in or opt-out. The current USPTO regulation allows for deferral on an opt-in basis, while foreign systems typically operate on an opt-out basis. Under current law, there is a discussion on whether deferred patent applications should be subject to different rules regarding publication. Some suggest that all deferred applications should be published to alert the public, regardless of pursuing foreign patents. This is important as a deferred application may not issue for many years after filing. The exception for domestic-only applications is being debated. The fee structure for deferred patent applications may be adjusted to align with USPTO policy goals. Patent attorney Robert J. Yarbrough suggests that deferred applicants should not pay higher fees and could even receive a discount. Another consideration is the impact of deferred examination on the patent term, which is currently 20 years from the filing date. Deferred examination at the USPTO can reduce the effective term of a patent, with one proposal suggesting a \"term neutral\" approach where each day of deferral results in a day of term extension. This could potentially extend the maximum term of a patent to 23 years from the filing date. No current system of deferred examination offers patent term extension in this manner. Some suggest patents from deferred applications should have \"intervening rights\" like amended patents. Congress has options for deferred examination in the U.S. patent system. Congress could introduce a statutory deferred examination regime into the U.S. patent system via legislation or allow the USPTO to enact regulations mandating deferred examination of patent applications. The USPTO has the authority to establish regulations governing proceedings, which could potentially be used to expand deferred examination regulations. An improved deferred examination system could be implemented through USPTO regulation, but uncertainty over procedural rulemaking authority may require congressional intervention. Proposed changes may be considered substantive, potentially limiting USPTO's ability to promulgate expanded regulations. The USPTO is facing challenges in processing a large number of patent applications due to the growing importance of intellectual property in the global economy. There is a discussion about adopting a deferred examination system, which is controversial domestically but accepted globally. It is uncertain whether this system would benefit innovation in the United States."
