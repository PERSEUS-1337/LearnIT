The Stock Raising Homestead Act is amended to require anyone other than the surface owner to file a notice and provide notice before exploring or locating mining claims on the lands subject to the Act. The Stock Raising Homestead Act is amended to require notice before exploring or locating mining claims on lands subject to the Act. During the authorized exploration period, individuals can enter lands for mineral activities causing minimal disturbance without using certain equipment or materials. The Stock Raising Homestead Act is amended to require individuals seeking to locate a mining claim on lands subject to the Act to file a notice of intention with the Secretary of the Interior. The notice must include the person's name, mailing address, and a legal description of the lands. This notice must be filed within 90 days of the initial filing date. The Stock Raising Homestead Act amendment requires individuals to file a notice of intention with the Secretary of the Interior within 90 days of the initial filing date. During this period, no other person can explore for minerals, locate a mining claim, or acquire any interest in the lands. If a plan of operations is filed within the 90-day period, it will be extended until approved or disapproved by the Secretary. Any person filing a notice of intention to locate a mining claim must provide written notice to the surface owner at least 30 days before entering the lands. The notice should include a description of the proposed mineral activities, a map and legal description of the lands, contact information for the person managing the activities, and the dates when the activities will take place. The total acreage for mining claim notices is limited to 6,400 acres per person and affiliates in one State, and 1,280 acres for a single surface owner. Written consent is required for mineral activities on a mining claim after the effective date of this subsection. The Secretary can authorize mineral activities on lands subject to the Act without surface owner consent if requirements are met, including posting a bond for reclamation. The Secretary can authorize mineral activities on lands subject to the Act without surface owner consent if requirements are met, including posting a bond for reclamation. This includes compensation for permanent damages to crops and tangible improvements, as well as compensation for permanent loss of income due to loss or impairment of grazing or other land uses. The bond amount for income loss considers the potential reduction in land value. Before authorization, a plan of operations must be submitted. When conducting mineral activities on lands subject to the Act, the Secretary requires a plan of operations that includes procedures for minimizing damages to crops and tangible improvements, minimizing disruption to grazing or other land uses, and payment of a fee for surface use equivalent to the loss of income to the ranch operation. The surface owner must receive a copy of the proposed plan at least 45 days before a determination is made, allowing for comments and recommendations. The Secretary must approve a proposed plan of operations within 60 days if it meets the requirements of the Act, including completeness, accuracy, and compliance with federal and state regulations. Any modifications required by the Secretary must be agreed upon by the submitter for approval. The Secretary must approve a proposed plan of operations within 60 days if it meets the requirements of the Act. The Secretary may extend the 60-day period if needed. The Secretary can suspend or revoke a plan if there is substantial noncompliance. Final approval of a plan of operations is required. Final approval of a plan of operations is conditioned upon compliance with specific requirements, including the payment of a fee to the surface owner based on factors such as acreage and potential disruption to existing surface uses. The fee cannot exceed the fair market value of the land. Reclamation of lands affected by mineral activities must be done to support their previous uses. State laws regarding reclamation, bonding, and environmental standards still apply. The right to enforce water resource interests affected by mineral activities is protected under applicable law. Surface owners can request inspections if they believe they are adversely affected by violations of approved operation plans. The Secretary must respond within 10 days, or immediately if imminent danger is alleged. The surface owner has the right to accompany inspectors during inspections. If the surface owner suffers damages due to unauthorized mineral activities or noncompliance with approved plans, they can take legal action in the United States. The surface owner has the right to take legal action in the United States district court for double damages plus costs for willful misconduct or gross negligence related to mineral activities on their land. Any damages awarded by the court can be reduced by compensation received through a bond or financial guarantee. The surface owner may also petition the Secretary for payment of a financial guarantee. The surface owner can petition the Secretary for compensation for damages or loss of income due to land use, using a bond or financial guarantee. The Secretary will release the bond upon successful completion of approved operations, and may simplify procedures for conveyance to the surface owner. The Secretary may simplify procedures for surface owners applying for title to US-owned lands. Definitions for mineral activities include exploration, mining, and beneficiation. Exploration locates mineral deposits, mining extracts minerals, and beneficiation involves crushing. The term 'beneficiation' refers to the crushing and grinding of mineral ore to separate the mineral from other constituents. A 'mining claim' is a claim under US mining laws subject to specific terms. 'Tangible improvements' include agricultural, residential, and commercial enhancements. These definitions apply to minerals not covered by the Mineral Leasing Act. The amendments made by this Act pertain to the Mineral Leasing Act, Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, and Materials Act of 1947. Section 9 of the Act of December 29, 1916 is amended. The effective date for these amendments is 180 days after enactment, with final regulations to be issued by the Secretary of the Interior by that date. The effective date for amendments made by this Act shall not be delayed by any appeal or judicial review. The Secretary of the Interior must report to Congress within 2 years on foreign firms acquiring mineral interests on lands governed by the Act of December 29, 1916. A \"foreign firm\" is defined as a business entity with over 51% foreign ownership."
