Alice Paul, born on January 11, 1885, dedicated her life to securing suffrage and equal rights for women. She founded the National Woman's Party and played a key role in passing the 19th Amendment. Paul and her party were the first to picket the White House, using nonviolent civil disobedience to bring attention to the women's suffrage movement. Alice Paul's courage during her 3-week hunger strike in jail inspired women to join the suffrage movement. She mobilized women to pressure Congress for the right to vote, drafted the Equal Rights Amendment, and successfully lobbied for gender inclusion in civil rights bills. Alice Paul, a key figure in the suffrage movement, founded the World Party for Equal Rights for Women in the 1930s and advocated for gender equality globally. She was influential in including a passage on gender equality in the United Nations Charter and is recognized for her significant impact on shaping US history.
