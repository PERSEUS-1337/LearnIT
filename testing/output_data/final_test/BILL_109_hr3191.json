    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Multilateral Debt Relief Act of 2005\". The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative was created in 1996 to reduce debt burden in impoverished countries. Donor countries have committed over $50 billion in debt cancellation. Countries receiving relief have increased poverty reduction expenditures by 75% on average. Congress has shown support for debt relief initiatives. Congress has demonstrated support for bilateral and multilateral debt relief through comprehensive initiatives enacted in 1999 and 2000. Several countries, including the United States, have canceled bilateral loans for countries eligible for debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. However, some countries will still owe substantial debts to international financial institutions. The Enhanced HIPC Initiative aims to cancel 100% of debt owed by eligible countries to multilateral institutions, allowing for increased investments in infrastructure and social programs to achieve sustainable economic growth and the Millennium Development Goals. On June 11, 2005, finance ministers from the Group of 8 proposed canceling $40 billion in debt owed by 18 countries immediately, with a total of $56 billion in debt canceled for 38 countries. This would save each country an average of $1.5 billion annually in debt service payments. Donors would provide additional resources to the World Bank and African Development Bank for grants and lending to the poorest countries for investments in health, education, and well-being. SEC. 3.
