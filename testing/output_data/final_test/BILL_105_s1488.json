FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that Adak Island, located 1,200 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, was reserved as a Preserve in 1913 for its natural and military values. Portions of the island were withdrawn for military purposes dating back to 1901, with approximately half withdrawn in 1959 for the Department of the Navy. By 1990, Adak Island supported a community of 6,000 residents. The Adak Naval Complex on Adak Island, which once supported a community of 6,000 residents, has been closed by the Department of Defense due to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The Aleut Corporation, representing the indigenous people of the Aleutian Islands, was unable to select any land on Adak Island under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Aleut Corporation is interested in establishing a community on Adak Island and has offered to exchange ANCSA land selections for certain lands on a portion of Adak formerly occupied by the Navy. This exchange would involve removing a portion of Adak Island land from refuge status, which will be offset by acquiring high-quality wildlife habitat in other Aleut Corporation selections within the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. This plan aims to maintain a resident human population on Adak to control caribou. It is in the public interest to promote reuse of Adak Island lands by exchanging certain lands for lands selected by The Aleut Corporation elsewhere in the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Experience with environmental problems associated with formerly used defense sites in the State of Alaska suggests that the most effective way to avoid future environmental problems on Adak is to support and encourage active reuse of Adak. The Agreement Concerning Transfer of Lands at Adak Naval Complex is ratified, confirmed, and approved by the United States. Additionally, lands are to be removed from the refuge as part of the agreement. SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM REFUGE: Upon conveyance to The Aleut Corporation of the Adak Exchange Lands, all such lands will be removed from the National Wildlife Refuge System. The lands will no longer be part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and will not be subject to laws pertaining to it. Conveyance restrictions under ANCSA will cease to apply, and the Refuge boundaries will be adjusted to exclude these lands and interests. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act states that lands exchanged under this act will be treated as conveyances under the Act, without constituting a sale or disposition of the received lands or interests."
