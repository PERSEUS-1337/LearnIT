The agency receives funds through various federal budget processes, including mandatory and discretionary appropriations, forward funds, and grants. Analyzing ED's budget requires an understanding of federal budget concepts. This report introduces key terms and concepts in the federal budget and appropriations process for the Department of Education (ED). It includes FAQs on federal funding for ED and education in general, along with links to additional resources. The focus is on funding through the annual appropriations process. The report introduces key terms and concepts in the federal budget process for the Department of Education (ED), focusing on funding through the annual appropriations process. It provides an overview of budget authority, obligation, and outlay in relation to federal funding for education. Financial obligations involving federal government funds rarely align in terms of budget authority, obligations, and outlays for a budget account. For example, in FY2017, the Education for the Disadvantaged account had $16.805 billion in budget authority, with $16.789 billion newly obligated and $16.237 billion in total outlays. Budget authority can only be provided through law enactment. Budget authority is specified by law, indicating the amount, purpose, and time period for its use. It can be for various purposes or specific ones, with defined or indefinite amounts. The time element sets a deadline for fund obligation. Agencies must legally obligate the budget authority by signing contracts or grant agreements. During a fiscal year, agencies can obligate budget authority provided in that year or earlier with a specific period of availability. Obligations must be made before the deadline, and outlays are only made when payments are due. The timing of obligations affects the total amount in a fiscal year, with salaries paid regularly and construction project outlays spread over several years. Budget authority can expire if not used within a specific period. Rescissions can repeal unobligated budget authority before it expires, eliminating outdated or undesirable purposes. Rescissions can repeal unobligated budget authority to eliminate outdated or undesirable purposes. The congressional budget process distinguishes between authorizations and appropriations, with authorization measures containing enabling or express authorizations of appropriations provisions. Understanding these distinctions is important for why programs with \"expired\" authorizations can still function. The distinction between appropriations and enabling authorizations is crucial for understanding why programs with \"expired\" authorizations can continue to function. Enabling authorizations define the government's authority to act, establish or alter federal agencies, programs, and policies. Authorization measures may also address organizational and administrative matters within departments. Authorization measures, under legislative committees like the House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, can be permanent or limited-term. Most ED authorizations are permanent, like Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This gives ED the authority to provide aid to disadvantaged children through local educational agencies. Unless repealed by Congress and the President, ED can distribute budget authority for such aid according to defined program parameters. Limited-term authorizations for programs end after a specified period of time, without requiring further legislative action. Some programs require regular legislative action as their authorities expire, while others are addressed as needed. Appropriations measures provide new budget authority annually for authorized agencies, programs, policies, and activities. Appropriations provide federal agencies with the authority to use allocated funds for specific program purposes. For example, the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated $71.4 billion to the Department of Education, with $22.5 billion designated for the Pell Grant program. Budget authority in appropriations can be for one fiscal year, multiple years, or indefinitely. Congress typically considers 12 regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year starting on October 1, along with continuing resolutions and supplemental appropriations. Most annual ED appropriations are included in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. An authorization of appropriations is a provision of law that recommends a funding level for a program or agency in a given fiscal year. It may include a range of fiscal years and specific funding levels for each year. For example, Section 1002 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 provides an explicit authorization of appropriations. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act, recommends a specific funding level for the Title I-A program in FY2019. An authorization of appropriations does not provide actual budget authority, but if appropriations are provided for programs with an expired authorization, federal agencies still have legal authority to operate them. An authorization of appropriations is a directive to Congress, which must be followed for discretionary appropriations. If an authorization lapses without renewal, subsequent appropriations may be considered unauthorized. The federal budget and appropriations process includes discretionary spending controlled by appropriations acts. This type of spending is for authorized programs and activities, with the budget determined annually by Congress. Discretionary spending programs do not require Congress to provide appropriations at authorized levels. For example, the Higher Education Act authorized $75 million for the Predominantly Black Institutions program, but actual appropriations were only $10.8 million in FY2010. Mandatory spending is controlled by authorizing acts and includes entitlement programs that require payments if specific criteria are met. The act sets program parameters and provides budget authority for programs, such as Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants. Mandatory spending occurs through a two-step process involving authorizing legislation and appropriations measures. The appropriations process provides budget authority for commitments, including appropriated mandatory spending. Congressional committees have limited control over the amount of budget authority provided for these programs. Funding is based on projections of costs for the fiscal year. Most ED line items in annual appropriations acts are discretionary, with some exceptions like Vocational programs. The appropriations process determines funding for federal programs, with most ED line items being discretionary. However, the Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants program is an exception as it is appropriated mandatory spending. Congress decides the total federal spending through a budget resolution, which is then divided among appropriations committees and subcommittees to allocate funding for agencies. This process is known as the 302(a) and 302(b) allocation process. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires Congress to adopt a budget resolution each fiscal year, establishing overall budgetary and fiscal policy. This resolution allocates federal spending among 20 functional categories and sets budget authority and outlay levels for each function. Total new budget authority and outlays are also allocated among committees with jurisdiction over spending within each chamber. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 mandates Congress to adopt a budget resolution annually, allocating federal spending among functional categories and setting budget authority levels. Spending ceilings, known as 302(a) allocations, are established for authorizing committees, including discretionary and mandatory spending. Appropriations committees then receive their spending ceilings and subdivide them among subcommittees as 302(b) suballocations for FY2019. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $1.2 trillion for discretionary budget authority and $955 billion for appropriated mandatory budget authority. The Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittee received $177 billion for discretionary budget authority and $783 billion for appropriated mandatory budget authority. Congressional allocations are for the upcoming fiscal year, including advance appropriations from previous years. The Department of Education budget and appropriations are reported using different units of time such as fiscal year, calendar year, academic year, and award year. It is important to consider the unit of time when comparing funding levels. The federal government uses the fiscal year (FY) to account for budgeted, appropriated, or spent funds, which runs from October 1 to September 30. The current year is the fiscal year in progress, the prior year is the one before, and outyears refer to future fiscal years. The federal fiscal year is the standard unit of time for congressional appropriations, different from the calendar year or academic year. Funding levels in ED budget documents may use various time units. Funding for federal programs in regular appropriations acts is typically available at the start of the fiscal year. Budget authority is typically available at the start of the fiscal year and may be obligated during that year unless specified otherwise. It can be provided for multiple fiscal years or with no fiscal year limitation. Carry forward allows budget authority from a previous fiscal year to be available for obligation in the next fiscal year. The concept of carry forward budget authority allows unobligated balances from a previous fiscal year to be available for obligation in the next fiscal year. This is different from advance appropriations and forward funding, where budget authority becomes available for obligation at a delayed point in time. Forward funding becomes available starting late in the budget year and extends into at least one following fiscal year. Federal accounts and programs may receive annual appropriations, advance appropriations, forward funding, or a mixed approach, with the most common being a combination of advance appropriations and forward funding in ED appropriations. The period of availability for budget authority in ED's accounts varies, with some receiving annual appropriations and others a mix of advance appropriations and forward funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established limits on discretionary spending and automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal budget deficit. Advance appropriations and forward funding are used to provide funds to recipients like schools, allowing them to plan and adjust to changes in federal funding levels. The Budget Control Act of 2011 sets limits on discretionary spending, with separate limits for defense and nondefense categories. Excess spending leads to sequestration, automatic budget cuts across the board. Sequestration is the automatic cancellation of budget authority through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs to comply with discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The revised limits for each fiscal year are calculated by OMB and reported with the President's budget submission, allowing time for congressional consideration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 sets discretionary spending limits each fiscal year, with OMB calculating revised limits for congressional consideration. Laws like the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 have increased these limits. Mandatory spending also faces reductions through sequestration, which differs from discretionary spending sequestration. Mandatory spending sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 automatically reduces spending each fiscal year, calculated by OMB. The reductions affect both defense and nondefense mandatory spending, including nonexempt budget authority at ED. The BCA impacts funding levels at ED by establishing caps on federal discretionary budget authority. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposes caps on federal discretionary budget authority, impacting funding levels at the Department of Education. If these caps are exceeded, discretionary budget authority at ED may be subject to sequestration. This sequestration has only occurred once in FY2013. Additionally, ED programs with nonexempt mandatory funding are subject to annual sequestration calculated by OMB based on the required savings percentage. For example, in FY2018, certain ED accounts were subject to nondefense mandatory sequestration. Debt Collection accounts were subject to nondefense mandatory sequestration, with a reduction of 6.6% in the past and 6.2% for FY2019. Sequestration cancels a certain dollar amount in each account based on sequesterable budgetary resources. Some programs like the Pell Grant program are exempt from sequestration. During mandatory spending sequestration, origination fees on federal student loans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program increase by the nondefense, mandatory sequestration percentage. It is important to consider pre- or post-sequestration funding levels when analyzing funding for ED accounts and programs. Transfer authority allows agencies to shift budget authority between accounts with statutory authority. Agencies are restricted from transferring funds between accounts without statutory authority. However, they can reallocate budget authority within an account through reprogramming. For example, in FY2016, the Department of Education shifted funds from one program to another using reprogramming authority. Appropriations subcommittees have oversight procedures for reprogramming actions. In FY2019, the Department of Education had specific reprogramming requirements outlined in the appropriations act. These requirements included consultation with appropriations committees and written notification before reprogramming funds. The Department distributes grant funds through mathematical formulas or merit-based competitions. For example, the Title I, Part A program uses a formula based on school-age children in poverty and state per-pupil expenditures. The Innovative Approaches to Literacy program is a merit-based competitive grant program that awards points based on specific criteria. Policy debates on education funding often revolve around block grants versus categorical grants, with block grants being general grants awarded to states through a formula-based process for various purposes. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, amended by ESSA, authorized a new block grant program at ED called \"Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants\" for various educational purposes. Categorical grants, on the other hand, are more specific and may be distributed through formula or competition, like the Carol M. White Physical Education program. The Student Support and Academic Enrichment block grant, a competitively awarded categorical grant under ESSA, may require matching funds from awardees. These matching contributions can be in cash or in-kind, and must meet a certain percentage of the federal award amount. The Federal Work-Study program provides 75% funding for part-time employment of needy college students, with institutions required to provide the remaining 25%. The ED's annual budget includes discretionary and mandatory spending, with approximately $71 billion in budget authority in FY2019. Three-quarters of these funds were distributed to local educational agencies and low-income postsecondary students through programs like Pell Grants. The Department of Education (ED) receives funding for various programs, including student loan subsidies, with about $2.5 billion in net funding in FY2019. The total budget can fluctuate due to the varying costs of student loan subsidies. The definition of \"education spending\" and the timing of budget estimates can impact the reported federal funding for educational purposes. The federal government categorizes education funding by Treasury Department function code and tracks it in ED's Digest of Education Statistics. Funding for education overlaps with funding for the Department of Education (ED), but they are not the same. Federal education funding is categorized under function 500, which includes subfunctions like elementary, secondary, vocational education, higher education, research, general education aids, training, employment, and social services. Simply adding the totals for elementary and higher education subfunctions does not capture all federal funding for education. Other subfunctions like research, general education aids, and training and employment also contribute to federal education spending. Additionally, subfunction 506 includes ED's Rehabilitation Services and Disability Research Account. Only a portion of total outlays for subfunctions 501 and 502 were spent by ED, with other agencies like the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health also providing federal funds for educational programs. Some ED programs are classified under different functional categories, such as the Office for Civil Rights. The National Center for Education Statistics tracks federal funding for education in the Digest of Education Statistics, which includes data on federal support broken down by program. The education funding tables show federal support for education, including research grants to universities. In FY2017, the federal government provided $228.4 billion in direct budget authority for education, with a total of $322.6 billion including nonfederal funds. The ED congressional budget justifications are available on the department's website, and appropriations for ED accounts are typically included in annual appropriations acts. The Congressional Research Service tracks these acts. The Congressional Research Service tracks annual appropriations acts, including related bills and committee reports. The budget resolution sets procedural parameters for spending legislation, enforceable by points of order, but does not provide actual funding for specific departments like the Department of Education. Funding assumptions for education in the budget resolution cannot be determined by CRS due to allocation by congressional committee rather than by department. The Congressional Research Service cannot determine the assumed amount of funding for the Department of Education through congressional allocations, as they are based on functional categories that do not directly correspond to education-related purposes. Without specific information from the House or Senate budget committees, CRS cannot determine funding amounts for education assumed by the budget resolution. Funding levels in appropriations bills are determined by the force of law. The force of law is central to funding levels in House and Senate appropriations bills. Once enacted, these funding levels become legally binding, providing a basis for agencies to use the allocated funds. Appropriations acts carry the force of law, while committee recommendations in reports are not typically legally binding. Report language in appropriations acts is not legally binding but agencies usually comply with it as it reflects congressional intent. It supplements legislative text during the appropriations process, often reconciling conflicting language and providing additional instructions through a joint explanatory statement. The Joint Explanatory Statement (JES) accompanies the conference report for appropriations measures, providing additional instructions and reconciling conflicting language. It may serve a similar purpose as report language when differences are resolved through an amendment exchange. In some cases, an explanatory statement from an appropriations committee is entered into the Congressional Record during the legislative process. When federal education funding is provided through a continuing resolution (CR), planned changes may be delayed. The Department of Education (ED) has limited obligations until the full fiscal year budget is enacted. The effects of a funding lapse, including agency shutdown, depend on various factors. The effects of a funding lapse for the Department of Education (ED) depend on factors such as available budget authority, staff furloughs, grant cycle timing, and alternative funding sources. Most of ED's program authorizations are permanent, mitigating the impact of a lapse. Program authorizations are typically permanent unless they include a sunset provision or are repealed by legislation. Even if the authorization of appropriations has expired, the program can continue as long as Congress funds it. Authorization of appropriations does not act as a sunset provision, but an expired authorization may lead to a point of order during appropriations consideration.
