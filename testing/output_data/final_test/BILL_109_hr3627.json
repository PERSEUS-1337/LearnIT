    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rapid Pathogen Identification to Delivery of Cures Act\". The Congress acknowledges the potential threat of terrorists using biotechnology to enhance biological agents, which could undermine current diagnostic and immune response strategies. The advancement of biotechnology may increase this risk over time, while natural processes can also lead to the emergence of harmful pathogens. The development of new drugs and vaccines for pathogens is slow and costly, taking 10 to 20 years and $800 million on average. Congress has authorized the abridgement of the approval process during severe outbreaks, but it still takes years. There is a lack of coordinated research and development program to quickly develop new biodefense medical countermeasures against pathogens. Existing technologies are not being utilized effectively to screen drug candidates and manufacture treatments. Private sector firms are shifting away from innovation in infectious disease research towards more profitable medical markets. Public-private investment could significantly reduce the time needed to develop new countermeasures, as the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are quick to integrate new technologies. The Congress declares the national policy to promote technological advancements for faster development of new medical countermeasures to treat infectious diseases. The Congress declares the national policy to promote technological advancements for rapid development of new medical countermeasures to treat infectious diseases, as outlined in the Rapid Biodefense Countermeasures Development National Strategy. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the Rapid Pathogen Identification to Delivery of Cures Act enactment, outlining a strategy to shorten the timeframe for developing and approving priority countermeasures against new pathogens. The report should address technical obstacles, research needs, and clinical research requirements. The report to Congress must identify existing research efforts in various sectors and facilities that can be utilized to address research, development, technology, and clinical research needs. The report to Congress must identify existing research efforts in various sectors and facilities that can be utilized to address research, development, technology, and clinical research needs. This includes proposals for a coordinated federal program involving biotechnology companies, consortia, foreign research institutions, resource allocation, interagency coordination, partnerships between private and federal entities, and information sharing mechanisms. The national strategy under subsection (a) should include considerations such as promoting private sector participation, adjusting regulatory requirements for innovation, addressing liability concerns for distributing countermeasures, and managing technology transfer and intellectual property rights. The national strategy should address research, development, and technology needs for pathogen identification and countermeasure discovery, including initial pathogen characterization, countermeasure discovery, pre-clinical testing, and safety and efficacy animal testing for accelerated approval under emergency conditions. The curr_chunk discusses the need for evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of new drugs when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. It includes topics such as safety and efficacy human testing, manufacturing processes, approval of priority countermeasures under emergency conditions, and the importance of advanced technologies like automation and bioinformatics. The Secretary may contract with firms for research on bioinformatics, pharmacogenomics, and bioengineering techniques for manufacturing priority countermeasures. The focus is on ensuring sufficient manufacturing capacity and promoting national and international collaborative research networks for rapid development and sharing of research results. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as emergency conditions, pathogen identification, and priority countermeasure. Additionally, $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006 for carrying out the provisions outlined. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a system for rapid clinical research on new treatments for pathogens. An emergency fund will be available for this purpose. Additionally, an interagency working group will be formed. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish an interagency working group to carry out the requirements of the Act, including representatives from various government departments, agencies, and the private sector. Additionally, the Act aims to develop the capability for rapid biodefense countermeasure development. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include the development of rapid countermeasures against pathogens or toxins. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 is also amended to include research, development, and procurement. The program aims to rapidly develop and produce countermeasures against new pathogens or toxins for emergency use when existing options are not safe or effective. The program aims to develop the capability for rapid biodefense countermeasure development against novel pathogens or toxins in emergency situations."
