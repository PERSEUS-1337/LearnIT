    "content": "The doctrine of federal preemption, based on the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, states that federal law supersedes state law. Proponents argue for uniform regulations, while opponents value policy experimentation at the state level. The Supreme Court has identified two ways federal law can preempt state law: expressly with explicit language in the federal statute or regulation, and impliedly when Congress' command is implicitly contained in the federal law's structure and purpose. This is based on the doctrine of federal preemption, which states that federal law supersedes state law. Implied preemption includes \"field preemption\" where federal regulation is pervasive, and \"conflict preemption\" where state law conflicts with federal objectives. In Hines v. Davidowitz, the Court ruled that a federal law preempted a state statute imposing additional requirements on aliens. The purpose of federal banking laws is to protect the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens through a uniform national registration system. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has rules that expressly preempt certain state laws for federally chartered banks. The National Bank Act (NBA) impliedly preempts state laws that interfere with a national bank's powers. Federal preemption of state banking laws is based on the ultimate purpose of Congress. Federal preemption of state banking law is complex due to the dual banking system in the US, which divides chartering authority between federal and state governments. Banks can choose between a national charter from the OCC or a state charter. The decision is influenced by factors such as federal preemption benefits and regulatory simplicity. The choice of chartering authority for banks in the US is influenced by various factors such as federal preemption benefits, regulatory simplicity, and supervisory fees. The OCC serves as the primary regulator for national banks, while state banking authorities regulate state-chartered banks. National banks must also become members of the Federal Reserve System for monetary policy regulation and financial system stability. The Federal Reserve System (FRS) regulates the safety of the financial system, with membership requiring supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. National banks must obtain deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and adhere to powers granted by Congress, including discounting promissory notes, receiving deposits, and loaning money. Federal court rulings have identified around 80 specific activities for national banks. Federal court and administrative rulings have identified roughly 80 specific activities falling within the \"incidental powers\" of national banks. National banks are not entirely immune from state law, as long as it does not conflict with federal law or hinder their ability to fulfill federal duties. They are subject to state laws in their daily business operations, including contracts, property transactions, debt collection, and liability. State banking laws allow state-chartered banks to engage in similar activities as national banks, as long as they do not regulate activities authorized for national banks under federal law. State banks are subject to federal laws, including tax and consumer laws, despite receiving their powers from state law. State-chartered banks are subject to federal tax, consumer protection, and antidiscrimination laws, in addition to any federal laws applicable to them by virtue of their membership in the FRS or supervision by the FDIC. Membership in the FRS offers benefits such as reputational advantages and access to the Federal Reserve's \"discount window\" for temporary liquidity needs. All state-chartered banks must obtain FDIC insurance, with the FDIC serving as the main federal regulator for state banks not in the FRS. Regulatory competition between state regulatory agencies and the OCC for bank charters has been ongoing since the dual banking system's inception. Some argue that regulatory competition in the dual banking system prevents unresponsive regulation, while others criticize it for promoting a \"race to the bottom\" in regulatory standards. Critics also point out that state bank access to FDIC insurance can create moral hazard and lead to anticompetitive restrictions on entry into the banking industry. Certain state banking authorities compete with the OCC by granting state-chartered banks powers not available to national banks. In the dual banking system, state banks can compete with national banks by granting additional powers, such as insurance underwriting and real estate activities. Some state banks have converted to national charters due to regulatory dissatisfaction. Over time, regulatory treatment of national and state banks has become more similar, with both required to obtain FDIC insurance. This convergence has been driven by regulations like Section 24 of FDICIA, which restricts certain activities of FDIC-insured state banks. Section 24 of FDICIA restricts activities of FDIC-insured state banks, unifying state and federal banking systems. Some states have \"wild card statutes\" granting state banks national bank activities, with varying requirements. Some states have \"wild card statutes\" that allow state banks to engage in national bank activities, which can override conflicting state laws. Federal statutes also preempt state laws to eliminate differential regulatory treatment for state and national banks, as seen in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First Omaha Services Corporation. In Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First Omaha Services Corporation, the Court ruled that a national bank located in Nebraska could charge its Minnesota customers higher interest rates than allowed by Minnesota law, based on the bank's home state laws. This decision led to Congress extending the same power to state banks to \"export\" maximum interest rates from their home state. Preemptive statutes allow banks to set maximum interest rates based on their home state laws, promoting regulatory parity for state and national banks. Branch banking has evolved, with most states now allowing banks to operate anywhere within the state. The McFadden Act of 1927 and the Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997 ensure competitive parity between state and national banks for intrastate and interstate branching. In the early 1990s, some states began allowing interstate branching on a reciprocal basis. In 1994, the Riegle-Neal Act authorized interstate branching for both national and state banks, establishing a federal statutory scheme. The Act treated state and national banks differently regarding which state laws governed a bank's branches. In 1997, Congress passed the Riegle-Neal Amendments to address concerns about the dual banking system. These amendments specified that state bank branches are subject to host state laws to the same extent as branches of out-of-state national banks. The key issue in banking law preemption is the extent to which federal law overrides state laws that interfere with national banks' powers. The Supreme Court ruled that federal banking law preempts state laws that significantly interfere with a national bank's powers. In Barnett Bank, the Court found that a state law prohibiting banks from selling insurance in small towns conflicted with a federal statute granting national banks the authority to do so. The Court reasoned that Congress would not want states to hinder powers explicitly granted to national banks. The Supreme Court's ruling in Barnett Bank established that federal banking law preempts state laws that interfere with national banks' powers. Lower courts have generally followed this rule, stating that federal statutes and regulations granting specific powers to national banks override state laws that prohibit or significantly interfere with those activities. The Supreme Court's Barnett Bank ruling established that federal banking law preempts state laws that interfere with national banks' powers. Lower courts have upheld this principle, allowing national banks to charge non-interest fees despite state statutes prohibiting such fees in certain circumstances. For example, in Monroe Retail, Inc. v. RBS Citizens, N.A., the Sixth Circuit held that OCC regulations preempted state law conversion claims against national banks for fees charged for processing garnishment orders. The courts reasoned that state laws interfering with national banks' fee collection abilities are preempted under the National Banking Act. The Ninth Circuit applied similar reasoning in Rose v. Chase Bank USA, N.A., holding that an NBA provision preempted state statutes imposing disclosure requirements on credit card issuers. Federal courts have broadly interpreted NBA provisions, such as authorizing national banks to dismiss officers \"at pleasure,\" preempting state law claims for wrongful discharge. The Ninth Circuit has held that the \"at pleasure\" provision in the NBA preempted a claim for breach of an employment agreement by a former national bank officer. Federal courts have taken expansive views on state laws that significantly interfere with national banks' powers, but not all state laws affecting national banks have been found to be preempted. In Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, the Ninth Circuit found that certain state laws affecting national banks survive preemption under Barnett Bank. The case involved Wells Fargo's use of \"high-to-low\" posting for debit card transactions, leading to state law claims alleging the bank aimed to maximize overdraft fees. The court ruled that OCC regulations preempted some, but not all, of the plaintiffs' claims. The court in Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA found that certain state laws affecting national banks survive preemption under Barnett Bank. The court ruled that OCC regulations preempted some claims related to Wells Fargo's posting method but allowed claims based on misleading statements about the method to proceed. The Ninth Circuit allowed misrepresentation claims against national banks to proceed, rejecting preemption arguments. The court found that prohibiting fraudulent representations did not hinder the banks' authority or efficiency. Additionally, a provision in the NBA regarding visitorial powers has been central in Supreme Court decisions on federal preemption of state laws. The Supreme Court has been involved in major decisions regarding federal preemption of state banking law, including Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A. in 2007. The case dealt with preemption of state requirements for national bank operating subsidiaries, with Wachovia Mortgage seeking relief against Michigan's Office of Financial and Insurance Services. The Court upheld an injunction against the OFIS, emphasizing the limitations on state regulatory powers over national banks. The Supreme Court affirmed a lower court injunction against the OFIS, stating that state law should focus on a bank's powers, not its structure. Duplicative state regulation would burden national banks, including their subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act later overturned Watters' ruling on state examination of national bank subsidiaries. In Cuomo v. Clearing House Association, L.L.C., the Supreme Court ruled that state law enforcement actions against national banks are not preempted by the NBA's provision on \"visitorial powers.\" The case involved the NYAG requesting information from national banks to investigate potential violations of state fair lending laws, which was challenged by the OCC and a banking trade group. The relevant OCC regulation interpreted the NBA's restriction on \"visitorial powers\" as limiting state officials from enforcing actions against national banks, except in specific circumstances. The Supreme Court ruled that state law enforcement actions against national banks are not preempted by the NBA's provision on \"visitorial powers.\" This distinction allows states to pursue law enforcement actions against national banks, separate from the OCC's oversight powers. The interpretation of \"visitorial powers\" does not include judicial actions to enforce state law against national banks. This decision clarifies the limits of OCC regulations and state enforcement authority over national banks. The OCC's authority to regulate national banks has been recognized by Congress in the 1994 Riegle-Neal Act, granting the OCC the power to preempt state laws that may have a discriminatory effect on national bank branches. The OCC has taken a broad view of federal banking regulations, sparking controversy. The OCC has taken an expansive view of federal banking law preemption, issuing interpretive letters and legal opinions in the 1990s and early 2000s. They asserted that federal law preempted state laws limiting national banks in various activities. In 2004, the OCC issued sweeping preemption rules in response to state laws targeting subprime and predatory lending. In 2004, the OCC issued rules preempting state officials from conducting examinations or enforcement actions against national banks, except as authorized by federal law. Additionally, the OCC established a preemption standard stating that state laws hindering national banks' federally authorized powers are not applicable, unless mandated by federal law. The OCC's rule clarified that national banks are exempt from state laws except where applicable by Federal law. The rule identified specific categories of state laws preempted under the NBA related to real estate lending, non-real estate lending, and deposit-taking powers of national banks. The OCC's rule clarified that national banks are exempt from state laws except where applicable by Federal law. It identified specific categories of state laws preempted under the NBA related to real estate lending, non-real estate lending, and deposit-taking powers of national banks. The rule outlined various aspects of real estate lending that national banks are allowed to engage in, such as loan-to-value ratios, terms of credit, escrow accounts, security property, and access to credit reports. It also addressed non-real estate loans and specified that national banks may make such loans without regard to state law limitations on certain matters. The OCC rule clarified that national banks are exempt from state laws except where applicable by Federal law. It outlined specific categories of state laws preempted under the NBA related to real estate lending, non-real estate lending, and deposit-taking powers. The rule also identified areas where national banks could exercise deposit-taking powers without regard to state law limitations. The OCC's 2004 preemption rules, criticized after the 2008 financial crisis, allowed national banks to operate without state interference in certain areas like real estate lending. Critics debate the impact of preemption on the crisis. In response to concerns over federal preemption of state consumer protection laws, Congress included provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. Critics argue that national banks' role in predatory lending did not significantly contribute to the financial crisis, while others believe preemption limited states' ability to regulate such practices. Section 1044 of Dodd-Frank establishes a standard for preempting state consumer financial laws. Section 1044 of Dodd-Frank sets rules for preempting state consumer financial laws, defining them as laws that regulate financial transactions without discriminating against national banks. Preemption only occurs if the state law discriminates against national banks compared to state-chartered banks. Section 1044 of Dodd-Frank outlines the criteria for preempting state consumer financial laws, stating that preemption can occur if the state law hinders the powers of national banks. Preemption determinations can be made by the Comptroller of the Currency on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with applicable law. Section 1044 of Dodd-Frank outlines the criteria for preempting state consumer financial laws, stating that preemption can occur if the state law hinders the powers of national banks. When determining if a state law has substantively equivalent terms as one being preempted, the Comptroller must consult with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Obama Administration's proposed financial reforms aimed to eliminate NBA preemption of state consumer protection laws, but a modified version introduced by Representative Barney Frank in December 2009 allowed for preemption if the OCC found certain conditions were met. The proposed legislation modified by Representative Melissa Bean added the words \"materially impair[]\" to reflect the Barnett Bank v. Nelson case, establishing the preemption standard for national banks. This change aimed to ensure that state consumer financial laws do not significantly interfere with a national bank's ability to engage in banking. The proposed bill, modified by Representative Bean, aimed to align the preemption standard for national banks with the Barnett Bank v. Nelson case. The bill passed the House in 2009 but was later substituted by the Senate to ensure that preemption determinations are made in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in Barnett Bank v. Nelson. The Senate Banking Committee intended to undo broader standards adopted by rules. The proposed bill aimed to align the preemption standard for national banks with the Barnett Bank v. Nelson case. After amendments, the Senate passed the bill in May 2010. A modified version was reported back by a House-Senate conference committee, adding language to the preemption provision. The bill revised the standard for preempting state consumer protection laws and codified the Barnett Bank preemption standard. Senator Carper interpreted the modified provision as maintaining the Barnett Bank standard, while Senator Dodd responded to his interpretation during Senate consideration. Senator Christopher Dodd confirmed Senator Carper's interpretation of Section 1044, stating that the legislation codifies the preemption standard set by the U.S. Supreme Court in Barnett Bank. Senator Timothy Johnson also supported this view, reading the bill's preemption provision as codifying the same standard. The reconciled bill passed the House in June 2010, and was later signed by President Obama in July. Commentators have debated the scope of Section 1044, with some believing it sets a more restrictive preemption standard than the OCC's previous language, while others argue it simply codifies the Barnett Bank decision. In 2011, the OCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking reaffirming its pre-Dodd-Frank preemption decisions, proposing to remove language that created ambiguities in its 2004 preemption rules. George W. Madison, the General Counsel of the Department of the Treasury, responded to the OCC's proposed rules. George W. Madison, the General Counsel of the Department of the Treasury, expressed concern about the OCC's proposed rule, stating it could preempt state laws in violation of Section 1044's requirement for \"case-by-case\" determinations. Senator Carl Levin also disagreed with the rules, arguing that Congress did not intend to expand the OCC's preemptive powers. Senator Levin disagreed with the broad interpretation of Section 1044, arguing that Congress did not intend to expand the OCC's preemptive powers. Senators Carper and Mark Warner criticized the reasoning in Madison's letter to Secretary Geithner. In response to Senator Levin's disagreement with the interpretation of Section 1044, Senators Carper and Warner criticized Madison's reasoning in a letter to Secretary Geithner. They argued that the OCC's proposed rule would revise its preemption standards by removing certain language. The OCC ultimately agreed with Senators Carper and Warner, rejecting arguments from Madison and Senator Levin, and published a final regulation in July 2011. The OCC concluded that the Dodd-Frank Act did not create a new preemption standard but rather incorporated conflict preemption legal principles. The OCC's final rule on preemption standards incorporated conflict preemption legal principles from the Barnett decision. It removed certain language and emphasized the need for case-by-case determinations. Courts have supported the OCC's interpretation that Section 1044 codifies the Barnett Bank standard for preemption. In Baptista v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Eleventh Circuit interpreted Section 1044 as codifying the Barnett Bank test for conflict preemption under the Dodd-Frank Act. District courts have also supported this interpretation, stating that Section 1044 did not significantly change pre-Dodd-Frank preemption law. Section 1044 also addresses OCC preemption determinations, stating that courts should give the OCC Skidmore deference when reviewing its interpretations of statutes. Skidmore deference is less permissive than Chevron deference, with courts deferring to agency interpretations if they are reasonable. A recent study found agency interpretations more likely to prevail under Chevron deference. Section 1044 states that OCC preemption determinations should be given Skidmore deference when reviewing interpretations of statutes. The legal standard established by Barnett Bank regarding preemption provisions requires \"substantial evidence\" to support agency rules and determinations. This standard, which is more than a mere scintilla of evidence, contrasts with the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard for informal rulemakings. The Supreme Court has clarified that agency actions would be considered arbitrary and capricious if factors not intended by Congress are relied upon. The legal standard for preemption provisions requires \"substantial evidence\" to support agency rules and determinations, not just a scintilla of evidence. Courts have found that the distinction between the substantial evidence test and the arbitrary and capricious test is largely semantic. Section 1044 mandates the OCC to periodically review determinations of federal law preempting state consumer financial laws through public notice and comment. Section 1044 of Federal law requires the OCC to periodically review preemption determinations, publish decisions in the Federal Register, and submit reports to Congress. It ensures that State consumer financial laws are not preempted for subsidiaries, affiliates, or agents of national banks. The Dodd-Frank Act allows states to supervise and regulate national bank subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents not chartered as national banks. Section 1041 of Dodd-Frank exempts state consumer protection laws from federal preemption, stating that state laws must be followed unless they conflict with federal laws. Section 1041 of the Dodd-Frank Act allows states to regulate national bank subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents. It exempts state consumer protection laws from federal preemption, stating that state laws must be followed unless they conflict with federal laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may determine if a state law is inconsistent with federal provisions. The scope of Section 1041's savings clause has not been interpreted by any court yet. The Trump Administration and Congress prioritize financial regulatory reform. In June 2017, the House of Representatives passed the Financial CHOICE Act. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, passed by the House of Representatives in June 2017, includes a provision related to banking preemption. Section 581 of the Act aims to override the Second Circuit's decision in Madden v. Midland Funding LLC regarding the enforcement of interest rates on loans sold to third parties. The Second Circuit rejected the defendant debt purchasers' argument that New York usury law was preempted by the National Bank Act (NBA) because the debt originated by a national bank in Delaware. The court held that since the debt purchasers were not national banks or acting on their behalf, New York usury law could still apply to them. The Supreme Court denied the Madden case. The Supreme Court denied the Madden defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari in June 2016, and the OCC has indicated it does not intend to issue an interpretive opinion on the application of New York usury law to debt purchasers. The Senate's consideration of the Financial CHOICE Act and the role of banking preemption in financial regulatory reform debates remain uncertain. Federal preemption and the interplay between state and federal banking law will continue to be important considerations in Congress's discussions on prudential bank regulation, financial stability, and consumer protection."
