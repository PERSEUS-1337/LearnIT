    "content": "The U.S. agricultural sector heavily relies on trade, with exports contributing to about 20% of total production. The farm bill, renewed every five to six years, includes farm income and commodity price support programs. The current omnibus farm bill is the Agricultural Act of. The current omnibus farm bill, the Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79), made significant changes to the previous farm safety net. Most provisions will remain in effect until September 30, 2018. The U.S. may replace the current farm bill with new legislation, extend it temporarily, or revert to \"permanent law\" from the 1930s and 1940s. The most recent WTO notification on domestic support outlays was for the 2012 crop year under the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill is subject to constraints from the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements on agriculture and trade. The AoA and SCM agreements set limits on market-distorting policies and allow for challenges to domestic support programs found in violation of WTO rules. Successful challenges could lead to the elimination or alteration of the program by Congress. The 2008 farm bill is subject to constraints from the WTO agreements on agriculture and trade. Compliance with WTO rules can prevent trade disputes, requiring new legislation for changes. The AoA sets rules on domestic subsidies, aiming to avoid challenges to U.S. commitments under the WTO. The WTO's AoA sets rules on domestic farm policies to promote open trade by categorizing and restricting agricultural support programs based on their market-distorting potential. Amber box subsidies are subject to spending limits, while more benign outlays are exempted under green box, blue box, de minimis, or special exemptions. The AoA provides detailed guidelines for classifying programs to comply with WTO regulations. The WTO's AoA categorizes agricultural support programs into Green Box, Blue Box, and Amber Box based on their trade-distorting potential. Green Box programs are non-trade distorting, Blue Box programs are production-limiting, and Amber Box programs are market-distorting with strict spending limits. The United States has a spending limit of $19.1 billion for Amber Box programs, with de minimis exemptions. The WTO's AoA categorizes agricultural support programs into Green Box, Blue Box, and Amber Box based on their trade-distorting potential. Amber Box programs have a spending limit of $19.1 billion with de minimis exemptions. De minimis exemptions are limited by 5% of the value of production and include domestic support spending that is deemed benign. Prohibited programs include certain types of export and import subsidies and non-tariff trade barriers. The most recent U.S. notification to the WTO of its domestic farm program spending is provided in the Appendix. The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) outlines rules for determining prohibited and actionable subsidies in U.S. farm programs. The key aspect of SCM commitments is the degree of market distortion caused by domestic support programs. Criteria for significant market distortions include the subsidy's share of farmer returns or production costs and the commodity's importance in world markets. The SCM evaluates the market distortion of a program or policy in terms of its measurable effects on international trade and market prices for the affected commodity. It assesses if the subsidy displaces imports, impedes exports, leads to price suppression, undercutting, or lost sales, and increases the world market share of the subsidizing member. Under the SCM, a WTO dispute settlement panel reviews challenged farm programs for market distortion. Prohibited subsidies must be stopped immediately, while actionable subsidies must be altered to minimize distortion. The DSU provides a framework for resolving disputes among WTO members. The DSU provides a process for resolving disputes among WTO members, with panels examining complaints and the possibility of retaliation for non-compliance. The United States has been involved in a significant number of complaints under the DSU, with the USTR representing the country in WTO disputes. The US is committed to limiting trade-distorting support under the AoA. The WTO's AoA procedures for classifying trade-distorting support are complex. Four questions help determine if a farm measure exceeds the $19.1 billion AMS limit. A fifth question checks if AoA-compliant outlays are SCM-compliant. Policies can be classified as \"green box\" or \"blue box\" to avoid AMS counting. \"Amber box\" policies may still be excluded under the 5% de minimis exemption. The WTO's AoA procedures for classifying trade-distorting support are complex. If support exceeds the 5% de minimis exemption, it may be subject to challenge under SCM rules. Green box spending has no limits and is considered minimally trade-distorting. Programs must meet specific criteria to qualify for exemption in the green box. To qualify for exemption in the green box, a program must be publicly funded and not provide price support to producers. It must also comply with specific criteria related to the program itself, such as not involving direct payments to producers or processors. These programs can include research, pest control, training, inspection services, marketing, and promotion. The curr_chunk discusses various aspects of food security programs, including safety, grading, standardization, marketing, promotion services, infrastructure, public acquisition, stockholding, domestic food aid, and income support eligibility criteria. It emphasizes the importance of financial transparency and clear eligibility criteria for these programs. Government financial participation in income insurance or safety net programs should define eligibility based on agricultural income loss exceeding 30% of average gross income in the preceding three-year period. Payments should compensate for less than 70% of income loss and be based solely on income, not production, price, or inputs. Total annual payments, including natural disaster relief, cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Eligibility for natural disaster relief payments should be based on formal criteria. Government criteria for natural disaster relief payments include eligibility based on formal recognition of the disaster and payments determined by a production loss exceeding 30% in the preceding three-year period. Payments are limited to losses of income, livestock, land, or other production factors and cannot exceed total replacement cost. Total annual payments, including income insurance, cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Structural adjustment programs for producer retirement or resource retirement must have clearly defined criteria. Structural adjustment programs involve removing land, livestock, or resources from production with payments conditioned on specific criteria. Payments are not tied to production type/quantity or prices, and investment aids are based on clearly defined criteria for restructuring operations. Payments cannot be linked to production volume or prices after a base period and are provided for a limited time. Environmental and regional assistance program payments are limited to compensate for structural disadvantages and must meet specific program conditions. Eligibility is determined as part of a government environmental or conservation program, with payments dependent on compliance with program requirements. Regional assistance is only provided to producers in a designated disadvantaged geographic region. Payments for regional assistance programs are limited to compensate for structural disadvantages in designated disadvantaged regions. The payments must meet specific program conditions and are exempt from AMS if they meet certain criteria. The blue box exemption allows for unlimited spending on production-limiting programs with specific conditions. If the conditions are not met, the policy is considered an amber box policy and subject to the 5% de minimis rate. Developed countries do not have to count certain payments towards their total AMS. The de minimis exclusions allow members, including the United States, to exclude small-cost amber box programs from their total AMS calculations. Product-specific domestic support must not exceed 5% of the total value of production of a basic agricultural product. For example, the 2012 U.S. corn crop had a value of $74.3 billion, with corn-specific AMS outlays of $2.7 billion, below the 5% threshold. The United States exempted $2.7 billion in corn-specific support from the AMS limit for the marketing year 2012. In contrast, U.S. sugar support of $1.454 billion for 2012 exceeded its 5% de minimis threshold. Non-product-specific domestic support totaling $309.3 million in 2012 was also exempted from inclusion under the AMS limit. The 2012 farm bill exempted $309.3 million in non-product-specific domestic support from the AMS limit. The de minimis clause requires all support measures to be considered in determining if total support exceeds 5% of production value. If total U.S. AMS does not exceed $19.1 billion, the WTO commitment is met. The 2014 farm bill includes a safety trigger for USDA to adjust program outlays. The United States has never exceeded its AMS limit, with the closest approach in 2000 at $16.8 billion. Compliance with WTO rules is crucial for the U.S. as a major player in agricultural markets, especially for temperate field crops benefiting from farm program support. Market distortion from domestic farm policies can have adverse international effects. The U.S. farm program may face challenges under WTO dispute settlement procedures if it distorts markets for other members. The AoA's spending limits in the amber, blue, and green boxes encourage green-box compliance. The Doha Round of WTO negotiations on agricultural trade began in 2001 but is not expected to conclude soon. Lawmakers must consider policy options with international implications. The U.S. farm program may face challenges under WTO dispute settlement procedures if it distorts markets for other members. Lawmakers must consider policy options with international implications, including compliance with U.S. commitments under the AoA and the Doha Round of talks. The objective is for negotiations to result in reductions in trade-distorting support and stronger rules, while preserving \"green box\" policies that support agriculture with minimal trade distortions. The last U.S. notification to the WTO was in 2014, detailing domestic policies and their classification. The United States notified $127.5 billion in green box outlays for various agricultural programs, including General Services, Risk Management Agency costs, Farm Service Agency, Agricultural Research Service, and others. The United States allocated $106.8 billion for domestic food aid programs, including SNAP, child nutrition programs, WIC, and other food assistance programs. Additionally, $4.8 billion was designated for decoupled income support, $0.344 billion for relief from natural disasters, $0.135 billion for structural adjustment through investment aids, and $5.2 billion for environmental payments. The United States allocated $106.8 billion for domestic food aid programs, including SNAP, child nutrition programs, WIC, and other food assistance programs. Additionally, $4.8 billion was designated for decoupled income support, $0.344 billion for relief from natural disasters, $0.135 billion for structural adjustment through investment aids, and $5.2 billion for environmental payments. Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) received $1.4 billion, Conservation Stewardship Program received $0.9 billion, Wetland Reserve Program received $0.6 billion, Farmland Protection Program received $0.145 billion, and Grassland Reserve Program received $0.065 billion. The United States has not made any payments under the Blue Box Policies since 1995. De Minimis Exclusions totaled $5.3 billion in 2012, including product-specific exclusions of $5.0 billion and non-product-specific exclusions of $0.3 billion. Amber Box Policies received $6.9 billion in funding. Prior to the de minimis exclusions, U.S. amber box notifications totaled $12.1 billion, with $6.9 billion in amber box support subject to the $19.1 billion limit. Product-specific support included crop and revenue insurance subsidies, dairy price support, sugar price support, MILC, marketing loan benefits, commodity loan-related interest subsidies, special cotton marketing payments, ACRE program, and disaster assistance programs. The U.S. amber box notifications totaled $12.1 billion before de minimis exclusions, with $6.9 billion in support subject to the limit. Key programs include ACRE, disaster assistance, irrigation subsidies, grazing programs, renewable energy, and biomass assistance. Total non-product specific support amounts to $0.3 billion."
