    "content": "Congress enacted \u00a7 211 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998 to prohibit Cuban nationals or their successors from protecting certain trademarks in the United States, specifically in a dispute over the \"Havana Club\" trademark for rum. This law prevents the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from accepting or renewing trademarks owned by Cuban nationals without the original owners' consent. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998 enacted \u00a7 211 to prevent Cuban nationals or their successors from protecting trademarks acquired from the Cuban Government without compensation. This provision was challenged by the European Community in the World Trade Organization for being inconsistent with U.S. obligations under the TRIPS Agreement. Federal courts have ruled that \u00a7 211 bars infringement suits by successors-in-interest to Cuban corporations. A DSB panel found \u00a7 211 inconsistent with the TRIPS Agreement in some respects, but not proven in others. The European Community appealed the ruling. The Appellate Body reversed the lower panel's ruling on subsections 211(a)(2) and 211(b) regarding trademark rights enforcement, finding them inconsistent with TRIPS Agreement and Paris Convention requirements. The DSB adopted the rulings on February 1, 2002, requiring WTO Members to inform the DSB of their implementation intentions. The United States and the European Community agreed on a reasonable period of time for the US to amend \u00a7 211 to comply with WTO obligations, with multiple extensions granted. The US is expected to bring inconsistent measures into compliance by December 31, 2004. The United States has been consulting with Congress regarding the final deadline extension to December 31, 2004 for amending \u00a7 211 to comply with WTO obligations. The Appellate Body did not specifically address the consistency of the U.S. decision in the Havana Club case with the TRIPS Agreement. The challenge by the European Community focused on subsections 211(a) and (b) on their face, not as applied. The CFAC regulations and the Trading with the Enemy Act were not at issue in the dispute. Paragraph 211(a)(2) prohibits U.S. courts from processing any payment or transaction related to a trademark confiscated by the Cuban Government without compensation, unless the original owner or successor-in-interest consents. The DSB ruled that the U.S. was not obligated to accept the registration of a trademark that did not meet U.S. law requirements, even if it was registered in another WTO member or Paris Convention organization. The WTO and Paris Union prohibit U.S. courts from recognizing rights of a \"designated national\" based on U.S. trademark laws. Subsection 211(b) also restricts recognition of treaty rights for confiscated trademarks unless consent is given. \"Designated national\" includes Cuba and Cuban nationals. The Appellate Body of the DSB ruled that paragraph 211(a)(2) and subsection 211(b) are inconsistent with national treatment requirements in the TRIPS Agreement and the Paris Convention, specifically regarding U.S. trademarks owned by nationals of other WTO Members. The Appellate Body of the DSB found that paragraph 211(a)(2) and subsection 211(b) violated national treatment obligations by treating U.S. and Cuban owners of U.S. trademarks differently in protecting their trademarks in U.S. courts. This was based on a hypothetical scenario where a U.S. national and a Cuban national acquire rights to the same trademark, with the Cuban rights being confiscated. The U.S. owner's ability to assert their rights in U.S. courts was not affected, while the Cuban owner would face limitations. The Appellate Body of the DSB ruled that paragraph 211(a)(2) discriminates between U.S. and Cuban owners of trademarks, violating national treatment obligations. The U.S. owner's ability to enforce their rights in U.S. courts depends on the consent of the successor-in-interest to the confiscated Cuban rights. Paragraph 211(a)(2) discriminates between U.S. and foreign successors-in-interest regarding designated national status. The Appellate Body found that foreign successors-in-interest face additional hurdles under CFAC regulations and paragraph 211(a). Subsection 211(b) was deemed consistent with TRIPS Agreement and Paris Convention for successors-in-interest to original trademark owners. The Appellate Body ruled that paragraph 211(a)(2) and subsection 211(b) are inconsistent with most-favored-nation requirements in the TRIPS Agreement, as they discriminate against foreign successors-in-interest. There is no discrimination between U.S. and foreign successors-in-interest under subsection 211(b), aligning with WTO obligations. The Appellate Body of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) disagreed with the lower panel's ruling on the protection of trade names, stating that trade names are covered under the TRIPS Agreement. This means that WTO Members are obligated to extend protections to trade names, highlighting a violation of the most-favored-nation requirement. The Appellate Body disagreed with the lower panel's ruling on trade names protection under the TRIPS Agreement, finding inconsistencies with national treatment and most-favored-nation provisions. Six bills in the 108th Congress aim to bring the US into compliance with the Appellate Body's ruling. Several bills in the 108th Congress focus on compliance with the Appellate Body's ruling on Cuba sanctions. These bills aim to lift the trade embargo on Cuba, ease restrictions for certain purposes like food and medicine exports, and improve compliance with international intellectual property obligations related to Cuba. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of assignment and enforcement of trademarks, trade names, or domain names involving Cuban nationals. It also clarifies the application of the Lanham Act to Cuban nationals and the protection of trademarks owned by U.S. nationals in Cuba. H.R. 2494 and S. 2002 aim to protect trademarks owned by U.S. nationals in Cuba through a registry. The President will negotiate with Cuba to ensure compliance with international intellectual property agreements. Amendments to \u00a7 211 in H.R. 1588 were considered but not included. Bacardi proposed changes to \u00a7 211, but opponents argued for a complete repeal to avoid further challenges. The European Union and Cuba have expressed concerns about the lack of progress in U.S. compliance with the DSB's recommendations regarding trademark protection. The European Union specifically asked for clarification on the U.S. position on abandoned trademarks, noting discrepancies between U.S. representations to the DSB panel and court rulings on the matter. The panel had previously relied on non-application to abandoned trademarks in determining the consistency of certain clauses of \u00a7 211 with TRIPS. The United States responded to concerns about trademark protection by stating that a recent decision by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled against Havana Club Holding. The Board found that HCH was not the rightful owner of the U.S. trademark for \"Havana Club\" due to issues related to the Cuban embargo. Additionally, the Board dismissed Bacardi's cancellation petition regarding the ownership of the trademark, stating it was a political question concerning the legitimacy of the Cuban government. The repeal of \u00a7 211 would allow litigation on disputed Cuban/U.S. trademarks to address the substantive merits of the case, as the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled against Havana Club Holding, stating it was a political question regarding the legitimacy of the Cuban government."
