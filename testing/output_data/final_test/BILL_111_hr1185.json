    "content": "The \"Primary Care Volunteer Incentive Act of 2009\" establishes the Primary Care Loan Repayment Program under the Public Health Service Act. The Primary Care Loan Repayment Program aims to address shortages of primary care physicians by offering loan repayments to eligible individuals who agree to serve for 5 years as primary care physicians at designated health centers. The Primary Care Loan Repayment Program offers up to $5,000 annually towards the graduate educational loans of individuals who have a degree in medicine or osteopathic medicine, completed or enrolled in a primary care residency program, and meet application requirements specified by the Secretary. The program follows certain provisions outlined in section 338B(c). The loan repayment program under this section follows provisions similar to the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program, with priority given to individuals serving in community health centers designated as health professional shortage areas. Participation in the program requires approval. The loan repayment program under this section requires a written contract between the Secretary and the individual. Payments cover principal, interest, and related expenses on government and commercial loans for tuition, educational expenses, and living expenses as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may pay up to $5,000 per year of service for loans on behalf of individuals contracting to serve under this section. The amount paid is determined based on maximizing the number of contracts provided under the loan repayment program. The Secretary may pay up to $5,000 per year of service for loans on behalf of individuals contracting to serve in community health centers with the greatest shortage of primary care physicians. The repayment schedule for loan repayments shall incentivize individuals to remain in areas with a shortage of primary care physicians and continue providing health services in primary care medicine after completing the service period. The Secretary may make loan repayments for a year of service no later than the end of the fiscal year in which the individual completes the service. Additionally, the Secretary may provide payments to cover tax liability resulting from the loan repayments, equal to 39 percent of the total amount, and may make further payments as deemed appropriate. The Secretary may also establish a payment schedule for these repayments. The Secretary can establish a payment schedule for loan repayments under the loan repayment program. Breach of contract will be treated in accordance with section 338E. Definitions include primary care medicine and primary care physician. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to fund the loan repayment program for primary care medicine. Funding is contingent on appropriations being made for loan repayments."
