The Democratic Progressive Party lacks administrative experience, leading to many government positions being held by KMT members. Opposition parties have blocked many of Chen's policies, creating contentious issues during his presidency. Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian has faced challenges during his presidency, including an economic downturn, labor demonstrations, and an anti-corruption campaign targeting KMT vote-buying and gang-related politics. Opposition members have threatened motions of no confidence in Premier Chang and a recall of President Chen, but have backed down due to public demands to reduce political deadlock. Taiwan's democracy is experiencing instability as it matures politically. The congressional staff delegation noted key challenges in Taiwan's \"transition politics,\" including the lack of institutions for moderating partisanship, inexperienced political parties in forming coalitions, unstable voter identification, and a media lacking traditions of objective reporting. Most mass media in Taiwan are government- or party-affiliated and politically biased. Taiwan's political parties are uncertain about their performance in the upcoming legislative elections. The KMT's popularity is declining due to various reasons. President Chen is facing economic challenges with a significant drop in the stock market and high unemployment rates. Taiwanese investment in the People's Republic is also a concern. Taiwanese investment in the People's Republic of China nearly doubled in 2000, leading to the transfer of skilled and high tech jobs. Non-performing loans in Taiwan banks have reached 12-17 percent. Experts foresee challenges for the Taiwanese economy, including declining exports to the US, increased imports if Taiwan joins the WTO, and greater economic competition from China. Some analysts believe China is crucial for Taiwan's development. Taiwanese analysts see China as vital for Taiwan's development, with increased investment and exports. Restrictions on investment in China are deemed necessary to maintain Taiwanese technological superiority. The DPP advocates for Taiwan's independence, but President Chen Shui-bian promised not to declare independence as long as China refrains from military force. President Chen Shui-bian's stance on Taiwan's independence has shifted, with analysts attributing this change to various factors such as pressure from China, Taiwanese public opinion, and U.S.-China relations. Opposition lawmakers have engaged in informal discussions with Beijing to resume cross-strait talks, while Chen remains unwilling to accept the PRC's \"one-China principle\" as a starting point. Following the March 2000 presidential election, both the DPP and the KMT in Taiwan have shown more conciliatory stances towards mainland China. The KMT has moved away from Lee Teng-hui's \"state-to-state\" framework for negotiations, while the DPP has accepted the inevitability of political accommodation with the PRC. Vice President Annette Lu, known for her pro-independence views, lacks widespread public support. Both parties now support the \"status quo\" in cross-strait issues. Both the DPP and KMT in Taiwan support the \"status quo\" on cross-strait issues, neither advocating for independence nor unification at the moment. Democratization on the mainland is seen as a prerequisite for closer political ties or unification. Despite political tensions, cross-strait economic ties have significantly increased since the late 1980s, with bilateral trade reaching $25.8 billion in 1999 and Taiwanese firms being major importers for China. Taiwan is China's largest import source, with Taiwanese firms investing $40 billion in over 40,000 enterprises on the mainland. Economic cooperation between both sides is increasing in preparation for WTO accession. Growing economic ties pose a dilemma for Taiwan's new government, providing opportunities but also risks of job loss and technological dependence on the mainland. President Chen of Taiwan has cautiously encouraged greater trade and investment with the mainland, considering easing restrictions on Taiwanese businesses. The ROC government and military officials discussed military and political solutions to cross-strait tensions, including the need for more sophisticated U.S. armaments and concerns about hardware utilization. ROC defense officials discussed the possibility of a mainland military attack on Taiwan, stating that while it was possible, it was not likely in the short-term. They believed that the PRC still lacked the capability to successfully invade the island and not all military exercises conducted by the PRC were preparation for an attack. Additionally, they noted that the PRC's White Paper of February 2000 did not indicate a greater imminent threat of an attack. Taiwanese defense leaders fear mainland attack through missile tests, sinking ships, or taking islands. American specialist warns of PRC missile threat. AIT officials note PRC's internal divisions and nationalist motivations. Exploitation of Chinese nationalism may fuel militaristic behavior, but China's focus on economic development and international prestige may deter a military solution. Considerations of coercive actions against Taiwan may be limited by perceived economic and political costs. U.S. policy objectives include supporting liberal forces in PRC politics and increasing the costs to China of using force against Taiwan. Stabilizing factors in PRC-Taiwan relations include political competition in Taiwan and a majority view that the status quo should be maintained. The status quo between Beijing, the DPP, and opposition parties allows for future talks on the issue, with negotiations potentially influenced by the outcome of the December 2001 legislative elections. Cross-strait economic ties, boosted by the prospect of WTO membership, have increased the economic and political costs of military conflict for Beijing and Taipei. Other potential tension factors include PRC foreign policy mishaps, social unrest from economic reforms, and China's military modernization."
