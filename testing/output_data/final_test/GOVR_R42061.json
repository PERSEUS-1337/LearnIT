While overall totals of intelligence spending are now public, the process for appropriating funds remains complex. Despite past increases in funding, there is now a focus on reducing spending while maintaining effectiveness against threats like al-Qaeda. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. has addressed the need to adapt to new priorities in intelligence operations. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper Jr. warned of a 7% cut to the National Intelligence Program (NIP) budget due to sequestration, which could lead to reduced global coverage and intelligence collection. He highlighted the negative impact of budget cuts on the intelligence community, citing past repercussions. The Washington Post published details about the Administration's FY2013 NIP budget request leaked by Edward Snowden, sparking public debate. Total intelligence spending includes the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP), which serve different strategic and tactical purposes. Public discourse on intelligence spending often fails to differentiate between these two programs. The 9/11 Commission recommended public disclosure of intelligence spending, leading to the release of NIP and MIP budget figures starting in 2007. This transparency allows public access to previously classified budget numbers for national and military intelligence efforts. Total intelligence spending has decreased by at least 15% since 2010, with appropriations amounting to over $78 billion in FY2012. The President's budget requested $73 billion for FY2013, excluding sequestration impacts. Funding for intelligence activities includes roughly $10 billion annually for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Intelligence spending has increased significantly since September 11, 2001, with the NIP budget more than doubling in real terms from 2001 to 2012. Base budget intelligence spending peaked in FY2010, while OCO intelligence spending peaked in FY2011. The NIP budget for FY2012 was more than double the budget in 2001. Total intelligence spending has increased significantly since 2001, with the budget doubling from 2001 to 2012. In 1980, spending was estimated to be around $21 billion, quadrupling by 2010 before declining in recent years. The commission specified percentage changes in intelligence spending trends from 1980 to the mid-1990s and projected trends from the mid-1990s to 2001. The Director of Central Intelligence disclosed intelligence appropriations for FY1997 and FY1998. CRS estimated spending in 1980 and 1989 based on these trends. Data for national intelligence spending specifically over this period are not available. Intelligence spending mainly falls under the national defense function. Total intelligence spending grew more sharply than other national defense spending in both the 1980s and after 2001. In 1989, total intelligence spending peaked at 125% above 1980 levels before declining in the mid-1990s. By 2012, total intelligence spending had increased by about 110% in real terms from 2001. National defense spending excluding intelligence grew by 55% over the same period. Intelligence spending has grown significantly since 1980, outpacing national defense spending. There is a debate on whether intelligence spending should decrease along with defense spending or remain steady to provide forewarning to a smaller Department of Defense. The relationship between defense and intelligence spending is complex due to the diversity and magnitude of threats to U.S. interests. Intelligence spending is correlated to the diversity and magnitude of threats to U.S. interests, including non-state actors like terrorism and cyber-attacks. The intelligence community argues that resources must be dedicated to address these expanding threats. In comparison, while the Department of Defense (DOD) must plan for various threats, it may not need to allocate resources to each one. The cost of addressing new threats for DOD may not be as high as challenges from traditional state actors. Defense spending correlates to the total size of threats. Intelligence spending is influenced by the diversity and magnitude of threats to U.S. interests, including non-state actors like terrorism and cyber-attacks. The Department of Defense (DOD) may not need to allocate resources to each threat as it correlates to the total size of threats. DNI James R. Clapper highlighted the diverse array of threats faced globally in 2013. The intelligence community faces a diverse array of interconnected and viral threats globally. Congress and the intelligence community must establish priorities and align budgets accordingly to effectively respond to these critical issues. Critics have argued that in the past, there was a lack of a rigorous system to establish priorities and shape intelligence budgets. The 1996 report from the Council on Foreign Relations criticized the intelligence community management for setting priorities based on lower-level staff rather than the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The DCI was found to provide guidance too late in the budgeting process to influence program priorities. The Intelligence Community receives guidance for their annual budgets from the DCI's staff or jointly with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. This guidance considers presidential directives, national security strategy, intelligence gaps, and future needs. However, there is a challenge of the \"tail trying to wag the dog,\" where community-level staff compile budget proposals but have little influence on program priorities. The Intelligence Community's budget proposals were compiled by community-level staff without much oversight. Some believed the DCI lacked authority over individual agency budgets, leading to the creation of the DNI in 2004 with expanded budgetary authorities. The DNI was tasked with developing an annual consolidated National Intelligence Budget. The DNI was granted additional reprogramming authority and the ability to monitor and execute the NIP, which the DCI lacked. The DNI established the NIPF and IPPBE process to prioritize intelligence topics and allocate resources accordingly. The NIPF is the DNI's sole mechanism for setting national intelligence priorities. The intelligence community follows the NIPF to allocate resources, overseen by the DNI CFO. Ambassador Hutchings criticized the NIPF's effectiveness, but there is limited public information to verify this. The IPPBE system is used to develop the NIP, but the directive doesn't mention the NIPF. The IPPBE does not mention the NIPF, indicating a limited role in budget formulation. Analysis of intelligence priorities and gaps is part of the IPPBE planning phase, but the extent of NIPF's influence is unknown. After DNI staff completes IPPBE analysis, programmatic guidance is provided to the intelligence community members. Prior to intelligence reform in 2004, priorities and budget allocations were agency-specific. The intelligence community underwent reform in 2004 with the establishment of a DNI. Concerns have been raised about the community's focus on counterterrorism to the detriment of other strategic priorities. A report by the PIAB in 2012 found a heavy emphasis on tactical operations. Congress may review NIPF and IPPBE processes to shape the NIP effectively. The NIPF's impact on intelligence agencies' collection and analytic priorities, DNI's authority over agency budgets, incorporation of DNI's guidance in agency budgets, and adjustments made by DNI based on community priorities are key oversight questions. Intelligence appropriations are complex due to the nature of the intelligence community and budget processes. Major agencies like CIA, NSA, NRO, NGA, and DIA receive funds at the national level. The National Intelligence Program (NIP) includes funding for key intelligence agencies like CIA, NSA, NRO, NGA, and DIA. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) develops the NIP budget, which is then presented to the President for approval and subsequently submitted to Congress for review. The President's budget for intelligence is submitted to Congress in early February each year. Congress appropriates funds for intelligence mainly in defense legislation, with over 90% of the NIP budget allocated through defense appropriations acts. CIA funding is included in defense appropriations but is managed separately by the Director of the CIA. Other departments like State, Justice, Homeland Security, Energy, and Treasury receive intelligence funding through different appropriations measures. Once appropriations are enacted, the OMB distributes funds to agencies with national intelligence programs based on the Administration's request and congressional adjustments. The DNI can manage intelligence resources through reprogrammings and transfers, authorized by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Reprogrammings or transfers must be approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and stay within certain limits. The DNI may exceed these limits with department head concurrence. The DNI can transfer up to $2 billion of NIP funds as per the Intelligence Reform Act. Various proposals aim to separate national intelligence funding from the defense budget, with the DNI and the Office of the Secretary of Defense sharing budget execution responsibilities. The \"does not abrogate\" language in the Intelligence Reform Act raises ambiguity about budgetary authorities between the DNI and Secretary of Defense, potentially leading to challenges in the DNI's stewardship of the intelligence community, especially if major changes occur in the DOD component of the intelligence community's budgets. This could complicate budget formulation and execution, as much of the NIP is embedded within the defense budget. Some suggest separating intelligence appropriations from defense appropriations to improve oversight and coordination. This could involve creating separate appropriations acts or subcommittees for intelligence funding. Proponents argue this would allow for better consideration of national intelligence efforts and give the DNI a greater role in ensuring government-wide requirements are met. However, skeptics believe these changes may not provide new insights for the DNI and could complicate ties between intelligence and non-intelligence DOD programs. One option for policy makers is to create a separate title for National Intelligence Program (NIP) funding within defense appropriations bills, giving greater visibility to NIP funding without requiring separate 302(b) allocations. This approach aims to improve oversight and coordination of intelligence funding. The 9/11 Commission recommended disclosing amounts appropriated for national intelligence and passing a separate appropriations act for intelligence. This would require fewer changes to the intelligence appropriations process and make overall amounts requested and appropriated public. The option of a stand-alone intelligence appropriations act would separate appropriations for the NIP from the DOD budget. DNI Clapper spoke favorably of this separation. DNI Clapper supported separating the National Intelligence Program from the DOD budget for transparency and budget reduction purposes. He indicated that this approach would be implemented starting with the FY2013 budget submission to Congress in February 2012. DNI Clapper supported separating the National Intelligence Program from the DOD budget for transparency and efficiency. Section 433 of the FY2012 Intelligence Authorization Bill allows for separate accounts in the Treasury to improve tracking and management of intelligence funds. Separating the National Intelligence Program budget for transparency and efficiency is a challenge due to the lack of auditable tools. Some suggest a separate intelligence appropriations subcommittee to address this issue, but it may face opposition in Congress. Efforts to separate the National Intelligence Program budget from the Department of Defense funding have faced significant congressional resistance in the past, with language in the FY2012 defense appropriations bill prohibiting such actions. Efforts to separate the National Intelligence Program budget from the Department of Defense funding faced resistance in past defense appropriations bills. The provision survived in H.R. 3671 and H.R. 933, becoming law in 2012 and 2013 respectively. The House version of the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act further restricted the use of DOD funds for NIP. The Senate has not passed its authorization act yet, and proposals for changing intelligence appropriations processes remain controversial. The National Intelligence Program budget has faced resistance in past defense appropriations bills, with little attention given to a separate title for the NIP. DNI Clapper has dropped plans to separate the NIP from DOD's budget, and efforts to establish new congressional committees for intelligence oversight have generated little interest. The existing intelligence appropriations and oversight mechanisms are being used by Members of Congress to guide the intelligence community into a new fiscal era. These issues also raise questions about the sufficiency of DNI authorities. The debate over the extent and sufficiency of DNI authorities, particularly in relation to Department of Defense elements of the intelligence community, continues. DNI Clapper suggests that moving the intelligence community out of DOD's budget would increase ODNI's authority and transparency over the NIP. There is little interest in expanding DNI authorities due to unanswered questions about the effectiveness of the Office of the DNI. However, DNI authorities are becoming more critical as declining budgets require tough choices between intelligence platforms and agencies. The 9/11 Commission recommendations led to changes in congressional oversight of intelligence and the intelligence budgeting process. Congress implemented some initiatives in response but many have not been fully executed. Both the House and Senate established separate appropriations subcommittees for intelligence, with the House creating a Select Intelligence Oversight Panel within the Appropriations Committee. The Select Intelligence Oversight Panel within the Appropriations Committee was established to review and study intelligence budget requests, make recommendations, and prepare an annual report for the Defense Subcommittee. Proponents of H.Res. 35 aimed to support the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, focusing on three main concerns. The 9/11 Commission raised concerns about the lack of oversight and insufficient staff in the intelligence authorizing committee and Appropriations Committee. There was also criticism of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for not prioritizing intelligence matters. Critics argued that the proposed changes did not address the existing oversight structure effectively. The panel created in July 2008 by Representative Rush Holt influenced intelligence fund appropriations through recommendations to enhance Congressional oversight of the DNI's budget management. The Panel created by Representative Rush Holt in July 2008 aimed to provide stability for the Intelligence Community by recommending stronger budgetary oversight. In January 2011, the 112th Congress eliminated the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, and in March 2011, Representative Mike Rogers announced a plan to allow three members of the Appropriations Committee to participate in Intelligence Committee hearings. The initiative aimed to connect the Intelligence Committee with the Appropriators to provide insights, without changing their responsibilities. The Senate also responded to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations by establishing a Subcommittee on Intelligence within the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate responded to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations by establishing a Subcommittee on Intelligence within the Senate Appropriations Committee, aiming to connect the Intelligence Committee with the Appropriators. In 2009, the Intelligence Committee proposed creating a Subcommittee on Intelligence within the Committee on Appropriations to approve annual appropriations for the National Intelligence Program without review by other subcommittees, but this provision was later dropped. The Senate dropped Section 341 from the bill before passing it by unanimous consent on September 16, 2009. The provision was not included in the final version of the FY2010 Intelligence Authorization Act. Classification has always been a key consideration in the congressional approach to intelligence appropriations."
