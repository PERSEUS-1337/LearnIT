    "content": "Businesses can take various forms, from large corporations to partnerships to self-employed owners. The rules for determining taxable income are generally the same, but the way income is taxed varies based on the type of business. Large corporations are subject to the corporate income tax, a key component of the federal tax system. The corporate income tax applies to taxable corporate income, separate from owners, and is in addition to individual income tax on dividends and capital gains. Income subject to the corporate tax is generally taxed twice, except for debt-financed investment returns. The corporate income tax applies to taxable corporate income, separate from owners, and is tax-deductible. Double taxation does not apply to income paid to tax-exempt stockholders like pension funds. S corporations and partnerships pass income through to stockholders and partners, respectively, avoiding entity-level taxes. Sole proprietors are taxed on their business income under individual income tax. The federal business income tax applies to self-employed individuals operating sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations. 62% of tangible business assets are owned by C corporations, while the remaining 38% is owned by other business entities. Taxable income is determined based on profits, which are gross receipts minus deductible costs such as interest payments, wages, materials, and depreciation allowance. The tax code's definition of these elements often varies. The tax code's definition of tangible capital and income may differ from economic definitions, leading to potential tax benefits or penalties. This discrepancy can impact how capital resources are allocated in the economy, especially as U.S. firms engage more in international markets. In the international context, the U.S. applies a \"residence\" based tax system to corporations chartered in the United States. U.S. firms can defer tax on foreign-source income by reinvesting abroad. Foreign businesses in the U.S. are subject to U.S. business taxes on their U.S.-source income. Foreign businesses operating in the United States are generally subject to U.S. business taxes on their U.S.-source income. If a foreign firm operates through a U.S.-chartered subsidiary corporation, it is subject to U.S. tax on its worldwide income. Alternatively, if the foreign firm operates through a branch of the foreign-chartered parent corporation, it is taxed on its income from U.S. sources only. The U.S. taxes foreign persons and corporations on their income from the active conduct of a U.S. trade or business. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) applies to both corporations and individuals, requiring them to pay the higher of either the regular tax or the AMT. The AMT has a lower rate and a broader base than the regular tax, aiming to ensure profitable corporations pay some tax. The exact impact of the AMT on corporate investment is hard to quantify due to limited data availability. Prior to 1999, the AMT was significant, with over one-quarter of corporate assets held by firms paying the tax. However, new depreciation rules in 1999 likely reduced the impact of the AMT on investments. Corporate tax receipts have varied over time, with the review focusing on the corporate income tax's size relative to the economy. Data from fiscal years 1934 to 2009 show corporate tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. The chart displays corporate tax revenues as a percentage of GDP from fiscal years 1934 to 2009, showing a decline from peaks during World War II and the Korean War. Corporate tax revenue's share of total federal revenue also decreased over time, with a peak of 40% during World War II. The corporate tax revenues as a percentage of GDP declined from peaks during World War II and the Korean War, reaching levels slightly above and below 10% after the late 1980s. There was a surge in 2005 before a dramatic fall in 2009. The aggregate burden of corporate taxes steadily declined during the 1960s and 1970s, reaching a low of about 20% of corporate profits in the early 1980s. The average effective tax rate (AETR) on corporate profits fluctuated during the 1960s and 1970s, hitting a low of around 20% in the early 1980s before stabilizing at about 25% from 1986 onwards. In 2000, there was a spike to 34%. Legislative changes, such as reductions in the statutory corporate tax rate and tax credits, influenced these variations. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 also played a role by providing accelerated depreciation deductions. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 provided accelerated depreciation deductions, contributing to a sharp drop in tax rates in the early 1980s. Rates increased again in the mid-1980s, partly due to timing results from the 1981 act and the Tax Reform Act of 1986. AETRs have limitations as a measure of the corporate tax burden, as they only provide one-year snapshots of a firm's tax burden. The tax burden on investment depends on how taxes are distributed over an investment's life, with the timing of payments and deductions playing a crucial role. Marginal effective tax rates (METRs) consider these factors, accurately reflecting the impact of provisions like accelerated depreciation. METRs also account for inflation, tax rules, statutory tax rates, and investment subsidies. In essence, METRs measure the difference between pre-tax and after-tax returns on prospective investments. The METR for corporate investment declined from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s due to various tax provisions, then rose in the late 1960s and varied during the 1970s. Rates sharply declined in 1981 with the Economic Recovery Tax Act's accelerated depreciation provisions, remaining relatively stable thereafter. The METR for corporate investment declined from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s due to tax provisions, rose in the late 1960s, and varied during the 1970s. Rates sharply declined in 1981 with the Economic Recovery Tax Act's accelerated depreciation provisions. METRs remained stable until 2001-2003, with reductions in shareholder-level taxes and bonus depreciation causing a decrease in effective rates. Rates increased again in 2005 with the expiration of bonus depreciation. Corporate tax data shows a general decline in taxes post-World War II, but the relative positions of METRs for corporate investment, non-corporate business, and owner-occupied housing should be noted. The relative tax treatment of investment affects the allocation of capital among different uses. Corporate investment remains heavily taxed compared to non-corporate business and owner-occupied housing. Business taxes have generally declined post-World War II, but the relative positions of METRs for different types of investment have remained the same. Business taxes impact capital investment by reducing returns, influencing resource allocation among sectors, and ultimately affecting individuals. Advocates suggest cutting business taxes to boost capital formation and investment levels. According to economic theory, cutting business taxes is believed to boost capital formation, leading to long-term growth and increased living standards. However, the impact of business taxes on the overall capital stock in the economy is not significant. While business taxes may affect firms' investment demand by increasing the required rate of return, individual savers may not respond strongly to tax cuts by increasing their saving. Uneven application of business taxes can result in firms choosing to forgo less profitable investments. Uneven application of business taxes can lead to less investment in heavily taxed areas and more investment in lightly taxed projects. Changes in investment demand may not significantly impact the overall capital stock if individual saving is unresponsive to changes in the after-tax rate of return. Boosts in demand may increase the economy's real interest rate without increasing the capital stock. Economic theory suggests that tax credits for businesses may boost demand for specific investments, but without an increase in savers' funds, the capital stock will not grow. Economic theory is inconclusive on how saving responds to changes in the rate of return after taxes. Taxes on investment income can affect saving behavior, with conflicting effects. Some suggest that reducing government dis-saving by cutting the budget deficit could be a more effective way to increase national saving than providing tax incentives for saving and investment. Reducing government dis-saving by cutting the budget deficit can be more effective in increasing national saving than providing tax incentives for saving and investment. Business taxes impact the allocation of investment, affecting economic efficiency by distorting investment demand and reducing economic welfare. Business taxes distort resource allocation and reduce economic welfare. One major issue is the double-taxation of corporate-source equity income under both corporate and individual income taxes, leading to investment being redirected to less heavily taxed areas. Another problem is the corporate income tax favoring debt over equity in investment financing, as interest payments are tax-deductible but dividends and capital gains are not. This encourages firms to take on higher levels of debt, increasing the risk of bankruptcy. Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, business taxes distorted resource allocation by favoring debt over equity in investment financing, leading to higher levels of debt and increased risk of bankruptcy. Differential tax burdens among assets encouraged more investment in machines and equipment than in structures and inventory, resulting in inefficient asset choices. The 1986 Tax Reform Act changed depreciation rules, repealed the investment credit, and reduced the corporate tax rate, reducing inter-asset distortions. Recent legislative changes reintroduced differential tax burdens, favoring equipment over structures, and increased the statutory tax rate. Corporate income tax favors debt finance, while individual income taxation and capital gains receive preferential treatment. Recent legislation has reduced the tax rate on dividends to match capital gains, narrowing the gap between tax rates on retained earnings and dividends. However, the difference remains as capital gains are taxed upon realization while dividends are taxed immediately. Corporations, as economic entities, cannot bear the burden of corporate income tax, ultimately impacting individuals. In the short run, the tax burden is on corporate stockholders, but the long-term impact is uncertain. The long-term burden of the corporate income tax, as per Arnold Harberger's model, spreads beyond corporate stockholders to all owners of capital, including owners of corporate debt, non-corporate business, and owner-occupied housing. This has implications for the vertical equity of the tax. The corporate income tax burden extends to all capital owners, impacting vertical equity. Reforming business taxation aims to enhance U.S. competitiveness, but the concept is debated in international economics. Contrary to popular belief, business taxes do not directly impact a nation's balance of trade. Imposing taxes on business profits does not necessarily reduce exports or increase imports, as a country's trade deficit is influenced by factors like foreign investment. Contrary to popular belief, business taxes do not directly impact a nation's balance of trade. A country's net exports only increase if its net overseas investment also increases, as the balance of trade mirrors the balance on capital account. Exchange rate adjustments enforce this relationship, offsetting any changes that would otherwise occur due to external factors like taxes. The United States repealed the extraterritorial income (ETI) benefit in 2004, which was a tax benefit for exporting. Despite fears of harm to U.S. competitiveness, economic theory suggests that the repeal would not directly impact the trade balance. The depreciation of the dollar would offset any initial decline in exports and also reduce imports, resulting in no change in the trade balance. Business taxes do not affect the trade balance but can influence the composition of trade based on the theory of comparative advantage. According to comparative advantage theory, a country's trade composition is determined by the costs of domestic goods relative to each other, not foreign goods. Business taxes can impact trade by altering cost patterns, encouraging imports of heavily taxed items and exports of lightly taxed ones. While taxes can't increase net exports, they can change trade patterns, which is beneficial according to standard economic trade theory. Taxes can impact trade by altering cost patterns and distorting the composition of trade, leading to a country specializing in inefficient activities. This can worsen a country's terms of trade and reduce its economic welfare. Taxes can reduce a country's economic welfare by worsening its terms of trade, impacting investment decisions, and leading to a subsidy that benefits foreign consumers at the expense of the subsidizing country's taxpayers. The impact of taxes on investment location choice is influenced by tax rates in different countries. Lower taxes in foreign locations can encourage overseas investment, while lower U.S. taxes promote domestic investment. Neutrality between overseas and domestic investment is ideal for economic efficiency. The U.S. tax system's impact on investment location is uncertain due to varying tax treatments of overseas income. The current federal business taxation system creates a mix of incentives, disincentives, and neutrality towards foreign and domestic investment. The system's efficiency effect is unclear due to factors such as foreign tax levels, legal form of investment, and location of other foreign investments. Business taxes have generally decreased since World War II, but disparities in taxation of different investment types persist. The report discusses the economic effects of different types of investment taxation and explores options for reforming business tax policy. It questions the necessity of a separate corporate income tax, highlighting efficiency concerns such as investment diversion. Arguments for and against a corporate income tax, including its role in adding progressivity, are considered. The corporate income tax adds progressivity to the tax system among upper-income individuals. Repealing it without compensating changes would be regressive. Corporate managers may have independence from stockholders in investment decisions. Without the tax, retained earnings would receive favorable treatment. Individual taxpayers compare their taxes to those of corporations, influencing perceptions of fairness. The current system taxes corporations separately but with important omissions. Tax reform could move towards a more comprehensive approach to taxing corporate income, minimizing inefficiencies and distortions. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to minimize inefficiencies and distortions in the tax system by considering a more comprehensive approach to taxing corporate income. One significant departure from the current system is the omission of income from debt-financed investment, favoring debt over equity and leading to higher bankruptcy risks for firms. Interest deductibility elimination has been rarely proposed as a solution outside of tax integration discussions. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to minimize inefficiencies in the tax system by reforming depreciation allowances to align with economic depreciation. A realignment of depreciation allowances for equipment and structures may be a likely component of future tax reform based on comprehensive income taxation. A likely ingredient of tax reform based on comprehensive income taxation would involve realigning depreciation allowances with economic depreciation. The deduction for domestic production, enacted by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, allows for a 9% deduction of income from domestic production activities. Various targeted tax benefits, such as the section 179 expensing allowance for small businesses and tax credits for research and experimentation, are also omitted from the tax base. The Joint Committee on Taxation maintains a list of \"tax expenditures\" that provide special tax treatment for specific activities, income, or investments. A comprehensive list of omissions from the corporate tax base can be found in the JCT list. Moving towards comprehensive income taxation would involve reducing tax expenditures. The current system of taxing corporate income leads to distortions in investment allocation, reducing economic efficiency. Economists suggest tax integration to eliminate double taxation of corporate income, with proposals for full integration or changing treatment of retained earnings and dividends. There are three basic approaches to full integration to eliminate double taxation of corporate income. The \"shareholder allocation\" method would allocate corporate profits to owners for individual income tax. Another approach is \"shareholder credit\" integration, where stockholders receive a tax credit for corporate-level taxes paid. The three basic approaches to full integration to eliminate double taxation of corporate income include the \"shareholder allocation\" method, the \"shareholder credit\" integration, and adjusting the capital gains portion of the credit to account for gains from retained earnings and price appreciation. This approach would provide relief at the individual level while taxes would be paid on corporate income tax at individual income tax rates, functioning similar to a withholding tax. Another approach is to retain the corporate income tax but exclude corporate-source income from individual income taxes, which may be difficult to administer for gains attributable to reinvested earnings. Adjusting stockholders' basis in stock to reflect retained earnings would be necessary to exclude gains from retained earnings. In 1992, a U.S. Treasury report proposed a \"comprehensive business income tax\" (CBIT) where corporate-source income would not be taxed at the individual level. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) applied a reduced individual income tax rate to dividend income, resembling partial integration at the shareholder level. A shareholder-credit version of integration restricted to dividends paid would be simpler than full integration. This partial-integration method is commonly used in Europe and other regions. The shareholder credit method is commonly used in Europe and other foreign countries for tax integration. Partial integration is simpler than full integration but may not achieve all efficiency gains. Different integration methods have varying revenue costs, with shareholder allocation methods reducing revenue the most. Tax integration or a comprehensive income-based tax would require significant changes to the current system. In discussions of tax reform, the focus is often on replacing current income taxes with consumption taxes like value-added taxes or national sales taxes. These consumption taxes differ in collection methods but all aim to exempt savings and encourage new business investment. A national retail sales tax would operate similarly to state sales taxes, exempting business-to-business sales and taxing final sales to consumers. However, taxing business inputs could lead to inefficiencies and distortions in the market. One method to distinguish between business and non-business uses under a national sales tax is to issue exemption certificates to businesses. However, this could lead to significant administrative and compliance challenges, especially for items with dual uses. Value-added taxes (VAT) are levied on the value added by each firm in a good's production process, differing in collection point from retail sales taxes but resulting in the same cumulative rate at the final production stage. The VAT is administered through credit-invoice and subtraction methods. In the credit-invoice method, businesses are assessed VAT on gross receipts and claim credits for VAT paid on inputs. The subtraction method levies tax on gross receipts after subtracting purchases, focusing on the value added by the taxed firm. The subtraction-method VAT and credit-invoice VAT both levy taxes on the value added by the taxed firm. They are similar in tax outcome when imposed at the same rate. Both taxes are applied to imports but not exports. The credit-invoice method allows for tax rebates on inputs for exporting firms. The flat tax, a variation of the subtraction-method VAT, allows firms to deduct wages from gross income, reducing the tax base on labor contributions. The value-added tax (VAT) and sales tax have similar economic effects but differ in collection methods. A VAT taxes the value added by businesses at each stage of production, while a sales tax is imposed only at the final sale. A VAT imposes a higher compliance burden on businesses as every business must file a tax return. However, a VAT simplifies the distinction between business and personal use of items. A tax on consumed income can be imposed at the individual level, where individuals calculate their tax by subtracting saving from their income and paying tax on the residual. This type of consumption tax focuses on the uses of income rather than its source, allowing for deductions on business investments and exempt uses of income. A consumption tax focuses on the uses of income, allowing deductions for business investments and exempting new investment income. Business profits are ultimately exempt from tax under any form of pure consumption tax. Under a consumption tax, non-neutralities in business taxation would be eliminated, leading to increased business investment, equity finance, and investment in assets other than equipment. This could potentially increase economic efficiency. The particular shape of capital income taxation in the current system creates non-neutralities affecting business investment. Transitioning to a consumption tax would exempt the return to new investment but still tax income from existing investments. This change could have significant short and medium-term effects on business investment. Transitioning to a consumption tax would impact existing capital by including revenue from old investments in the tax base, leading to a windfall loss for owners of older, slow-growing firms. This shift would benefit business sectors with intensive corporate production, low debt-to-equity ratios, and production processes favoring machines and equipment over structures. The transition effects would also result in a resource shift away from previously favored investments. Transitioning to a consumption tax would impact existing capital by including revenue from old investments in the tax base, leading to a windfall loss for owners of older, slow-growing firms. The argument for border tax adjustments in support of consumption taxes is frequently made by businesses, focusing on the cost advantage foreign firms in VAT countries have over U.S. firms. However, taxes or tax-related mechanisms like VAT rebates do not directly alter trade balance or competitiveness. Exchange rate adjustments in response to VAT rebates eliminate any impact on competitiveness. The corporate tax system has seen changes over the years, with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 broadening the base and reducing rates. Recent concerns about its impact on capital formation and international competitiveness have led to discussions about adopting tax integration or a consumption tax."
