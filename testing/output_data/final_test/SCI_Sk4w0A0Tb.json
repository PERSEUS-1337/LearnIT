The Rotational Unit of Memory (RUM) is a novel RNN cell that combines the advantages of unitary/orthogonal matrices with associative memory. It outperforms basic RNN models in tasks like Copying Memory and Recall, as well as in the bAbI question answering task. RUM's performance is competitive with memory networks that utilize attention mechanisms. LSTM is designed to address the issue of exploding and vanishing gradients in RNNs, but gradient clipping is still necessary for training. Recent advancements have utilized orthogonal or unitary matrices to overcome this problem by keeping the norm of the gradient stable. Several successful approaches have applied these matrices to recurrent neural networks to improve efficiency. Recent advancements in recurrent neural networks have utilized orthogonal or unitary matrices to stabilize the norm of the gradient, improving efficiency. BID13 found that combining unitary/orthogonal matrices with a gated mechanism enhances RNN performance by enabling long-term memorization. They suggest placing the unitary/orthogonal matrix before the reset gate, followed by a modReLU activation. In RUM, an orthogonal operation is implemented differently by encoding a natural rotation generated by inputs and hidden states. In RNN, a natural rotation is encoded by inputs and hidden states. Adding external associative memory can expand memory space but increases model size, making learning more challenging. Associative memory concept involves replacing fixed parameters with dynamic ones to serve as memory state, increasing memory size. The Rotational Unit of Memory model enhances RNN memorization by using an orthogonal matrix for memory storage. Capsules, introduced by BID23, represent concepts in hidden states with vectors and utilize dynamic routing for connections. This phase-encoded model shows promising performance in Convolutional Neural Networks. The model introduced is the first successful phase-encoded model in the RNN domain, with a detailed comparison to other models. Rotations are studied mathematical structures with applications in various fields. Estimating poses in computer vision involves rotational matrices and quaternions. The conventional way of representing memory in RNNs is through a hidden state vector of finite dimension N. Using capsules as vectors in RNN models can provide representational advantages. Incorporating rotations as units of memory in RNN models by equipping the hidden state with a pose vector in Euclidean space. Rotation operation efficiently encodes orthogonal operations for manipulating pose orientation. This approach enhances representational advantages in models using capsules as vectors. The proposed method involves computing an orthogonal operator in Euclidean space to represent rotations between non-collinear vectors in a two-dimensional subspace. This operator can act as a kernel on a hidden state in RNN models, enhancing representational advantages for manipulating pose orientation. Other approaches for extracting orthogonal operations from RNN cells exist but may be more complex to implement and lack intuitive memory encoding. Rotation is a practical and differentiable method for projecting to the plane spanned by vectors a and b. It is orthogonal, enabling learning through backpropagation and stable gradients. Rotation can be implemented in various deep learning frameworks for RNNs and other architectures, producing an orthogonal matrix efficiently. The Recurrent Unit of Memory (RUM) is a universal operation that efficiently implements Rotation in neural network models. It uses two trainable vectors to generate orthogonal weights, with memory complexity of O(Nb\u00b7Nh) and time complexity of O(Nb\u00b7N^2h). RUM consists of an update gate and a memory target variable, making it suitable for any neural network model with backpropagation. The Recurrent Unit of Memory (RUM) implements Rotation in neural network models using a memory target variable \u03c4 and an orthogonal matrix R(\u03b5 t , \u03c4 ). It learns to embed input vectors and evolves hidden states similar to GRU, with a rotational associative memory and unbounded evolution. The model uses an update gate, embedded input for Rotation, and a scalar hyper-parameter \u03b7. The orthogonal matrix R(\u03b5 t , \u03c4 ) acts on the hidden state to produce an evolved hidden stateh. The RUM model introduces Rotation using an orthogonal matrix R(\u03b5 t , \u03c4) in place of a kernel in GRU. Unlike GORU, RUM learns \u03c4 to determine R and uses ReLU activation for stability. Time normalization is suggested to maintain the norm of the hidden state h t. The RUM model utilizes time normalization along the sequence dimension, stabilizes learning with appropriate \u03b7, and incorporates additional memory via the target vector \u03c4 for encoding rotations. This memory unit gives RUM an advantage over LSTM and GRU in tasks like the Copying Memory Task. RUM model demonstrates superior memorization capacity in various tasks, outperforming LSTM and GRU. It achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks like Associative Recall and bAbI Question Answering. Additionally, RUM's rotational memory helps achieve high performance in the Character Level Penn Treebank. RUM model outperforms LSTM and GRU in memory representation. Despite its update gate limitations, RUM successfully completes tasks. GORU is the only other gated RNN model successful at copying. RUM falls below baseline initially but achieves zero loss after iterations. Removing normalization speeds up RUM's learning but increases fluctuations. The training involves fluctuations, so using a finite \u03b7 to normalize the hidden state is crucial for stable learning. Large hidden sizes in character level predictions can lead to cross entropy loss escalation if not normalized. Tuning in associative rotational memory shows benefits, with a \u03bb = 1 RUM learning faster than a \u03bb = 0 RUM due to phase accumulation. Both models overcome gradient issues and learn the task successfully. Associative Recall is a synthetic task to test RNN memory ability. Associative Recall task requires RNN to remember sequences of data and perform logic. The RNN is fed a sequence of characters and must output the character based on a \"key\" at the end. LSTM fails to learn the task. Comparison is made between RUM, LSTM, Fast-weight RNN BID2, and WeiNet. All models have the same hidden state size and batch size. Optimizer is RMSProp with a learning rate of 0.001. In the context of comparing different models on the Associative Recall task, RUM is tested on the bAbI Question Answering dataset without using attention mechanisms. The results are compared with baselines like LSTM and End-to-end Memory Network BID27, showing RUM's ability to memorize and reason effectively. RUM outperforms LSTM and GORU in the Question Answering task on the bAbI dataset, achieving competitive results with MemN2N. It shows the ability to learn long-term structures in data without significant overfitting, making it a natural choice for real-world character-level NLP tasks. The study tests RUM on real-world character-level NLP tasks using a corpus of articles from The Wall Street Journal. The data is split into train, validation, and test sets. RUM is incorporated into the FS-RNN-k architecture, consisting of a \"fast\" layer with k RNN cells and a \"slow\" layer with a single RNN cell. The output of the model is the probability distribution of the predicted character. FS-RUM-2 achieves state-of-the-art results on the Penn Treebank task by efficiently learning activation patterns in its kernels. The Rotational Unit of Memory allows encoding information in the phase of the hidden state, providing a representational advantage. Visualization of the kernels generating the target memory in the RUM model demonstrates the learning structure. The RUM model utilizes kernels to generate target memory \u03c4, with a diagonal structure in the hidden state playing a crucial role in learning. This structure is not task-specific and likely encodes grammar, vocabulary, and language components. The use of orthogonal matrices in approaches like RUM falls under phase-encoding. The RUM model utilizes orthogonal matrices for phase-encoding architectures, parameterizing them with Efficient Unitary Neural Networks. The rotational memory equation in the model represents phase vectors at different times, with elements depending on specific parameters. This eliminates the need for a reset gate in the RNN implementation. The RUM model uses orthogonal matrices for phase-encoding, eliminating the need for a reset gate in RNN implementation. Extending the model involves allowing \u03bb to be any real number in the associative memory equation to enhance representational power. Defining the raising of a matrix to a real power involves rotations, which are elements of SO(Nh) and their logarithms correspond to elements of the Lie algebra so(Nh). RUM and Capsule Net are not equivalent in learning representations. Both RUM and Capsule Net share similarities in learning representations. They both manipulate orientation and magnitude of vectors through rotation and routing mechanisms. The routing mechanism measures similarity between vectors using dot product and cosine similarity. The relative position between two vectors is used for effective routing in RUM, manipulating orientations iteratively. The rotation mechanism involves generating target memory, measuring rotation, and changing the orientation of the hidden state. RUM demonstrates manipulating orientations and magnitudes of higher dimensionality compared to BID23 capsules. The RUM model, a novel RNN architecture, utilizes unitary and associative memory concepts to outperform previous state-of-the-art models like LSTM and GRU in tasks such as Copying Memory and Associative Recall. It can be integrated with other RNN structures like FS-RNN and Recurrent Highway Networks for even better results in sequential tasks. The Rotational Unit of Memory (RUM) model is a competitive architecture that can be applied to various fields beyond RNN, such as Convolutional and Generative Adversarial Neural Networks. In experiments, the RNN model is expected to output \"blank\" and then sequentially copy the initial data after a \"marker\" appears in the input. Training sequences consist of randomly generated pairs of \"character\" and \"number\" elements. The Rotational Unit of Memory (RUM) model uses randomly generated pairs of \"character\" and \"number\" elements for training. The key is always a \"character\" with a set size equal to half the sequence length and the \"number\" set size of 10. RUM utilizes rotational operation to solve the Associative Recall Task with input sequences of size 50. Training involves 20 models jointly on each sub-task using a 10k data set divided into 90% training and 10% validation. Tuning the associative memory with \u03bb = 1 is crucial for learning the task. The RUM model uses randomly generated pairs of \"character\" and \"number\" elements for training. Different length sequences are filled with \"blank\" and embedded into dense vectors for RNN processing. The model is trained with Adam Optimizer, batch size of 32, and 20 epochs per subset. Various regularization techniques are applied to RNN cells, LSTM gates, and FS-RNN. Gradient clipping is used with a maximal norm of 1.0. Hyper-parameters for the models are listed in TAB9. Inputs are embedded into dense vectors for processing. The RUM model utilizes randomly generated pairs of \"character\" and \"number\" elements for training. The outputs of the models pass through a softmax layer and are evaluated using a cross entropy loss function. The performance of various RUM models is outlined in Table 7, with FS-LSTM-2 achieving a record. Setting S as a RUM in FS-RUM-2 is found to be beneficial for capturing long-term dependencies. Time normalization \u03b7 = 1.0 is empirically determined to work best for RUM models. In Figure 6, time normalization \u03b7 = 1.0 is found to work best for RUM models when gradient clipping norm is also 1.0. Various derivative models of FS-RUM-2 are introduced, such as FS-RUM-2(B)+LR with a learning rate of 0.003, and FS-RUM-2(B)+(S)800-1100 which improves validation performance. Other variations include FS-RUM-2(B)+Norm with \u03b7 = 1.3, and different cell sizes for fast and slow cells in FS-RUM-2(B)+(S) models. FS-RUM-2(B)+(S)900-1200 has fast cells' size of 900 and slow cells' size of 1200."
