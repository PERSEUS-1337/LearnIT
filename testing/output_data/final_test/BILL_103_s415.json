    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Boot Camp Prison Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that Federal prisons are overcrowded, with a capacity of 50,707 inmates housing 72,191. The prison populations are increasing due to Federal Sentencing Guidelines, with projections of 79,000 inmates in 1993, 92,000 in 1995, and 109,000 in 1998. The cost of constructing a medium security Federal prison is $53,173 per bed, while housing a Federal inmate costs $20,072 per year. An alternative to the current system is needed. Boot camp prisons are a cost-effective solution to overcrowding in the prison system. Originally introduced in 1984 in Oklahoma and Georgia, this concept has now spread to 25 states. Despite higher costs per year for counseling and education services, inmates spend a shorter time (between 90 and 120 days) in boot camp, reducing overall costs and overcrowding. For example, New York's boot camp system saved taxpayers an estimated $150 million by December 31, 1991. Boot camps are a cost-effective solution to prison overcrowding, with inmates spending a shorter time in these programs. The Attorney General will establish 10 military-style boot camp prisons within the Bureau of Prisons on closed military installations. These boot camps will provide strict discipline, physical training, education, counseling, and substance abuse treatment for inmates. Each camp will accommodate 200-300 inmates for 90-120 days. The boot camp program for inmates will last up to 120 days, with no more than 20% being Federal prisoners. State prisoners can participate if accepted. Federal prisoners under 25 years old, able-bodied, and convicted of a serious offense may be eligible for placement in a boot camp prison as a sentencing alternative. The boot camp program allows inmates convicted of serious but nonviolent offenses, with no prior serious convictions over 10 days, and who consent to the designation. The sentencing court must find the defendant's offense level is 15 or less. Inmates who refuse to comply with boot camp conditions may be transferred to another facility. Successful completion of boot camp satisfies the period of active incarceration. State prisoners can apply for boot camp placement before sentencing if they meet certain criteria. The Bureau of Prisons must respond to applications within 30 days. State prisoners can apply for boot camp placement before sentencing if they meet specific criteria, including being under 25 years old, having no prior convictions with more than 10 days of incarceration, and being sentenced to a term that can be satisfied by completing 90 to 120 days in a boot camp. The Bureau of Prisons must respond to applications within 30 days to determine eligibility for assignment. State prisoners meeting specific criteria can apply for boot camp placement before sentencing, with eligibility determined by the Bureau of Prisons within 30 days. If placed in a boot camp, inmates must comply with confinement conditions, or they may be transferred back to the state sentencing court. States referring prisoners to boot camps must reimburse the Bureau of Prisons for incarceration costs, with a 20% refund if the program is successfully completed. (g) Post-Release Supervision: States must use funds allocated for aftercare services to provide necessary supervision and support for prisoners upon release. States referring prisoners to boot camps must submit aftercare plans to ensure continued supervision, educational, vocational training, and counseling post-release. The Bureau of Prisons will also develop aftercare plans for federal prisoners to support their reintegration into society. The Attorney General will evaluate boot camp prisons 7 years and 6 months after enactment, comparing recidivism rates, cost-effectiveness, and impact on prison overcrowding. The boot camp prison program will terminate 8 years after the first boot camp is established. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the Bureau of Prisons. Authorized appropriations for the Bureau of Prisons include $150,000,000 for fiscal year 1994. $12,500,000 is allocated for converting closed military bases to boot camp prisons, and $2,500,000 for operating each boot camp for one fiscal year."
