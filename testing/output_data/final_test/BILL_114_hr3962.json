The Act, known as the \"Protecting Individuals From Mass Aerial Surveillance Act of 2015,\" defines key terms such as mobile aerial-view device, law enforcement official or agency, and Federal entity. The Act defines terms like national border, non-Federal entity, surveil, and sensing device. The term \"sensing device\" refers to a device that can remotely acquire personal information using various methods. It does not include equipment for safe air navigation or operation of a MAVD. Public lands are defined as lands owned by the US Government. Federal entities are prohibited from using MAVDs for surveillance purposes related to criminal activities or violations of laws. Exceptions to this rule exist. Exceptions to the prohibition on using MAVDs for surveillance purposes include patrol of borders and national waters to prevent illegal entry, and the use of MAVDs in exigent circumstances to prevent imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm. Exceptions to using MAVDs for surveillance purposes include preventing illegal entry at borders and national waters, as well as using MAVDs in exigent circumstances to prevent imminent danger of harm, terrorist attacks, destruction of evidence, or escape of suspects. Federal entities must maintain records of the facts leading to reasonable suspicion in such cases. Federal entities can use MAVDs to gather evidence related to forest fires, monitor environmental catastrophes, research wildlife management, assess environmental damage, and survey public lands for illegal vegetation. Consent is required when using MAVDs to acquire information about individuals or their property. Law enforcement can use a MAVD with written consent to surveil specific property, persons, or their effects under a Rule 41 warrant. SEC. 5 prohibits Federal entities from identifying individuals in collected information and restricts disclosure to other government agencies. Exceptions apply if there is probable cause of criminal activity and a warrant is obtained. SEC. 6 prohibits the use of evidence collected under these operations. SEC. 6 prohibits the use of evidence obtained in violation of the Act in any legal proceedings. SEC. 7 prohibits solicitation and purchase. SEC. 7 prohibits Federal entities from soliciting or purchasing contracts for MAVD surveillance unless they already have authority to surveil. Personal information obtained from MAVD surveillance by non-Federal entities cannot be purchased without the consent of all individuals involved."
