    "content": "Beginning in 1986, Congress passed legislation to limit Members' mail costs and disclose franking expenditures. This reduced congressional mail postage costs to $23.8 million in the 113th Congress from $177.4 million in the 100th Congress. Critics raise concerns about the franking privilege, especially mass mailings, seen as publicly funded campaign literature. The House reported individual Member mass mailings between 1997 and 2008. The House began reporting volume and cost of individual mass communications in 2009, separate from mass mailings. This report analyzes Member mass mailings from 1997-2008, mass communications from 2009-2011, and both from 2011-2015. It examines the number of communications sent annually, total costs, and the percentage of Members who sent mass communications. The quarterly data on Member mass mailings and communications from 1997-2015 is analyzed to determine variations in volume, costs, and trends. The analysis includes the percentage of Members who sent mass communications and whether volume was higher in election years. Data was compiled from the House's quarterly Statement of Disbursements. The analysis of Member mass mailings and communications from 1997-2015 includes data on mass mailings defined as mail with substantially identical content totaling more than 500 pieces in one session of Congress. Unsolicited mass communication is defined as communication to 500 or more persons with substantially identical content. Examples include radio, TV, newspaper ads, automated calls, facsimiles, and mass emails. House Members sent 1.6 billion pieces of mass mail between 1997 and 2008 and between 2011 and 2014, at a total cost of $322.8 million. House Members sent an average of 94.1 million pieces of mass mail per year, costing $19.0 million annually. The number of mass mail pieces sent ranged from 39.8 million in 2013 to 122.6 million in 1997. Since 2011, both the total pieces and costs of mass mailings have decreased by almost 50%. Between 1997 and 2013, 81% of House Members sent mass mail, but in 2014 and 2015, only 62% and 66% sent mass mail, respectively. Additionally, House Members sent 1.72 billion pieces of mass communication between 2009 and 2011, costing $131.5 million. In 2011, House Members sent a total of 1.72 billion pieces of mass communication, costing $131.5 million. Between 2009 and 2011, 92% of Members sent at least one mass communication, with an average of 1,407,364 pieces sent per Member at a cost of $107,431. In 2011, there was a significant increase in the total number of mass communications, but a decrease in total cost. This is likely due to the rise in electronic communication with no marginal cost and a decrease in mass mailing. House Members sent 1.11 billion pieces of mass communication in 2012, costing $7.4 million, 801 million pieces in 2013 costing $5.7 million, 623 million pieces in 2014 costing $5.1 million, and 568 million pieces in 2015 costing $5.7 million. Data for 2012-2015 no longer include mass mailing volume or cost, but when added, comparable figures for previous years can be obtained. The total number of mass communications sent in 2012-2015 remained similar to 2011, but there was a significant reduction in costs. The average number of mass communication pieces sent annually between 2009 and 2011 was much higher compared to 1997-2008. This increase is due to the inclusive definition of mass communication during that period, which includes various forms of communication. The lack of data on mass communications in 2008 makes it impossible to draw a valid comparison. The House began reporting separate mass mailing and mass communication figures in the second quarter of 2011. Total pieces of mass mailings in 2011 were similar to 2007 but accounted for just 8% of total communications, while non-mail mass communications made up 92%. In 2012, mass communications made up 94.7% of total constituent contact, with mass mailings at 5.3%. The cost per piece for mass mailings was 38 cents, compared to less than 1 cent for mass communications. In 2013, mass communications accounted for 95.3% of total contact, with mass mailings at 4.7%. Costs per piece were 38 cents for mailings and less than a cent for communications. In 2014, mass communications were 93.9% of total contact. In 2014, mass communications made up 93.9% of total constituent contact, with mass mailings at 6.1%. Costs per piece were 39 cents for mailings and less than a cent for communications. In 2015, mass communications accounted for 95.3% of total contact, with mailings at 4.7%. Costs per piece remained stable at 38 cents for mailings and less than a cent for communications. The total number of mass mail pieces sent by House Members follows an eight-quarter cyclical pattern, with peaks in the fourth quarter of the first year and the second and third quarters of the second year of each Congress. The highest peak occurs in the fourth quarter of the first year, with 24.7% of all mass mail sent. The fourth quarter spike in mass mailings is mainly due to a large amount of mail sent in December, at the end of the first session. Increased mailings in the second and third quarters of the second year of each Congress are related to the period just before the 90-day pre-election period when Members are not allowed to send mass mailings. Specifically, mass mail sent in the third quarter of the second year of any Congress must be sent in the first month of the quarter, before the prohibited period in early August. This results in above-average third quarter mass mailing totals for even-numbered years, which somewhat underestimate the increased rate of mailing before the election. The fourth quarter of the second year of each Congress (October-December) includes approximately five weeks during which mass mailings are prohibited. Figure 2 shows the quarterly number of mass mailings and mass communications sent between 1997 and 2015, with variation in the quarterly totals. The quarterly number of mass communications sent showed variation between 2009 and 2015, with peaks in 2009, 2010, and 2013. The data should be interpreted cautiously due to limited data points. Mass mailings volumes may continue on a cyclical pattern, but variations could disappear if other mass communications do not vary. The increase in 2011 suggests changes in Member use of mass communications. Critics cite increased election-year mail costs as evidence of political use of the franking privilege. The fiscal calendar structure creates disparities in election-year and non-election-year mail costs. Comparing mass mailings by fiscal year shows inflated election-year numbers due to the December spike and pre-election increase occurring in the same year. Comparing data by calendar year balances out these spikes, resulting in relatively similar totals. Comparisons of fiscal year data overstate the effect of pre-election increases in mail costs. In analyzing mass mailings, discrepancies are found between fiscal year and calendar year totals. While 2009 and 2010 show little difference, 2011 and 2012 exhibit a significant increase in mass communications. Critics of the franking privilege raise concerns about financial waste and unfair advantages to incumbents in elections, particularly focusing on mass mailings. Critics argue that mass mailings, funded by taxpayers, give incumbents an unfair advantage in elections. Proponents claim it enhances communication between representatives and constituents, promoting accountability and informed voting. The analysis shows that most Representatives use mass communications or mailings to connect with constituents, with a majority sending at least one mass mailing annually. The cost per piece of mass communication is lower than mass mailing, suggesting that new technology may reduce overall communication costs for Congress. The analysis reveals significant quarterly variation in Member mass mailing patterns, with peaks in mailings before election prohibitions. This suggests that mass communications are not evenly distributed throughout a Congress, providing insight into concerns about election-year mailing expenditures. The analysis shows that mass mailing peaks twice, with the larger peak occurring at the end of the first session, not prior to the election. This challenges previous comparisons of election-year and non-election-year franked mail data, as the data may show inflated election-year numbers and suppressed non-election-year numbers due to spikes in mail costs at different times."
