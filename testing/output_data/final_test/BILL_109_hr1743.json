    "content": "UNITED STATES PENSION PLANS. Congress finds that rogue regimes supporting international terrorism pose a significant threat to global security by potentially acquiring weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons. Iran, the primary state sponsor of terrorism, is close to obtaining nuclear capabilities without facing consequences for years of deception. US investors have a vested interest in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The Act requires the President to publish a list of US and foreign entities investing over $20,000,000 in Iran's energy sector every six months. Congress emphasizes divestiture from Iran to prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons. Upon publication of a list in the Federal Register, managers of US Government pension plans, private sector pension plans, and mutual funds should divest investments in listed entities. Future investments in listed entities should be prohibited according to Congress. Managers of US Government pension plans, private sector pension plans, and mutual funds must notify investors if their funds are invested in entities on a list published in the Federal Register. The notification should include the entity's name, investment amount, and potential liability if US sanctions are imposed on Iran. Managers of US pension plans and mutual funds must notify investors if their funds are invested in entities on a list published in the Federal Register. The notification should include the entity's name, investment amount, and potential liability if US sanctions are imposed on Iran. Additionally, managers must include this notification in prospectuses and reports provided to investors. Managers who divest from entities on the Federal Register list do not need to notify investors in prospectuses or reports. SEC. 2. REPORT BY OFFICE OF GLOBAL SECURITY RISKS. The Office of Global Security Risks within the Division of Corporation Finance of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission will issue a report within 30 days of a list being published in the Federal Register under section 206(b). The report will contain a list of US and foreign entities identified, determine if their operations in Iran pose risks to the US, and assess if they face US litigation, sanctions, or similar circumstances that could impact their financial condition or operations."
