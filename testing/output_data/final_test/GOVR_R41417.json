This practice, akin to \"forum shopping,\" can be seen as strategic manipulation of legal processes for a favorable outcome. Some view it as a way for plaintiffs to seek redress under favorable laws, while others warn of a global impact on speech standards. \"Libel tourism\" involves filing defamation suits in countries with plaintiff-friendly libel laws, often with few prior connections to the jurisdiction. U.S. authors and publishers are vulnerable to foreign libel judgments due to differences in defamation laws. England's plaintiff-friendly libel laws and low jurisdiction bar attract libel tourists seeking redress for reputational injuries. \"English courts are popular for defamation suits against U.S. nationals due to plaintiff-friendly libel laws. Winning a judgment in a foreign court does not guarantee receiving the money awarded. U.S. courts may be involved in enforcing foreign court judgments against U.S. defendants to address libel tourism.\" The Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act (SPEECH Act) prohibits U.S. courts from enforcing foreign defamation judgments unless they meet specific requirements. Both U.S. and English defamation laws have a common origin but differ in their approach, with England being a common destination for libel tourists. Traditionally, defamation liability under both laws was strict, requiring only proof of a defamatory statement. The differences between U.S. and English defamation law are primarily due to the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the First Amendment. U.S. defamation law places the burden of proof on plaintiffs, making it harder for them to win cases. The U.S. Supreme Court established a federal constitutional privilege in defamation law in New York Times v. Sullivan, requiring public officials to prove \"actual malice\" for damages. The U.S. Supreme Court established the standard of \"actual malice\" in defamation cases in New York Times v. Sullivan, extending this protection to public figures in Gertz v. Robert Welch. This standard requires knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth, derived from the First Amendment's protection of free speech and press. The Supreme Court rejected English law of strict liability in defamation cases, requiring fault amounting to negligence or higher for a plaintiff to recover damages in the U.S. courts. English courts maintain traditional common law elements for public officials, allowing a defense known as the Reynolds privilege, which is based on responsible journalism. In Reynolds v. Times, the court considered statements in the newspaper related to public figures should be covered by a qualified privilege known as the Reynolds privilege. This privilege is limited in application and determined by the judge if the statement is in the public interest. Defendants in libel tourism suits in England have not been able to invoke the Reynolds privilege. In England, libel suits cannot invoke the Reynolds privilege due to not qualifying as media or being deemed privileged by the judge. British libel law has become more protective of free speech, but this may not impact libel cases against U.S. individuals. The U.S. response to libel tourism may prompt a re-examination of English libel laws, with proposals for reforms such as shifting the burden of proof and implementing a one-year statute of limitations for Internet libel cases. Libel tourism involves cases arising from Internet speech, with a notable example being a suit against an author for alleged defamation. Despite the book being published in the US, an English court allowed the case to proceed due to online sales to English residents. The author did not defend herself, leading to a default judgment with damages and orders to destroy the book. This raised concerns about limitations on free speech and writing about national security matters. The phenomenon of libel tourism raised concerns among lawmakers and editorial boards about its potential negative impact on free speech and national security. Foreign libel suits against U.S. defendants in English courts were seen as a threat to the strong free-speech protections of the U.S. Constitution. The possibility of civil or criminal liability in foreign courts was feared to have a chilling effect on speech. The lack of a strong national law on foreign libel judgments in the United States could have a chilling effect on speech, as civil or criminal liability may deter protected expression. State laws govern the recognition of foreign judgments in U.S. courts, with no federal uniform rules or international agreements in place. This could inhibit the exchange of vital ideas in a functioning democracy. Foreign libel judgments can be enforced in another state where a defendant has assets based on principles of international comity. Some states' recognition statutes are based on Hilton v. Guyot or uniform state acts, which do not require reciprocity for recognition. In contrast, countries like England require reciprocity for recognizing foreign judgments. The principle of international comity allows for the recognition of foreign judgments in courts, based on principles outlined in the Hilton v. Guyot case. This recognition is contingent upon a fair trial, impartial administration of justice, and absence of prejudice or fraud in the foreign court system. Many states have adopted similar approaches to recognizing foreign judgments. The 1962 Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act and the 2005 Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act provide statutory language adopted by many states to recognize foreign judgments. These laws state that final and enforceable foreign judgments shall be recognized, with exceptions based on public policy. The 1962 Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act and the 2005 Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act allow states to recognize foreign judgments, with exceptions based on public policy. The 2005 version offers a broader public policy exception, allowing a state court to refuse recognition if the judgment itself is repugnant to the state's public policy or to the United States as a whole. This exception allows for a judicial examination of the laws and procedures under which the foreign judgment was rendered. The 2005 Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act broadens the public policy exception, allowing state courts to refuse recognition of foreign judgments if they are repugnant to the state's public policy or to the United States as a whole. This exception permits a judicial review of the laws and procedures behind the foreign judgment. Some U.S. courts have declined to enforce foreign libel judgments based on public policy exceptions, citing conflicts with the U.S. Constitution. Some states have enacted statutes addressing the libel tourism phenomenon by making foreign defamation judgments unenforceable unless the foreign country's defamation law provides \"at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press\" as U.S. law. These statutes codify and expand public policy exceptions applied by state courts. The statutes codify and expand public policy exceptions for libel suits under states' foreign judgment recognition statutes. New York, Florida, and California have expanded personal jurisdiction over individuals obtaining foreign defamation judgments. The statutes in New York, Florida, and California expand personal jurisdiction for defamation cases involving individuals with connections to those states. This change allows courts to declare foreign defamation judgments unenforceable and protect defendants from liability. This addresses issues faced by individuals like Rachel Ehrenfeld in libel tourism cases. The 111th Congress passed legislation to address this issue. The 111th Congress passed the SPEECH Act on August 10, 2010, avoiding constitutional questions raised by other proposals like the Free Speech Protection Act. These proposals could have allowed for personal jurisdiction over U.S. individuals in foreign defamation lawsuits, potentially exceeding due process boundaries. The SPEECH Act aimed to uphold fairness and international comity in defamation cases. The SPEECH Act, passed by the 111th Congress on August 10, 2010, aims to uphold fairness and international comity in defamation cases. It prohibits U.S. courts from enforcing foreign defamation judgments unless certain requirements are met, but does not allow for counter-suits against plaintiffs in foreign libel cases. Advocates argue that without the threat of a counter-suit, the Act may not sufficiently prevent a chilling effect on the speech of U.S. persons. The SPEECH Act, passed in 2010, prevents U.S. courts from enforcing foreign defamation judgments unless certain conditions are met. These conditions include ensuring the judgment aligns with the First Amendment, due process requirements, or section 230 of the Communications Act. U.S. citizens can challenge foreign judgments in federal district court under these circumstances. The SPEECH Act allows parties to challenge foreign defamation judgments in federal court if they believe the judgment violates the Constitution. It also allows for the removal of state court actions to federal court under certain conditions. The Act ensures that parties have the right to oppose recognition or enforcement of foreign judgments and may be awarded attorney fees if successful. Additionally, the Act appears to preempt state laws related to foreign judgments. The SPEECH Act may conflict with state libel tourism statutes, potentially preempting state laws under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Federal preemption can occur when there is a conflict between state and federal law or when Congress intended to exclusively occupy the field. The Court has identified two forms of implied preemption. The SPEECH Act, like many federal statutes, does not have an express preemption provision. However, its language and legislative history suggest that Congress intended to preempt state laws conflicting with its purpose. The primary evidence of Congress's preemptive intent is the explicit language of the SPEECH Act itself. The SPEECH Act does not have an express preemption provision, but its language and legislative history suggest Congress intended to preempt state laws conflicting with its purpose. The statute applies in all \"domestic\" courts, including state and federal courts, and is likely to preempt state laws related to foreign judgments. The preemptive effect may be constrained by constitutional principles like federalism and separation of powers, leading courts to apply a presumption against preemption. Ultimately, the determination of preemption depends on how the federal law is characterized. The SPEECH Act, while not explicitly preempting state laws, is likely to preempt state laws related to foreign judgments. The decision on preemption depends on how the federal law is characterized, with the Act ensuring uniformity in federal and state treatment of foreign libel judgments. Courts should not be dissuaded by federalism or separation of powers in deeming state law preempted by the Act, as it primarily addresses foreign affairs. Non-enforcement of foreign libel judgments under the Act could impact the enforcement of U.S. libel judgments in foreign courts. Prior to the enactment of the SPEECH Act, concern existed over the impact of foreign libel suits on U.S. libel judgments in foreign courts. Some countries may refuse to enforce U.S. libel judgments if U.S. courts refuse to enforce foreign libel judgments. The United States has plaintiff-friendly laws in certain areas like antitrust, which some countries have tried to undermine. U.S. diplomatic efforts to oppose these actions could be compromised if the SPEECH Act is seen as employing similar tactics. The SPEECH Act addresses the threat of foreign libel suits on Americans' freedom of speech rights by prohibiting domestic courts from enforcing foreign defamation judgments that violate the First Amendment or due process requirements. The SPEECH Act prohibits U.S. courts from enforcing foreign defamation judgments that violate the First Amendment or due process, preempting state libel tourism laws. Congress believed a uniform national approach was necessary to prevent a chilling effect on U.S. persons' speech. The passage of the SPEECH Act may impact international comity by affecting the enforcement of U.S. libel judgments in foreign courts. Countries that require reciprocal recognition of judgments may be affected. Additionally, U.S. plaintiff-friendly laws could face opposition from countries whose libel judgments are impacted by the SPEECH Act."
