    "content": "Executive orders issued by the President require federal contractors to adhere to specific conditions in their contracts, raising questions about presidential authority. These orders cite the President's constitutional authority and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPASA), which allows the President to prescribe policies for promoting \"economy\" and \"efficiency\" in federal procurement. Legal challenges have been made against orders encouraging project labor agreements, requiring contractors to inform employees of their rights regarding unions, and directing agencies to include certain provisions in contracts. The President's executive orders require federal contractors to follow specific conditions, raising questions about presidential authority. Legal challenges have been made against orders directing agencies to impose certain conditions on contractors, with concerns about the President's authority under the FPASA. The practical and legal significance of these orders is highlighted by the substantial amount of federal procurement activities, totaling $541.1 billion in FY2010. In FY2010, federal procurement activities totaled $541.1 billion, approximately four percent of U.S. GDP. Around 22% of U.S. workers are employed by entities subject to requirements from federal contractors. Concerns have been raised about the broad interpretation of presidential authority to regulate the economy through executive orders. This report examines the historical background and legal issues surrounding executive orders for federal contractors, particularly those issued under the FPASA. The report discusses executive orders issued by Presidents under the FPASA, addressing potential limitations and congressional responses. Executive orders can have the force of law and impact private conduct through government contracts. Past Presidents have utilized executive orders to influence government procurement. Presidents have issued executive orders to leverage government procurement spending for socio-economic policies, sparking controversy over the constitutionality and congressional prerogatives involved. These orders are based on the President's powers under Article II of the Constitution or delegated powers from FPASA. The procurement process to further socio-economic policies of the President has been issued based on his constitutional authority as commander-in-chief, with orders under FPASA authorizing the President to prescribe policies for efficiency and economy. There is debate over whether Congress intended to delegate broad authority over procurement or only narrow aspects. The President's authority over procurement under FPASA is debated, with questions about inherent authority. Challenges to executive orders may depend on whether they are issued under statutory or constitutional authority. Courts have analyzed presidential actions under FPASA, focusing on statutory interpretation, legislative history, and prior uses of presidential authority. Challenges to contractor-related executive orders based on nondelegation doctrine have been unsuccessful, as it asserts that Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the executive branch. The nondelegation doctrine limits Congress from delegating legislative power to other branches of government. The Supreme Court requires an \"intelligible principle\" for executive branch officials to follow when delegated authority. This doctrine has not been used to strike down a congressional delegation since 1935. Challenges to contractor-related executive orders based on constitutional arguments have referenced Justice Jackson's three-part scheme for analyzing presidential actions. In Youngstown, the Supreme Court struck down President Truman's executive order directing the seizure of the steel mills during the Korean War, deeming it unconstitutional due to separation of powers concerns and lack of authorization from Congress. Justice Jackson's three-part scheme for analyzing presidential actions has become influential in constitutional arguments. The Supreme Court in Youngstown ruled against President Truman's seizure of steel mills, citing separation of powers and lack of congressional authorization. Justice Jackson's framework outlines three circumstances for presidential authority: when granted by Congress, when acting independently, and in situations of uncertain authority distribution. In Youngstown, the Supreme Court ruled against President Truman's seizure of steel mills, citing separation of powers and lack of congressional authorization. Justice Jackson's framework outlines three circumstances for presidential authority: when granted by Congress, when acting independently, and in situations of uncertain authority distribution. In instances where presidential action is \"incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress,\" the President's power is at its minimum and must rest upon exclusive powers. The courts can uphold such actions only by disabling Congress from acting on the subject. This supported the majority's holding that the President lacked the authority to seize the steel mills in Youngstown. Some commentators argue that certain contractor-related executive orders may be invalidated based on separation of powers concerns. However, executive orders based on authority delegated to the President under the FPASA are generally considered valid. Challenges to executive orders often fall into two categories based on the arguments raised and court treatment. Cases challenging executive orders related to contractors' anti-discrimination and affirmative action obligations, issued before and after the FPASA, raise different legal issues. Key cases are discussed chronologically to highlight developments in the case law over time. Some argue that certain executive orders may be invalidated based on separation of powers concerns, but orders under the FPASA are generally considered valid. Challenges to executive orders fall into two categories based on arguments raised and court treatment. Presidents have issued executive orders since 1941 requiring federal contractors to promote socio-economic policies collectively. Legal challenges to the President's authority arose in the 1964 case Farmer v. Philadelphia Electric Co., where the court ruled that employees must exhaust administrative remedies before suing for discrimination under Executive Order 10925. This order prohibited discrimination based on race in employment. The court in Farmer v. Philadelphia Electric Co. ruled that Executive Order 10925 did not authorize a private cause of action without exhausting administrative remedies. The order prohibited discrimination based on race in employment. In Farkas v. Texas Instruments, Inc., the defendants did not challenge the validity of the order. In Farkas v. Texas Instruments, Inc., the court held that Executive Order 10925 does not allow for a private right of action. The claims for breach of contractual nondiscrimination provisions were dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. The court assumed the validity of the executive order, and the defendants did not question its validity. In Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Secretary of Labor, the validity of Executive Order 11246 was challenged, which imposed anti-discrimination requirements on federal contractors. The Philadelphia Plan was issued under this order, requiring affirmative action for equal employment opportunities. The Third Circuit upheld the validity of the Philadelphia Plan, requiring bidders for federal construction contracts in the Philadelphia area to submit affirmative action programs for minority manpower utilization. The court found that Executive authority to impose non-discrimination provisions falls under Congressional authorization. The court upheld the validity of the Philadelphia Plan, stating that Congress granted the President general authority to act for the protection of federal interests. Executive Order 11246 was issued to address discrimination in employment affecting federal projects, not to impose social legislation on states wholesale. The inclusion of the plan as a pre-condition for federal assistance was within the implied authority granted to the President. The court upheld the validity of the Philadelphia Plan, stating that the inclusion of the plan as a pre-condition for federal assistance was within the implied authority of the President. The court also rejected challenges to the executive order under the National Labor Relations Act and the Department of Labor's interpretation of the affirmative action provision. The Third Circuit upheld the validity of the Philadelphia Plan, dismissing plaintiffs' claims that it violated Title VII by establishing specific goals for minority employment and interfering with seniority systems. The court found that the plan did not require preferential treatment based on workforce imbalances as prohibited by Title VII. The court upheld the Philadelphia Plan, stating it did not require preferential treatment based on workforce imbalances prohibited by Title VII. The court also ruled that Title VII did not prevent interference with seniority systems through executive orders or the Philadelphia Plan, a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court in International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States. The Fifth Circuit held in United States v. East Texas Motor Freight Systems, Inc. that a bona fide seniority system cannot be prohibited by Executive Order 11246, as Congress exempted it from Title VII. The court cited Youngstown to support this, stating that the President cannot make unlawful in an executive order what Congress has declared lawful. The executive order is authorized by procurement authority. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered the legality of a seniority system under Title VII and Executive Order 11246. The court found the Fifth Circuit's reasoning persuasive and dismissed the government's arguments regarding statutory language and legislative history. The court noted that Congress did not intend for the executive order to go beyond Title VII in addressing discrimination perpetuated by seniority systems. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered the legality of a seniority system under Title VII and Executive Order 11246. The court dismissed the government's arguments regarding statutory language and legislative history, noting that Congress did not intend for the executive order to go beyond Title VII in addressing discrimination perpetuated by seniority systems. In Chrysler Corporation v. Brown, litigation arose due to regulations promulgated under Executive Order 11246, requiring public disclosure of contractors' compliance with anti-discrimination and affirmative action requirements. Despite being exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA, records obtained or generated pursuant to the Executive Order were subject to disclosure. The Supreme Court considered whether OFCCP regulations provided the \"authorization by law\" required under the Trade Secrets Act for the release of records obtained or generated pursuant to Executive Order 11246. Chrysler objected to the proposed release of certain documents, arguing that the regulations did not have the force of law. The Department of Labor regulations issued under Executive Order 11246 lacked the necessary congressional authority, as the legislative grants of authority for the disclosure regulations were not contemplated in the order. The Court found a remote relationship between the grant of legislative authority and the challenged regulations, which were supposed to end discrimination in government contracting. The Court found that the Department of Labor regulations lacked necessary congressional authority to end discrimination in government contracting. It emphasized the need for a \"nexus\" between executive actions and delegated authority from Congress under the FPASA. The Court stated that regulations must have a reasonable connection to legislative grants of authority to be binding like statutes. The D.C. Circuit's decision in AFL-CIO v. Kahn challenged Executive Order 12092, which required agencies to include wage and price standards in contracts. The labor unions argued that the order exceeded the President's authority under FPASA and violated federal law. The district court agreed, stating that the order did not align with the legislative grants of authority. The court found that Executive Order 12092, which required agencies to include wage and price standards in contracts, was not authorized by FPASA or the Council on Wage and Price Stability Act. The order was also deemed unconstitutional due to separation of powers issues. The en banc court of appeals reversed the decision regarding Executive Order 12092, stating that it was within the President's power under FPASA. The court found that the goals of FPASA, such as \"economy\" and \"efficiency,\" were broad terms that encompassed various factors. It concluded that the President's order was within his statutory authority under FPASA, based on the legislative history indicating congressional intent to give the President broad authority over government management issues. The court found a close nexus between the executive order and economy and efficiency in procurement, despite temporary price increases on certain contracts. The procurement compliance program authorized by the order was not barred under COWPSA, as it did not prohibit mandatory wage and price controls under FPASA. The court emphasized that the program's requirements were not mandatory for all, only for those wishing to do business with the Government. The court's decision on the executive order emphasized the President's need to use procurement authority in line with the FPASA's structure and purpose. The dissent disagreed, stating that the FPASA does not allow using procurement to control the economy. The court's decision on the executive order emphasized the President's authority to use procurement in line with the FPASA's purpose. The dissent argued that the FPASA does not permit using procurement to control the economy. The majority and dissent disagreed on the interpretation of FPASA, with the majority focusing on statutory interpretation rather than broader separation of powers issues. The dissent raised concerns about potential unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch. The court affirmed the President's powers under the FPASA, ruling in favor of the plaintiffs in Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Friedman regarding Executive Order 11246 requirements for insurance underwriters. The Fourth Circuit found the DOL's determination invalid based on the \"reasonably close nexus\" tests of Chrysler and Kahn. The plaintiffs challenged their classification as \"subcontractors\" under Executive Order 11246, arguing that the regulations exceeded the scope of the order or constituted an invalid delegation of legislative authority. The district court disagreed, stating that the regulations directly aimed at implementing the order's purpose of combating employment discrimination through government procurement. The court found that the regulations were aimed at implementing civil rights programs by requiring government contractors to submit affirmative action plans. The Fourth Circuit reversed, stating that the application of the executive order to the insurance company exceeded legislative authority. The court found that the application of Executive Order 11246 to Liberty Mutual exceeded legislative authority, as none of the possible sources of congressional grants of authority reasonably contemplated such requirement. Unlike previous cases, the court in Liberty Mutual held that there was not a close enough nexus between the efficiency and economy criteria of the FPASA and the requirements imposed on Liberty. The court in Liberty Mutual found that the connection between the efficiency and economy criteria of the FPASA and the requirements imposed on contractors under the executive order was too attenuated to justify the application of Executive Order 11246 to Liberty Mutual. Unlike previous cases, there was not a close enough nexus between the two. The court in Liberty Mutual found that the connection between the efficiency and economy criteria of the FPASA and the requirements imposed on contractors under the executive order was too attenuated to justify the application of Executive Order 11246 to Liberty Mutual. Subsequent courts generally declined to follow Liberty Mutual in requiring presidential findings for procurement-related executive orders. The court mentioned Youngstown in a footnote, citing it as preventing consideration of the argument for the executive order's authority. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found Executive Order 12954 invalid in 1996, as it conflicted with the NLRA and was deemed \"regulatory in nature.\" The order directed the Secretary of Labor to create regulations for debarment of contractors hiring permanent replacements for striking workers, issued after failed Congressional amendments to the NLRA. The Chamber and business groups challenged the order on these grounds. The Chamber and business groups challenged Executive Order 12954, arguing it conflicted with the NLRA and exceeded the President's authority under FPASA. The district court upheld the order, citing Dalton v. Specter, but the appeals court reversed, questioning its reviewability and validity. The court discussed the ability of courts to review the legality of the President's order and actions of subordinate officials. It found Executive Order 12954 invalid for conflicting with NLRA provisions on hiring permanent replacements during strikes. The court found Executive Order 12954 invalid for conflicting with NLRA provisions on hiring permanent replacements during strikes, stating that the order exceeded the President's authority under FPASA. The court noted the potential effects of the order's policy upon \"thousands of American companies\" and \"millions.\" The court found Executive Order 12954 invalid for conflicting with NLRA provisions on hiring permanent replacements during strikes, stating that the order exceeded the President's authority under FPASA. The court noted the potential effects of the order's policy upon \"thousands of American companies\" and \"millions of American workers,\" as well as the implications of the broad authority claimed by the President under FPASA. The court highlighted the breadth of presidential power under FPASA in subsequent decisions. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld Executive Order 13202, allowing contractors to use project labor agreements on federally funded contracts. The court found that the President had the constitutional authority to issue the order and criticized the district court's decision to invalidate it. The D.C. Circuit determined that the order was within the President's supervisory authority over the Executive Branch. The D.C. Circuit upheld Executive Order 13202, allowing contractors to use project labor agreements on federally funded contracts. The court found that the order was within the President's supervisory authority over the Executive Branch and not preempted by the NLRA. The order directed executive branch employees in their implementation of statutory authority and was considered proprietary, not regulatory. The court distinguished this case from Reich, where the NLRA preempted the executive order because it was regulatory. The D.C. Circuit upheld Executive Order 13202, allowing contractors to use project labor agreements on federally funded contracts. The court found that the order was within the President's supervisory authority over the Executive Branch and not preempted by the NLRA. The order was considered proprietary, not regulatory, as it did not address projects unrelated to the Government's proprietary interest. Executive Order 13201 was also found not preempted by the NLRA, with the President possessing authority to issue the order under FPASA for economy and efficiency in procurement. The D.C. Circuit upheld Executive Order 13202, allowing contractors to use project labor agreements on federally funded contracts. The court found that the order was within the President's supervisory authority over the Executive Branch and not preempted by the NLRA. The order was considered proprietary, not regulatory, as it did not address projects unrelated to the Government's proprietary interest. The court reversed a district court decision regarding a provision in a contract of $100,000 obligating contractors to post notices informing employees of their rights not to join a union or pay mandatory dues. The court found that the NLRA preemption doctrine did not apply to the order as it did not conflict with the NLRA. The court upheld Executive Order 13465, requiring contractors to use E-Verify to check work authorization. Business groups challenged the order, citing various legal grounds. The court upheld Executive Order 13465, requiring contractors to use E-Verify to check work authorization, despite arguments that it exceeded statutory and constitutional authority. The court found that the Secretary of Homeland Security did not \"require\" contractors to use E-Verify in violation of the IIRIRA, as it was the executive order and final rule that mandated it for government contracts. The court emphasized that entering into contracts with the government is a voluntary choice. The court upheld Executive Order 13465, requiring contractors to use E-Verify for government contracts. It emphasized that being a government contractor is a voluntary choice, rejecting arguments that it was not truly voluntary for those reliant on government contracts. The court found that the executive order and final rule did not \"require\" the use of E-Verify, as individuals could choose not to contract with the government. The court upheld Executive Order 13465, requiring contractors to use E-Verify for government contracts, stating that it was within the President's authority under FPASA. The court found a \"reasonably close nexus\" between the order and the goals of FPASA, noting that contractors with rigorous employment eligibility policies are more efficient and dependable procurement sources. The court upheld Executive Order 13465, requiring contractors to use E-Verify for government contracts, stating that it was within the President's authority under FPASA. The court found a \"reasonably close nexus\" between the order and the goals of FPASA, emphasizing the importance of contractors with rigorous employment eligibility policies for efficient procurement sources. In Chrysler and Liberty Mutual cases, regulations under Executive Order 11246 lacked nexus to congressionally delegated authority, leading to invalidity. Conflicts with other laws have also rendered requirements of executive orders invalid, as seen in Reich where debarment of contractors conflicted with the NLRA. The courts have found conflicts between Executive Orders and other laws, leading to invalidity in some cases. However, in Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, an executive order on the use of PLAs in federal contracting was upheld based on the President's constitutional authority. Further developments in the case law are possible. Possible future actions in the realm of government contracting include the continuation of issuing executive orders by Presidents, potential legislation by Congress to amend or repeal executive orders, and the clarification of presidential authority over federal contractors through amendments to FPASA. Congress may also pass legislation targeting specific requirements in this area. The 112th Congress enacted legislation to prevent disclosure of contractors' political contributions and expenditures in federal contracts. This legislation prohibited defense agencies from requiring contractors to submit political information as part of the solicitation or contract performance. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, barred the use of funds to recommend or require disclosure of political contributions or expenditures from persons submitting offers for federal contracts."
