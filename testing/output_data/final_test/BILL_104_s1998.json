    "content": "The Secretary of the Interior will negotiate with Alaska Native Village Corporations for the conveyance of lands in the Cook Inlet Region of Alaska within 180 days. This is in partial fulfillment of the acreage entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. If the Secretary successfully negotiates with a Village Corporation within 180 days, the conveyance obligation will be suspended. The Secretary will then convey lands or provide financial consideration to the Village Corporation. If no agreement is reached within 80 days, the Secretary will consult with Cook Inlet Region, Inc. regarding subsurface entitlement. The Secretary must convey 50 percent of the West Side Lands to Village Corporations within 210 days of enactment, or by operation of law 240 days after. Title to the lands will be vested in the Village Corporations regardless of selection priority. Upon completion, expedited negotiations will begin. The Secretary will negotiate with Village Corporations to convey remaining West Side Lands within 180 days. If agreements are not reached, a report will be filed with the Senate and House Committees explaining the lack of agreement. If agreements are not reached within 180 days, litigation may be initiated to seek conveyance of remaining lands. Exclusive jurisdiction is with the US District Court for Alaska, and the Deficiency Agreement benefits Alaska Natives. The \"West Side Lands\" are those selected by Village Corporations under the Settlement Act. Corporations under the Settlement Act must adhere to the existing Village Corporation selection priority ranking from 1974.
