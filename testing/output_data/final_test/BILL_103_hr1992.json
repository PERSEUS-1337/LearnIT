The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to specify factors for determining if a species is endangered or threatened, including habitat destruction, overutilization, disease, and regulatory inadequacy. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to consider factors like habitat destruction, overutilization, disease, regulatory inadequacy, and other natural or manmade factors affecting a species' existence. The listing of a species must be in the public interest, considering factors like technical practicability of recovery, biological significance, data quality, costs to public and private sectors, and impacts on non-use value. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to consider impacts on non-Federal property, the environment, other species, scientific benefits, and other effects resulting from applying protections to species. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to Section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to require blind peer review of information and analyses on species or habitat before making determinations. The panel of experts selected by the Inspector General must not be affiliated with the Secretary's department. The Secretary must consider the panel's report, make it public, and provide a response in the final rule preamble. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to prevent bias by prohibiting individuals involved in determining species status from receiving funding related to that species. Additionally, the Act now requires estimation of species numbers. SEC. 5 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to require the Secretary to estimate and publish the number of species in proposed rules. The estimate must be periodically reviewed and used for determinations. SEC. 6 applies the emergency listing process to emergency situations. SEC. 6 amends the Endangered Species Act to address immediate threats of extinction. SEC. 7 limits take prohibition before a recovery plan is completed. SEC. 8 eliminates citizen suits against private parties. SEC. 8 amends the Endangered Species Act to eliminate citizen suits against private parties. SEC. 9 addresses compensation for diminution in value of private property rights. SEC. 19 addresses compensation for diminution in value of private property rights. Federal agency heads must compensate private property owners for any decrease in value caused by their actions under the Act, even if it is temporary or does not result in a complete deprivation of all use or value. They must determine if their regulations or activities result in compensable diminution in value of private property. Compensation must be provided within 60 days of issuance. The Federal agency must offer compensation to private property owners within 60 days of any regulation or action that diminishes the property's value. Owners can reject the offer and file a claim for fair market value in the United States Claims Court. Alternatively, owners of lands can exchange affected lands in accordance with Federal law. The amendment allows private property owners to receive compensation for any regulation or action that diminishes their property's value. Owners can also accept compensation under other laws for tax benefits, mineral rights credits, and comparable offers by the United States. Any cash settlement from the United States Claims Court will be paid from the land and water conservation fund. The amendment applies to any activity of the United States Government after the enactment of this Act."
