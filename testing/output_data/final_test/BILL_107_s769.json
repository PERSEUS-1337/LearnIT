    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Carbon Conservation Act\" and includes a Carbon Sequestration Program. The International Carbon Conservation Act establishes a Carbon Sequestration Program through an implementing panel within the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The panel consists of various government officials and experts in carbon sequestration practices. The Chief of the Forest Service acts as the chairperson of the panel. The Chief of the Forest Service chairs the implementing panel for the Carbon Sequestration Program. A carbon sequestration project outside the US must last at least 30 years, increase carbon sequestration, and be accepted by the panel. Project proposals are accepted if they meet specific criteria. The Carbon Sequestration Program requires project proposals to include a needs assessment, identify benefits of carbon sequestration practices, and agree to carry out such practices. Additionally, proposals must include an agreement for verification of compliance with approved projects. Compliance standards are established under the program. The needs assessment for a carbon sequestration project involves evaluating the project's necessity and the sponsor's ability to implement sequestration practices. The assessment is developed by the project sponsor in collaboration with various organizations and verifiers. The project sponsor must contract with entities to carry out carbon sequestration practices that provide additional sequestration and contribute to reducing greenhouse gases over a 30-year period. Compliance with the approved project must be verified. Under a carbon sequestration project proposal, the sponsor must provide verification through a third party that the project is sequestering carbon as approved by the implementing panel. Criteria for evaluating the benefits of carbon sequestration practices will be developed by the Chief of the Forest Service in consultation with the implementing panel. The Chief of the Forest Service, in consultation with an implementing panel, will develop criteria for evaluating carbon sequestration project proposals. These criteria will prioritize native forest preservation and reforestation of former forest land not forested for at least 10 years. Carbon sequestration investment credits will not be allocated to projects primarily focused on commercial timber growth or replacing native ecological systems with timber plantations. The carbon sequestration program aims to prioritize biodiversity enhancement, prevention of greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion management, soil fertility restoration, and project duration. Guidelines will be established for quantifying benefits under the program. The guidelines for quantifying carbon sequestration in project proposals should include methodologies for measuring carbon sequestered, ensuring project duration, verifying additional sequestration, evaluating displacement of deforestation, and promoting project benefits. The guidelines for quantifying carbon sequestration in project proposals should promote sustainable development, protect traditional land tenure of indigenous people, consult with experts in carbon storage verification, and use information from the Energy Information Administration. The Director of the National Institute of Standards is responsible for verification standards in the carbon sequestration program. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in consultation with other members, shall establish verification standards for the carbon sequestration program. The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, with the Secretary of Agriculture, will monitor carbon sequestration improvements and compliance with project approvals. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this program. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the program established under subsection (a) for approval of projects. The Export-Import Bank of the United States can provide financing for carbon sequestration projects outside the country. The bank may offer credit up to 75 percent of the project cost if it aligns with the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945. Additionally, equity investment insurance is also addressed in the following section. Equity investment insurance can be obtained for property used in approved carbon sequestration projects outside the US through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, subject to their determination of consistency with relevant provisions."
