    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act\". Congress found that prior to December 7, 1956, retired members of the uniformed services with at least 20 years of service were led to believe they would receive fully paid lifetime health care. This was based on recruiting tactics used by government officials. The retired officers of the World War II and Korean War era were promised free health care for life after serving at least 20 years. However, because there was no authority to make such promises and Congress never ratified them, the court can only hope that Congress will fulfill these promises made in good faith. The court upholds the judgment against retirees' breach-of-contract claim as Congress never ratified the promises made for free health care. Only Congress can fulfill these promises made in good faith to World War II and Korean War era retirees. After multiple base closures and drawdowns of military medical facilities, access to \"space available\" health care for retired uniformed services members was limited despite previous promises of fully paid lifetime health care upon retirement. Access to health care for military retirees is limited, despite promises of lifetime coverage. The TRICARE program only covers retirees over 65, leaving those under 65 without adequate care. This lack of healthcare is discouraging young individuals from pursuing a military career. Recruiters made promises to veterans from World War II and the Korean War era to provide high-quality healthcare for all retired uniformed service members. SEC. 3. Coverage of military retirees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The amendment to Section 1108 of title 10, United States Code, allows for health care coverage for retirees and dependents through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. Eligible beneficiaries include members or former members of the uniformed services and unremarried former spouses of such members. Eligible beneficiaries, including dependents of deceased or living members of the uniformed services, may enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit plan under chapter 89 of title 5. Health Benefit plan under chapter 89 of title 5 allows for self-only or self and family coverage, including dependents. Eligible individuals do not need to meet additional criteria for enrollment. Members or former members under specific sections are considered employees for family determination. Eligible beneficiaries can enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. An eligible beneficiary enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program can receive health care in a military medical treatment facility and may change health benefits plans. The Government will contribute to the health benefits plan for the beneficiary. The Government contribution for an eligible beneficiary in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program is capped at the amount for an employee in the same plan. Health benefits plans must maintain separate risk pools, and the Secretary of Defense will reimburse eligible beneficiaries for health care expenses under TRICARE Standard. Chapter 89 of Title 5 is amended to allow reimbursement for health care costs not covered by the health benefits plan but would have been paid by the Department of Defense under TRICARE Standard. The amendments made by this section will provide health care coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, effective October 1, 2005. Additionally, reimbursement for TRICARE pharmacy benefits at TRICARE network pharmacy levels will be available to certain military retirees and dependents in hardship cases. The Secretary will reimburse eligible individuals for pharmacy benefits from non-TRICARE network pharmacies if certified by a physician as having no access due to physical or medical constraints. Eligible individuals are described in section 1108(b) of title 10, United States Code with another insurance plan. Eligible individuals under section 1108(b) of title 10, United States Code with another insurance plan providing primary coverage for health benefits. SEC. 5. WAIVER OF MEDICARE PART B PREMIUM FOR CERTAIN MILITARY RETIREES. The amendment to Section 1839 of the Social Security Act waives the monthly premium for eligible individuals enrolled in Medicare Part B, including retired military personnel and their spouses. The amendment exempts certain individuals, including military retirees and their spouses, from paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B. The amendments made by this section apply to premiums for months starting from January 2005. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will use a rebate methodology to provide rebates to eligible individuals for premiums paid under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003."
