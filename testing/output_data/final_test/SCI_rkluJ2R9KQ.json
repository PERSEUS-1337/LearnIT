    "content": "This paper presents a new framework for learning algorithms to solve online combinatorial optimization problems by connecting primal-dual methods with reinforcement learning and introducing adversarial distributions. The models tested on various optimization problems show behaviors consistent with traditional optimal algorithms. Machine learning has significantly improved our ability to solve previously challenging problems. The paper explores using machine learning to learn algorithms for classic combinatorial optimization problems. It aims to connect traditional algorithms and complexity theory concepts to create uniform algorithms that work for inputs of all lengths. Previous approaches using ML techniques have struggled with training difficulties. The paper discusses the challenges of training machine learning models for combinatorial optimization problems, highlighting the difficulty of back-propagation and gradient descent over long sequences. A novel approach involves learning \"convolution masks\" of finite size to solve problems on inputs of arbitrary length, but the resulting learning problems are complex. The primal-dual framework is identified as offering efficient solutions for combinatorial optimization problems, with potential for online algorithms. The curr_chunk discusses the use of reinforcement learning in optimization problems, specifically in the Markov Decision Process framework. It involves training two agents - U for updating data structures and D for making decisions based on input units. The goal is to optimize rewards by learning to maintain a data structure and making decisions based on global parameters. The curr_chunk discusses the framework of using reinforcement learning in optimization problems, focusing on two agents - U for updating data structures and D for making decisions based on input units. The approach combines theoretical computer science's worst-case analysis with machine learning's use of training sets to handle a wide range of input instances. The curr_chunk discusses using adversarial input sets in the ML domain to craft training sets for optimization problems. This approach combines theoretical computer science's worst-case analysis with machine learning techniques to ensure robust guarantees on algorithm performance. Incorporating adversarial input sets in machine learning training to improve algorithm performance on specific distributions. This approach combines worst-case analysis from theoretical computer science with machine learning techniques for robust guarantees. In the secretary problem, inputs from various distributions make it challenging for the model to learn characteristics. Can a network of fixed size performing well on diverse inputs imply it has learned the correct algorithm? Comparing the concise logic of the network to the optimal pen-and-paper algorithm will provide insights. In this work, three optimization problems are studied - the Adwords Problem, the Online Knapsack Problem, and the Secretary Problem. Using RL, a \"uniform algorithm\" is found for each problem, with models discovering classic algorithms when trained on universal input distributions. The models trained on universal input distributions discover classic algorithms for optimization problems such as the Adwords, Online Knapsack, and Secretary Problems. Key highlights include finding optimal strategies for unweighted and weighted graphs in the Adwords problem, an optimal threshold for the Online Knapsack problem, and algorithms for the Secretary Problem. The results suggest a potential formal connection between online primal-dual framework and RL for efficient algorithm learning. In this paper, the authors use the standard REINFORCE algorithm with the Adam optimizer to show how standard RL techniques can find classic algorithms for optimization problems. They focus on the question of how machine learning solves optimization problems, specifically combinatorial problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem and Knapsack. The training is done on a single machine and often takes less than a day or two. The paper discusses using policy gradient methods for an RL framework to optimize parameters of a pointer network for combinatorial optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem and Knapsack. It compares its approach to previous literature and highlights differences, emphasizing the interpretation of the learned RL policy network and comparison to known optimal algorithms. The work distinguishes itself by focusing on performance and structure, contrasting with other papers that use recurrent networks or embeddings for similar problems. The paper explores using policy gradient methods in an RL framework to optimize parameters for combinatorial problems. It differentiates itself from previous work by focusing on finding new heuristics for specific distributions and discovering worst-case algorithms. The study aims to develop a uniform algorithm independent of input length using RL, contrasting with other research on TSP and vehicle routing. The paper focuses on using policy gradient methods in an RL framework to optimize parameters for combinatorial problems, aiming to develop a uniform algorithm independent of input length. Various approaches have been explored for this problem, including Neural Turing machines, recurrent models, and convolution masks. The Knapsack and Secretary problems are well-studied, with the Adwords problem being a more recent challenge motivated by online advertising. Solutions merging theoretical and ML approaches could have a significant impact on budgeted ad allocations. The AdWords problem involves allocating ad slots to advertisers with budgets and maximizing revenue. The online b-matching problem is a special case with values in {0, 1}. Algorithm MSVV is used for this optimization. The AdWords problem involves allocating ad slots to advertisers with budgets and maximizing revenue using algorithm MSVV. The algorithm achieves a (1 \u2212 1/e)-approximation of optimal revenue when values are small compared to budgets. MSVV has an elegant form when values are binary, allocating to advertisers with positive values and the most fractional budget remaining. The problem can be formulated as an RL problem with n advertisers and m ad slots. The problem of allocating ad slots to advertisers with budgets and maximizing revenue is formulated as an RL problem with n advertisers and m ad slots. The state space consists of values and fractional spends of advertisers for each ad slot, while the action space allows the agent to allocate or not allocate the ad slot. Rewards are based on successful allocations without exceeding advertiser budgets, and transitions update fractional spends. A feedforward neural network is used for training with specific architecture details provided in the appendix. The problem of allocating ad slots to advertisers is formulated as an RL problem with a neural network trained using the REINFORCE algorithm. The network has five hidden layers with 500 neurons each and ReLU nonlinearity. Training involves a bootstrapping approach starting with a small number of ad slots before moving to a larger stream. Special graphs are used for training, and the output of the learned model is analyzed to visualize the policy it has learned. The learned model's policy for ad slot allocation is visualized and compared to the BALANCE algorithm. The evolution of advertisers' duals under the learned agent and optimal algorithm is examined. Results show similarities in dual trajectories and allocation probabilities for advertisers. The learned model's policy for ad slot allocation is visualized and compared to the BALANCE algorithm. Results show similarities in dual trajectories and allocation probabilities for advertisers. The model was trained on AdWords using an adversarial graph with scaled budgets for advertisers. The network learned that as an advertiser spends more, it needs to have a larger value before being allocated the ad slot. Performance metrics for the learned agent are shown in Table 4, demonstrating its ability to handle larger input lengths. Future work includes finding a more adversarial distribution to accurately recover MSVV. The algorithm \"Online Bang-per-Buck\" provides a strategy for the online knapsack problem, aiming to maximize total value within capacity constraints. It suggests accepting the first k items with a high value-by-size ratio and defining a threshold ratio for subsequent items. The \"Online Bang-per-Buck\" algorithm aims to maximize total value within capacity constraints for the online knapsack problem. It accepts items with high value-to-size ratios and sets a threshold ratio for subsequent items. This algorithm is the online version of the natural Bang-per-Buck Greedy strategy for the offline problem BID11. It can be seen as a \"Dual-learning\" algorithm that finds the best online estimate of the corresponding dual variable of the natural linear program. The Knapsack problem is related to the Adwords problem, with differences in complexity due to the number of parameters for each item. An RL formulation can be used to learn the nearly optimal algorithm for n items arriving in sequence with knapsack capacity B. The algorithm involves using a neural network with 3 hidden layers to train a Policy Gradient RL model for the knapsack problem. The network is trained with a fixed learning rate and achieves performance close to the Bang-per-Buck Algorithm. The output of the network is analyzed to visualize the learned policy. The learned network visualizes the policy it has learned for the knapsack problem. The probability of accepting items based on their value-to-size ratio is plotted, showing correct thresholds for different distributions. The network adapts its threshold based on the budget and number of items, picking about one-fifth for (B, n) = (20, 200) and (B, n) = (50, 500), and only a tenth for (B, n) = (50, 1000). In contrast to the Adwords and Secretary problems, there is no known theoretical work providing a universal distribution for the online knapsack problem. A universal algorithm would require maintaining a larger state, such as a histogram of value-by-size ratios of items seen so far. The first steps towards this goal involve considering two types of knapsack instances, X and Y, with fixed budgets and all items having the same value. In X, items have sizes of either 1 or a small positive integer k with equal probability, while in Y, all items have the same size. The distribution for the online knapsack problem involves two types of instances, X and Y, with different size probabilities. The optimal solution varies for X and Y, requiring different value-by-size thresholds. Training the RL agent on this distribution includes two settings: original state space and state augmented by a histogram of spend binned by value-to-size ratio. The learner (A) without the augmented state achieves only 73% of optimal, while learner (B) achieves 95% by leveraging the augmented state to determine the optimal threshold for instance type X or Y. Future work includes leveraging the mixed distribution to find a universal training set. The problem described is the basic secretary problem where an agent is trying to hire the single best candidate out of n candidates arriving in random order. The optimal \"Wait-then-Pick\" algorithm involves rejecting the first 1/e fraction of items and then accepting the first item with a value greater than the best rejected item. The problem described is the basic secretary problem where an agent is trying to hire the single best candidate out of n candidates arriving in random order. The optimal \"Wait-then-Pick\" algorithm involves rejecting the first 1/e fraction of items and then accepting the first item with a value greater than the best rejected item. The algorithm chooses the best item with a probability of at least 1/e. It is known that no algorithm can perform better in the worst case scenario. The input values are made scale-free by restricting them in three different ways, each giving a variant of the original problem. The Wait-then-Pick algorithm achieves a success probability of 1/e in the basic secretary problem. The Percentile setting generalizes the binary setting by representing items as percentiles. In the i.i.d. value setting with fixed distributions, Wait-then-Pick is not optimal. The optimal algorithm for the secretary problem involves a thresholding algorithm where the threshold decreases over time. It picks the first item with a value higher than the threshold. In a setting with changing distributions, the algorithm needs to adapt to different distributions each time. The agent in the problem setting sees a state at each time step and decides whether to Accept or Reject the item. The reward is given at the end state based on the agent's success in picking the maximum value. The formulation is not an MDP, but can be converted with minor modifications. In the value setting with changing distributions, the state space is augmented by providing the maximum value in the past. A feedforward neural network with three hidden layers is used for training, with a softmax output layer. The network is trained using the REINFORCE algorithm with a fixed learning rate and batch size. A bootstrapping approach is employed to facilitate training by gradually increasing the input stream size. In the binary and percentile settings, the agent learned algorithms similar to the optimal one. Performance metrics were compared in Table 6 and Table 7. In the I.I.D. value setting with fixed distribution, the agent learned the optimal algorithm, as shown in FIG0 and Table 8. In the I.I.D. value setting with changing distributions, the model learns a behavior characteristic of Wait-then-Pick by using a distribution with high entropy. The threshold in experiments coincides at 1/e. Performance metrics are provided in Table 9. Future work includes removing the hint provided to the learner to maintain the maximum value seen in the past. Traditional algorithmic ideas are introduced to train neural networks for online optimization problems. In online optimization problems, RL was able to find key characteristics of optimal algorithms but required state augmentation in some instances. Future work aims to remove state augmentation from the RL environment and have the agent learn it during training. Comparison with optimal algorithms showed a threshold around 1/e. Special graphs were used for the AdWords problem. Special graphs are used for the AdWords problem, with a perfect b-matching in the adversarial graph. The expected competitive ratio is bounded above by 1 - 1/e for any deterministic algorithm when advertisers are randomly permuted. The thick-z graph is defined for the AdWords problem, with a perfect b-matching in the adversarial graph. Each advertiser has a budget of 100, allowing for a perfect allocation. Randomized algorithms face challenges with permutations of vertices on the left-hand side. The thick-z graph in the AdWords problem allows for a perfect allocation with each advertiser having a budget of 100. Randomized algorithms face challenges with vertex permutations, yielding a competitive ratio of at most 1 \u2212 1/e. The discretized state and action spaces are introduced to make the framework applicable to a large number of advertisers. The network learned to balance advertiser preferences based on budget spent, but struggled to distinguish between small fractions and zero, as shown in Figure 6 in Appendix C. The learned algorithm was compared to the BALANCE algorithm in terms of performance using different state spaces and numbers of advertisers and budgets. Experimental evidence showed that the quality of the learned algorithm remained consistent regardless of these factors. The learned algorithm was tested on instances with varying numbers of advertisers and budgets, achieving a solution quality of 0.92 compared to the BALANCE solution. Even with input scaling up to 1 million ads, the solution quality never dropped below 0.84. The evolution of duals for different advertiser preferences was compared to the optimal algorithm. The agent's algorithm learned to balance the bipartite b matching problem with some issues in varying advertiser numbers. Performance was compared to the BALANCE solution on instances with different advertiser numbers and budgets, achieving a solution quality of 0.92. The solution quality remained above 0.84 even with input scaling up to 1 million ads. The agent's algorithm was trained on instances with 20 advertisers and a common budget of 20 but tested on instances with up to 10^6 ad slots. Figures show curves for different scenarios. In Figure 8, the learner with augmented state accepts items of specific sizes for different types, while the learner without the augmented state makes suboptimal decisions for certain types. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of an algorithm in computer science, highlighting the challenges and nuances involved in learning an algorithm. It emphasizes the importance of the underlying model of computation and how it affects the effectiveness of an algorithm. The model of computation in machine learning tends to be non-uniform, with algorithms operating on inputs of fixed length. Linear and logistic regression, as well as feed-forward neural networks, work on inputs of fixed dimensions. Learning algorithms for problems with inputs of arbitrary length can be challenging, as most machine learning algorithms operate on inputs of fixed dimensions. Success stories like finite-state machines and regular expressions show that learning with bounded length inputs is possible, but generalizing to arbitrary lengths remains a challenge. Context-free languages present even murkier challenges in machine learning. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of learning algorithms for context-free grammars and Turing machines, highlighting the Neural Turing Machine model as a solution. It mentions the undecidability of equivalence for context-free grammars and the intractability of inferring grammars from labeled data. The model is described as a recurrent neural network with Turing completeness, offering a philosophical answer to learning algorithms. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of training recurrent neural networks for complex algorithmic tasks, citing the limitations of back-propagation over long input sequences. It also mentions the potential of convolution in defining models for image-processing tasks. Convolution in defining models for image-processing tasks involves applying a sequence of finite-size masks to input patches, pooling the results into a fixed-length summary, and then using a neural network for output computation. The pooling operator divides the input into regions and applies a simple function like SUM to the convolution outputs. The architecture for image-processing tasks involves applying masks to input patches, pooling the results, and using a neural network for output computation. The pooling operator divides the input into regions and applies a simple function like SUM to the convolution outputs. The finite-depth limitation enables efficient learning but raises questions about the richness of the resulting model and its capabilities for complex tasks. The convolution-pooling paradigm may not be powerful enough for nontrivial algorithms, as it struggles with tasks like computing the parity of bits. BID21 proposes a model that aims to overcome this limitation by learning a set of convolution masks based on Turing machine principles. The BID21 model aims to learn convolution masks based on Turing machine principles to overcome limitations in the convolution-pooling paradigm. It removes the depth limitation, allowing for the simulation of a Turing machine with polynomial overhead. Despite increased computation volume, it solves the non-uniformity problem and can be trained on inputs of varying lengths. Kaiser and Sutskever demonstrate the model's ability to learn algorithms for basic problems like addition and multiplication. The paper discusses learning algorithms for optimization problems like the Knapsack problem and bipartite graph matching. It aims to understand conditions for learning uniform algorithms that work for inputs of all lengths with a finite number of parameters. The paper focuses on optimization problems like the \"secretary problem\" and discusses learning algorithms for these problems. It frames the learning problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem to avoid issues with training recurrent networks. The algorithms considered are those that can be computed with limited memory and few passes over the input sequence, such as online algorithms with space constraints. These restrictions capture interesting algorithmic problems with nontrivial solutions, like the AdWords problem and the online knapsack problem. These problems require memory independent of the input. The paper discusses optimization problems like the \"secretary problem\" and learning algorithms for these problems, focusing on algorithms that can be computed with limited memory and few passes over the input sequence. The AdWords problem and the online knapsack problem are examples of problems that require memory independent of the input length. These memory-restricted computational models lead to tractable learning tasks and can be solved by computation graphs of constant depth. The prevailing model for solving problems with more than a handful of numbers is the semi-streaming model, which allows algorithms to use a linear amount of memory. This model is a one-pass or few-pass algorithm that is more efficient for certain tasks compared to the standard streaming algorithm. In the segmented semi-streaming model, algorithms use a linear amount of memory divided into constant-sized units. This model allows for powerful algorithms for matching and allocation problems, as many algorithms maintain per-variable information. In the segmented semi-streaming model, algorithms use a linear amount of memory divided into constant-sized units. This model allows for powerful algorithms for matching and allocation problems. A structural representation theorem shows that every symmetric function computable in the streaming model is also computable in the weaker \"sketching model\". This theorem allows for computation graphs of constant depth with a constant number of parameters that need to be learned. In the segmented semi-streaming model, algorithms use a linear amount of memory divided into constant-sized units. A structural representation theorem shows that every symmetric function computable in the streaming model is also computable in the weaker \"sketching model\". This allows for computation graphs of constant depth with a constant number of parameters that need to be learned. A function is computable by a streaming algorithm with space s(\u00b7) if there is an algorithm A that computes f(x) given one-way access to x, using space no more than s(n). A function is computable by a sketching algorithm if there are two algorithms S and R such that f(x1,...,xn) = R(S(x1),...,S(xn)). The main idea is that differentiable sketching algorithms are easier to learn than differentiable streaming algorithms. A key complexity-theoretic result states that any function computable by streaming algorithms can also be computed by sketching algorithms. Theorem 1 states that symmetric functions computable by streaming algorithms can also be computed by sketching algorithms, as shown in the \"deep sets\" work of Zaheer et al. (2017). The optimization problem captured by function f can be efficiently solved using an online version of f through the primal-dual framework. If f is symmetric, it can be computed by functions S and R in the sketching model, reducing the problem to learning algorithms S and R. The symmetry of f implies that R must also be symmetric, allowing it to be computed from the values of S on the input sequence. If the range of S is a set of discrete values of size k, R can be learned from the k-bucket histogram of S values. Function R can be computed from the k-bucket histogram of values of S in a differentiable manner if S is computed in a one-hot fashion."
