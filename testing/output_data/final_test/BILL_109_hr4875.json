    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rocky Mountain Forest Insects Response Enhancement and Support Act\" or the \"Rocky Mountain FIRES Act.\" The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Rocky Mountain Forest Insects Response Enhancement and Support Act\" or the \"Rocky Mountain FIRES Act\" includes provisions for addressing bark beetle infestations, wildfire protection plans, biomass utilization grants, cooperation with private landowners, and tax incentives for silvicultural activities in response to insect infestations. Congress acknowledges that fire, bark beetles, and insects are natural parts of the Rocky Mountain forest ecology, shaping forests and promoting regrowth. However, large-scale infestations of bark beetles, combined with fire suppression policies on Federal lands, have increased the risk of severe wildfires threatening nearby communities. The recent reduction in timber harvesting on Federal lands has led to dense vegetation fueling severe wildfires. A prolonged drought has weakened trees, making them more susceptible to wildfires and insects. Population growth in mountain communities near Federal lands has increased the risk to people, homes, and businesses. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 aimed to reduce fuel volume for severe fires. The purpose of this Act is to facilitate a swifter response by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to reduce the increased risk of severe wildfires to communities in the Rocky Mountain region resulting from the effects of widespread infestations of bark beetles and other insects. However, provisions of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 and other laws need to be modified to help further reduce the risks to communities in the Rocky Mountain region associated with current insect infestations. The Act aims to expedite the response to bark beetle and insect infestations on federal land in the Rocky Mountain region. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to include a definition for \"insect-emergency area\" in the Rocky Mountain region, characterized by widespread infestation of bark beetles or other insects and identified for hazardous fuel reduction treatment in a community wildfire protection plan. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to prioritize funding allocation for hazardous fuel reduction in the Rocky Mountain region, defined as including Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. The Secretary must allocate at least 70% of funds for hazardous fuel reduction projects in the Rocky Mountain region, focusing on projects in the wildland-urban interface and lands near municipal water supply systems. The text chunk discusses amending the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to include provisions for insect emergencies in at-risk communities or adjacent insect-emergency areas. \"Amendment to include provisions for insect emergencies in at-risk communities or adjacent insect-emergency areas.\" The Secretary has the authority to designate insect-emergency areas based on observation of insect infestations. This designation can be initiated by the Secretary or in response to a request from a State agency or political subdivision. If a request is made, a decision must be made within 90 days. The authority to designate areas on National Forest System lands is limited. The Secretary can delegate the authority to designate insect-emergency areas to a Regional Forester. Before making a designation, consultation with relevant agencies and public comment is required. Any review of the designation is subject to regulations and provisions. Authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects can be implemented on designated lands. Authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects in insect-emergency areas can be excluded from environmental impact assessments if they are part of a community wildfire protection plan and meet certain criteria. Stewardship projects are also included in this provision. Regulations allow stewardship projects in insect-emergency areas to exceed 10 years but not exceed 15 years. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to relocate Forest Service personnel for silvicultural assessments in response to insect emergencies. This is related to the Appeals Reform Act. The Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to clarify that administrative review procedures for hazardous fuel reduction projects and insect-emergency areas are not affected by the Appeals Reform Act. SEC. 4. Community wildfire protection plan development assistance for at-risk communities in the Rocky Mountain region. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to provide planning assistance grants to at-risk communities in the Rocky Mountain region for wildfire protection plans. Funding of $5,000,000 annually is allocated from the Mineral Leasing Act. Funds allocated from the Mineral Leasing Act for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 will be available to the Secretary of Agriculture for wildfire protection plans under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. SEC. 5 amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act to provide additional assistance for the preparation of community wildfire protection plans. SEC. 6 introduces a biomass commercial utilization grant program. The Secretary of Agriculture may grant funds to facilities using biomass for various purposes, with priority given to those purchasing biomass from insect-emergency areas. Grants can be used to offset biomass purchasing costs and are in addition to other grant authorities related to biomass. Authorization of $10,000,000 for grants related to biomass under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. SEC. 204 establishes central collection points. The Secretary shall establish collection points for vegetative material from hazardous fuel reduction projects on Federal or other lands. Material at these points can be sold, donated, or removed by parties with consent. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for Forest Service lands and the Secretary of the Interior for other agency lands. SEC. 7. COOPERATION WITH CERTAIN PRIVATE LANDOWNERS. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to include a new section on cooperation with private landowners. The Secretary may award stewardship contracts to private landowners for fuel-reduction projects on Federal lands. Reimbursement for costs incurred by the landowner may be provided, or the costs will be treated as a donation to the United States. The Secretary may award stewardship contracts to private landowners for fuel-reduction projects on Federal lands, with costs incurred by the landowner treated as a donation to the United States for tax purposes. SEC. 8. PARTIAL EXCLUSION FROM GROSS INCOME OF PAYMENTS RECEIVED AS COMPENSATION FOR SILVICULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN RESPONSE TO INSECT-INFESTATION EMERGENCIES. This section introduces a new provision for excluding compensation for silvicultural activities in response to insect-infestation emergencies from gross income. The provision excludes qualified silvicultural payments from gross income, with a dollar limitation of $10,000 ($20,000 for joint returns). Qualified payments are compensation for work in the Rocky Mountain region related to hazardous fuels reduction projects or silvicultural assessments. The text chunk provides definitions for terms related to authorized hazardous fuels reduction projects in insect-emergency areas in the Rocky Mountain region under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. It also includes a clerical amendment to the table of sections in the Code. The text chunk introduces compensation for silvicultural activities in response to beetle emergencies, with amendments applying to taxable years starting after December 31, 2005."
