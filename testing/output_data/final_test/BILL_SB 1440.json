    "title": "SB 1440",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code defines a \"water storage project\" funded by bonds from the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014. Procedures for challenging the certification of environmental impact reports or project approvals are established under this section. The Judicial Council must adopt a rule of court by July 1, 2017, to establish procedures for actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports for water storage projects. The draft and final reports must include a notice about the process in not less than 12-point type. The EIR is subject to Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code, which states that the lead agency is not required to consider comments filed after the public comment period for the draft EIR. Any legal challenge to the EIR or project approval is subject to procedures outlined in the Public Resources Code. The draft and final EIR must include the full text of this section as an appendix and the lead agency must conduct an informational workshop within 10 days of releasing the draft EIR. Within 10 days before the close of the public comment period, the lead agency must hold a public hearing for testimony on the draft environmental impact report. A transcript of the hearing will be included in the final report. Within five days after the comment period closes, a commenter can request nonbinding mediation. The mediation must involve the lead agency, applicant, and all relevant commenters, and must be completed within 35 days. The lead agency must select experienced mediators for disputes, with costs borne by the applicant. Mediation sessions are required for each area of dispute, with agreed-upon measures becoming conditions of approval. Commenters who agree to measures cannot challenge the agency's decision based on those issues. The lead agency does not have to consider comments submitted after the public comment period unless they address new issues, new information, changes to the project, or proposed conditions for approval or mitigation measures released after the draft environmental impact report. The lead agency must file the required notice within five days of the last initial project approval. The agency may prepare and certify the record of proceedings, with the applicant covering all costs. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of its release. Any additional documents submitted after the draft report must also be accessible within five business days. The lead agency is required to make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available electronically within three business days of release. Copyright protected documents not prepared specifically for the project do not need to be in electronic format but an index must be provided for public review. The lead agency must encourage electronic submission of project comments and make them available to the public within five days. Non-electronic comments must be converted to electronic format within seven days. Comments not considered need to be noted in the record without including their content. Within five days of filing the required notice, the lead agency must certify and provide an electronic copy of the proceedings record to a party upon request. A reasonable fee may be charged for the copy. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the superior court. (9) Disputes over the record of proceedings are resolved by the superior court. Parties must file a motion to augment the record when disputing its content. (10) The contents of the record are outlined in Section 21167.6. Subdivisions (d) and (e) do not apply to projects started before January 1, 2017. (g) The court cannot stop a water storage project unless it poses a threat to public health and safety. The court can only enjoin specific activities of a water storage project if they pose a threat to public health and safety or adversely affect important Native American artifacts, historical, archaeological, or ecological values. An action to challenge a decision of the lead agency regarding a subsequent project approval must adhere to the requirements of this chapter. No reimbursement is necessary for this act as local agencies have the authority to fund mandated services."
