    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Education Code Section 66602 is amended to include five ex officio members on the board, along with a representative of the alumni associations of the state university and 16 members appointed by the Governor. Two students from the California State University, with at least sophomore year standing, are appointed by the Governor to serve on the board for two-year terms. The students are selected from lists provided by statewide student organizations representing the students of the California State University. Vacancies for student members are filled for the remainder of the term. The term of office for student members of the board starts on July 1 of either an even or odd-numbered year and ends on June 30 two years later. If a student member graduates after January 1 of the second year of their term, they can serve the remainder of the term. During the first year of a student member's term on the board, they can attend meetings, participate in discussions, but cannot vote. In the second year, they have voting rights like other members. If one student member is absent due to illness or emergency, the other can vote in their place. During the second year of a student member's term, if a vacancy occurs, the remaining student member assumes the vacant office and all privileges of the second-year student member. Student members have their tuition fees waived. A faculty member from the California State University, appointed by the Governor, serves on the board for a two-year term. The faculty member appointed by the Governor for a two-year term shall not participate in collective bargaining negotiations. Their term starts on July 1 and can be extended for one additional year if a successor is not appointed. One of the 16 appointive members of the board for the California State University must be a permanent nonfaculty employee, chosen from nominees provided by an independent staff council. The employee organizations of permanent nonfaculty employees will fund this council. The permanent nonfaculty employee member of the California State University board appointed from nominees by an independent staff council cannot participate in collective bargaining negotiations subcommittees and will only receive compensation as authorized by Section 66604.5."
