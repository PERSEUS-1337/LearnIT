    "title": "AB 2725",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that food waste in California is a significant issue, with over 5.5 million tons of food dumped in landfills annually. This waste of food also leads to a drain on the economy, costing $162 billion nationally. Reducing food losses by 15% could feed over 25 million Americans each year and help alleviate food insecurity for more than 6 million Californians. Additionally, dumping organic waste into landfills contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, releasing over 8.3 million tons of greenhouse gases annually in California. The legislation aims to address food waste caused by misinterpretation of date labels on foods, with surveys showing high percentages of premature discarding. It establishes requirements for quality date labeling on food for sale in California to ensure uniformity and accuracy. The legislation in California mandates that the quality date on food packaging must be labeled as \"best if used by\" unless otherwise specified. The date should be displayed clearly in 8-point type size or larger, using upper and lower case letters, and must include the month followed by the calendar day and year. The guidelines can be modified by the department after consulting with stakeholders. The department can modify guidelines after consulting stakeholders. \"Quality date\" refers to the date on food packaging indicating when quality may deteriorate. Retail food facilities must not sell unlabeled food items after July 1, 2017. Facilities can donate unlabeled food items and can still sell, donate, or use food after the quality date has passed. Retail food facilities must label food items with an elevated-risk date starting July 1, 2017, as per regulations set by the department. This does not create legal liability for ensuring proper labeling by the manufacturer. The department will establish a list of high-risk ready-to-eat foods and post it on their website. Regulations require retail food facilities to display an elevated-risk date with the phrase \"expires on\" by July 1, 2017, unless the department specifies a different term. Regulations may be modified after consulting with stakeholders. On July 1, 2017, retail food facilities must not sell food items without proper labeling indicating an elevated risk date. Food manufacturers can include elevated risk dates on products that require time/temperature control for safety. Food for sale in the state with an elevated risk date must meet specific requirements. The department may modify guidelines for displaying elevated risk dates on food items after consulting with stakeholders in an open public process. Regulations adding or exempting foods from this requirement can be adopted by the department in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act. The department will provide consumer guidance on quality and safety date food labels by December 1, 2017. This does not create legal liability for retail food providers regarding food labeling. Retail food facilities are prohibited from selling food items labeled with a \"sell-by\" date or any date intended for stock rotation. Sell-by dates in coded formats not easily readable by consumers are allowed. Retailers are not legally liable for ensuring proper labeling by manufacturers. The act does not require reimbursement for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
