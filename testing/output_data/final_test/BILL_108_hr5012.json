    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial 1-Cent Coin Redesign Act\". Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, demonstrated courage during the Civil War, rose to the Presidency through honesty and integrity, led efforts to free slaves, had a generous heart, and died for his country in 1865. Americans could benefit from studying his life. Abraham Lincoln, born in Kentucky, grew up in Indiana, became famous in Illinois, and led the nation from Washington, D.C. The Lincoln cent was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of his birth, with the design enduring on the nation's coinage. President Theodore Roosevelt chose Victor David Brenner to design Lincoln's likeness for the coin. The Lincoln cent, introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of President Lincoln's birth, has had only 2 designs on the reverse in nearly 100 years. To commemorate Lincoln's bicentennial and the centennial of the coin, a series of 1-cent coins with designs representing the 4 major periods of Lincoln's life will be issued. The Lincoln cent will be redesigned for 2009 to commemorate Lincoln's bicentennial and the centennial of the coin, with designs representing the 4 major periods of Lincoln's life. In 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury will issue redesigned 1-cent coins with 4 different designs representing key aspects of Abraham Lincoln's life, including his birth, early childhood, formative years, professional life, and presidency. In 2009, redesigned 1-cent coins with 4 different designs representing aspects of Abraham Lincoln's life will be issued quarterly. The Secretary will determine the number of coins for each design, selected after consultation with various commissions and committees. After 2009, 1-cent coins will feature a design symbolizing President Lincoln's role in preserving the United States. Numismatic pennies in 2009 will have the same metallic content as the 1909 penny. Congress supports reproducing the original Victor David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin in 2009."
