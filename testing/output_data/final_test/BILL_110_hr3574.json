    "content": "The \"Willamette River United Act\" includes sections on short title, findings, purposes, definitions, grant authorization, private property protection, tribal rights, authorization of appropriations, and agency partnership authorization. The Act may be cited as the \"Willamette River United Act.\" The Willamette River basin has a long history of human habitation and cultural significance. It covers nearly 12,000 square miles, is home to a majority of Oregon's population, and is a key economic driver for the state. The population in the basin is expected to grow significantly by 2050. The Willamette River is significant in terms of stream flow and runoff production. The Willamette River has the most runoff in the Continental United States and is fed by thirteen major tributaries. It is home to a variety of fish and wildlife, including anadromous fish like coho salmon and provides spawning grounds for various species. Designated an American Heritage River in 1998, it is part of an initiative to assist river communities without imposing new regulations. The Willamette River, designated an American Heritage River in 1998, has received significant resources and assistance from various entities for natural resource protection, economic revitalization, and cultural preservation. Federal, state, and tribal governments, along with private organizations, have collaborated to facilitate conservation actions for the enhancement and enjoyment of natural resources. The Willamette River has seen collaborative efforts from various entities for natural resource protection and economic revitalization. Federal agencies provide critical expertise, but more funding is needed for local communities to achieve their full potential. Despite population growth, cleanup efforts have improved watershed health, but more work is needed for long-term restoration. Nature observation and sightseeing are popular recreational activities in the Willamette Basin. The Willamette River has seen a significant increase in interest from visitors and residents, with investments in natural areas and lands near rivers and streams to protect water quality and manage growth impacts. A $227.4 million bond measure was approved in 2006 for this purpose. The purposes of this Act are to enhance access to the Willamette River, assist in restoring and preserving its resources, and authorize partnerships among various entities for these purposes. The Act defines Indian tribal governments as governing bodies of federally recognized tribes, specifies the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and defines the Willamette River as approximately 187 miles long. The Willamette River is approximately 187 miles long, flowing from the headwaters in the mountains south of Eugene to the confluence with the Columbia River at St. Helens. It has various tributaries including the Calapooia, Clackamas, and McKenzie rivers, and the Willamette River Basin encompasses all surface water that feeds into it. Conservation projects are also included in the management of the river. Conservation projects in the Willamette River Basin include restoring hydrologic functions, habitat for flora and fauna, acquiring conservation easements or land, and improving water quality. SEC. 5. GRANT AUTHORIZATION. The Secretary will enter into cooperative agreements with Oregon Parks and Recreation Department and Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board to administer the grant program for eligible projects such as providing facilities, safety education, signage, craft acquisition, and trail development along the Willamette River. The Willamette River and its tributaries will be enhanced for recreation, conservation, and tourism. Improved technologies and partnerships will be used to reduce pollution. Efforts will focus on restoring water quality and watershed health through various restoration projects involving multiple organizations. The curr_chunk discusses acquiring land interests for various conservation projects, including ecological restoration along the Willamette River and its tributaries. It also mentions designing park and conservation projects through technical analysis. The curr_chunk discusses outreach for coordination and collaboration among communities along the Willamette River, as well as specific eligible grant projects like the South Waterfront Greenway and Wilsonville Park to Boat Works Park pedestrian-bike bridge. Funds from grants under this Act have limitations on their use. Funds from grants under this Act have limitations on their use, including restrictions on supporting regulatory actions or operations and maintenance costs. Projects funded with these grants must have a matching funding commitment, with a minimum 35 percent match required from grantees. In-kind service can count towards the matching requirement, and communities demonstrating local capacity building may receive special consideration. Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board may waive land acquisition requirements through a rule. Oregon Parks and Recreation Department and Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board will collaborate to streamline grant program administration. SEC. 6. PRIVATE PROPERTY PROTECTION AND LACK OF REGULATORY EFFECT. The Act recognizes the authority of Federal, State, or local governments to regulate land use. Private property owners in the Willamette Basin are not required to participate in any land conservation programs. Funds can only be used to purchase land from willing sellers. Participating landowners must allow access to their property for project implementation and monitoring. The Act allows for inspection, monitoring, and maintenance of projects funded under it. Private property owners participating voluntarily are not liable for injuries on their property. SEC. 7 of the Act protects tribal rights and interests, ensuring that no treaty rights or other rights of Indian tribal governments are affected. SEC. 8 authorizes appropriations for the Act. SEC. 8 authorizes $10,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2009 through 2018, with $100,000 allocated to Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality for Willamette River pollution reduction. The remaining funds are split equally between Oregon Parks and Recreation Department and Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board. Administrative costs are also covered. Federal agencies like the National Marine Fisheries Service, Department of the Interior, Forest Service, and others can provide technical and financial assistance to Oregon's Watershed Enhancement Board and Parks Department, as well as financial aid to the Willamette River. The Federal agencies can provide financial assistance to Willamette River restoration, recreation, heritage, and tourism efforts through agreements with Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board or Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. This assistance does not obligate the State agencies to any unfunded Federal authorization."
