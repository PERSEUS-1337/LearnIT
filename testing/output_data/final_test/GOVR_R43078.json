    "content": "The deregulation of the airline industry in the United States in 1978 eliminated governmental control over most business practices of airlines. The federal government still regulates certain practices for customer protection and air safety. Congressional interest in airline passenger rights increased between 2007 and 2009 due to lengthy delays. Congress has since strengthened passenger rights under federal law. This report examines aviation consumer protections post-deregulation, including the roles of Congress and the U.S. Department of Transportation in protecting airline consumers and major passenger rights issues and related laws and regulations. The rights of domestic airline passengers are primarily defined by Congress through federal laws, regulations, and airline policies. State and local governments are limited in their ability to regulate airline services. Congress authorizes federal agencies to enforce passenger rights and directs them to define and enforce rights not explicitly stated in legislation. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation play key roles in overseeing these matters. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure oversee the Department of Transportation (DOT) and enforce airline passenger rights laws. Congress addresses passenger rights issues through constituent complaints and advises on filing complaints with DOT. Tarmac delays highlight Congress's oversight role, with incidents of passengers being held on planes between 2007 and 2009. In response to incidents of passengers being held on planes without access to basic necessities, congressional hearings were held in 2009. The Department of Transportation issued rules on tarmac delays in 2010, which were further solidified in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. The 2016 FAA reauthorization included language defining excessive tarmac delays but also changed how the delays are measured, potentially giving airlines more flexibility in handling delayed flights. Members of Congress have also raised concerns about flight schedules and aircraft capacity. Concerns have been raised about flight schedules, aircraft capacity, and frequency of service in the context of business dealings between air carriers. These issues, although no longer subject to federal regulation, are often brought up in discussions requiring federal approval, such as mergers and code-share arrangements. For instance, objections were made regarding the American Airlines and US Airways merger, citing reduced competition and limited consumer choices. The Department of Transportation (DOT) enforces airline consumer rights laws established by Congress and may develop regulations based on statutory authority. The Department of Transportation (DOT) enforces airline consumer rights laws established by Congress and has broad authority to regulate air travel. DOT's authority is used to protect consumers from unfair practices and ensure safe air transportation, exercised by the Office of the Secretary. DOT does not oversee aviation security, which falls under the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The Department of Transportation (DOT) enforces consumer rules based on \"unfair or deceptive practices\" and \"ensure safe and adequate service\" provisions. They also ensure nondiscriminatory access for individuals with disabilities and prevent unlawful discrimination by airlines. The DOT Aviation Consumer Protection Division's Fly-Rights booklet covers topics like flight delays, travel scams, and consumer complaints. The Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings in DOT (OAEP) monitors airline compliance, investigates violations, and enforces rules. In 2015, DOT issued 15 consent orders for aviation consumer rule violations, totaling $2,435,000 in civil penalties. OAEP considers various factors in determining civil penalties, with air carriers facing a maximum penalty of $32,140 per violation. The Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings (OAEP) enforces rules and investigates violations in the aviation industry. Air carriers can face civil penalties of up to $32,140 per violation, while small businesses or individuals may be subject to a maximum penalty of $1,414. OAEP may issue warning letters for inadvertent or minor violations after sending a letter to the air carrier outlining the complaint and requesting a response. The Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings (OAEP) enforces rules and investigates violations in the aviation industry. If violations are found to be inadvertent or minor, OAEP may issue warning letters. If enforcement action is deemed necessary, OAEP may seek a civil penalty and consent order, which outlines the penalty and requires the air carrier to cease further violations. Air carriers' \"Contract of Carriage\" defines the rights, duties, and liabilities of parties involved. Airlines' contract of carriage outlines 30 rules, covering reservations, ticketing, cancellation policies, and more. These contracts replace pre-deregulation-era tariffs and are now available for download online. Passengers can take legal action based on these contracts, as they are no longer subject to federal review or approval since the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978. Since the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978, airlines' contract of carriage is no longer subject to federal review or approval. However, a contract that conflicts with federal laws may not be enforceable. Under regulation, the CAB had authority to approve carriers' fares, but now competition is primarily based on price rather than service. Airlines have started charging separately for services like checked baggage and seat changes. Ancillary fees for checked baggage, early boarding, and seat changes have led to consumer complaints. Airlines' treatment of passengers during flight delays or cancellations is a major issue. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 included some passenger rights provisions, but not all proposed protections were included in the final bill. The DOT rulemaking process under P.L. 114-190 includes provisions for assessing air carrier training programs for assisting persons with disabilities, issuing best practices, and proposing rules for accessibility matters like oxygen tanks, service animals, and lavatories. The provision in Section 2308 of P.L. 114-190 requires DOT to issue a final rule for airlines to refund checked-bag fees if a bag is delayed 12 hours on a domestic flight or 15 hours on an international flight. The Secretary can extend these time frames up to 18 hours for domestic flights and 30 hours for international flights if necessary. This section also amends the definition of \"excessive tarmac delay\" for interstate and international flights, directing DOT to issue regulations for implementation. The DOT regulations (14 C.F.R. \u00a7259.4) measure excessive delay from the time passengers last have a chance to deplane to when they are allowed to deplane. The new legislation requires delay to be measured from when the main aircraft door is closed to when the aircraft is returned to a suitable disembarkation point. The maximum time for deplaning after returning to a disembarkation point is not specified. The air carrier must complete passenger deplaning upon returning to a disembarkation point, potentially requiring a change to the existing DOT rule. Section 2309 mandates DOT to establish policies for children under 13 to sit next to a family member over 13 at no extra cost. Section 1102(j) extends the Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protection through FY2017. The Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protection was established in 2012 to advise the Secretary of Transportation on passenger service improvements. Despite the 15 largest U.S. airlines having an on-time arrival rate of nearly 80% in 2015, flight delays and cancellations remain a common complaint. In 2015, there were 6,433 complaints, with mishandled baggage, reservation problems, customer service, and refunds being frequent issues. Improved tracking systems have helped reduce lost baggage incidents for U.S. carriers. In 2015, U.S. carriers reported 4.04 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers, one of the lowest rates since 1987. A rule issued in 2009 addressed airline flight delays and cancellations, expanding on previous regulations. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 altered how tarmac delays are measured but left the existing rule unchanged, requiring large carriers to deplane passengers after three hours on the tarmac. The final rule mandates that air carriers must develop contingency plans for tarmac delays, ensuring passengers are not stranded for more than three hours without the option to deplane. Carriers face penalties for non-compliance, with requirements for food, water, lavatory facilities, and medical attention within specified timeframes. International flights also require commitments to passenger care. The tarmac delay rule, effective since April 2010, mandates air carriers to limit on-tarmac hours for both domestic and international flights. In 2014, there was a significant decrease in lengthy tarmac delays. The rule also includes provisions for displaying flight delay information, monitoring impacts of delays, and addressing consumer complaints. The Department of Transportation (DOT) issued rules to protect air travelers' rights, including reimbursement for lost baggage, disclosure of additional fees on airline websites, and a ban on excessive tarmac delays for both domestic and international flights. These rules aim to provide accurate information to consumers, improve responsiveness to complaints, and prevent unfair practices by air carriers. Major U.S. carriers have increasingly utilized code-share agreements with regional and foreign airlines, allowing them to share flights, branding, and promotional activities. This practice extends to both domestic and international flights, with a four-hour limit on international flights at U.S. airports. The DOT code-share disclosure rule applies to both domestic and international air transportation, requiring clear disclosure of code-share agreements and the identity of the transporting carrier. Despite efforts to ensure transparency, confusion among passengers persists due to varying disclosure practices by airlines, travel agencies, and advertisers. Some airlines overbook flights to account for no-shows, which is not illegal. When a flight is oversold, DOT mandates airlines to ask for volunteers to give up their seats before involuntarily bumping anyone. Airlines must inform and compensate passengers who are bumped involuntarily, and establish boarding priority rules based on factors like check-in time and fare paid. In April 2011, DOT amended the rule on denied boarding compensation, increasing rates and dollar limits subject to inflation adjustment every two years. If a passenger is involuntarily bumped and the substitute transportation arrives more than one hour later than the original time, compensation rules apply based on the delay. On international flights departing the United States, airlines must pay bumped passengers compensation equal to 200% of the one-way fare if delayed up to four hours. If substitute transportation is more than two hours late (four hours for international flights) or not provided, compensation doubles to 400% of the fare, with a $1,350 maximum. Airlines must also refund unused optional service fees for denied boarding. Air carriers advertise cheap base airfares and charge separate optional fees for services like checked baggage, seat selection, and in-flight meals. These ancillary charges, including baggage fees and reservation change fees, generated over $3.8 billion and $3 billion respectively in 2015. To ensure transparency, the DOT rule requires airlines to include all costs in their advertised airfare. Airlines must disclose full prices, including taxes and fees, in advertising and on e-ticket confirmations. They must also provide information on baggage fees and refund charges for lost bags. Some airlines challenged a rule requiring total ticket costs to be prominently displayed, but the court rejected their argument. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected airlines' argument against displaying total ticket costs prominently, stating it does not violate their rights. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld this decision in 2013. In 2014, the House passed a bill allowing airlines to highlight \"base airfare\" in ads as long as taxes and fees are disclosed separately. The Senate did not act on legislation regarding the disclosure of ancillary fees in the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-190)."
