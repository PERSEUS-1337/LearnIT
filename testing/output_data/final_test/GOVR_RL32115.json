    "content": "U.S. security interests in South Asia focus on weapons proliferation, reducing tensions, antiterrorism, and regional stability, with missiles playing a crucial role as potential delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons. The proliferation of missiles in the region is a key factor in assessing regional stability. In the 1990s, the U.S. aimed to protect the nonproliferation regime, prevent a nuclear arms race, and encourage dialogue between India and Pakistan, particularly regarding the Kashmir dispute. The Clinton Administration set five benchmarks for both countries based on UN Security Council Res. 1172, which condemned their nuclear tests in May 1998. The Bush Administration has made no reference to the benchmark framework set by the Clinton Administration in May 1998, which included signing the CTBT, halting fissile material production, limiting WMD delivery vehicles, implementing export controls, and establishing dialogue between India and Pakistan. Progress in these areas has been limited, with both countries continuing to produce weapons-grade fissile materials and unclear status on weaponization and deployment. There are concerns about potential WMD exports, especially from Pakistan. The Bush Administration shifted U.S. nonproliferation policy towards encouraging India and Pakistan to be responsible nuclear powers, moving away from international treaties like the CTBT. Tensions between the two countries remain significant, with no substantive dialogue in progress. There are concerns about potential WMD exports, particularly from Pakistan. The Bush Administration's de-emphasis on \"vertical proliferation\" has legitimized South Asia's strategic arsenals. Assistant Secretary of State Rocca stated that the U.S. is taking a pragmatic approach to urge India and Pakistan to exercise restraint. The 9/11 attacks transformed U.S. relations with India and Pakistan, with Pakistan becoming a front-line ally receiving significant U.S. foreign assistance. India's swift support for U.S. antiterrorism efforts improved U.S.-India relations in 2003. The improved U.S.-India relations in 2003 have raised the United States' influence in South Asian security dynamics. However, differences with Pakistan and India over various issues continue to complicate future engagement. Congress is concerned about missile proliferation in South Asia and the role of U.S. policy in promoting regional stability and nonproliferation efforts. Levels of U.S. foreign assistance to India and Pakistan, aid restrictions, transfer of conventional weapons platforms, export control parameters, and nonproliferation goals all have a vital congressional facet. Pending legislation could influence stability in South Asia. Understanding missile proliferation in South Asia is aided by reviewing historical conflicts between India and Pakistan, including the 1999 Kargil battle, the first significant clash between nuclear-armed countries. The 2002 military standoff between India and Pakistan raised concerns of a potential nuclear confrontation. Despite India's superior population, land area, GDP, and military strength, the U.S. struggled to maintain a balanced approach towards both countries in South Asia. India and Pakistan were established in August 1947 from British India, leading to a war over Kashmir. Despite India's superior status in terms of population, land area, GDP, and military strength, the United States has historically been more closely engaged with Pakistan due to various alliances and efforts, including containment of the Soviet Union and combating Islamic militancy. There has been a longstanding \"strategic divergence\" between the United States and Indian nationalists, shaping their interactions for decades. During the Cold War, U.S. interest in South Asia was limited due to a perceived lack of strategic or economic importance. Pakistan aligned with the U.S. in containment efforts against communism, leading to close ties and large aid packages. Meanwhile, India focused on nation-building and nonalignment, resulting in cool relations with the U.S. diplomat exchanges. During the Cold War, the United States provided military assistance to India after a border war with China in 1962. However, the second India-Pakistan war in 1965 led to the end of military aid to both countries. President Nixon's decision to support Pakistan during the turmoil in East Pakistan in 1971 strained U.S.-India relations. India's nuclear test in 1974 heightened U.S. concerns about weapons proliferation in South Asia. Asian weapons proliferation was a major concern for the U.S. during the Cold War, with Pakistan becoming a key ally in the fight against Soviet expansion. After the Soviet Union's collapse, U.S. policy towards South Asia aimed to improve Indo-Pakistani relations. However, restrictions on aid to Pakistan led to a perceived imbalance in U.S. policy. India saw a shift in its relations after the Cold War, with a reduction in aid from Moscow and the end of close Indian-Soviet ties. During the 1990s, Pakistan faced criticism for supporting insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir and the Afghani Taliban regime. U.S. aid restrictions were imposed after nuclear tests in May 1998 and a military coup in October 1999. President Clinton's visit to South Asia in March 2000 highlighted a shift in U.S. focus towards India. Following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, Pakistan became a key U.S. ally against radical Islamic terrorists, while India also joined the U.S.-led antiterrorism efforts. The U.S. lifted aid restrictions on India and Pakistan after both countries joined the antiterrorism coalition. While U.S.-India relations strengthened with joint military exercises and arms sales, concerns about Pakistan's role in WMD proliferation and terrorist activities persisted. Islamabad continued to receive U.S. foreign assistance despite these concerns. The key questions regarding missile proliferation in South Asia revolve around the potential for a strategic arms race between India and Pakistan. The key questions in South Asia revolve around a potential strategic arms race between India and Pakistan. Despite officials denying it, a Defense Department review in 2001 suggested that both countries are in an accelerated nuclear weapons and missile development phase, which could be seen as a \"slow-speed\" arms race. Director of Central Intelligence Tenet mentioned in 2002 that both countries are advancing their nuclear weapons capabilities. Both India and Pakistan are advancing their nuclear weapons capabilities, including developing long-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles with land-attack capability. Analysts warn that overt nuclear weaponization, especially of ballistic missiles, could lead to destabilization and escalation of conflict. India's strategic decision-making has been under scrutiny since the 1998 nuclear tests in South Asia. India's strategic decision-making post-1998 nuclear tests in South Asia is crucial for regional stability. The Pentagon notes that India's development of medium-range ballistic missiles is driven by its desire to be seen as a major power and competitor with China. China is satisfied with its current deterrent against India, while Pakistan's limited resources limit its ability to engage in an arms race with India. The future of nuclear proliferation in South Asia hinges on India's strategic intentions towards China, with a potential dangerous scenario being India seeking nuclear parity with China through a larger arsenal and long-range delivery capabilities. Deployment of Agni missiles capable of reaching China's population centers could prompt Beijing to redirect more nuclear forces southward. The debate over nuclear proliferation in South Asia is divided between \"optimists\" and \"pessimists.\" Optimists believe in the logic of deterrence, where both sides possessing nuclear weapons can lead to stability through mutual deterrence. Pessimists fear that the development of strategic arsenals could lead to a full-blown arms race on the Asian Subcontinent. U.S. sales of missile defense systems in Asia could also contribute to further ballistic missile proliferation in the region. Proliferation pessimists believe that the spread of nuclear weapons capability is destabilizing and dangerous, especially in conflict-prone areas. The Kargil conflict of 1999 is cited as evidence that South Asia's strategic arsenals do not contribute to stability and may increase the likelihood of nuclear weapons use. Talbott warned that India and Pakistan's justification for their nuclear capabilities by referencing the U.S.-Soviet Cold War experience may not accurately reflect the reality of their own situation. Both countries claim to only seek nuclear weapons for minimum credible deterrence, despite differing views on proliferation between Indian and Pakistani governments and some U.S. officials. Most Indian and Pakistani planners view minimum credible deterrence (MCD) as a scaled-down form of nuclear retaliation, aiming to inflict \"unacceptable damage\" on adversaries. A strategic arms race is observed in South Asia, limited by economic and technological factors, with differing views on its impact on regional stability. Perspectives on nuclear deterrence in the region vary based on fundamental beliefs and analysis of key variables. India and Pakistan possess nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and aircraft with the capability to strike targets outside their borders. They also have missile defense systems and chemical weapons. India declared its possession of chemical weapons in 1998 and is reportedly in the process of destroying them. India, a signatory of the Biological Weapons Convention, is believed to have an active biological defense research program and infrastructure to develop biological agents. Estimates suggest India had between 30 to 35 nuclear weapons with yields of 5 to 25 kilotons in 2002, likely configured as aerial bombs or missile warheads. The majority of India's nuclear weapons are reportedly configured as aerial bombs. India has a variety of aircraft including MiG-27 Flogger and Jaguar for nuclear bomb delivery. The Sukhoi-30MKI from Russia provides deep strike capability. India successfully tested Agni II missile with a nuclear warhead assembly in 1999 and 2001. India's Defense Minister reported that India conducted 20 missile tests in the first half of 2003, including two Agni variants. India's satellites, including the Technology Experiment Satellite, enhance its strategic capabilities, providing early warning and improving military command and control. Pakistan, a member of the CWC since 1997, is not believed to possess chemical weapons but has imported dual-use chemicals that could be used for making them. They have the capability for limited biological warfare research but are not believed to possess biological weapons. Pakistan is speculated to have between 24 and 48 nuclear weapons, with seismic measurements suggesting lower yields than claimed by Pakistan. Pakistan is speculated to have between 24 and 48 nuclear weapons with potential higher yield weapons that have not been tested. The country has obtained combat aircraft, with experts believing the U.S. F-16 fighter would be used for nuclear weapon delivery. Despite orders for additional F-16s, they have not been fulfilled due to the Pressler Amendment. The September 22, 2001 Presidential Determination waived the Pressler Amendment and other sanctions on India and Pakistan. Pakistan's current fleet of F-16s is believed to be capable of delivering a 1,000 kg nuclear bomb. A.Q. Khan claims that the Ghauri missile is currently Pakistan's only nuclear-capable missile. India's and Pakistan's missile forces' stability is influenced by factors such as readiness posture. India and Pakistan maintain similar readiness postures for their missile forces, with missiles kept in a state of \"induction\" rather than deployment. Both countries have been accused of deploying their missiles on several occasions, including during the July 1999 Kargil crisis. U.S. intelligence detected Pakistani military deploying nuclear-armed missiles, unknown to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during his meeting with President Clinton in Washington D.C. Both countries store their nuclear weapons separately for security. Analysts suggest increasing alert levels for credible nuclear postures. Pakistan's National Command Authority (NCA) was established in 2000 by President Musharraf, with control over nuclear weapons deployment. The NCA includes officials from various ministries and military services, with a Strategic Force Command responsible for missile deployment. Unlike India, Pakistan has not declared a \"no-first-use policy\" for its nuclear weapons. The Indian government established the Nuclear Command Authority in 2003, with a two-tiered political council headed by the Prime Minister for launching nuclear attacks. Additionally, a strategic forces command was set up for missile deployment. The Indian government established a strategic forces command to command all strategic assets, including aircraft, land-based missiles, and nuclear weapons. This move was seen as a response to international concerns about India's nuclear command and control structure and to send a message to Pakistan. Regional missile defense was debated as either promoting stability or upsetting the region's strategic balance. The Pentagon supports regional missile defense as a stabilizing concept, while the State Department expresses concerns about India obtaining missile interceptors from the US and Israel. India's motivation for missile defense is linked to Pakistan's missile capabilities. India's desire for missile defense is driven by concerns about Chinese DF-21 missiles in western China and Pakistan's nuclear threats. India is exploring options for regional missile defense, including modifying the Akash missile or purchasing a system from another country. There have been efforts to develop the Akash into a missile defense system, but no open-source reports of testing. India is interested in purchasing the U.S.-Israeli Arrow Missile Defense system, but concerns have been raised by the Senate and House Armed Services Committees about the potential sale. The Arrow system, developed with U.S. assistance, could trigger an arms race and raise worries about technology transfer to countries like China. The Arrow 2 missile system, developed with U.S. assistance, is designed to intercept short and medium-range ballistic missiles. Concerns have been raised about the potential sale to India, including violations of the Missile Technology Control Regime and competition with the U.S. Patriot missile system. India may deploy the Arrow system along the India-Pakistan border for defense. India has been in negotiations with Russia since 1995 to acquire the S-300PMU-1 or S-300V anti-tactical ballistic missile system. Discussions have also taken place with the U.S. for the sale of the Patriot Advanced Capabilities-3 air and missile defense system. Deployment of a missile defense system by India could impact Pakistan's nuclear deterrent capabilities. Pakistan's nuclear deterrent against India could be affected if India deploys a missile defense system. Analysts suggest that this could lead Pakistan to increase its nuclear warheads or adopt a \"use it or lose it\" policy. Some believe that a greater number of missiles and warheads could overwhelm India's defenses. There are differing opinions on whether Indian missile defense would contribute to regional stability. Pakistan is in negotiations with the United States to purchase a ballistic missile defense system, potentially the Patriot, Hawk, or Nike-Hercules system. These systems are not actively used by the U.S. Army and their effectiveness against modern threats is uncertain. The acquisition of such a system could deter Pakistan from further missile development to counter India's ballistic missile defense capabilities. Pakistan is considering deploying missile defense systems around nuclear facilities and missile sites to ensure the survival of its nuclear warheads. Acquiring a ballistic missile defense system from the United States could lead India to increase its missile and nuclear weapons production. Concerns also exist about the potential transfer of Patriot technology to other countries for developing countermeasures against U.S. ballistic missile intercepts. Some experts are concerned about India and Pakistan potentially exporting missiles or nuclear technology to other nations, increasing the security risk. Neither country is a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), established in 1987 to restrict the proliferation of WMD-capable missiles and technology. The MTCR is not legally binding, but members voluntarily enforce export control standards. Efforts may be made to gain Indian and Pakistani accession to the MTCR. India and Pakistan's potential accession to the MTCR could help address missile proliferation concerns. Critics argue against joining due to perceived control by industrialized countries. Technical assistance programs, like a Nunn-Lugar-type initiative, could reduce the risk of a nuclear exchange between the two countries. India and Pakistan are seen as potential candidates for a technical assistance program to safeguard their missiles. Concerns about equity and potential for suspicion between the two countries are raised. Export controls and multilateral initiatives could also be explored to assist India and Pakistan. A multilateral initiative could assist India and Pakistan in improving their export control systems, especially regarding missile technology. This effort could be standalone or in anticipation of MTCR membership, which requires approval from all current members and meeting strict export control requirements. It is uncertain how receptive India or Pakistan would be to such assistance, as export controls are considered a domestic legal matter. Pakistan may resist controls limiting its missile-related dealings with North Korea and Iran. Confidence-building measures, or CBMs, aim to reduce conflict risk and build trust between India and Pakistan. The 1999 Lahore Declaration included CBMs to prevent nuclear accidents, but were derailed by fighting in Kargil. The US could help establish new CBMs like hotlines and military notifications in the region. Possible confidence-building measures (CBMs) between India and Pakistan could include aerial monitoring efforts, establishment of dispute settlement mechanisms, and technological support for ground-based sensors in disputed areas. The United States could provide support and advice for these measures, although critics point out past failures of CBMs in the volatile region. Possible confidence-building measures (CBMs) between India and Pakistan, such as aerial monitoring efforts, dispute settlement mechanisms, and technological support for ground-based sensors in disputed areas, could be more effective if regional disputes are settled diplomatically first. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) focuses on interdicting WMD and associated technology, with ten nations agreeing to stop the flow of these items through air, land, and sea routes. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) aims to interdict WMD and associated technology through air, land, and sea routes. The PSI principles are consistent with national legal authorities and international laws. U.S.-sponsored naval exercises called \"Pacific Protector\" were conducted with Australia and Great Britain in 2003 as part of the PSI. While not targeting any specific country, the PSI is seen as a response to North Korean missile exports. India and Pakistan could also be subject to PSI actions. Congress may explore the legality of the PSI in U.S. and international law. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) aims to interdict WMD and associated technology through air, land, and sea routes. Congress may review the scope of the PSI in terms of India and Pakistan, questioning the legality of interdicting shipments to or from these countries under current international law. The CRS Report raises concerns about the PSI's wide-ranging provisions to interdict and seize WMD and missile-related technologies on the high seas. Suggestions to address the issue of sea and air proliferation under international law include amending current laws to include WMD and missile technologies. Concerns about a suspected Pakistan-North Korean proliferation relationship involve accusations of sharing missile and nuclear technology. Some experts believe Pakistan may be assisting North Korea in its missile program. The Presidential Determination waived sanctions against India and Pakistan, previously used to compel Pakistan to end proliferation activities with North Korea. Concerns arise about the BrahMos Cruise Missile's impact on U.S. missile defense vulnerability and the potential development of a nuclear warhead for it. The issue of missile proliferation and the international nonproliferation regime are also highlighted. While U.S. efforts to strengthen international nonproliferation have slowed under the Bush Administration, some advocate pressuring India and Pakistan to join treaties like the NPT and CTBT. The world's nuclear powers closely monitor U.S. nuclear weapon developments, impacting global proliferation perspectives. Some policymakers argue that new U.S. nuclear weapons would enhance deterrence, while others believe they would undermine nonproliferation goals. The potential ramifications of providing U.S.-developed missile and air defense systems to India and Pakistan are a concern. Experts are divided on whether it would de-escalate tensions or heighten them, with possible implications for Sino-Indian relations. Technology transfer issues and concerns about onward transfer to countries like North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia are also significant. The United States has expressed concerns about terrorism in Pakistan and neighboring regions, as well as the existence of outlawed terrorist groups. Some believe that the U.S. has muted its criticism of South Asian WMD proliferation due to the need for allies in the global anti-terrorist coalition. This trade-off between counterterrorism and nonproliferation policies poses a challenge for Congress. Options for Congress in addressing terrorism in Pakistan and neighboring regions include adjusting U.S. development assistance, reviewing military aid to India and Pakistan, and resolving the Kashmir dispute to reduce regional terrorism. Concerns also exist about terrorists gaining access to nuclear materials in these countries, prompting the consideration of expanding Cooperative Threat Reduction programs to secure nuclear assets. The United States aims to enhance security of nuclear assets in Pakistan and India through new initiatives, despite potential conflicts with treaty obligations and opposition from some analysts. Strong ties with both countries contribute to geostrategic stability in South and Southwest Asia. The Bush Administration seeks to expand engagement with India in high-technology trade and military relations, while focusing on antiterrorism cooperation with Pakistan and providing economic and military aid. Many in Congress are interested in initiatives affecting U.S. relations with India and Pakistan, economic development, and human rights promotion in the region. Increased U.S. trade and investment in the region could lead to more stable international relations. Efforts to resolve regional stability issues are crucial. Efforts to resolve the ongoing violence in the Kashmir region are crucial for regional stability. Improved U.S.-China and India-China relations could contribute to a more peaceful Asia in the future. South Asia's security dynamics have become a significant concern for the United States, especially after September 2001. The establishment of nuclear command and control mechanisms is seen as a positive step for missile proliferation and South Asian security. The establishment of nuclear command and control mechanisms and reliable ballistic missile capabilities between India and Pakistan is seen as contributing to crisis stability through mutual deterrence. Proliferation pessimism persists, with concerns about the potential for tension and increased incentive for a first strike in a crisis due to the nature of ballistic missiles. The contiguity of the countries and the lack of warning time with missiles pose challenges, especially given the existing animosity and risk of war related to terrorism and Kashmir. The risk of war between India and Pakistan remains high due to the proliferation of strategic arsenals in South Asia. Key concerns include the influence of Hindu nationalism in New Delhi, Islamic fundamentalism in Islamabad, and military rule in Pakistan hindering regional peace efforts. Ongoing violence in Kashmir, Pakistani support for terrorist groups, Afghani instability, and conflict along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border are crucial issues for South Asian security. In South Asia, key factors affecting regional stability include India-China relations, U.S. engagement with India and Pakistan, New Delhi's weapons procurement decisions, and the possible deployment of missile defense systems. While relations between New Delhi and Beijing have improved, India's acquisition of advanced weapons and pursuit of missile defense systems may impact regional stability. The progress of regional missile proliferation is also crucial. U.S. policies towards South Asia and the implications of missile proliferation on security in the region are important considerations. India's ballistic missile program is seen as a significant development in South Asian security, driven by a desire for prestige and strategic considerations towards Pakistan and China. It is considered one of the most ambitious missile programs in the developing world, capable of producing missiles with ranges comparable to those of established nuclear powers. Some experts believe India's space launch vehicles could potentially be converted into intercontinental ballistic missiles, although opinions on this vary. India's space launch vehicles have the potential to be converted into intercontinental ballistic missiles, but experts argue that India lacks a security requirement for such a conversion. The Indian Defense Research and Development Organization established a program in 1983 to develop ballistic missiles, and India procured high-quality foreign missile components in anticipation of the Missile Technology Control Regime. India's missile program has achieved self-sufficiency through foresight in obtaining high-quality foreign missile components and reverse engineering. This self-sufficiency allows India to avoid international export control restrictions and foreign involvement. India has developed two ballistic missiles, the short-range Prithvi and the medium-range Agni. The Prithvi I is a single-staged, liquid propellant short-range ballistic missile used exclusively by the Indian Army. It is reported to have various warheads, including high explosive, submunitions, fuel air explosive, and possibly chemical warheads. Experts believe India developed small yield nuclear warheads for the Prithvi I after nuclear tests in 1998. The missile, first test fired in February 1988, is capable of striking a quarter of Pakistan, including major cities like Islamabad. The Prithvi II, first test fired in January 1996, has the capability to hit almost half of Pakistan, including critical military targets and major cities. The Prithvi III is still under development with a range of 350 km and a payload of 750 kg. The Agni I is an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a range of 500 km to 2,500 km and a CEP of 100 m. India may install a GPS guidance system to improve missile accuracy. The Agni I missile has a range of 500 km to 2,500 km with a 100 m CEP. It has a separating reentry vehicle with aerodynamic maneuver fins. The Agni II has a range of 500 km to 3,500 km, a 100 m CEP, and a 200 KT nuclear warhead. It was first test launched in April 1999. The Agni II missile has been operationally available since late 2000 with an annual production rate of 15 to 20 missiles. It has a range that can strike all of Pakistan and parts of China. The Agni III, with a range of 5,000 km, is under development and believed to be \"China-specific.\" It is said to be rail and road-mobile with a new guidance system, capable of delivering a one-tonne warhead beyond the range of combat aircraft. India is developing the Agni III missile with solid propellant stages, potentially for nuclear weapons delivery. They are also working on a submarine-launched ballistic missile called Sagarika for a nuclear triad capability. India and Russia are jointly developing the BrahMos anti-ship cruise missile, with India's missile program being largely self-sufficient but still acquiring some missile components and technology from Russia. The BrahMos anti-ship cruise missile, developed jointly by India and Russia, has a range of 185 miles, a payload of 440 pounds, and a speed of over 1,400 miles per hour. Considered state-of-the-art, it travels at supersonic speed and is built with stealth technology, making it difficult to intercept. Both countries plan to deploy it with their armed forces and potentially export it to third-world countries. The missile can be fired from air, land, and sea, and could potentially be modified to carry a small nuclear warhead, enhancing India's nuclear missile capabilities. India and Russia plan to deploy the BrahMos missile to their armed forces by the end of 2003. Pakistan's ballistic missile program is seen as a response to India's capabilities, with rapid advances attributed to competition between key individuals. Pakistan relies on assistance from North Korea, China, and Iran for its missile program. Pakistan's missile program, influenced by India's advancements and US denial of F-16 aircraft, saw significant progress with Chinese assistance in acquiring M-11 missiles in 1992. This led to the development of Shaheen and Ghauri-series ballistic missiles. The Hatf I is a single-stage rocket with a 60 to 80 km range carrying a 500 kg payload or a 350 km range carrying a 100 kg payload. Analysts speculate it may carry high explosives, submunitions, or chemical weapons. Pakistan may have up to 80 of these rockets. The Hatf II is a two-stage missile with a 280 km range carrying a 500 kg payload or a 450 km range carrying a 300 kg payload. The program may have been terminated due to technical issues, but it was believed to potentially carry a nuclear warhead. The M-11 missile, delivered by China to Pakistan, has a 300 km range and a 500 kg payload capacity. It is road-mobile and can carry various warheads, including nuclear ones. The Shaheen I missile is considered a larger version of the M-11. The Shaheen I missile, a scaled-up version of the Chinese M-11, has a range of 600 km, 200 m accuracy, and can carry a 750 kg, 35 KT nuclear warhead. It can be launched within 5 to 10 minutes of arrival at a launch site. Pakistan may have had 5 to 10 Shaheen Is by 1999. The Shaheen II, with a 2,500 km range, 350 m CEP, and 750 kg warhead, is also developed by Pakistan. The Shaheen II missile, with a 350 m CEP, can carry a 750 kg 15 to 35 KT nuclear warhead, high explosives, submunitions, chemical, and fuel-air explosives. It may have a separating reentry vehicle and use GPS technology for accuracy. The Ghauri I missile, produced in Pakistan, is believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong I and II missile, with speculation of collaboration with Iran's Shahab III missile development. The Ghauri missiles, developed in collaboration, have ranges of 1,500 km for Ghauri I and 1,800 to 2,300 km for Ghauri II. Both can carry a 15 to 35 KT nuclear warhead. Ghauri III, with a possible 3,000 km range, is in development. Pakistan's 47th Artillery Brigade deployed Ghauri I in late 1998. Foreign involvement in Pakistan's missile program was critical, with Chinese and North Korean assistance cited in reports. China was heavily involved in the development of the Shaheen I missile, with transfers of designs for a missile factory. China also increased shipments of specialty steels, guidance systems, and technical expertise to Pakistan. Reports suggest China assisted in developing the Shaheen II missile and possibly nuclear weapons. Pakistan's missile program has received assistance from North Korea, with concerns raised about the transfer of missile technology between the two countries. There are allegations that Pakistan has provided test data from its Ghauri missile program to North Korea, despite North Korea's self-imposed moratorium on long-range missile test flights. Additionally, Pakistan is believed to be sharing solid-fuel propulsion technology with North Korea for its missile program. North Korea received solid-fuel propulsion technology from Pakistan for its missile program, with concerns about missile technology transfer between the two countries. Allegations of Pakistani-Iranian missile cooperation have reportedly deteriorated due to anti-Shiite activities in Pakistan and Islamabad's policies towards Afghanistan in relation to the U.S. war on terror."
