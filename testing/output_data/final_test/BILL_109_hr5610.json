    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Foreign Anti-Sex Offender Protection Act of 2006\". It includes findings related to the protection against sex offenders. The Congress finds that immigration law allows citizens and lawful permanent residents to bring foreign family members to the US based on immediate relative status or preference classification. The Secretary of Homeland Security conducts background checks on beneficiaries and petitioners for national security reasons. In fiscal year 2005, 398 petitioners filing family-based visa petitions were on the National Sex Offender Registry. In fiscal year 2005, 398 petitioners filing family-based visa petitions were on the National Sex Offender Registry. The nature of the sex offense was identified for 194 petitioners, with convictions including sex assault, child fondling, rape, statutory rape, indecent exposure, kidnapping, and possession of obscene material. Some petitioners were classified as \"sexual predators\" likely to commit additional sex offenses. At least 45 petitioners convicted of sex offenses against children may not be denied family-based petitions by the Secretary of Homeland Security, as the Immigration and Nationality Act does not authorize such denials even when a spouse or child beneficiary is at risk. SEC. 3. Discretionary authority to deny family-sponsored classification petition by petitioner on national sex offender registry. Section 204 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to deny a family-based petition if the petitioner is listed on the national sex offender registry for a conviction resulting in incarceration for more than 1 year. The Secretary of Homeland Security can deny a family-based petition if the petitioner is on the national sex offender registry for a conviction resulting in over 1 year of incarceration. The petition may also be denied if granting it would endanger a spouse or child through sexual abuse. Factors like the relationship between the petitioner and spouse are considered in assessing the danger. Petitions based on marriages with little personal contact should be viewed skeptically. Evidence must show alternative ways the couple got to know each other. Consideration should be given to the nature of any sex offense committed by the petitioner, including when it occurred, seriousness, sentence imposed, duration of incarceration, age at the time of the offense, and characteristics of the victim. The evaluation of rehabilitation for evidence of reducing the risk of sexual abuse to spouse or child beneficiaries, examination of previous visa petitions for relevant evidence, and providing a notice of reasons for denial if applicable. The petitioner is given 90 days to submit rebuttal evidence focusing on factors leading to denial. Final denials can be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and a new petition can be filed with additional evidence. The Secretary of Homeland Security gives petitioners 90 days to prove they are not listed on the national sex offender registry. If they fail to do so, beneficiaries are provided with information from the registry before a decision is made on the petition. The Secretary of Homeland Security requires petitioners to prove they are not on the national sex offender registry within 90 days. If confirmed on the registry, the Secretary provides the Secretary of State with relevant information, including concerns about potential sexual abuse of beneficiaries. The consular officer conducts an interview with the beneficiary before issuing a visa if the petitioner fails to prove they are not on the national sex offender registry. The interview includes private questioning without the petitioner present, and the beneficiary receives written information. The consular officer provides the beneficiary with written information about the petitioner from the public registry in their primary language. The officer also warns the beneficiary that visa approval does not guarantee safety. Additionally, the officer can send files back to Homeland Security if there are concerns about potential sexual abuse risks to the beneficiary or their family. The consular officer may include additional information or observations that could impact the visa decision, such as results from field examinations. SEC. 4. REMOVAL OF CONDITIONAL PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS. Section 216(d)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to require interviews for spouses and children subject to sexual abuse or harm, especially if the petitioner is listed on the national sex offender registry. Prior to removal of conditional status, interviews are required for spouses and children subject to abuse or harm, with a private portion held without the petitioning spouse. If abuse is found, the victim will be offered assistance and information on ways to stay in the US independently of the qualifying marriage. The amendment allows for a hardship waiver in cases where the alien spouse or child has been sexually abused during a qualifying marriage entered into in good faith. Special task force established to identify individuals on the national sex offender registry who have filed family-based classification petitions. The Secretary of Homeland Security establishes a task force called the \"Task Force to Rescue Immigrant Victims of American Sex Offenders\" consisting of officials from various law enforcement agencies. The task force's duties include identifying individuals on the FBI's sex offender registry who have filed family-based petitions under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The task force is responsible for maintaining a comprehensive database of petitioners, prioritizing information based on the risk to family members, investigating cases where beneficiaries may be at risk, protecting privacy rights, and taking appropriate actions based on investigation findings. The task force is responsible for investigating sexual abuse and criminal activities, including notifying relevant authorities. A report to Congress must be submitted within 270 days, detailing findings, investigations, and recommendations for identifying and protecting immigrant victims of sexual abuse. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the provisions of the Act, with funds remaining available until expended. Regulations for implementing the Act must be finalized within 180 days of its enactment."
