    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"GET THE LEAD OUT Act of 2016\" and aims to reduce lead in drinking water. The \"GET THE LEAD OUT Act of 2016\" defines an eligible entity as a community water system, system in an area governed by an Indian Tribe, nontransient noncommunity water system, qualified nonprofit organization, or municipality/State/interstate/intermunicipal agency. A lead reduction project is a project aimed at reducing lead levels in water for human consumption. The \"GET THE LEAD OUT Act of 2016\" aims to reduce lead levels in water for human consumption through various measures, including replacing lead service lines, testing and planning to address conditions contributing to lead levels, assisting low-income homeowners in replacing lead-containing components, and educating consumers on reducing lead exposure. Eligible entities for lead reduction projects include community water systems, Indian Tribe governed areas, nonprofit organizations, and municipal agencies. The term \"lead reduction project\" excludes partial lead service line replacements if drinking water is still delivered through a lead service line. The term \"low-income\" is defined by the head of the municipality or State providing assistance. \"Municipality\" refers to a public entity like a city, town, or county. The Administrator will establish a grant program to assist eligible entities, including municipalities and Indian tribes, with lead reduction projects in the United States. Assistance will be provided based on the identification of lead sources in water for human consumption. The Administrator will prioritize eligible entities that have exceeded lead levels in water systems or address lead levels in facilities serving children or vulnerable populations for grants to reduce lead levels. The Administrator may establish priority criteria for grants to reduce lead levels in water systems or facilities serving vulnerable populations. The non-Federal share of project costs funded by a grant must be at least 20 percent, but the Administrator can waive this requirement for affordability reasons. Eligible entities can use grants for low-income assistance. An eligible entity can use a grant to assist low-income homeowners with lead reduction projects, with a limitation on the grant amount for privately owned service line replacement. Special considerations for lead service line replacement include notifying customers and offering replacements for non-low-income homeowners. The grant can be used to assist low-income homeowners with lead reduction projects by replacing privately owned portions of lead service lines. Customers must be notified of planned replacements funded by the grant. The grant funded lead reduction projects require customer consent for simultaneous replacement of privately owned lead service lines and consideration of multiple options for reducing lead in drinking water. $60,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2021."
