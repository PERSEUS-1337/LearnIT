    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2001\". The Congress acknowledges the tragic crimes of the Holocaust, including the murder of 6,000,000 European Jews and the systematic destruction of families. Many Holocaust survivors faced challenges in reclaiming insurance policies due to lack of documentation. Insurance company records are crucial in proving the existence of these policies, and survivors have been advocating for settlement of unpaid claims. The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established in 1998 to address unpaid insurance policies issued to Holocaust victims. The United States and Germany signed an Executive Agreement in 2000 to support the ICHEIC in resolving all unpaid insurance claims. The deadline for claims applications to the ICHEIC is January 31, 2002. Insurance companies are withholding names on dormant accounts with unpaid policies, causing delays in resolving claims. Claimants struggle to identify the companies holding the policies. Companies in the US must disclose insurance policies of Holocaust victims to expedite resolution and prevent further victimization. State legislatures in California, Florida, and New York are involved in addressing this issue. State legislatures in California, Florida, New York, Minnesota, and Washington face challenges implementing laws restricting insurers until they disclose names of Holocaust-era policyholders. The purpose of this Act is to provide information on Holocaust-era insurance policies to victims and their heirs for rightful claims. The Holocaust Insurance Registry is established to collect and maintain records of information provided under the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2001. The Archivist will make this information publicly accessible and searchable online. The Holocaust Insurance Registry requires insurers to disclose information about Holocaust-era policies, including policyholder details and issuing entities. Insurers must file this information electronically with the Secretary of Commerce within 90 days of the enactment of the Act or by January 31, 2002. Additionally, insurers must provide information to the Archivist for public access. The Secretary of Commerce must promptly provide filed information to the Archivist of the United States. A civil penalty of at least $5,000 per day will be imposed on insurers for non-compliance with section 4. Amounts received as civil penalties can be used by the Archivist to maintain the Holocaust Insurance Registry. SEC. 8. NOTIFICATION.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce will notify each State's insurance commissioner of insurers failing to comply with section 4 or pay civil penalties. Upon request, the Secretary will inform state commissioners about non-compliant insurers.\n\nSEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS REPORTING STATUTES. SEC. 9. State Holocaust Claims Reporting Statutes. This section addresses the preemption of State laws requiring insurers to disclose information about insurance policies taken from victims of Nazi persecution. It also discusses the sense of Congress regarding legal fees in litigation related to these State laws. In this Act, the term \"commissioner of insurance\" refers to the highest-ranking officer of a State responsible for regulating insurance. The term \"covered policy\" includes life, dowry, education, or property insurance policies issued to policyholders domiciled in areas of the European Continent occupied or controlled by Nazi Germany or its allies between January 30, 1933, and December 31, 1945. The term \"insurer\" refers to any person engaged in the business of insurance in the United States interstate or foreign commerce. The term \"related company\" in the Act refers to an affiliate as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act."
