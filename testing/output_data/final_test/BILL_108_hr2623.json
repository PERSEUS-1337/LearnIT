The Cahaba River is nationally recognized for its unique biological diversity, including habitat for over 131 fish species, 64 rare and imperiled aquatic plants and animals, and 12 endangered or threatened aquatic animal species. It also harbors the largest population of the imperiled shoals lily and contains rare plant communities in its watershed. The Cahaba River is home to unique plant communities and endemic aquatic animals. It is the longest free-flowing river in Alabama, recognized for its outstanding water quality. The river also has high recreational value for various outdoor activities. The Cahaba River watershed supports diverse game species and was designated for inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System by Congress. Expanding the Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge would bring additional recreational and conservation benefits. The Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge, defined as the Refuge in this Act, is set to expand under the Secretary of the Interior. The Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge in Bibb County, Alabama, will be expanded to include approximately 30,000 acres of lands and waters. The Secretary may make minor boundary revisions as needed. The map depicting the expansion will be available for inspection. The Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge in Bibb County, Alabama will be expanded by approximately 30,000 acres, with the expansion taking effect upon the enactment of the Act. The Secretary may acquire up to 30,000 acres of lands and waters within the Refuge boundaries described in section 4(a)(1), which will become part of the Refuge. The Secretary shall conserve, enhance, and restore the native aquatic and terrestrial community characteristics of the Cahaba River, habitat for endangered species, and prioritize hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and environmental education on the Refuge.
