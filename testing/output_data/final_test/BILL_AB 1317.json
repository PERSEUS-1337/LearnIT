    "title": "AB 1317",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2699.3 of the Labor Code is amended to require written notice by certified mail to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the employer before a civil action can be filed by an aggrieved employee for a violation of specified code provisions. The employer can cure the alleged violation within a 33-day period. If not cured, the employee must notify the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the employer by certified mail. The agency must notify the employer and the employee within 30 days if they do not intend to investigate a violation. If no notice is provided within 33 days, the employee can start a civil action. If the agency decides to investigate a violation, it must notify the employer and employee within 33 days of receiving the initial notice. The agency has 120 days to investigate and issue a citation. If no citation is issued within 158 days or if there is a failure to provide timely notification, the employee can start a civil action. A plaintiff can add a cause of action under this part to an existing complaint within 60 days. A civil action by an aggrieved employee alleging a violation of Division 5 must meet specific requirements, including giving notice to the relevant agencies and the employer. The employer can cure alleged violations within a 33-day period, or the employee can notify the Division of Occupational Safety and Health if the violation is not cured. The division will then inspect or investigate the alleged violation according to specified procedures. If the division issues a citation, the employee cannot take legal action under Section 2699. The division must notify the employee, representative, and employer within 14 days of certifying the violation correction. If the division does not issue a citation by the end of the inspection period, the employee can challenge this decision in court following precedents of the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board. If the court orders the division to issue a citation, the employee cannot file a civil action under Section 2699. The superior court shall not dismiss the action for nonmaterial differences in facts or theories between the notices provided to the division and employer and the complaint filed with the court. If the division fails to inspect or investigate the alleged violation, the employee may commence a civil action. Nothing in this subdivision alters the authority of the division to permit long-term abatement periods or enter into agreements with employers for long-term abatement issues. An employee cannot file a civil action under Section 2699 while the employer is in consultation with the division to address worksite conditions. Employers cannot enter into consultation with the division to avoid actions under this section after receiving notice. The superior court must approve any settlement for violations of Division 5 to ensure it meets state and federal standards. The division can comment on health and safety provisions in the settlement, and the court must consider their input. Civil actions by employees for violations must meet specific requirements before commencing. The aggrieved employee must provide written notice of alleged violations to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the employer. The employer has 33 days to cure the violation, after which the employee can commence a civil action if the violation is not resolved. No employer can use the notice and cure provisions more than three times in a 12-month period for the same violation. If the employee disputes the cure, they must provide written notice to the employer and agency. The agency must review the employer's actions to cure a violation within 17 days of notice. If the violation is not cured or if no notification is provided, the employee can proceed with a civil action. If the violation is deemed cured but the employee disagrees, they can appeal to the superior court. The time periods specified in this section do not count towards the time limit for commencing a civil action. The sum of $1,400,000 is appropriated to the Department of Industrial Relations to establish nine new positions for reviewing and investigating cases under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004."
