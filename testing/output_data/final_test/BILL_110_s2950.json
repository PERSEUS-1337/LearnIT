The autism navigators provide referrals, financial support, service coordination, health insurance coverage assistance, and partnerships within the healthcare and advocacy community. The autism navigators work with the healthcare and advocacy community to assist the underserved autism community by notifying individuals about clinical trials, helping them overcome barriers in accessing services, and coordinating with State departments for various services. The autism navigators provide caregiver supports, mentoring, and resources for individuals with autism spectrum disorder and their families. They also offer culturally sensitive support and serve as expert resources for accessing early intervention services. The eligible entity receiving a grant will develop an autism navigator program to recruit, train, and supervise autism navigators. Grants will support access to early intervention services, health insurance, housing programs, financial security programs, Medicare, and Medicaid services. The autism navigator program developed under the grant shall be for a maximum of 5 years, subject to annual approval by the Secretary and availability of appropriations. There is no limit on the number of grants that can be awarded to eligible entities. The program will reach out to doctor's offices and treatment centers to encourage referrals for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The autism navigator program developed under the grant aims to train navigators with direct knowledge of communities, health insurance systems, and evidence-based practices for individuals with autism spectrum disorder.

It provides centralized access to Federal and State programs related to autism spectrum disorders. The autism navigator program is carried out by various agencies including the Administration for Children and Families, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and others.
