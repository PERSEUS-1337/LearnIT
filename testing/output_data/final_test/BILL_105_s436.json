The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund is created in the Treasury of the United States, funded by taxes imposed under specific sections. Amounts in the Trust Fund can be used without fiscal year limitation.

If a state's expenses exceed the allocated amount, the excess is carried over to the following fiscal year. Definitions include \"qualified expenses.\" The term 'qualified expenses' refers to expenses incurred for equipment, rolling stock, capital improvements, maintenance facilities, and interest/principal payments for obligations made between September 30, 1997, and October 1, 2002, for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and non-Amtrak States.
