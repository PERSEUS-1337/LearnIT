    "content": "The \"Mandatory Minimum Reform Act of 2015\" is the short title of this Act. Congress found that mandatory minimum sentences, particularly for drug offenses, are rigid and do not allow judges to impose lower sentences. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, enacted hastily during the crack cocaine epidemic, imposed harsh penalties on low-level drug offenders. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 introduced new mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders, leading to a significant increase in the federal prison population and a rise in annual spending on the federal prison system. The average cost to keep one prisoner in federal prison for a year is approximately $29,000. Over 400,000 drug offenders were sentenced between 1995 and 2010. Between 1995 and 2010, over 400,000 drug offenders were sentenced under Federal law, with almost 250,000 (61 percent) receiving mandatory minimum sentences. In 2013, almost two-thirds of all drug offenders received a mandatory sentence, with most getting a 10-year minimum. The majority of these offenders are nonviolent or lower-level offenders with little to no criminal history. The United States Sentencing Commission found that mandatory minimum sentences disproportionately impact African-American drug defendants, who are 20% more likely to be sentenced to prison than White drug defendants. Between 1994 and 2003, the average time served by African-Americans for a drug offense increased by 62%, compared to a 17% increase among White drug defendants. According to government surveys, drug use is consistent across racial and ethnic groups. Research shows that drug users typically buy drugs from sellers of the same background. However, over 70% of Federal narcotics offenders sentenced each year are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, many of whom are low-level offenders. Federal prosecutors' focus on low-level drug offenders has led to a disproportionate number of African-Americans facing heightened crack cocaine penalties. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, African-Americans are disproportionately convicted and serve longer sentences for drug offenses compared to Whites, with 81.8% of Federal crack cocaine convictions imposed on African-Americans. In 2013, almost 34 percent of women entering Federal prison did so for a drug offense. Linking drug quantity with punishment severity has had a significant impact on women, who are more likely to play peripheral roles in a drug enterprise than men. Prosecutors can attach drug quantities to an individual regardless of their level of participation, leading to harsher sentences for women. Low-level and mid-level drug offenders can be adequately prosecuted by the States and punished or supervised in treatment as appropriate. The Departments of Justice, the Treasury, and Homeland Security have the greatest capacity to address drug offenses. Security agencies have the capacity to investigate and dismantle high-level drug trafficking organizations. Congress needs current information on prosecutions of high-level and low-level drug offenders to reauthorize Federal drug enforcement programs. Cost-effective sentencing policies that increase public safety should be used, as mandatory sentences may not reduce recidivism or deter crime. Prisons are important and expensive; limited resources in the Federal criminal justice system should be used to protect society by incapacitating dangerous offenders. The Federal judiciary is best positioned to determine sentencing and prison allocation. SEC. 3.
