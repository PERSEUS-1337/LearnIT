The Super-AND approach, based on the Anchor Neighbourhood Discovery model, uses multiple losses to improve sample grouping and feature invariance. This model outperforms existing methods, achieving 89.2% accuracy in CIFAR-10 with Resnet18, a 2.9% improvement. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks are crucial in computer vision, with supervised learning leading significant advancements. Unsupervised deep learning has gained attention in computer vision tasks due to high annotation costs in supervised learning. Various methods like clustering analysis, self-supervised models, and generative models have shown promise in extracting visually meaningful representations without labels. In unsupervised deep learning for computer vision tasks, methods aim to extract visually meaningful representations without labels. New approaches focus on positive and negative separation in the embedding space to improve model performance. The Super-AND model is a holistic method for unsupervised embedding learning that extends the Anchor Neighborhood Discovery (AND) algorithm. It aims to unify various dominant approaches in the domain by focusing on learning distinctive features across neighborhoods and maintaining class information from augmented data. The Super-AND model extends the AND algorithm for unsupervised embedding learning by introducing UE-loss to gather similar data points in a low-density space. It outperforms baselines on benchmark datasets, achieving 89.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with ResNet18 compared to 86.3% from state-of-the-art models. The experiments and ablation study demonstrate that every component in Super-AND contributes to performance improvement, highlighting the critical synergies. The model's exceptional performance brings unsupervised techniques in computer vision tasks closer to broader adoption. Data-less embedding learning's applicability to scenarios with minimal examples per cluster is emphasized. Access to Super-AND codes and trained data is available through a GitHub link. Generative models, a powerful branch in unsupervised learning, reconstruct underlying data distributions to generate new data points and features from images without labels. The Generative adversarial network has driven rapid progress in image generation problems, while some progress has been made in unsupervised embedding learning. Generative models aim to mimic the true distribution of each class in unsupervised embedding learning. Self-supervised learning uses inherent structures in images for training, such as predicting pixel positions or changes in images. Wu et al. (2018) proposed a method to learn feature representation by capturing discriminability among instances. These methods are suitable for unsupervised embedding learning, but there is a risk of false knowledge from generated labels. Data augmentation enables models to learn from diverse datasets without deforming crucial features. Clustering analysis groups similar objects together, often using deep learning for dimensionality reduction or end-to-end training. Deep cluster is an iterative concept proposed by Caron et al. (2018). The AND model, extended from the deep cluster concept, combines sample specificity and clustering strategy to improve supervision by analyzing neighborhoods in unlabeled image sets. The goal is to obtain a feature extractor with visually meaningful representations. The AND model utilizes Sobel-processed images and concatenates feature vectors to emphasize edge information. A nonparametric classifier computes the probability of images being recognized as their own class. A temperature parameter is added for label distribution with low entropy. A memory bank is used to save instance embeddings, updated by exponential moving average. The probability vector is defined with neighborhood relationship vectors. The algorithm trains Super-AND by defining neighborhood relationship vectors and using them to detect discrepancies between neighborhoods. The loss term enforces unchanged features even after data augmentation. It involves selecting pairs discovered by the nearest neighbor algorithm and concatenating embedded vectors from the image set. The hyper-parameter w(t) controls the weights of UE-loss. The AND model suggests a finer-grained clustering focusing on 'neighborhoods' to address limitations of existing methods. It involves three main steps: neighborhood discovery, progressive neighborhood selection with curriculum, and neighborhood supervision. The k nearest neighborhood (k-NN) algorithm is used for the first step. The k nearest neighborhood (k-NN) algorithm is used for neighborhood supervision. Curriculum learning involves progressively selecting neighborhood pairs based on visual similarity for consistent training. Entropy of probability vector is used to select candidate neighborhoods for local classes. The k nearest neighborhood (k-NN) algorithm is used for neighborhood supervision in a low-density area with few neighbors. The AND-loss function is defined to distinguish neighborhood pairs, ensuring data points from the same neighborhoods are classified in the same class. Existing sample specificity methods use cross-entropy loss in a confined space by normalization, limiting the distance between data points. The unification entropy loss (UE-loss) enhances the concentration-effect in a confined space by minimizing the entropy of the probability vector. This loss, along with the AND-loss, aims to bring similar neighborhoods closer while keeping overall neighborhoods separated. Unsupervised embedding learning trains encoders to extract visually meaningful features consistent with ground truth labels. Unsupervised embedding learning aims to extract visually meaningful features consistent with ground truth labels without external guidance. Data augmentation, such as the Augmentation-loss, helps learn invariant image features by considering augmented instances as positive samples. The neighborhood relationship vectors should be similar to initial data points to improve performance. The Augmentation-loss aims to minimize misclassification by considering augmented instances as positive samples. Extensive experiments were conducted using different backbone networks on coarse-grained and fine-grained benchmarks. The model's critical components were identified through an ablation study, and comparisons were made with the original AND model. Six image datasets were used for training, with AlexNet and ResNet18 as backbone networks. We utilized AlexNet and ResNet18 as backbone networks, tuning hyper-parameters similar to the AND algorithm. The optimizer used was SGD with Nesterov momentum 0.9. The learning rate was initially set at 0.03 for 80 epochs, decreasing by 0.1 every 40 epochs. Training involved 5 rounds with 200 epochs each, adjusting UE-loss weights and using four types of augmentation. Evaluation employed a weighted k-NN classifier following Wu et al. (2018), with N top neighbors used for prediction. The Super-AND model utilized top k-nearest neighbors for prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets. The Super-AND model showed superior performance on CIFAR-100 with AlexNet, indicating potential benefits for stronger CNN architectures like ResNet18. Fine-grained evaluation on subtle differences between classes also demonstrated outstanding results with the ResNet18 backbone network compared to baselines. The study tested different backbone networks (AlexNet, ResNet18, ResNet101) on CIFAR-10, showing that stronger networks lead to better performance. An ablation study was conducted on the Super-AND model, revealing that each component contributes to performance increase, with a significant impact from the Augmentation-loss component. The study compared different initialization methods for the Super-AND model, finding that the choice of initialization is not significant. Using solely the instance loss for initialization even had a negative impact on performance. This suggests that the model is robust to random initial data points but may show unexpected outcomes with ambiguous knowledge. Super-AND leverages learning similarities in neighborhoods and invariant features from data. Super-AND has a high capability of discovering cluster relationships by learning similarities in neighborhoods and invariant features from data augmentation. The embedding quality was evaluated by checking the class consistency of selected neighborhoods, showing that Super-AND maintains consistent and discriminative clusters. The reduction in consistency of selected neighborhoods for Super-AND is not significant compared to the original AND model. The reduction in consistency of selected neighborhoods for Super-AND is not significant compared to the original AND model. Super-AND excels in capturing class information, with robust clusters that recognize object shapes well and are flexible in color composition. Super-AND is a holistic technique for unsupervised embedding learning that introduces the UE-loss for grouping nearby data points in low-density spaces. It outperforms state-of-the-art models in experiments with coarse-grained and fine-grained datasets, making it a cost-effective option for unsupervised learning where labels are expensive to generate."
