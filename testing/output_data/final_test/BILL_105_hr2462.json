The deductions allowed under section 62(a) are allocated to spouses based on their ownership rights in the property. Deductions for retirement savings, alimony, and contributions to medical savings accounts are assigned to the respective spouses for whom they apply. The deductions allowed under section 62(a) are allocated to spouses based on their ownership rights in the property.
