Chapter 1209 of the title is amended to include a new item at the end. \"Reserves: retention on active duty after demobilization following extended deployments in contingency operations or homeland defense missions.\" The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to provide a special rule for veterans residing in high unemployment counties. This rule allows for an increase in tax credits for employers hiring unemployed veterans who have performed at least 800 hours of service. An unemployed veteran residing in a high unemployment county is considered a targeted group for tax credit purposes. The term \"unemployed veteran\" is defined without certain conditions, and a high unemployment county is one where the unemployment rate exceeds the national threshold. The national unemployment threshold is 12 percent, indexed and multiplied by the ratio of the national unemployment rate for the month to 9.5 percent. The amendment applies to individuals starting work after the enactment date. Grants are provided for eligible entities offering transportation to Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities for veterans in rural areas. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs establishes a grant program for eligible entities to provide transportation options to veterans in rural areas. Eligible entities include government entities, non-profit service providers, State veterans' service agencies, veterans service organizations, local governmental authorities, and private non-profit organizations. Grants are to assist veterans in rural areas to travel to Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities, with a maximum amount of $100,000 per fiscal year. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs establishes a grant program for eligible entities to provide transportation options to veterans in rural areas. Grants may not exceed $100,000 per fiscal year and do not require matching funds. Regulations are prescribed for evaluating grant applications, coordinating transportation services, and defining veterans service organizations. The term \"local governmental authority\" refers to a local government providing public transportation. A veteran is considered to be residing in a rural area if they live more than 30 miles from the nearest Department health care facility for primary care services. The veteran may qualify for care if they live more than 100 miles from a Department health care facility providing tertiary care, or if travel to the nearest facility is not in their best interest due to hardship or difficulties. The Secretary determines the veteran's interest for this subsection. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 for this section."
