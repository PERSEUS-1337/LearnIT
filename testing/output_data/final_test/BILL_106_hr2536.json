    "content": "The Act titled as the \"San Francisco Bay Shipping and Fisheries Enhancement Act of 1999\" includes findings. Congress finds that San Francisco Bay is a vital environmental, industrial, and recreational resource, with over 800 tank vessels entering annually carrying hazardous substances. The small oil spill in 1996 highlighted the costly and harmful effects of spills on the environment. The Coast Guard's inability to improve vessel routing due to the bay's bathymetry poses risks, compounded by multiple underwater hazards near shipping lanes. Increased traffic of tankers with drafts in excess of 45 feet near shipping lanes in San Francisco Bay significantly raises the risk of collisions or groundings, leading to oil spills that could severely damage the economy and environment. Removing navigation hazards to separate vessels carrying hazardous substances is a cost-effective way to reduce pollution risks and improve safety for wildlife and the environment. Navigational improvements are necessary to reduce pollution risks and improve safety for wildlife and the environment in San Francisco Bay. The Secretary of the Army will develop a navigation project in San Francisco Bay to remove underwater hazards near Alcatraz Island, reroute vessel traffic to prevent spills, and minimize environmental impacts. The Secretary will develop a plan for a navigation project in San Francisco Bay, including design, hazard removal, and environmental mitigation, with a feasibility study to be completed within 2 years. The plan for a navigation project in San Francisco Bay includes scoping, alternative designs, cost-benefit analysis, and selection of final project design. The second phase involves underwater hazard removal, transportation, and disposal of material. The final phase includes mitigation and monitoring. The final phase of the navigation project in San Francisco Bay involves mitigation and monitoring of environmental impacts, with monitoring continuing for at least 5 years. Non-Federal participation includes a 50% cost share for the feasibility study and a 25% cost share for project implementation. Reports to Congress are required periodically. The Secretary must report to Congress on the progress of the project under this section. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will modify navigation lanes and reroute vessel traffic in San Francisco Bay to enhance safety and efficiency. A vessel routing program will be developed to reduce the risk of oil spills. SEC. 5. OIL SPILL RISK ASSESSMENT. The Maritime Administrator, in consultation with the Coast Guard Commandant, will survey operational vessels for oil spill risks and hazards. The Commandant will use the same standards as private vessels. A report on identified risks and corrective actions will be submitted to Congress within a year. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the Secretary of the Army and the Commandant of the Coast Guard for fiscal years after September 30, 1999. The funds will be available until expended."
