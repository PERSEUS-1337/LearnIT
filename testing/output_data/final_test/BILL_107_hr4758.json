    "content": "The Act titled \"Restore Fiscal Discipline and Safeguard Social Security Act of 2002\" aims to ensure fiscal responsibility and protect Social Security. The Congress finds that the Government is projected to run deficits, relying on social security and medicare trust fund surpluses, despite assurances of budget balance without using social security surpluses. The Secretary of the Treasury has requested a $750 billion increase in the debt limit to save the social security and medicare trust fund surpluses. This increase would be the second largest in history and is deemed irresponsible without a plan to protect taxpayers from further national debt increases. Congress should approve a limited debt limit increase to prevent financial default and collaborate with the President on a fiscal restoration plan. The purpose of the Act is to provide a responsible increase in the debt limit to meet current legal obligations. Current law enforces budget resolutions by imposing points of order for violations in discretionary spending totals or reductions in receipts. The Act aims to responsibly increase the debt limit to meet legal obligations. It also includes measures to strictly limit future increases in the debt limit until a plan is enacted to balance the budget by 2007 without relying on the social security trust fund surplus. Additionally, it requires the President to submit a budget plan to achieve balance by fiscal year 2007. The Act aims to establish points of order against budget resolutions that do not eliminate deficits projected by the Congressional Budget Office within five years, without relying on the social security trust fund surplus. This is to restore fiscal discipline and preserve social security for future retirees. SEC. 101. INCREASE IN DEBT LIMIT. Increase in Statutory Debt Limit to $6,100,000,000,000 and implementation of a point of order in the House of Representatives and the Senate to restrict any bill that raises the public debt limit by more than $100,000,000,000 without a budget resolution in place. The budget resolution must achieve on-budget balance or surplus within 4 fiscal years and maintain it thereafter, without reducing social security benefits. The requirement can be waived if the Committee on the Budget certifies the balance or surplus based on a Congressional Budget Office report. The Congressional Budget Office will assume discretionary spending levels if legislation extends the limits beyond fiscal year 2002 before the release of the report. This certification is valid until the submission of the next report. SEC. 102. The President must submit a plan to balance the budget by 2007. The plan should be based on the Congressional Budget Office's economic assumptions. TITLE II - A circuit breaker is proposed to protect Social Security. Effective January 1, 2003, a circuit breaker provision prohibits the consideration of any budget resolution in the House of Representatives or the Senate that projects an on-budget deficit larger than the Congressional Budget Office's projection, does not achieve on-budget balance or surplus within 4 fiscal years, or includes reductions in social security benefits. Effective January 1, 2003, a provision prohibits considering any budget resolution in Congress that projects an on-budget deficit when the Congressional Budget Office projects a surplus or balance, or includes reductions in social security benefits. This provision can be suspended during times of war or low economic growth. If real economic growth is less than 1 percent for two consecutive quarters or during a declaration of war, the provision mentioned earlier is suspended."
