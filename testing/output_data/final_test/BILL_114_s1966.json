    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hunger Free Summer for Kids Act of 2015\" and provides alternative options for program delivery. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to include alternative options for program delivery, such as summer food service program meals delivered through an EBT card and off-site consumption. The Secretary will implement alternative options to increase program effectiveness, improve child nutrition, and reduce food insecurity among children. States can issue EBT cards to eligible children as an alternative to meals provided at feeding sites starting in summer 2018. The EBT card value for each child is $30, with an annual limit of $100 per child. The value is adjusted annually on January 1. EBT cards issued for summer use can only be used when school is out of session, as defined by the Secretary. These cards can only be used to purchase food from approved retail stores participating in the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children. The Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786) mandates that retail stores redeem EBT card benefits in the same way as the special supplemental nutrition program. The Secretary administers EBT cards only to children residing in rural areas. The Secretary administers EBT cards to children in rural areas, with specific conditions such as limiting administrative expenses to 2.5% and issuing EBT cards only after regulations are in place to prevent benefit duplication. The Secretary issues EBT cards to children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals, with an application process in place. Off-site consumption options for summer food service program meals will be available starting in summer 2018. Children eligible for the food service program can consume meals off-site if they live in a rural area, outside of economically poor areas, or if the feeding site is closed. Children eligible for the food service program can consume meals off-site if the site is closed due to extreme weather, violence or safety concerns prevent travel, the site is open 4 or fewer days a week, or if the site only provides 1 meal per day. The Secretary must ensure proper administration of this alternative option. The Secretary must ensure that when providing meals off-site under specific conditions, each child is limited to 2 meals per service and that the meals meet safety and quality standards. States are allowed to choose between alternative options but are prohibited from operating both. The Secretary must ensure that meals provided off-site meet safety and quality standards. States can choose between alternative options but cannot operate both simultaneously in the same area. Program integrity regulations must be in place by October 1, 2017. The Secretary must ensure off-site meals meet safety and quality standards. States can choose between alternative options for program delivery."
