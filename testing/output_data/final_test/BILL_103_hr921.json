The Congress recognizes the importance of athletic participation in teaching teamwork, promoting health, and addressing concerns about athletic opportunities for young men and women in higher education. A study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association revealed disparities in funding for women's athletics compared to men's. On average, $318,402 is spent on recruiting female athletes, with men receiving $1,300,000 in scholarship expenses compared to $505,246 for women. Male athletes receive 143 grants on average, while women receive 59. Female college athletes receive less than 18% of athletics recruiting funds and less than 24% of operating funds. Male college athletes receive $179,000,000 more per year in scholarship grants. Prospective students should consider an institution's commitment to providing equal athletic opportunities for both men and women. Knowledge of an institution's expenditures for women's and men's athletic programs would help prospective students and athletes make informed judgments about the commitment of a higher education institution to providing equitable athletic benefits to its students. SEC. 3. AMENDMENT. Section 485 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require institutions with intercollegiate athletic programs to annually report participation rates and financial support data to the Secretary. This includes data for men's teams, women's teams, and coed teams, detailing the number of participants, gender breakdown, and scholarship expenditures. The Higher Education Act of 1965 now mandates institutions with athletic programs to report participation rates, financial support data, and details on team expenses, coaching staff, and head coach information. The Higher Education Act of 1965 requires institutions with athletic programs to report details on coaching staff, including the number of male and female graduate and volunteer assistant coaches, the ratio of participants to coaches, and the compensation of the head coach and assistant coaches. Additionally, institutions must report the ratio of male to female participants in the athletic program. The Higher Education Act of 1965 mandates institutions to report details on coaching staff and participant ratios in athletic programs. Institutions must disclose this information to prospective students and the public upon request. The Secretary of Education is responsible for publishing a report based on the submitted information. The Secretary of Education is required to compile and publish an annual report based on data submitted by institutions regarding athletic expenses. The report must include information broken down by individual institutions and athletic conferences. Operating expenses are defined as all nonscholarship expenditures. The Secretary must submit these reports to Congress annually, starting from July 1, 1993. The Secretary of Education is mandated to compile an annual report on athletic expenses submitted by institutions, starting from July 1, 1993. The first report to the Secretary is due on July 1, 1994."
