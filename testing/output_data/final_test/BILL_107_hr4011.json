    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Science of Stem Cell Research Act\". The Congress finds that President George W. Bush approved Federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research and established the President's Council on Bioethics to address ethical issues in biotechnology advancements leading to improved medical treatments for various diseases and injuries. The advancement of science is crucial for alleviating diseases and disorders. There is a limited number of human embryonic stem cell lines available for research, which may not be sufficient to meet the research needs. Federal funds are essential for researchers to continue stem cell research and technologies, allowing doctors to generate specialized cells to treat diseases and disabilities. Pluripotent stem cell research holds promise for treating a wide range of diseases and disabilities, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and more. Federal funding from the National Institutes of Health ensures that research is conducted ethically and to the highest scientific standards. The National Academy of Sciences states that there are important biological differences between adult and embryonic stem cells, as well as among adult stem cells from different tissues. Additional scientific data is needed on all stem cell types due to unclear therapeutic implications. Most existing stem cell lines accumulate harmful genetic mutations over time, potentially posing human health risks. Human stem cell research, especially when publicly funded and conducted under established standards, offers the most efficient and responsible means to fulfill the promise of stem cells for regenerative medical therapies. Continued monitoring and development of new stem cell lines are necessary due to changing genetic and biological properties. Establishment of the Stem Cell Research Board (referred to as the \"Board\") in the legislative branch with bipartisan commission duties. The Board conducts research on the effects of the President's stem cell research directive on advances in curing diseases, organ transplantation, and medical technology. The Board conducts research on the effects of the President's stem cell research directive on medical technology development, basic scientific research, private sector funding, NIH funding processes, and makes recommendations to Congress on legislation to improve efficiency in federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. They also conduct public forums to review NIH funding status and develop standards of conduct. The Board conducts research on the effects of the President's stem cell research directive and makes recommendations to Congress on legislation to improve federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. They also develop their own standards of conduct in consultation with relevant committees. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Board shall consist of 8 members appointed within 120 days of the Act's enactment. Membership is bipartisan, with 4 members appointed by the President, Speaker of the House, and Senate minority leader, and 4 members appointed by the House minority leader and Senate majority leader. The Board consists of 8 members appointed within 120 days of the Act's enactment. Members are appointed by various officials, with no more than 4 from the same political party. Each member serves for the life of the Board, vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and members serve without pay but receive travel expenses. A quorum consists of five members. The Board consists of 8 members appointed within 120 days of the Act's enactment, with no more than 4 from the same political party. Members serve for the life of the Board, vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and they serve without pay but receive travel expenses. A quorum consists of five members. The Board may promulgate regulations necessary to carry out its duties. Co-chairpersons are appointed jointly by members appointed under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), and meetings are called by either co-chairperson. SEC. 6. EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS; STAFF; EXPERTS AND CONSULTANTS. The Board shall have two executive directors appointed jointly by members under different sections, each paid at a rate not exceeding level IV of the Executive Schedule. The executive directors may appoint additional personnel and procure services of experts or consultants as needed. The Board's rules include provisions for fair resource sharing among staff. Executive directors and staff are not considered civil service positions. Federal agencies can detail employees to assist the Board without reimbursement. The Board can request technical assistance from Federal agencies to carry out its duties without affecting employees' civil service status or privileges. SEC. 7. POWERS. The Board has the authority to hold hearings, administer oaths, take testimony, and receive evidence as needed. Members and agents can take actions authorized by the Board, and they can obtain necessary information from other Federal agencies. The Board has the authority to hold hearings, administer oaths, take testimony, and receive evidence. The chairpersons or designated persons must provide information to the Board. The Board can use the United States mails and receive administrative support services on a reimbursable basis. Office space for the Board will be located at the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Board, located at the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland, can seek advice from other federal agencies with expertise in stem cell research. They may also receive assistance with printing and binding costs. The Board at the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland can seek advice from other federal agencies with expertise in stem cell research and receive assistance with printing and binding costs. Any data obtained by the Board shall be available to Congress upon request. The Board may also contract with government and private agencies for supplies and services. SEC. 8. AUDITS. The Public Printer will conduct interim and final audits of the Board's financial transactions within 2 and 4 years of the Act's enactment, respectively. The Board must maintain financial records and provide access to the Public Printer for audits. SEC. 9. REPORTS.\n\nThe Board must submit an interim report annually and a final report upon termination, detailing findings and conclusions. \n\nSEC. 10. TERMINATION.\n\nThe Board will end four years after the Act's enactment, transferring records to the Public Printer.\n\nSEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n$16,000,000 is authorized for the Board to implement the Act."
