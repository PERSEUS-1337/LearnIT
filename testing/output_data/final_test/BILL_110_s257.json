Congress finds that the Chinookan people have lived in the Columbia-Pacific region for over 6,000 years, developed a rich culture from the Columbia River, and established cultural centers in Chinook, Washington, and Seaside, Oregon. Early European explorers like Heceta, Vitus Bering, Sir Francis Drake, and Captain Cook explored the region in search of the Great River of the West. Many people visit the Columbia-Pacific region to experience its historical culture. In 1792, Captain Robert Gray brought a sailing ship into the Columbia River, opening up trade with east coast cities, European countries, and Asian kingdoms. This led to the development of a global trade network known as the \"Golden Round\", stimulating the economy and fur trade in the region. The development of the international fur trade in the region was further supported by ports and communities along the Columbia River engaging in fishing, seafood processing, timber harvesting, and trade. In 1805, Lewis and Clark arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River in search of an all-water route to the Pacific Ocean for commerce, leading to the establishment of a fort for winter. The legacy of Lewis and Clark is preserved at the Lewis and Clark National Historical Park. In 1811, John Jacob Astor founded the settlement of Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River, becoming the first American city west of the Rocky Mountains. Astoria, located at the mouth of the Columbia River, was sold to the Hudson Bay Company and became a British territory from 1812 to 1828. It was later returned to the United States, making Astoria the only city in the country to have been under another country's control before reverting back. The Chinookan people historically used the area as a homeland defense system, with villages established to monitor river traffic. During the Civil War, these villages were replaced by forts operated by the United States Army, including Cape Disappointment and Fort Columbia. The Army forts at Cape Disappointment, Fort Columbia, and Fort Stevens were operational through World War II. The United States Coast Guard maintains a homeland security operation in the area, protecting international commerce on the Columbia River. The water offshore Clatsop County, Oregon, and Pacific County, Washington, is known as the \"Graveyard of the Pacific\" due to numerous vessel and life losses. The area is known as the \"Graveyard of the Pacific\" due to shipwrecks and storm waters posing a threat to boaters. Modern navigation aids like lighthouses and lifesaving stations, including the Cape Disappointment Lifesaving Station operated by the United States Coast Guard. Coast Guard members undergo training at the \"Top Gun\" center to prepare for service at stations nationwide. The Columbia River in the United States has a rich history of supporting commercial and sport fisheries. The region has been home to various communities, including the Chinookan people and American settlers, who developed a vibrant economy around salmon fisheries. Astoria, Warrenton, Hammond, Chinook, and Ilwaco have deep roots in the fishing industry and continue to support both commercial and sport fisheries. Commercial timber harvesting along the Columbia River has been a significant cultural tradition for over 150 years, with raw logs and forest products being transported to markets worldwide. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Heritage Area\" as the Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"study area\" as specific coastal and historical areas along the Columbia River. The Secretary will conduct a study with stakeholders to determine the feasibility of designating the study area as the Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area, focusing on its national importance and distinctive heritage aspects. The Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area study area should be managed through agreements between public and private entities at the local or regional level. It reflects traditions, customs, beliefs, and folklife that are valuable to the United States, providing opportunities to conserve natural, historical, cultural, or scenic features. Additionally, it offers outstanding recreational and educational opportunities and has resources with national importance. Residents, business interests, nonprofit organizations, the Federal Government, and State, local, and tribal governments within the study area are involved in the planning process. The study area for the Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area involves planning and has significant support for designation and management from various stakeholders. It has been identified and is backed by State and local agencies, the public, and private businesses. The Secretary is required to submit a report to the Senate and House committees detailing the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the study within 3 fiscal years of funds availability. Additionally, the Secretary is authorized to receive necessary appropriations to carry out the Act."
