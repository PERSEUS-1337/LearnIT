    "content": "The Superfund Program, established in 1980 under CERCLA, is the federal government's main initiative for cleaning up contaminated waste sites. The EPA Brownfields Program, created in 1993, initially provided grants and loans to communities for redeveloping brownfield properties using funding from the Superfund Program. The EPA Brownfields Program, established in 1993, received approximately $90 million annually, accounting for 5% of Superfund appropriations. In 2002, Congress enacted the Brownfields Act, authorizing $200 million for site assessment and cleanup grants and an additional $50 million for assistance programs. The Brownfields Act authorized a $50 million annual grant program to assist state and tribal cleanup programs, with funding authority expiring in FY2006. Despite the expiration, Congress has continued to provide consistent funding levels for both grant programs. Grants from EPA's Brownfields Program are divided into competitive grants awarded to communities under Section 104(k) and non-competitive grants awarded to states and tribes under Section 128. Section 104(k) grants receive the majority of the annual appropriation. The EPA Brownfields Program provides competitive grants for assessment, planning, and community involvement related to brownfields sites. Grants are limited to $200,000 but can be waived up to $350,000. Private persons and corporations are not eligible for these grants. The EPA Brownfields Program offers grants for assessment, planning, and community involvement at brownfields sites. Grants can be awarded up to $350,000, with a 20% cost share required. Nonprofit organizations are eligible for cleanup grants, and job training grants are available for educational and nonprofit organizations. EPA awards grants of up to $200,000 for local environmental job training programs. The Brownfields Act added Section 128 to CERCLA, creating a non-competitive grant program to support state and tribal response programs with separate funding authority. Grants for job training complement funding for brownfields sites, encouraging local citizens to participate in environmental cleanup activities. Revolving Loan Fund grants provide no-interest or low-interest loans for cleanups, with a limit of $1 million per grant. Subgrants of up to $200,000 per site can also be awarded, not requiring repayment, including to nonprofit groups. The Brownfields Act added Section 128 to CERCLA, establishing a non-competitive grant program to support state and tribal response programs with separate funding authority. A 2004 GAO report found that all 50 states have some type of response program for contaminated properties, with EPA funding playing a crucial role in some states. Section 128 funding is intended to supplement state or tribal funding for response programs, allowing for the establishment or enhancement of these programs. EPA interprets this to include developing legislation, regulations, procedures, or guidance. The Brownfields Act added Section 128 to CERCLA, creating a grant program to support state and tribal response programs. Section 128 funding supplements state or tribal funding for developing legislation, regulations, procedures, or guidance. Congress funds EPA's Brownfields Program through appropriations from the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) Account and EPA's Environmental Programs and Management Account. Since the 2002 Brownfields Act, funding for the Brownfields Program has been consistent, ranging from $163 million to nearly $170 million annually. There is a consensus on the federal role in brownfields cleanup, but concerns about financial assistance and program effectiveness persist. Congress has funded the program below its authorized level, with appropriations representing 66% of the initial funding authorization. Some states and communities argue that funding falls short of demand, while the program struggles to demonstrate its effectiveness. The Brownfields Program, funded by Congress, has faced challenges in proving its effectiveness. A 2004 GAO report highlighted the lack of measures to assess the program's impact on reducing environmental risks. This raises questions about whether the program should focus on health threats or economic redevelopment. Some question if the EPA is the best agency to oversee the program."
