    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Permit Reassurances Enabling Direct Improvements for Conservation, Tenants, and Species Act of 2018\" or the \"PREDICTS Act of 2018\". Codification of the \"No Surprises\" regulations is also included. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include a definition of \"changed circumstances\" related to species or geographic areas covered by plans or agreements. This definition encompasses anticipated changes that can be planned for, including additions to species lists and natural catastrophic events. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include definitions related to conservation plans and agreements. These definitions clarify terms such as \"covered plan or agreement,\" \"conserved habitat areas,\" and \"operating conservation program.\" These terms outline specific areas and activities designated for habitat restoration and conservation purposes. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include definitions related to conservation plans and agreements. The amendment defines \"unforeseen circumstances\" as changes that could not have been anticipated and result in a substantial adverse change in the status of covered species. Additionally, paragraphs in the Act are redesignated. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include definitions related to conservation plans and agreements. Section 7(n) is amended to change a reference, and Section 10 is amended to include assurances governing permit issuance, modification, and revocation. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include provisions regarding permit revocation and conservation agreements. The Secretary is restricted from revoking permits or terminating agreements unless specific criteria are met. Each permit issued must adhere to the requirements outlined in the Act. Each permit issued by the Secretary under the Endangered Species Act must adhere to assurances addressing changed and unforeseen circumstances, including implementing necessary conservation and mitigation measures specified in the conservation plan or agreement. The Secretary may not require additional conservation and mitigation measures without the permittee's consent, even in unforeseen circumstances. If extra measures are needed, the permittee may be required to implement them. The Secretary may require additional measures of the permittee within conserved habitat areas or the conservation plan's operating program for affected species, maintaining original terms as much as possible and without additional commitments of land, water, or financial compensation. The Secretary may require additional measures of the permittee within conserved habitat areas or the conservation plan's operating program for affected species, maintaining original terms as much as possible. The Secretary shall have the burden of demonstrating that unforeseen circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial data available, and shall clearly document any finding based on reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat requirements of the affected species. Factors considered include the size of the current range of the affected species and the percentage of such range adversely affected by the conservation plan or agreement. The Secretary may require additional measures within conserved habitat areas for affected species under the conservation plan. Factors considered include the percentage of range conserved, ecological significance, knowledge about the species, and the need for additional conservation measures to ensure survival and recovery in the wild. The Secretary is responsible for presenting analyses of the situation. The Secretary may require additional conservation or mitigation measures from the permittee based on analyses of unforeseen circumstances, including a qualitative and quantitative analysis of specified factors. SEC. 3. CANDIDATE CONSERVATION AGREEMENTS WITH ASSURANCES. Section 10(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act is amended to allow for taking incidental to lawful activities under conservation agreements. Additionally, a new section is added for Candidate Conservation Agreements. The Secretary may enter into a candidate conservation agreement with assurances for a species proposed for listing, candidate species, or likely to be listed soon on areas where a person has property rights to carry out management activities. Non-Federal persons can submit these agreements to the Secretary for review before species listing. The Secretary can approve a candidate conservation agreement for species proposed for listing, candidate species, or likely to be listed soon if the actions taken under the agreement would benefit the conservation of the species or its habitat. A permit issued under subsection (a)(1)(C) of the agreement will not reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of an endangered or threatened species. The permit takes effect when the species is listed, provided the permittee complies with the agreement's terms. A person under a candidate conservation agreement may not be required to take additional measures for covered species if it involves extra costs or restrictions without their consent. The agreement and the Secretary can identify any necessary modifications or additional measures. The Secretary may require additional measures under extraordinary circumstances. SEC. 4. SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENTS. Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to allow the Secretary to enter into Safe Harbor Agreements with non-Federal persons for the conservation of endangered or threatened species by creating, restoring, or improving habitat. The agreements permit the taking of species incidental to lawful activities on the designated lands or waters. The Secretary can enter Safe Harbor Agreements with non-Federal persons to conserve endangered species by maintaining existing conditions for the species covered by the agreement on designated lands or waters. The baseline requirement is mutually agreed upon and aims to preserve habitat quality or species abundance. The Secretary may approve a Safe Harbor Agreement if it is expected to benefit species recovery, incidental take is lawful and in accordance with the agreement, and actions taken will not significantly harm endangered species. The Safe Harbor Agreement must benefit species recovery, allow lawful incidental take, and ensure actions do not harm endangered species. The agreement should include monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure compliance. Permits issued under the agreement take effect on the day of issuance for covered species. SEC. 5. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to allow the Secretary to provide financial assistance of up to $10,000 to private landowners for conservation agreements. Assistance cannot be provided for actions required by permits or agreements under the Act or other Federal law. Private landowners can receive grants under this Act in addition to other payments they are eligible for under Federal law."
