Conforming amendments are made to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Section 704 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended by removing a specific reference to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Establishment of Coal Technology Program under SEC. 962 as an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The section defines a large-scale pilot project as technology development beyond laboratory testing but not yet at commercial scale, necessary for gaining operational data and validating scaling factors. The term 'transformational technology' refers to a new power generation technology that significantly improves performance, efficiency, and cost compared to existing technologies. This technology aims to enable advancements from pilot plant to commercial scale applications. The term 'transformational technology' includes thermodynamic improvements in energy conversion, turbine technology advancements, and carbon capture system enhancements. The Secretary will establish a coal technology program to develop technologies improving efficiency, costs, and environmental performance of coal use through research, pilot projects, and demonstration projects. Performance standards will be developed in consultation with interested entities. The coal technology program aims to ensure reliable, low-cost power from coal plants with high conversion efficiencies, address carbon dioxide emissions through carbon capture, support small-scale technologies for capacity additions, enable flexible baseload operations, and reduce emissions of pollutants and water use in power plant operations. The coal technology program aims to develop technologies for efficient power generation, carbon capture, and utilization of coal for valuable products. The Secretary is required to undertake international collaborations and encourage cooperation for program implementation. The Secretary of Energy is required to consult with various stakeholders and submit a report to Congress on the performance standards adopted under the coal technology program within 18 months of enactment. Updates are to be provided every 2 years thereafter. The Secretary of Energy must provide updates to Congress every 2 years on the progress towards achieving objectives and performance standards set under the coal technology program. Funding of $610 million annually for fiscal years 2017-2020 and $560 million for 2021 is authorized for this purpose. The development program component for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 includes funding of $275 million annually, while the demonstration projects program component receives $50 million annually for 2017-2020 and $75 million for 2021. The large-scale pilot projects program component is allocated $285 million annually for fiscal years 2017-2021. Cost sharing for large-scale pilot projects is addressed in Section 988(c) of the legislation. Cost-sharing requirements for large-scale pilot projects under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 are amended to exclude the coal technology program established under section 962. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the table of contents of the Act. The coal technology program under section 962 is excluded from cost-sharing requirements for large-scale pilot projects under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. A conforming amendment is made to the Act's table of contents."
