Congress finds that certain scattered parcels of Federal land in Gilpin County, Colorado, administered by the Secretary of the Interior, have been identified as suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management due to their small size and proximity to existing communities, which may have fair market value. The Federal Government may use the fair market value of certain lands in Gilpin County, Colorado for land exchanges to enhance public access, recreation, wildlife habitat, and other public values. The purpose of the Act is to expedite land exchanges to dispose of Federal lands with limited public utility and acquire lands with important values for permanent public management and protection. SEC. 2. LAND EXCHANGE. The exchange directed by this Act shall be consummated if Lake Gulch, Inc., offers to transfer certain lands within Rocky Mountain National Park to the United States. Lake Gulch shall convey all right, title, and interest in approximately 40 acres with improvements located in Larimer County, Colorado. Certain lands in Colorado, including those in Conejos County and Huerfano County, are to be incorporated into Rocky Mountain National Park and administered according to National Park System regulations. The lands comprise approximately 3,993 acres and 4,700 acres respectively. The Bonham Ranch-Cucharas Canyon map from June 1995 allows grazing of livestock as determined by the Secretary. Lands acquired near Cucharas Canyon may be sold if not needed for public purposes. If offered land parcels cannot be conveyed to the US, Lake Gulch and the Secretary may find a solution. Upon receipt of title to the lands identified in subsection (a), the Secretary shall convey to Lake Gulch all right, title, and interest of the United States in selected lands in Gilpin County, Colorado. The Secretary will convey certain surveyed and unsurveyed lands in Gilpin County, Colorado to Lake Gulch, totaling approximately 107 acres. The Secretary may transfer unsurveyed lands to Lake Gulch in section 13 without surveying due to the small size and high cost. Additionally, the Secretary can transfer lands in sections 17 and 13 not shown on the map if mutually agreed upon and in the public interest. Lake Gulch can apply for transfer to a local government unit by offering additional lands or cash equalization money equal to the appraised value. Surveys may be required for transferring lands in section 13, with costs covered by Lake Gulch. Adjacent land boundaries must be clearly identified to avoid future conflicts. Prior to transferring lands out of public ownership near North Clear Creek in Colorado, the Secretary must notify and consult with local government units to allow them to acquire necessary easements or rights-of-way. Any associated survey costs will be covered by the acquiring party. The reservation of easements or rights-of-way must be paid for by the unit or units of local government concerned. SEC. 3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EXCHANGE. The values of lands exchanged under this Act must be equal as determined by the Secretary of the Interior using nationally recognized appraisal standards. Any cash equalization or land sale moneys received by the United States will be retained by the Secretary of the Interior to purchase land or water rights to enhance wildlife habitat and protect wetlands in the Bureau of Land Management's Blanca Wetlands, Alamosa County, Colorado. The Secretary of the Interior will acquire water rights in accordance with Colorado law for the Blanca Wetlands. The use of these water rights is limited to the wetlands and any proposal to use the San Luis Valley Project facilities requires approval from the Rio Grande Water Conservation District. The Rio Grande Water Conservation District will convey selected lands to Lake Gulch, contingent on an agreement with the United States. The agreement must include provisions prohibiting gaming on the lands and holding the US harmless for any liabilities. The selected lands will be transferred to Lake Gulch with restrictions on hazardous material handling and dumping. The conveyance is subject to an existing easement for Gilpin County Road 6 and will not affect the fair market value of the land. The Public Water Reserve established by Executive order dated April 17, 1926 is revoked in part to allow for the transfer of selected lands to Lake Gulch. The Public Water Reserve established by Executive order dated April 17, 1926 is revoked in part to allow for the transfer of selected lands to Lake Gulch. SEC. 4. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. The terms defined in this Act include \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, \"Lake Gulch\" as a Colorado corporation, \"offered land\" as lands to be conveyed to the United States, \"selected land\" as lands to be transferred to Lake Gulch, and \"Blanca Wetlands\" as an area of land comprising approximately 9,200 acres. The exchange of lands authorized by this Act should be completed within 6 months, with the option for the Secretary to sell parcels to Lake Gulch at fair market value if the exchange cannot be completed. The administration of lands acquired by the United States will follow federal land regulations. According to section 206(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, lands acquired by the United States under this Act will become part of the administrative unit where they are located upon acceptance of title without further action by the Secretary concerned."
