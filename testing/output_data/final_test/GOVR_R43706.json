    "content": "Article III of the Constitution established the judicial branch of the United States, including the Supreme Court and inferior courts as ordained by Congress. Judges are empowered to adjudicate cases, including those arising under the Constitution. The Supreme Court, in Marbury v. Madison, established judicial review, allowing the judiciary to countermand decisions that violate the Constitution. This power is controversial as it allows unelected judges to overturn decisions made by elected branches. The history of the United States is marked by conflicts between the political branches and the judiciary over the power of judicial review. The Supreme Court has recently invalidated laws like Section 3 of DOMA and Section 441 of FECA, leading to criticism and accusations of judicial activism. The Supreme Court's use of judicial review to invalidate democratically enacted laws is rare, with only a few cases in the October 2013 term. The Court's caution in using judicial review is supported by long-standing case law advising against broad rulings on constitutional questions. The Supreme Court has established rules known as the constitutional avoidance doctrine to discourage broad rulings on constitutional law. This doctrine allows courts to avoid invalidating democratically enacted laws. The Framers of the Constitution were cautious of unchecked power, leading to the development of this doctrine. The Framers of the Constitution established a written Constitution to limit the power of democratic majorities. The federal judiciary, as a \"countermajoritarian\" branch, interprets the Constitution to protect its principles from potential pressures that could compromise its integrity. The federal judiciary's independence is ensured by the Good Behavior and Compensation Clauses of Article III, allowing judges to have an independent spirit and preventing political influence over their decisions. Chief Justice John Marshall established the power of judicial review in Marbury v. Madison, giving the judiciary the authority to invalidate unconstitutional acts of the other branches of government. The federal judiciary, as outlined in the Constitution, raised few concerns during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The document itself devotes little attention to the judiciary, with Alexander Hamilton calling it the \"least dangerous branch\" due to its limited powers compared to the legislative and executive branches. The judiciary, unlike the legislative and executive branches, lacks the power of the purse or the sword. Throughout American history, there have been debates over the extent of power given to the unelected federal judiciary. Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson both questioned the authority of judicial review and emphasized the independence of each branch in interpreting the Constitution. In the wake of Dred Scott v. Sandford, Abraham Lincoln criticized the Supreme Court's power, warning that the people would lose their ability to govern themselves. Controversies over judicial review have persisted into the modern era, with examples like Franklin Roosevelt's defiance of the Court's decision in the Gold Clause Cases. The Supreme Court's rulings have sparked various reactions throughout history, from Roosevelt's \"court packing\" plan to Nixon's criticism of judicial activism. Controversies over judicial review have persisted, with examples like the backlash against Brown vs. Board of Education. President Obama expressed concern about the judiciary overturning laws passed by Congress, highlighting the tension between the judiciary's power of judicial review and the political branches. Professor Alexander Bickel emphasized the need for an independent judiciary to uphold constitutional norms against temporary populist interests. The federal judiciary, according to Bickel, should act on \"principle\" to enforce the First Amendment and protect unpopular individuals and their ideas from suppression. When the Court fails to do so and upholds laws that do not adhere to constitutional norms, it risks damaging the values of our government. On the other hand, when the court declares a legislative act unconstitutional, it thwarts the will of the voters. Judicial review creates a dilemma for the court as it lacks the power to enforce its decisions and relies on external support. The Court's legitimacy lies in the people's acceptance of its role in interpreting and declaring the nation's laws. Overly aggressive judicial review or abuse of power can lead to a loss of legitimacy and invite political and cultural backlash. The aggressive use of judicial review can weaken the democratic process by foreclosing democratic outlets for deep passions on specific issues and inviting intense conflict within the nation. This poses a challenge for the Supreme Court in maintaining the peaceful coexistence of countermajoritarian implications of judicial review and democratic principles. In The Least Dangerous Branch, Professor Alexander Bickel proposed a solution to the countermajoritarian difficulty by suggesting that the Supreme Court can choose not to exercise judicial review and instead practice the \"passive virtues\" when faced with difficult constitutional questions. Bickel proposed the use of \"passive virtues\" as tools for the Court to return unsettled constitutional problems to the political realm, avoiding unnecessary entanglement in controversial issues and preserving the Court's role as protector of established constitutional principles. This approach encourages constitutional dialogue in other branches and the public, helping the Court determine the appropriate constitutional principle for a specific issue. Professor Bickel emphasized the importance of \"passive virtues\" in addressing constitutional issues, echoing Justice Brandeis' belief in the value of inaction. Professor Sunstein's concept of \"judicial minimalism\" builds on Bickel's ideas, advocating for courts to provide minimal rulings and leave as much undecided as possible when addressing constitutional questions. This approach aims to avoid unnecessary entanglement in controversial issues and promote constitutional dialogue in other branches and the public. Sunstein advocates for narrow and shallow judicial rulings to reduce burdens on the judiciary and minimize judicial errors. This approach aims to avoid extensive resolution of complex constitutional issues by diverse courts, promoting efficiency and reducing the potential for damaging mistakes. Sunstein argues that judicial minimalism reduces errors and harm by keeping decisions open for further debate and reflection at various levels of government. This approach aligns with democratic deliberation and aims to address the countermajoritarian difficulty. Sunstein's minimalism, along with Bickel's passive virtues, is rooted in Supreme Court case law. Felix Frankfurter emphasized the importance of avoiding constitutional questions unless absolutely necessary. The constitutional avoidance doctrine, as articulated by Justice Brandeis in Ashwander v. TVA, is crucial in modern judicial decision-making. In the case, shareholders challenged a contract between a power company and a government agency. The shareholders challenged a contract between a power company and a government agency, arguing that the TVA acted beyond its constitutional authority. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's authority to construct the Wilson Dam and dispose of electric energy generated there based on war power, commerce power, and property disposal power. Justice Brandeis concurred, advocating for avoiding constitutional questions unless necessary. Justice Brandeis agreed with the Court's resolution of the constitutional questions in the case but argued that those questions should have been avoided. He believed the plaintiffs lacked sufficient injury to bring the lawsuit and that the Court could refuse an injunction if the law's invalidity was not clear. Justice Brandeis's Ashwander concurrence outlines seven rules that allow a court to avoid making broad rulings on constitutional grounds. These rules are not unitary but consist of loosely related principles and canons. Some rules rarely arise in constitutional law litigation, while others have been largely subsumed by core Article III concerns. The Ashwander rules, based on Justice Brandeis's concurrence, serve as the foundation for federal courts to avoid broad constitutional rulings. Key controversial cases under the Roberts Court include Citizens United v. FEC and NFIB v. Sebelius. The Supreme Court's decisions on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate and state spending conditions have been criticized for overreach. While cases like Citizens United and NFIB draw attention, broad constitutional rulings are rare at the Roberts Court. The Roberts Court has often avoided major constitutional questions, relying on the Ashwander doctrine. Justice Brandeis's rule that the Court will not rule on a statute if the plaintiff is not injured has taken on a constitutional dimension. The Supreme Court interprets the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III when a party invokes federal court jurisdiction. The Article III requirement for standing mandates that a party must show a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent, with a causal connection to the challenged action and a likelihood of redress. In contrast, the Ashwander doctrine treats standing as a prudential matter, emphasizing constitutional avoidance. The constitutional standing doctrine requires parties with a direct stake in a case to seek relief from a federal court, ensuring concrete adverseness and proper issue presentation. This doctrine is distinct from the prudential approach of the Ashwander doctrine. The standing doctrine ensures parties with a direct stake in a case seek relief from federal court, limiting the Court's interference with political decisions. The Roberts Court used standing to avoid ruling on controversial issues in the October 2012 term. The Supreme Court avoided ruling on the constitutionality of foreign surveillance practices under the standing doctrine. Amnesty International challenged Section 702 of FISA, but the Court ruled the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the lawsuit. The Supreme Court avoided ruling on the constitutionality of a state ban on same-sex marriage in Hollingsworth v. Perry, opting to resolve the case on standing grounds. Justice Alito emphasized the importance of separation-of-powers principles in preventing judicial overreach in politically sensitive areas like intelligence gathering and foreign affairs. The Supreme Court ruled in Hollingsworth v. Perry that the proponents of Proposition 8 lacked standing to defend the law on appeal, as they did not have a direct stake in the outcome. This decision emphasized the importance of standing doctrine in avoiding potential perils. The Court emphasized the standing doctrine's role in avoiding countermajoritarian difficulty by refusing to entertain generalized grievances, respecting the limited role of courts in a democratic society. New litigants with stronger standing defenses have brought similar constitutional claims following recent rulings, such as challenging Section 702 of FISA in district courts, potentially leading to a revisit of Fourth Amendment questions. The Roberts Court has used the standing doctrine to delay major constitutional law questions, allowing them to be resolved in lower courts and political branches. This doctrine, along with other rules like those in Justice Brandeis's Ashwander concurrence, has been relied upon in recent cases. One such case was Bond v. United States in the October 2013 term. In Bond v. United States, the Court applied the \"last resort rule\" and the \"avoidance canon\" to resolve the case, emphasizing the importance of avoiding constitutional questions if other grounds for resolution exist. The avoidance canon in Bond v. United States was applied to the case involving Carol Anne Bond, who attempted to poison her husband's lover. Federal prosecutors charged her with violating the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act by using a toxic chemical. In the case of Carol Bond, she challenged the application of the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act to her local crime, arguing it exceeded Congress's powers. The government defended the statute, citing the President's treaty-making power. The case raised constitutional questions on federalism and treaty power. In the case of Carol Bond, Chief Justice Roberts declined to address the constitutional issues surrounding the scope of the treaty power. Instead, the Court focused on the statutory question, ruling that the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act did not apply to Bond's actions. This decision was based on the avoidance canon, which states that the Court should avoid deciding constitutional questions if there is another ground to dispose of the case. Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the CWCIA should be interpreted in line with federalism principles, limiting its reach to prevent chemical warfare. The Court's decision in Bond reflects a reluctance to address divisive political issues through judicial review. The Roberts Court frequently relies on the Ashwander rule for judicial minimalism, avoiding broad constitutional rulings. Scholars view the Court as minimalist, with a shift towards minimalism since Roberts became Chief Justice. Debate exists on whether this approach is sufficiently modest. The Roberts Court has embraced minimalism in its constitutional law jurisprudence, issuing narrow rulings that are limited to the facts of the case at hand. For example, in Fisher v. University of Texas, the Court reversed a lower court decision on affirmative action without settling broader questions on its constitutionality in higher education. In Fisher v. University of Texas, the Court ruled that the lower court had deferred inappropriately to the university's judgment on affirmative action in higher education. This decision reaffirmed that diversity could justify affirmative action under the Equal Protection Clause. The ruling was narrow and confined to the case's facts, reflecting the Court's minimalism approach. In Shelby County v. Holder, the Court struck down Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which determines preclearance of voting laws by the federal government. The Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder struck down Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, inviting Congress to reenact a more specific coverage formula. This minimalist opinion did not address the constitutionality of Section 5 of the VRA. In United States v. Windsor, the Court invalidated Section 3 of DOMA, citing a violation of the Fifth Amendment's protection of equal liberty. The Windsor Court ruling in 2013 focused on the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA, not broader issues like state bans on same-sex marriage. The Roberts Court's trend towards minimalism was evident in controversial cases like Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, where they upheld Michigan's ban on race-based preferences in university admissions. The Court in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action refused to overturn precedent on the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of minority participatory rights. Justice Breyer's opinion distinguished the case from others, stating that the Michigan referendum did not diminish minority political participation. Justice Kennedy's opinion limited the ruling to the unique facts of the case and did not question the political process doctrine. In Lane v. Franks, Justice Sotomayor's opinion focused on protecting public employees who provide truthful sworn testimony outside their job responsibilities, without questioning the Garcetti v. Ceballos decision. The ruling was narrowly tailored to the specific case, with limited impact on Garcetti's central holding. In Harris v. Quinn, the Court struck down an Illinois law requiring personal health assistants paid under Medicaid to pay union dues, criticizing Abood v. Detroit Board of Education but not formally overruling it. In Harris v. Quinn, personal assistants in Harris may have to pay public union dues, reflecting themes from Lane and Schuette by avoiding a broad constitutional ruling in favor of a more narrow opinion. The constitutional avoidance doctrine at the Roberts Court has critics, questioning its assumptions and deployment. Legal scholars and jurists have critically assessed different strands of the doctrine, such as judicial minimalism and the constitutional avoidance canon. The idea of courts actively avoiding resolving constitutional disputes contrasts with the envisioned role for federal courts. The role of federal courts in interpreting the law, as envisioned by Alexander Hamilton and Chief Justice John Marshall, emphasizes a duty to review actions of other branches in light of the Constitution. The avoidance doctrine raises questions about whether courts can escape this duty. The avoidance doctrine in constitutional interpretation raises concerns about whether courts can evade their duty to review actions in light of the Constitution. Criticism of this doctrine comes from both judicial conservatives and liberals, with Justice Antonin Scalia advocating for a focus on the original intent of the Framers rather than evolving values. Scalia rejects the idea of the Court refraining from answering constitutional questions when the original understanding dictates a specific result. Justice Scalia disagreed with the Chief Justice's decision to avoid the constitutional question in Bond, arguing that the Court should not shirk its duty. Other jurists believe the Court should focus on improving the democratic process, as seen in footnote four of United States v. Carolene Products, which discusses when laws should be subject to more judicial scrutiny. Laws violating rights crucial for democracy or prejudicing excluded groups may require stricter judicial scrutiny. Some jurists argue that avoiding constitutional rulings undermines the judiciary's role in protecting civil rights. Justice Sotomayor criticized a narrow interpretation of the political process doctrine, emphasizing judges' duty to intervene when necessary to uphold constitutional guarantees. The Ashwander doctrine has been criticized for its potential misuse by judges, with concerns that it could lead to manipulation of rules for desired judicial outcomes. This criticism has been particularly focused on the Court's jurisprudence on standing. The criticism of the Court's jurisprudence on standing is echoed in dissenting opinions by Justices Breyer and Kennedy. Concerns include the manipulation of rules for desired outcomes and the lack of clarity on when a constitutional question should be answered. Professor Bickel argued that a principled Court should only enforce widely shared values, but determining what those values are may be challenging for the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's use of constitutional avoidance in cases like Windsor and Hollingsworth can lead to inconsistent results, as seen in the differing approaches taken on the same day. The Court's difficulty in determining widely shared values and engaging in principled judicial review can create challenges in upholding constitutional principles. The Supreme Court's inconsistent application of constitutional avoidance was evident in cases like Windsor and Hollingsworth. The Court's struggle to uphold constitutional principles and determine shared values led to varying approaches on the same day, highlighting challenges in principled judicial review. Under the \"harmless error\" doctrine, a court will determine if a Constitutional violation occurred during a criminal conviction before assessing if the error was harmless. The \"good faith\" exception to the Fourth Amendment allows evidence introduction if a police officer's search was a result of negligence. The qualified immunity doctrine states that a court should first determine if a government officer violated the Constitution before assessing liability. Many criticisms exist regarding the Ashwander rules, including those promoting judicial minimalism and avoiding constitutional issues. Justice Brandeis's rule of narrow constitutional rulings and Professor Sunstein's work on judicial minimalism have sparked debate among academics. Critics question the value of issuing narrow rulings, arguing that federal judges with life tenure may not be politically driven. Federal judges with life tenure are seen as less likely to be politically driven, making them capable of articulating broad principles of law. Minimalist decisions lack moral force and fail to influence government decision making, as they are often ambiguous and fact-specific. Critics argue that minimalist Supreme Court decisions do not provide the needed guidance and clarity to the other branches of government. Supreme Court decisions often lack the needed guidance and clarity, as highlighted by Justice Harlan Fiske Stone's criticism of narrow rulings. Justices may find fault with the limited scope of majority opinions, even when they agree with the outcome in a particular case. Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment, criticizing the majority for not clarifying the scope of the constitutional right to informational privacy in a case involving federal contract workers. He emphasized the importance of providing guidance for lower courts and quoted Marbury's directive for the judiciary to interpret the law. Justice Thomas has also expressed concerns about minimalist opinions lacking sufficient guidance, as seen in his concurrence in Shelby County. In Shelby County, Justice Thomas concurred, arguing that the Court should have invalidated Section 5 of the VRA allowing federal preclearance of state election laws, as the preclearance concept itself was deemed unconstitutional. Thomas voiced disappointment in the Court's narrow ruling, prolonging the demise of Section 5. Critics of judicial minimalism question its consistency and effectiveness. Critics from both ends of the political spectrum question the consistency and effectiveness of judicial minimalism, with some viewing it as a strategy to advance a liberal social agenda gradually. Chief Justice Roberts has been accused of using minimalism and restraint rhetoric to disguise substantive changes in constitutional law. Critics question the effectiveness of judicial minimalism, with some seeing it as a tactic to advance a liberal agenda. Chief Justice Roberts has been accused of using minimalism to hide substantive changes in constitutional law. The seventh rule of Ashwander, which suggests avoiding a construction of a statute that raises constitutional problems, has faced criticism. Critics argue that this approach may lead to interpreting laws in ways unintended by Congress, as it may not align with the legislative intent. The avoidance canon, criticized for leading to unintended interpretations of laws, can result in undemocratic outcomes and undermine judicial restraint. Justice Scalia and Professor John Manning have both raised concerns about the avoidance canon's potential to enshrine misinterpretations of statutes. Additionally, critics argue that by avoiding constructions that raise constitutional doubts, the court may stray from legislative intent. The avoidance canon in statutory interpretation may inadvertently lead to constitutional questions being addressed, as noted by Judge Posner. This can expand the reach of constitutional law and restrict Congress from legislating in certain areas. The Bond ruling exemplifies this, as it narrowly focused on a statutory question but used broad language that could have broader implications. The Bond decision avoided addressing the scope of the treaty power by making broad statements on Congress's power to criminalize local activity, potentially impacting constitutional law. The doctrine of constitutional avoidance is widely followed at the Supreme Court, as seen in recent terms of the Roberts Court. The viability of the constitutional avoidance doctrine could have significant implications for Congress in a world of increasing gridlock. The legislative branch may be tempted to draft vague legislation or ignore major legal questions, hoping the judiciary will resolve pressing issues. Senator Robert Byrd raised concerns about passing bills with serious constitutional questions. Senator Robert Byrd raised concerns about passing bills with serious constitutional questions, emphasizing the importance of Congress resolving such issues internally instead of relying on the courts. The constitutional avoidance doctrine may serve as a tool to address congressional intransigence on major legal issues. The Ashwander doctrine challenges congressional intransigence on legal issues, potentially undermining Alexis de Tocqueville's observation. The Roberts Court must address moral, social, and political questions, providing clarity on constitutional law. The federal judiciary's adherence to the avoidance doctrine will impact Congress's role in interpreting the Constitution. The constitutional avoidance doctrine is crucial in defining the roles of the judiciary and political branches in the federal government, guiding how the federal judiciary interprets the Constitution and Congress's actions."
