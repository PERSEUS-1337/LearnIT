    "content": "The \"GI Education Opportunity Act of 1999\" allows additional members of the Armed Forces to participate in the Montgomery GI Bill program. The \"GI Education Opportunity Act of 1999\" expands educational benefits for certain VEAP participants and active duty personnel not previously enrolled in the Montgomery GI Bill program. The \"GI Education Opportunity Act of 1999\" expands educational benefits for certain VEAP participants and active duty personnel who have completed specific requirements, including serving on active duty, completing secondary education or equivalent credits, receiving an honorable discharge, and making an election within a one-year period. The \"GI Education Opportunity Act of 1999\" allows individuals to make an irrevocable election to receive educational benefits under this section instead of benefits under chapter 32 of this title. The Secretary of each military department will provide procedures for making this election. Individuals who make this election are entitled to basic educational assistance under this chapter. Individuals who elect to receive basic education assistance under this chapter will have their basic pay reduced until the total reduction reaches $1,200. If the pay is not fully reduced before discharge, the individual must pay the difference to the Treasury. For those previously enrolled in chapter 32 educational benefits program, different provisions apply. The Secretary can reduce the required pay reduction by the amount of unused contributions to the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans Education Account, up to $1,200. Individuals can also pay the difference in reductions at any time. Amounts paid will go to the Treasury. Individuals enrolled in the educational benefits program under chapter 32 are subject to certain provisions. Individuals enrolled in the educational benefits program under chapter 32 can be disenrolled upon making a specific election. The Secretary will refund unused contributions to the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans Education Account to the individual and the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense will refund unused contributions to the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans Education Account for individuals enrolled in the educational benefits program under chapter 32. Contributions made on behalf of individuals will remain in the account for benefit payments. Regulations will provide notice of certain requirements. The Sense of Congress is that any new law affecting Armed Forces' educational assistance contributions should also impact contributions under section 3018D."
