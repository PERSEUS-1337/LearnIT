    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Taylor Force Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. The Taylor Force Act finds that the Palestinian Authority's payment of salaries to terrorists is an incentive for terrorism. The United States does not provide direct budgetary support to the Palestinian Authority but funds programs for basic human needs and peace promotion in the West Bank and Gaza. Since fiscal year 2015, annual appropriations legislation has allowed for the reduction of Economic Support Fund aid for the Palestinian Authority by an amount equivalent to what they spend on payments for acts of terrorism. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. Congress calls on the Palestinian Authority to stop payments incentivizing terror, urges donor countries to halt budgetary support until payments cease, supports a general welfare system for all Palestinian citizens, and urges the UN to address the issue of terrorism payments. Congress calls on the Palestinian Authority to immediately end payments for acts of terrorism and urges the Department of State to engage with governments and organizations to address this issue. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA. Funds for assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for the West Bank and Gaza must only benefit the Palestinian Authority if they certify steps to end violence against Israeli and US citizens and stop payments for terrorism. Israeli and US citizens must only provide assistance to individuals who have been imprisoned or died committing acts of terrorism, and to their family members. Assistance will be revoked for those who support compensation based on the sentence or period of incarceration. Public condemnation of violence and cooperation in investigations are required. Payments to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network are exempt from these limitations. Payments to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network are exempt from withholding requirements. Amounts withheld under this section will fulfill any similar withholding obligations under other laws. SEC. 5. CONTINUOUS CERTIFICATION. Funds for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza must be certified by the Secretary of State every 180 days to ensure the Palestinian Authority is taking steps to end violence against Israeli and U.S. citizens. SEC. 6. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY ACCOUNTABILITY FUND. The \"Palestinian Authority Accountability Fund\" (PAAF) is established in the Treasury with funds withheld under sections 4 and 5. The Secretary of State will invest PAAF funds in interest-bearing obligations of the US Government. Funds may be used upon certification by the Secretary of State that the Palestinian Authority has met conditions. Unused funds will be withdrawn annually for other assistance purposes. The Department of State provides assistance not benefiting the Palestinian Authority. SEC. 67. ANNUAL REPORT. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report to Congress estimating Palestinian Authority expenditures on payments for acts of terrorism and to families of deceased terrorists, along with an overview of relevant Palestinian laws. The annual report to Congress must include details on US policy efforts regarding Palestinian Authority payments for terrorism acts and engagement with other governments to address this issue. The report can be submitted in unclassified form with a classified annex. SEC. 78. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
