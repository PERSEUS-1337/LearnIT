    "title": "SB 496",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 3057.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow graduates of foreign universities to take optometrist license exams if they meet specific requirements, including being over 18 years old and holding a relevant degree from a foreign institution. Foreign university graduates seeking optometrist licensure must submit an approved sponsorship application form, pay the required fee, and provide supporting documents in English or translated by a certified US service as requested by the board. The board requires foreign university graduates to have their official school transcripts evaluated by an approved education evaluation service to ensure they meet educational requirements for optometrist licensure. If these requirements are not met, the board may establish alternative education requirements for the graduate to fulfill. Supporting documents must be provided to demonstrate compliance with these requirements. The board issues a letter of sponsorship for foreign university graduates to take optometry licensure exams. The letter expires in two years. The board may issue a license to practice optometry to those who pass required exams and meet specified criteria. To obtain a license to practice optometry, an individual must provide requested information, submit an approved application form, pay the required fee, have no impairments related to drugs or alcohol, and not be mentally incompetent. The license expires as per regulations and can be renewed under the same conditions. The text chunk discusses the financial implications of a new act in California, stating that no reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts."
