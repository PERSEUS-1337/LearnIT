It is a federal block grant providing billions of dollars annually to support neighborhood revitalization and economic development for low- and moderate-income individuals. Congress has allocated approximately $138 billion over 40 years for housing, economic development, and community activities. The CDBG program, the largest federal assistance for community development, has been used by Congress to provide additional funding for economic crises and disasters. This report reviews the funding history of the CDF account from FY2000 to FY2013 and discusses its primary components. The CDF account consists of three primary components: CDBG formula grants, CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks, and CDBG-linked supplemental and special appropriations. In FY2014, Congress appropriated $3.1 billion for CDBG activities, the lowest amount in the past 15 years. This funding is exclusively targeted to CDBG activities. In contrast, FY2013 saw a total of $19.308 billion in financial assistance for CDBG-related activities, with $3.308 billion for CDBG formula grants and an additional $16 billion for disaster relief and recovery activities in response to Hurricane Sandy and other disasters. Sequestration in response to disasters like Hurricane Sandy led to a $965 million reduction in FY2013 appropriations for CDF activities. Earmarked funds within the CDF account declined significantly from $713 million in FY2001 to $57 million in FY2013, mainly due to the elimination of earmarked projects funded under the Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative programs. Congress has discretion in using the program's statutory framework. The CDF program's statutory framework has been utilized by Congress for disaster relief, recession response, and economic stimulus. Specific initiatives like the NSP and CDBG funds from ARRA were implemented to aid in job creation and housing rehabilitation. Total appropriations for the CDF account saw fluctuations due to factors like sequestration and earmarked project eliminations. The CDF account appropriations fluctuated between $5.112 billion in FY2001 and $3.008 billion in FY2012. The FY2011 appropriation was the lowest in over a decade, while the FY2012 amount for CDBG formula grants was the lowest since FY1990. 70% of funds for CDBG eligible activities go to entitlement communities, with the remaining 30% allocated to states and Puerto Rico. The CDBG program's funding allocation has been a topic of debate, with supporters advocating for increased funding due to a decline in appropriations. This decrease has been exacerbated by the growing number of communities gaining entitlement status, leading to a smaller share of funds for existing entitlement communities. The CDBG program has faced criticism for stagnant funding despite an increasing number of eligible grant recipients. From FY2000 to FY2013, the average grant amount allocated to entitlement communities decreased by 43.7%, with funding levels fluctuating annually. For FY2013, the average allocation was 37.9% lower than in FY2000. The average grant amount for CDBG entitlement communities decreased by 43.7% from FY2000 to FY2013 due to lower funding levels and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. The total grant amount and average annual grant allocation to states and Puerto Rico also fluctuated during this period, with a 33% decline in funding for nonentitlement communities. In FY2013, $921 million was allocated among states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities, with an average allocation of $18.1 million. This was a 27.5% decrease from FY2001, but a 4.4% increase from FY2012. Program funding for CDBG formula grants declined by 46.4% in inflation-adjusted constant dollars from FY2000 to FY2013. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants fluctuated between $2.9 billion and $4.4 billion in current dollars from FY2000 to FY2013. The CDBG program allocations from FY2000 to FY2013 are determined by a dual formula using census and American Community Survey data. Funds are allocated to eligible entitlement communities and states based on two statutorily based formulas, with Formula A allocating funds based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors. The CDBG program uses a dual formula system to allocate funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on factors like population growth, poverty, and housing conditions. Formula A allocates funds based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors, while Formula B considers population growth lag, poverty share, and housing built before 1940. The CDBG program uses a dual formula system to allocate funds based on factors like population, poverty, and housing conditions. Formula A considers population, poverty, and overcrowded housing, while Formula B looks at poverty, housing built before 1940, and persons living in poverty. HUD uses Census Bureau data and American Community Survey estimates to update data sources annually for fund allocation. HUD updates data sources annually for CDBG fund allocation, reflecting recent demographic changes. Prior to FY2012, HUD used 2000 Census data for poverty, housing conditions, and housing stock. In FY2011, 2009 population estimates were also used. A study in December 2011 analyzed the impact of 2010 Census and ACS data on fund allocation. The HUD study analyzed the impact of new data sources on CDBG fund allocation. Communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions were expected to see a decline in allocations, while those in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions would experience an increase. The introduction of new data sources had a significant impact on the distribution of funds. The introduction of new data sources in CDBG fund allocation resulted in changes in funding distribution. Principal cities and urban counties received a greater share of funds, while entitlement cities saw a decline. Factors such as poverty rates, overcrowding, and housing age influenced these changes. States like New Mexico and Puerto Rico experienced the largest funding declines. The full report can be found at http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/cdbg_redis_eff.pdf. The FY2013 appropriations for the CDBG program totaled $3.078 billion, a 6.8% decrease from FY2011. Funding for entitlement communities declined, with average grant amounts decreasing from $2 million in FY2011 to $1.8 million in FY2013, a 10.1% reduction. The average state allocation for the CDBG program declined by 6.7% from $19.42 million in FY2011 to $18.1 million in FY2013. Over the last 11 years, the average entitlement allocation decreased by 37.9% from $2.9 million in FY2003 to $1.8 million in FY2013. This reduction in funding disproportionately affects low and moderate-income households, as communities are required to allocate at least 70% of the funds to benefit them. The FY2012 appropriation for the CDBG program was the lowest in over a decade. The FY2014 funding for the CDF program was reduced, with $3.1 billion allocated, affecting entitlement communities' projects and support. HUD had not yet distributed funds to eligible communities and states at the time of the report. The FY2014 appropriation for the CDF account reflects outcomes from previous cycles, with appropriations for CDBG grants remaining steady. H.R. 2610 recommended a 45% reduction in funding for CDF activities, causing concern for supporters of the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.295 billion for CDF activities in FY2014, with $3.150 billion allocated for CDBG formula grants. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 2610 raised concerns among groups opposing cuts to CDBG funding, citing potential impacts on community and economic development plans. The decline in average CDBG grant amounts is due to reduced funding and an increase in eligible communities. Congress is unlikely to increase CDBG funding significantly due to concerns about national debt. Options to address the decline include appropriating additional funds or implementing HUD's proposal to eliminate grandfathering. The HUD proposal in the FY2014 budget aimed to eliminate grandfathering for communities no longer meeting population thresholds and formula funding for entitlement cities with low allocations. This would affect 25% of entitlement communities, transitioning them to nonentitlement status. The HUD proposal in the FY2014 budget aimed to transition entitlement cities to nonentitlement status by increasing population thresholds. This would potentially eliminate over half of the cities receiving entitlement funding in FY2012. Eliminated cities could potentially join their county's CDBG program. The HUD proposal in the FY2014 budget aims to transition entitlement cities to nonentitlement status by increasing population thresholds, potentially eliminating over half of the cities receiving entitlement funding in FY2012. Eliminated cities could join their county's CDBG program, reducing administrative costs and promoting intra-county cooperation. HUD argues that larger grants would increase effectiveness by fully funding projects that create jobs or pursue neighborhood revitalization, as small grants are inefficient and do not provide sufficient resources for effective program management. The CDF account includes set-asides for specific objectives and projects, some of which complement the larger formula grant program. Critics argue that funding for these programs has sometimes come at the expense of the CDBG formula grant program. Appropriations for set-aside programs in the CDF account have varied significantly from FY2000 to FY2013, with earmarks under the EDI and NI programs accounting for a large portion of the funding in FY2001. From FY2000 to FY2013, appropriations for CDF set-asides, including EDI and NI programs, fluctuated significantly. Funding for these programs declined by 59.4% in constant FY2000 dollars from FY2000 to FY2008, rebounded in FY2009 and FY2010, then decreased again in FY2011, reaching a low of $57 million in FY2013. Congress made decisions to move grant programs in and out of the CDF account, reduce funding for specific programs, and allocate funds to EDI and NI programs. Earmarked projects were a significant part of CDBG-related set-asides, but Congress stopped funding earmarks in the CDF account after FY2011. The issue of earmarks has been debated in recent Congresses, with all earmarks removed from the CDF account during the FY2007 appropriations cycle. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks were the dominant components of CDBG-linked set asides programs, with combined appropriations more than twice the amount for other set-aside activities. Congress has used the CDBG program's framework to provide supplemental funds for disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation activities. The government provided funds to states and communities to acquire, rehabilitate, and resell foreclosed properties under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) to reduce the inventory of abandoned properties. This was part of a larger federal effort to support job creation in response to the economic recession. Disaster relief and NSP funding were allocated based on specific criteria, with CDBG disaster funding only going to communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration. Funds allocated to states under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) were based on mortgage foreclosure rates. Congress required states to distribute a portion of these funds to local governments with high foreclosure rates. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) allocated funds based on mortgage foreclosure rates to communities affected by subprime loans and mortgage delinquencies. NSP-1 and NSP-3 funds had minimum allocation thresholds, with 309 communities qualifying for NSP-1 and 268 for NSP-3. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to states, local governments, and non-profit organizations, with for-profit entities allowed to participate as partners. The program's block grant structure gives entitlement communities and states discretion in allocating funds for local development needs. Approximately $100 billion has been allocated by formula to communities over 40 years. Over 40 years, approximately $100 billion has been allocated by formula to communities and states for housing, public facilities, infrastructure, and economic development projects benefiting low and moderate-income individuals. Congress has expanded the program to provide disaster relief, address economic recessions, and fund additional programs supporting the CDBG program. This has led to the creation of narrowly targeted programs known as \"creeping categoricals.\" Since 2011, Congress has not funded earmarked projects under the CDF account, leading to a decline in other programs authorized under the CD account. CDBG entitlement grantees have seen stagnant or declining allocations, with FY2013 averaging 37.9% less than FY2000. This is due to lower funding levels and an increase in entitlement communities. The number of jurisdictions receiving CDBG entitlement allocations increased from 1,012 to 1,183 between FY2000 and FY2013. The table shows annual appropriations for the CDBG formula grants, excluding special appropriations and set-asides. The FY2011 to FY2013 distribution of CDBG formula funds to states and entitlement communities was detailed in Table C-1. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2012 decreased allocations by 10.8% compared to FY2011, while FY2013 saw a 4.6% increase over FY2012. In FY2013, CDBG formula funds increased by 4.6% above the amount appropriated for FY2012."
