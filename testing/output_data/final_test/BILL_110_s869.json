Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is amended to require registered public accounting firms to attest to and report on the internal control assessment made by the management of the issuer, focusing on the process and system management used to identify and manage risks. The amended Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires registered public accounting firms to attest to and report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, focusing on risk management, key controls, and assessment conclusions. The regulations under this section mandate intervals for attestation and reporting. The amended Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires attestation and reporting on internal controls over financial reporting at 3-year intervals, with the possibility of shorter intervals for major structural or performance changes. Attestations must adhere to standards issued by the Board. The Board issues standards for the audit of internal controls over financial reporting, focusing on critical controls for accurate financial statements. The Board issues standards for the audit of internal controls over financial reporting, focusing on critical controls for accurate financial statements. The standards prescribed by the Commission require auditors to consult with management to identify the controls posing the greatest risk to the company, considering industry characteristics. Additionally, the standards aim to eliminate duplication of audits and examinations by relying on the work of others. The standards issued by the Board focus on audits of internal controls over financial reporting, emphasizing critical controls for accurate financial statements. Registered public accounting firms can rely on examinations and inspections by regulatory agencies that focus on risk-based internal controls of the issuer. The third-party accountant works with registered public accounting firms to assess internal control systems, allowing the firms to heavily rely on the accountant's work during attestations and reports. The third-party accountant assists registered public accounting firms in assessing internal control systems to avoid repetitive testing. Management of the issuer should communicate openly with the accounting firms on all aspects of internal controls. The term 'third-party accountant' refers to a registered public accounting firm other than the one engaged to perform the attestation and report. The Commission will establish a materiality standard for assessing internal controls based on their impact on financial statements and the issuer's financial status. SEC. 4. SMALLER PUBLIC COMPANY OPTION REGARDING INTERNAL CONTROL PROVISION. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is amended to include a smaller public company option, allowing smaller issuers to voluntarily elect to comply with certain requirements. Smaller issuers not electing to comply must state their decision in their annual report to the Commission. The term 'smaller issuer' is defined for this purpose. The term 'issuer' refers to a company required to submit an annual report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A smaller issuer is defined as having a total market capitalization, product and services revenue, or number of record beneficial holders below specific thresholds. These thresholds are adjusted annually for changes. The thresholds for smaller issuers are adjusted annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers in the United States. SEC. 5. COMPETITION FOR AUDITING SERVICES. The Commission and the Board will conduct a study on the lack of competition in audits for issuers, focusing on the concentration of audit performance in 4 large accounting firms. They will also explore ways to increase the number of qualified accounting firms and address conflict of interest provisions. A report is due within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Commission and the Board will submit a joint report to the Senate and House Committees on Banking and Financial Services. The report will include examination results, recommendations for the accounting industry, and measures for the Commission and Board to address audit concentration issues. The Board may recommend changes in laws to address audit concentration issues. SEC. 6. PRINCIPLES-BASED GUIDANCE STUDY. The Commission and the Board will conduct a study comparing the principles-based Turnbull Guidance in Great Britain to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A joint report must be submitted to the Senate and House Committees within 1 year, comparing accounting and other costs.
