    "content": "The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight is investigating executive agencies' public communications activities for wasteful or propagandistic spending. 11 federal agencies have been asked to provide records of their public communications contracts since 2008. Previous congressional committees have also examined agency public communications, including a hearing on the General Services Administration's hiring of a private consulting firm in March 2011. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee criticized seven agencies for inappropriate public relations activities, including a Department of Health and Human Services commercial promoting the Affordable Care Act. Congressional scrutiny of agency communications has been ongoing, stemming from concerns about agencies promoting policies and taking political sides. Apprehension about agencies promoting policies and taking political sides is a long-standing concern rooted in the belief that agencies should be apolitical and focus on informing the public rather than advocating for specific policies or engaging in elections. Agencies also have incentives to promote themselves positively and seek operational autonomy by building relationships with the public and interest groups through public communications. Federal agencies often communicate with the public to uphold representative democracy by keeping people informed of government activities. Statutory restrictions on publicity, propaganda, and lobbying with appropriated funds serve as tools for congressional control to prevent agencies from misusing resources for self-promotion or political causes. This ensures that agencies focus on informing the public rather than advocating for specific policies or engaging in elections. Federal agencies regularly communicate with the public for various reasons, such as informing them of rights, activities, and seeking feedback on proposed rules. Congress has established agencies like the U.S. Government Printing Office and the Office of National Drug Control Policy for public information dissemination. The exact annual spending on communications by the executive branch and federal government is unclear, but in FY2010, executive branch agencies spent around $945 million on advertising contracts. In FY2010, the Department of Defense spent $545.4 million on advertising, mainly for recruiting purposes. Congress has established statutory restrictions on executive agency communications, including prohibitions on using appropriated funds for publicity experts and grassroots lobbying. The annual appropriations acts carry restrictions on using funds for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States not authorized by Congress. These restrictions aim to prevent agencies from propagandizing the public and wasting public funds. The 1919 anti-lobbying statute aims to protect the separation of powers by preventing executive agencies from pressuring legislators through the public. Enforcing restrictions on government communications is challenging due to lack of oversight. The Department of Justice has never prosecuted anyone for violating the anti-lobbying law. Enforcement falls to inspectors general, GAO, and Congress, but they have other priorities. Post hoc enforcement is common as there is no central agency for reviewing agency communications. Enforcing restrictions on government communications is challenging due to lack of oversight. There is no central federal agency that reviews agency communications before they are released to the public. Authorities only learn of possible transgressions when alerted by someone else. The brevity of current statutes leaves agencies and oversight authorities responsible for interpreting the extent of the statutes' coverage. The GAO has opinions on defining \"publicity and propaganda\" in agency communications, but they are not authoritative. DOJ has contested GAO's conclusions, and federal agencies are using new media technologies to communicate with the public. Federal government domains have numerous websites, with agencies utilizing social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for communication. The National Archives and Records Administration is a heavy user of these technologies, including blogs, Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, and YouTube channels. Around a quarter of federal managers use Facebook for work purposes, aligning with past adoption of new communication technologies to enhance agency operations. The Obama Administration encouraged federal agencies to use new media technologies to improve transparency and public engagement. This \"Open Government Initiative\" aimed to make government operations and decisions more accessible to the public through online platforms. The Office of Management and Budget provided guidance on using new media for transparency and collaboration, appointing key officials to lead the initiative. Different agencies have used various new media platforms to communicate with the public. Examples include the U.S. Army using websites and Facebook for recruitment, Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu posting on Facebook about energy conservation, and NARA utilizing social media. The NARA and Department of State utilize social media tools for communication and public diplomacy. These platforms help in reaching out to researchers, students, and the general public, as well as foreign audiences. Twitter is used by the Department of State for public diplomacy, enabling direct communication with foreign audiences. Twitter allows agencies to communicate directly with foreign audiences. After the Deepwater Horizon explosion, a multi-federal agency used various online platforms to inform the public about their response to the oil spill. The Department of Veterans Affairs hired a former soldier, Alex Horton, to provide critical insights on their services. Smithsonian museums have also engaged the public by allowing them to vote online for items to be displayed. The use of new media by agencies, such as Twitter, has increased the quantity and quality of public communications. This can pose challenges for Congress in overseeing agency communications to ensure compliance with statutory prohibitions. New media technologies enable prompt communications between agencies and the public, but may also lead to misstatements or violations of restrictions. Daniel Mintz warns that online content from federal employees can be seen as establishing formal policy. Digital communications can be easily deleted and difficult to locate, especially real-time communications like live chats or videos. The NARA has issued guidance to agencies on preserving new media communications, which can be easily altered or forged. Federal agencies' new media public communications lack security protocols, making them vulnerable to manipulation and distribution by unauthorized individuals. New media communications by agencies have been compromised by hackers, making it challenging to identify authorized personnel. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook allow federal employees to interact with the public without clear attribution. For example, the Department of Commerce's Chief Economist maintains a blog and Twitter account. New media communications by agencies have been compromised by hackers, making it challenging to identify authorized personnel. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook allow federal employees to interact with the public without clear attribution. Congress established the position of chief information officer (CIO) within federal agencies to coordinate and monitor information technology programs. CIOs are not public affairs personnel, yet some have blogs that promote their agencies' activities. The use of new media may make it more difficult to discern when an agency has violated grassroots lobbying laws. Government communications through new media can easily be rebroadcast, leading to a loss of control over the message. This can result in errors or violations of statutory limitations on public communications being spread widely. The use of various new media formats has expanded the ways in which agency communications can be disseminated, potentially leading to grassroots lobbying efforts being identified through different channels. The ease of rebroadcasting government communications through new media can lead to widespread dissemination of errors or violations of statutory limitations. This poses challenges for agencies in rectifying such situations. Congress may need to consider policy options to enhance oversight and enforcement of public communications restrictions in light of the complexities introduced by new media adoption. The public communications restrictions include defining key terms, updating anti-lobbying statutes for new media, surveying agency employees on compliance, requiring author identification in communications, and providing guidelines through the OMB. The Information Quality Act mandates OMB guidance for federal agencies. The Information Quality Act (IQA) requires OMB guidance for federal agencies to ensure the quality of information disseminated to the public. It also includes requirements for agencies to report on public communications activities and for GAO to assess agency compliance with public communications restrictions."
