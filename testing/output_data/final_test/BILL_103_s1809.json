    "content": "The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress by June 1, 1994, on steps for achieving international cooperation in developing Theater Missile Defense systems and funding programs for them. The Congress must establish the annual authorization of new obligational authority for Theater Missile Defense programs, limiting the US contribution to not more than 80% of the total amount. No appropriation should exceed the total amount allocated for research, development, test, and evaluation, and procurement for TMD programs. The President may waive the limitation on US contribution to Theater Missile Defense programs if deemed necessary for national security. Foreign contributions for TMD systems should incrementally increase, with US funding not exceeding 80% of the total cost. The development and production of Theater Missile Defense systems should see a gradual decrease in US funding, with allied nations and international organizations increasing their financial contributions. Foreign nations paying at least 20% of the total cost of contracts for TMD systems are exempt from financial contribution requirements. SEC. 3. THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION ACCOUNT.
