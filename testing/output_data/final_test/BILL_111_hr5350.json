    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"North Korea Sanctions and Diplomatic Nonrecognition Act of 2010\". Congress finds that North Korean negotiators in the Six-Party diplomatic process did not act in good faith by refusing to agree to a transparent verification process for denuclearization. International press reports indicate North Korea's support to Iran in missile technology and nuclear development, as well as providing Hezbollah and Hamas with missile technology and tunneling techniques to attack Israel. International press reports reveal North Korea's involvement in assisting Syria with a nuclear reactor, destroyed by Israeli forces in 2007. North Korean negotiators refuse to address the abduction of civilians from Japan, South Korea, and other countries. Defectors report the torture and murder of Reverend Kim Dong-shik, a US permanent resident, in North Korea. Congress has expressed its view that US nonhumanitarian assistance to North Korea should be contingent on human rights improvements, release of abductees, family reunification, labor camp reform, and decriminalization of political expression, none of which has occurred. The North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008 acknowledges the deplorable human rights conditions in North Korea and the vulnerability of North Korean refugees. Congress has determined that any missile test by North Korea would violate UN Security Council resolutions. The North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008 acknowledges the deplorable human rights conditions in North Korea and the vulnerability of North Korean refugees. Congress has determined that any missile test by North Korea would violate UN Security Council resolutions. In response, North Korea must re-establish commitments to a moratorium on missile launching, with resulting sanctions under resolution 1718 coming into full effect following a missile test or launch. Congress also requires a firm commitment from North Korea for the complete dismantlement of all nuclear programs after any missile test or launch. Reports suggest a delegation of Iranian missile experts visiting North Korea. A delegation of Iranian missile experts arrived in North Korea in March 2009 to assist with a rocket launch, bringing a letter from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Kim Jong-Il. Despite international efforts to stop nuclear proliferation, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test in violation of UN resolutions, leading to the imposition of further sanctions. Council Resolution 1874 on June 12, 2009 imposed additional sanctions and inspection requirements on North Korea. SEC. 3. CONTINUATION OF RESTRICTIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTH KOREA. Congress finds that after the Secretary of State's decision in 2008 to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, North Korea has engaged in acts of international terrorism or provocation, including sending agents to assassinate a defector, involvement in the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel, and attempting to ship weapons to terrorist organizations. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman stated in Tokyo on May 12, 2010, that foreign terrorist organizations Hezbollah and Hamas are a threat. Despite North Korea being removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2008, restrictions against them will remain unless the President certifies otherwise to Congress. The President must certify to Congress that North Korea has ceased illegal activities related to missile and nuclear technology, as well as support for terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. The President must certify to Congress that North Korea has ceased illegal activities related to missile and nuclear technology, as well as support for terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. Additionally, North Korea must meet certain conditions such as no longer engaging in counterfeiting of US currency, international trafficking of illicit narcotics, and returning the remains of Reverend Kim Dong-shik to his family for a proper Christian burial in Chicago. North Korea has released abduction victims recognized by Japan and South Korea, as well as surviving POWs from the Korean War. They have also made provisions for family reunification meetings and opened up their penal system, including concentration camps holding an estimated 200,000 people. North Korea has made provisions for unrestricted visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross to concentration camps holding an estimated 200,000 prisoners, access for UN representatives to refugees forcibly repatriated to North Korea, and contact between international and South Korean religious organizations and their counterparts in North Korea. The Secretary of State should redesignate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism immediately upon the enactment of this Act. The term \"state sponsor of terrorism\" refers to any country that the Secretary of State determines has repeatedly supported international terrorism. SEC. 4. CONTINUATION OF DIPLOMATIC NONRECOGNITION OF NORTH KOREA. Congress finds that the United States has not granted diplomatic recognition to North Korea since its establishment in 1948 as a client regime of the Soviet Union. This nonrecognition continues due to the Korean War and the deaths of many military personnel. Diplomatic nonrecognition, including restrictions on establishing a permanent presence in North Korea, will persist until the President certifies to Congress otherwise. The President must certify to Congress that North Korea has met specified benchmarks. In response to a North Korean missile launch or nuclear test violating UN Security Council Resolutions, the President will direct the US Representative to the UN to push for a resolution condemning the action and imposing sanctions and inspections on North Korea."
