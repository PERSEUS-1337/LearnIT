    "content": "After rebounding from recession between 2009 and 2014, U.S. manufacturing output has grown little since the second half of 2014. Employment in the U.S. manufacturing sector has increased slightly, defying expectations of a surge in factory production and jobs. Changes in technology and business practices make it difficult to evaluate the manufacturing sector, with government statistics showing a growing share of manufacturing-related jobs and output in other sectors of the economy. The manufacturing sector in the U.S. has seen fluctuations in output and employment over the years. Despite strong growth in manufacturing, job creation has been modest, especially for workers with lower education levels. The number of manufacturing jobs declined during the recession in 2001 and failed to recover afterward. Currently, there are 12.6 million workers employed in the manufacturing sector, with a 22% increase in manufacturing output since June 2009. Since June 2009, manufacturing output in the U.S. has increased by 22%, while employment has only risen by 8%. Factors contributing to the weakness in manufacturing employment include the U.S. trade deficit with China and other limiting factors. The U.S. manufacturing industry has seen a shift in production methods, with some industries like apparel and footwear struggling to automate due to labor-intensive processes. This has led to a decline in domestic production and employment, particularly in industries with high labor costs. In contrast, industries like steelmaking have been able to increase output without adding workers through technological advancements. In 2017, steel production increased by 8% with fewer workers compared to 1980. Shifts in demand have affected employment in industries like paper and tobacco, leading to a decline in output and employment. Food manufacturing has seen growth in employment, while most manufacturing sectors have experienced a decrease. Since 2009, transportation equipment, fabricated metal products, food manufacturing, and plastics and rubber manufacturing have seen employment growth in the manufacturing sector. While mass production remains important, automation has impacted routine production tasks, leading to changes in the nature of work and skill requirements for manufacturing workers. The nature of work in manufacturing has shifted, with only two in five employees directly involved in production. Employment in other manufacturing occupations, such as office clerical work, has also declined. In 2017, 32% of manufacturing workers held management and professional jobs, reflecting a trend towards higher skill requirements in the industry. The shift to higher skill requirements is particularly evident in industries like computer and electronic product manufacturing, where automation and changes in production economies have led to a decline in total employment. In 2017, 32% of manufacturing workers were in management and professional jobs, reflecting a trend towards higher skill requirements in the industry. Of the 1.04 million people employed in manufacturing, 28% were in production occupations with a median annual pay of $35,010. Another 21% were in architecture and engineering occupations with a median annual wage of $87,010, and 13% were in computer and mathematical occupations with a median annual wage of $104,120. The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry also has 32% of workers in production roles, while the rest have scientific skills associated with higher education levels. In 2016, employment for team assemblers in manufacturing decreased by 15% since 2000, with 19% now working for employment agencies. Those working for agencies earn 21% less than those employed directly by manufacturing companies. The educational requirements in manufacturing have shifted, with a drop of 11 percentage points in workers with no education beyond high school between 2000 and 2017. Between 2000 and 2017, the proportion of manufacturing workers with bachelor's or graduate degrees increased by 9 percentage points to 31%. Despite the loss of manufacturing jobs, the number of workers with graduate degrees rose by 34%, while those with associate degrees in academic fields increased by 23%. Manufacturers are likely hiring more educated workers for greater productivity. The proportion of female manufacturing workers has decreased from 32% in 1993 to 28% currently. Women have historically been prominent in industries like apparel, textiles, and electrical manufacturing, but the number of less educated female workers has declined. In 2000, only 41% of female manufacturing workers had education beyond high school, compared to 61% of males. This gender gap has since closed due to the departure of less educated women from the manufacturing workforce. The proportion of female manufacturing workers with no education beyond high school decreased by 46% from 2000 to 2016. Currently, the number of years of schooling for female manufacturing workers is similar to that of males. In 2017, 32% of women in manufacturing held four-year college degrees or higher, almost the same as men. The female share of the manufacturing workforce has increased since 2014, with manufacturers adding 200,000 female workers and 300,000 male workers. Policymakers value manufacturing jobs for their wage premium compared to other industries. The Commerce Department reported that manufacturing jobs offer higher average hourly pay compared to nonmanufacturing jobs, with a 17% wage premium. However, this premium is partly due to fewer young workers in the manufacturing industry. The workforce in leisure and hospitality and retailing industries is predominantly under age 20, with many part-time workers and shorter work weeks compared to manufacturing. Full-time workers are more likely to receive benefits. Despite popular belief, manufacturing workers earn less per hour on average than workers in industries with fewer teenagers, similar workweeks, and education levels. For example, in 2017, nonsupervisory manufacturing workers earned $21.29 per hour, while construction workers earned $26.73 and electric utility workers earned $36.21 per hour. Average wages for production and nonsupervisory workers in manufacturing have declined over time compared to other industries. In 2000, manufacturing workers earned 5.1% more than services workers, but by 2017, they earned 2.4% less. Comparing wages may lead to misleading conclusions due to the smaller proportion of manufacturing workers considered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Alternative data suggests looking at the relative earnings of all workers, not just nonsupervisory ones. The wages of all workers in manufacturing have seen more modest declines compared to production and nonsupervisory workers. A recent analysis shows that workers without college educations earn 7.8% higher wages in manufacturing than in other private sector industries. However, the study notes that the manufacturing wage premium has substantially fallen since the 1980s. The wages of manufacturing workers have seen more modest declines compared to other sectors. Adjusting for individual characteristics may obscure broader trends in relative wages, with a growing proportion of black and Hispanic workers in manufacturing earning less than non-Hispanic white workers. The wage premium for manufacturing workers overall has decreased, but whether manufacturing pays higher wages depends on location and industry type. In 2010, the average hourly wage for manufacturing workers was higher than the private-sector average in 29 states. By 2017, this was true for 25 states. Durable-goods manufacturing workers earn $22.25 per hour, higher than non-durables manufacturing workers. Manufacturing employers traditionally offer better benefits due to a strong union presence. Manufacturing employers spend more on benefits for blue-collar union workers compared to non-union workers. The wage growth in manufacturing varies by industry, with some sectors seeing an increase while others experiencing a decline. Overall, job creation in manufacturing has not led to an improvement in the average position of manufacturing workers relative to other sectors. The manufacturing sector's ability to provide better wages and benefits than other industries is increasingly difficult to defend. Manufacturing-related work is often performed in sectors with higher average wages. Current statistical practices classify activities based on where they are conducted, leading to discrepancies in sector classification. If a firm locates its product design employees at a U.S. facility primarily engaged in producing goods, they will be considered manufacturing workers. However, if the designers work at a separate design center, they will be classified as industrial design workers. Their value added will be attributed to the professional, scientific, and technical services sector, not manufacturing. Product designers at manufacturing establishments are employed by a separate firm rather than by the manufacturer. There are four groups of U.S. workers related to manufacturing: production employees, nonproduction employees, workers producing manufactured goods but employed by nonmanufacturing establishments, and workers producing services and software used in manufacturing but employed by nonmanufacturing establishments. Data on the first two groups are captured by government statistics, while data on the last two groups are less clear. In 2015, establishments in the computer systems design and related services industry employed 1.9 million Americans. In 2015, the services industry employed 1.9 million Americans. Approximately 23% of work hours in this industry, equivalent to 447,000 jobs, could be considered manufacturing work. Additionally, 378,000 U.S. workers are employed in software publishing, with a growing number involved in writing and testing computer software for manufactured goods. Boeing Corp. aims for $50 billion in annual revenue from services like supplying aircraft. Boeing Corp. set a goal of $50 billion in annual revenue from services like supplying spare parts, modifying and repairing aircraft, training pilots, and monitoring aircraft systems during flights. Manufacturers are transitioning to service providers for continuous revenue streams. Pricing for bundled products and services may pose challenges in attributing value to different sectors. Factoryless goods producers are firms that design products but do not physically manufacture them. They rely on external suppliers for production, such as contract manufacturers in the US or abroad. Examples include a footwear company that designs shoes but outsources production, and a semiconductor company that contracts with a foundry for chip manufacturing. Identifying these producers is difficult due to confidential survey responses and annual report filings. Alphabet Inc., parent company of Google, may be considered a factoryless goods producer. While they generate most of their revenue from online advertising, they also sell various products and design computer servers and semiconductors. It is unclear if Alphabet owns and operates its own manufacturing facilities, as they rely on third parties for many of their products. Alphabet Inc., parent company of Google, may be considered a factoryless goods producer. It is unclear if any Alphabet employees are categorized as manufacturing workers or if their sales are registered as manufacturing output. Many tasks performed by Alphabet employees may be similar to those in manufacturing establishments, but their facilities are typically classified as wholesale, retail, or professional services rather than manufacturing. Contract manufacturing services are provided by establishments in the manufacturing sector, either in the United States or abroad. Over 20,000 U.S. enterprises not primarily in manufacturing offered contract manufacturing services in 2012, collectively employing 1.5 million workers. The classification of factoryless goods producers as manufacturers has been a controversial issue, with proposed changes by U.S. statistical agencies in 2010. The proposal to include factoryless goods producers as manufacturing workers was met with objections and postponed in 2014 due to poor data quality. This results in a significant amount of manufacturing-like work not being attributed to manufacturing in government statistics. Manufacturers often use workers from employment services firms, who earn less than those directly employed by manufacturers. The majority of employment service firms' employees in manufacturing work on a temporary basis, including nonproduction workers. A recent study shows that temporary-help workers in manufacturing increased from 6.9% in 2005 to 9.7% in 2015. The stereotype of large manufacturing plants with thousands of employees is outdated, as only a small number of establishments employ more than 1,000 workers. In March 2016, only 886 factories employed over 1,000 workers, up from 795 in 2010 but still below 1990s levels. These large factories employ 1.8 million workers, accounting for 16% of the manufacturing workforce. Mean employment in U.S. manufacturing establishments decreased from 46.3 workers in 1998 to 36.2 in 2010, but has since increased to 39.6 workers. The decline in large factories was widespread, except in the food processing industry. Chemicals, computers, machinery, and transportation equipment industries make up over half of the large factories. The number of large factories with over 1,000 workers declined between 1998 and 2010, mainly in industries like electronics, machinery, and transportation equipment. However, recent data shows an increase in large factories in sectors such as food, chemicals, and transportation equipment. The average employment size in these factories has remained around 2,050 workers since 2004. In 2016, 16% of manufacturing workers were employed in plants with over 1,000 workers, down from 19% in 1998 but up from a low of 14.9% in 2012. This trend differs from other sectors where business start-ups and shutdowns play a larger role in employment dynamics. In manufacturing, employment change is driven by the expansion and contraction of existing firms, with entrepreneurship and failure playing lesser roles due to financial factors like capital requirements and specialized nature of manufacturing equipment. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Business Employment Dynamics database provides quarterly estimates of gross employment gains in manufacturing. In manufacturing, Bureau of Labor Statistics finds that over 90% of job creation comes from the expansion of existing establishments, with less than 10% from new establishments. Plant closings account for less than 12% of job losses in manufacturing, a decrease from previous years. The manufacturing sector sees over 90% of job creation from existing establishments, with less than 10% from new establishments. Plant closures contribute to less than 12% of job losses in manufacturing, a decrease from previous years. Data from the Census Bureau's longitudinal business database also shows that new business establishments open and close at lower rates in the manufacturing sector compared to other sectors of the economy. The business creation rate fell significantly during the 2007-2009 recession and had not fully recovered by 2015. In that year, 16,365 manufacturing establishments opened, employing 241,643 workers, which was fewer than in any year since 1977. The average number of new manufacturing establishments opened each year from 2010 to 2014 was less than half the average during the 1980s and 1990s. Only a small share of manufacturing jobs come from new establishments, as factories typically expand slowly in their early years. The average manufacturing establishment that opened in 2015 provided 16 jobs during its first year, indicating that marginal employment change in manufacturing depends more heavily on staffing decisions at existing factories than on the creation of new factories. Congress has considered legislation to strengthen the manufacturing sector, with bills taking diverse approaches such as providing financial and technical assistance to designated manufacturing communities. The proposals in Congress aim to boost manufacturing in the U.S. for job creation, but data suggests achieving this goal may be challenging. New bills include Buy America for Drinking Water Extension Act, Chief Manufacturing Officer Act, and Next Generation American Manufacturing Act. Even with proposals in Congress to boost manufacturing for job creation, achieving this goal may be difficult. Large increases in manufacturing activity may not lead to significant gains in manufacturing employment due to firms' preference for capital-intensive production in U.S. facilities. The rise in fixed assets per employee and the decline in energy costs from shale gas development have only modest effects on manufacturing employment. This may create demand for workers in other sectors like construction or information services. Manufacturing industries like chemicals, petroleum refining, and primary metals account for 65% of natural gas consumption and are capital-intensive. Despite modest job growth in these sectors, new technologies and government support may lead to changes in methods and products. However, advancements in technology are likely to reduce the need for factory workers, limiting employment opportunities for those without higher education. Policies promoting new manufacturing facilities may not be as effective in creating jobs as focusing on existing facilities. Increased manufacturing activity can lead to job creation in other sectors like professional services, information, finance, and transportation. Manufacturing industries are capital-intensive and advancements in technology may reduce the need for factory workers without higher education."
