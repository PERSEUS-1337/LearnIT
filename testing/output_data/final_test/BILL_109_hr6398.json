    "content": "The Act titled \"Emergency Coverage During an Incident of National Significance Act of 2006\" extends federal employee health insurance to certain individuals affected by a national incident. It introduces a new chapter, Chapter 89A, which includes definitions, provisions for health insurance, contract requirements, eligibility criteria, and alternative conditions to Federal employee health benefits plans. The Act \"Emergency Coverage During an Incident of National Significance Act of 2006\" defines key terms such as eligible individual, incident of national significance, and Office. It also establishes health insurance provisions for eligible individuals. The Office of Personnel Management administers a health insurance program for eligible individuals. Regulations are prescribed to apply provisions of chapter 89 to these individuals. Contracts are made with multiple carriers to offer health benefits plans to eligible individuals. Eligibility and identification of individuals are outlined in the Act. \"Eligible individuals can enroll in a health benefits plan under this chapter, except if they are 65 years or older, enrolled in a public health insurance program, enrolled in a plan under chapter 89, or a member of the uniformed services.\" The Secretary of Homeland Security will identify the area affected by each incident of national significance and carry out a program to identify eligible individuals. Enrollment in a health benefits plan under this chapter is limited to 24 months for each incident, with possible extensions if the area remains affected. \"SEC. 8925. ALTERNATIVE CONDITIONS TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS PLANS.\" Rates and premiums for health benefits plans under this chapter may vary by geographic regions. No Government contribution is provided for individuals under this chapter. The Office ensures that individuals covered under this chapter are in a separate risk pool from those covered under chapter 89. Technical and conforming amendments include contract requirements and provisions for health benefits plans. The table of chapters for part III of title 5, United States Code, is amended to redesignate chapters 89A and 89B as chapters 89B and 89C, and insert a new chapter 89 after chapter 89. Chapter 89A introduces emergency health insurance for individuals affected by a national incident. The amendments made by this section will take effect upon the enactment of the Act and apply to contracts starting the following calendar year. Additionally, there is a provision for a credit for emergency health insurance costs for certain affected individuals. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to introduce a credit for emergency health insurance costs for individuals affected by a national incident. The credit is based on a percentage of the amount paid for health insurance coverage under chapter 89A of title 5, United States Code. The applicable percentage for taxpayers based on family income in relation to the poverty line is as follows: 100 percent for income up to 100 percent of the poverty line, 65 percent for income between 100 and 300 percent, 40 percent for income between 300 and 500 percent, 30 percent for income between 500 and 600 percent, and 0 percent for income over 600 percent. The definition of \"family income\" for tax purposes includes the total adjusted gross income of the taxpayer, spouse, and dependents. The definition of \"poverty line\" refers to the poverty line specified in the Community Services Block Grant Act for the relevant family size. Special rules apply to coordinate the tax credit with advance payments and other deductions. The IRS regulations prohibit double-dipping with deductions under sections 162(l) or 213 when claiming tax credits. Payments made by the IRS on behalf of individuals are considered made by the taxpayer. The Secretary has the authority to issue necessary regulations for compliance. The Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new section related to miscellaneous provisions. The Secretary will establish a program for advance payment of credit for emergency health insurance costs for certain individuals affected by a national incident. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code related to this program. Sec. 36 and Sec. 7529 of the Internal Revenue Code are amended to provide advance payment of credit for emergency health insurance costs for individuals affected by a national incident. These amendments apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a plan is outlined to extend the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program to certain individuals impacted by a national incident of significance. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will submit a plan to Congress within 3 months of the Act's enactment for the orderly implementation of the amendments, after consulting with experts and federal officers."
