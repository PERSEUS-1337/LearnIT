    "content": "The THUD appropriations subcommittees draft bills for annual appropriations for DOT, HUD, and related agencies. The DOT's mission is to ensure a fast, safe, efficient transportation system. DOT primarily provides grants and regulations organized by mode. The Department of Transportation (DOT) provides grants for transportation infrastructure and oversees safety in various industries, except for aviation which is managed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) focuses on creating inclusive communities and affordable housing for low-income households. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers rental assistance programs for low-income, elderly, and disabled individuals. Programs include Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance. Flexible block grant programs like HOME and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages for home buyers with low downpayments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Title III of the THUD appropriations bill funds related agencies. The THUD appropriations bill funds a collection of transportation and housing-related agencies, including the Access Board, Federal Maritime Commission, National Transportation Safety Board, Amtrak Office of Inspector General, NeighborWorks, and others. The bill also covers costs related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Funding details for FY2013 are provided in tables. The THUD appropriations bill provides funding for transportation and housing-related agencies, with much of the funding in the form of contract authority. The discretionary funding in the bill is only around half of the total funding. The President's FY2013 budget requested $73.4 billion for the Department of Transportation, which was $3.5 billion more than FY2012. The House-passed bill and Senate Committee on Appropriations' bills recommended similar funding levels to FY2012. The House-passed bill did not include funding for the TIGER grant program or high-speed rail, which are priorities for the Administration. The Senate THUD bill proposed funding for the TIGER program and high-speed rail development, but at a lower level than requested. Congress passed surface transportation reauthorization legislation that differed from the Administration's proposal. The President's FY2013 budget requested less funding for HUD compared to FY2012, but requested an increase in appropriations for HUD's programs and activities. The President's budget requested an increase of over $512 million for HUD programs compared to FY2012. S. 2322 included $35 billion in new budget authority for HUD, $1 billion more than the President's request. H.R. 5972 allocated $33.6 billion for HUD, less than the Senate proposed but more than the President requested. The Administration threatened to veto the House bill due to the overall discretionary funding level for FY2013 being below the Budget Control Act of 2011 ceiling. The FY2013 appropriations were not enacted before the fiscal year started, leading to a continuing resolution providing funding at FY2012 levels for the first six months. The 112th Congress adjourned without finalizing FY2013 appropriations. President Obama signed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, into law, providing $50.7 billion in supplemental funding for Hurricane Sandy losses and future disaster mitigation. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 provided funding for Hurricane Sandy recovery and future disaster mitigation. It allocated $13.07 billion for DOT, $16 billion for HUD's Community Development Block Grant program, and included adjustments for Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. The FY2013 discretionary appropriations were considered in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set limits for various purposes, including disaster relief and emergency requirements. It established a deficit reduction plan deadline for Congress and the President, leading to automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps starting in 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 delayed the sequester and reduced the total amount to be sequestered. The sequestration process for FY2013 required automatic spending cuts at the program level to achieve equal reductions from defense and nondefense funding. President Obama ordered the sequestration on March 1, 2013, with OMB calculating specific percentage reductions for different funding categories. DOT's budget was mostly exempt from sequestration, resulting in an overall reduction of around 2%. The sequestration process for FY2013 required automatic spending cuts to achieve equal reductions from defense and nondefense funding. President Obama ordered the sequestration on March 1, 2013, with OMB calculating specific percentage reductions for different funding categories. DOT's budget was mostly exempt from sequestration, resulting in an overall reduction of around 2%. Congress passed H.R. 933, as amended, which included continuing appropriations for THUD and several other federal agencies, on March 21, 2013; it was signed into law on March 26, 2013, as P.L. 113-6. Funding for DOT's programs and activities for FY2013 was reduced by about $1.6 billion, while funding for HUD's programs and activities for FY2013 was reduced by about $3 billion as a result of the sequester. Division F of P.L. 113-6 provides funding for THUD in Titles I and VIII at FY2012 levels, with adjustments for anomalies, sequester, and a 0.2% rescission. Anomalies include changes in funding levels for DOT accounts and increases for certain HUD programs like Homeless Assistance Grants and Section 8 rental assistance. Prior to FY2005, DOT and HUD were funded in separate appropriations bills under different subcommittees. From FY2005 to FY2008, they were under the same subcommittee, leading to changes in the list of agencies under its jurisdiction. This complicates year-to-year comparisons of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bills due to different bill combinations and other factors like supplemental appropriations for disasters and departmental changes. Table 3 and Table 4 provide funding trends and appropriations details for the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from FY2007 to FY2013. The enactment of Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) in 2012 authorized funding levels similar to those in FY2012 for DOT administrations. In FY2012, DOT agencies received lower funding levels compared to FY2010. The Obama Administration proposed a restructuring of surface transportation programs in FY2013, including a $50 billion supplemental appropriation for infrastructure improvement and job creation. This was an alternative to the typical gradual funding increase over an authorization period. The Obama Administration proposed a $50 billion supplemental appropriation for infrastructure improvement and job creation in FY2013, deviating from the typical gradual funding increase over an authorization period. The FY2013 budget request for DOT's surface transportation programs totaled $73.4 billion in new budget resources, $3.5 billion more than FY2012. The final enacted amount for FY2013 transportation funding was $70.6 billion, slightly less than FY2012. Most funding comes from the highway trust fund, supported by the gas tax. Congress transferred $34.5 billion from the general fund to the trust fund during FY2008-FY2010 to maintain solvency. The Congressional Budget Office projected the Highway Trust Fund would become insolvent by the end of FY2013. The MAP-21 legislation authorized transfers from the general fund to keep the fund solvent through FY2014. The federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, leading to a shortfall in funding due to improved fuel efficiency and inflation reducing tax revenues. The federal gas tax's capacity to support transportation infrastructure has been reduced by inflation and increasing fuel efficiency of vehicles. The Congressional Budget Office predicts flat gasoline consumption from 2013 to 2022 due to improved fuel efficiency offsetting increased miles driven. Highway trust fund revenues are forecasted to be $41 billion in FY2022, falling short of authorized expenditures. The Department of Transportation, congressionally created commissions, and nongovernmental groups argue that more funding is needed for transportation infrastructure. Congress faces a dilemma on how to increase funding, with raising the federal gas tax being a suggested solution. However, there is little support for this idea in Congress or the Administration due to economic challenges. The President's FY2013 budget proposed changing the highway trust fund to the transportation trust fund and increasing authorized expenditures to $476 billion over six years. This would have funded existing surface transportation programs and added the Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Transit Administration's New Starts transit construction program. The budget proposal did not include a gas tax increase but suggested offsetting additional spending by reducing overseas military operations. The Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding by providing discretionary grants to state and local governments. The TIGER grant program provides funding to state and local governments for transportation projects of regional or national significance. The funding is distributed based on priorities, making it challenging for projects with national impacts but localized costs to receive funding. The program has received support from Congress through annual DOT appropriations acts, with four rounds of grants awarded so far. The Administration requested $500 million for FY2013, the same as FY2012, but the House-passed bill did not allocate any funding for the program. The EAS program, funded at $500 million in FY2013, aims to maintain air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Costs have doubled since FY2008 due to airline route reductions, adding six new communities annually. Congress committed to preserving airline service in small communities when deregulating the industry. The EAS program, funded at $500 million in FY2013, aims to maintain air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Congress committed to preserving airline service in small communities when deregulating the industry in 1978. The Administration requested $114 million for the EAS program, which represents an increase over the FY2012 figure. Critics note the high subsidy cost per passenger and the proximity of some EAS-subsidized airports to major airports. The EAS program is funded by a $50 million mandatory annual authorization from overflight fees, in addition to discretionary appropriations. In FY2012, the total funding was $193 million. The Administration's FY2013 request proposed increasing mandatory funding to $100 million, totaling $214 million for the program, an 11% increase. Both the House-passed bill and the Senate Committee on Appropriations' bill supported the request, including the elimination of 15-passenger aircraft. The Administration requested to eliminate the 15-passenger aircraft requirement in the EAS program to reduce costs. This request was included in the FY2012 appropriations act and the current FAA authorization act. Reforms in the FAA act aimed to limit EAS program costs by restricting funding to communities that received subsidies in FY2011 and limiting coverage to airports with at least 10 passengers per day. The legislation repealed the local participation program for EAS subsidies, providing $136 million after sequestration reductions. The budget proposed $2.5 billion for high speed and intercity passenger rail funding, with $1.5 billion for System Preservation and $1 billion for Network Development. High speed rail development is a key initiative in the Administration's surface transportation proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $100 million for the high speed rail program, while the House-passed bill did not include funding for new projects. Congress has provided $10.1 billion for DOT's high speed and intercity passenger rail grant program, with funding starting in 2009. However, the 112th Congress did not allocate any funding for FY2011 and rescinded $400 million from previous appropriations. No funding was provided for FY2012, and the final FY2013 enacted budget did not include funding for the program. The $10.1 billion allocated in the 111th Congress for the High Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program did not receive funding for FY2012 or FY2013. The program aims to develop intercity passenger rail service with speeds of 90 or 110 miles per hour, although the Administration emphasizes high-speed rail. References to \"high speed rail\" typically refer to systems in countries like Japan, France, Spain, and China with speeds exceeding 150 miles per hour. California is the only state actively pursuing a high-speed rail line with federal funding of $3.6 billion, but the total cost is estimated at over $70 billion. The Administration proposed placing Amtrak funding into a new account for System Preservation with a request of $1.546 billion. Amtrak received $1.418 billion in grants in FY2012. Amtrak requested $2.167 billion for FY2013, with an authorized funding level of $2.256 billion. The Senate Committee recommended $1.450 billion, $32 million more than FY2012. The House bill recommended $1.802 billion, including $500 million for a new Bridge and Tunnel grants program. The House bill proposed $500 million for a new Bridge and Tunnel grants program, but this was not included in the enacted bill. The majority of FTA's $10 billion funding is allocated to transit agencies through various formula programs, with the Capital Investment Grants program being the largest discretionary grant program. This program funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions, with two components based on project cost: New Starts for projects over $250 million seeking over $75 million in federal funding, and Small Starts for projects under $250 million seeking less than $75 million in federal funding. Congress allocated $1.955 billion for the Capital Investment Grants program in FY2012. The Capital Investment Grants program received $1.955 billion in FY2012. For FY2013, the Administration requested $2.2 billion, but the final enacted bill provided $1.955 billion after sequestration reductions. New Starts projects undergo a rigorous evaluation process by the FTA, culminating in a full-funding grant agreement (FFGA) detailing funding and project development steps. The FFGA aims to ensure accurate project cost estimates, with the federal share capped at 80% for New Starts projects. However, since FY2002, FTA has been directed not to sign agreements with a federal share exceeding 60%. Critics argue this favors highway projects over public transportation, as highway projects typically receive an 80% federal share. Advocates claim the high demand for New Starts funding justifies the lower federal share requirement. The demand for New Starts funding exceeds available funds, so a higher local match is required to support more projects. This also encourages communities to scrutinize transit project costs more closely. FHA's mortgage insurance program aims to be self-financing, with fees covering expected losses. If the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund lacks funds, it can draw from the U.S. Treasury without congressional approval. The FY2013 President's budget showed that HUD anticipated the MMIF would need $688 million from the U.S. Treasury to cover future losses. This was due to an increase in estimated losses on FHA-insured loans. Despite having $33 billion in reserves, FHA included these funds in the budget as a precaution. After the FY2013 President's budget was released, HUD stated that it no longer expected to need funding from Treasury in FY2012 as it anticipated enough revenue from increased fees and legal settlements to cover losses. FHA did not use its budget authority with Treasury in FY2012 but drew $1.7 billion at the end of FY2013 for fund transfers. The PBRA account administers project-based rental assistance. The PBRA account provides funding for project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private property owners. The President's budget requested less funding than in FY2012, planning to \"short-fund\" contracts for partial terms. S. 2322 proposed more funding for the PBRA account, rejecting the President's proposal to short-fund assistance. The committee rejected the President's proposal to short-fund Section 8 project-based rental assistance contracts and instead provided sufficient funding to renew all contracts for 12 months. The PBRA account was funded at the FY2012 level, with reductions due to across-the-board rescission and sequestration. This funding was not enough to fully fund contracts, leading to short-funding in FY2013. The Administration requested $3.1 billion for CDF in FY2013, less than the $3.3 billion appropriated in FY2012. The Senate recommended $3.2 billion, the House proposed $3.4 billion, and the final funding after rescission and sequestration was approximately $3.1 billion. NeighborWorks America, a government-chartered non-profit corporation, supports community revitalization activities and provides funding for housing counseling organizations for foreclosure prevention. In FY2012, NeighborWorks received $215.3 million, including $135 million for regular annual appropriation and $80 million for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. The President's FY2013 budget request included $213 million for NeighborWorks. The President's FY2013 budget request for NeighborWorks included $213 million, a decrease from FY2012. The Senate proposed funding at $135 million for regular activities and $80 million for the NFMCP, while the House proposed $225 million with $80 million for NFMCP. The FY2013 Consolidated Appropriations Act funded NeighborWorks at $215.3 million, reduced to $204.1 million after sequestration. The THUD appropriations bill includes various funding mechanisms and savings mechanisms, leading to different reported figures for the same programs. Most programs in the bill are funded through regular annual discretionary appropriations. The appropriations committees allocate new funding each year from the general fund of the Treasury. This includes advance appropriations and emergency appropriations, often provided outside of regular appropriations acts. Emergency appropriations, usually for disasters, may not be included in the discretionary appropriation total. The Department of Transportation's budget also includes funding from contract authority based on federal trust fund resources. Contract authority for the Department of Transportation (DOT) is derived from federal trust fund resources like the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airways Trust Fund. Congressional appropriators have limits on new discretionary funding, which can be offset through rescissions of unobligated balances or offsetting receipts. The Appropriations Committee allocates funding among subcommittees, including only net discretionary budget authority. This can lead to confusion as contract authority from trust funds is not included in the allocations. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established overall spending limits. The Budget Control Act of 2011, established spending limits for FY2012 through FY2021, enforced through sequestration involving spending cuts if breached. Subcommittees must allocate funds across agencies based on their 302(b) allocations. In FY2012, the appropriations committee allocated the majority of funding to HUD, while DOT had greater resources when considering contract authority. Rescissions and offsets play a significant role in determining new appropriations provided by the THUD subcommittee each year. In FY2012, the THUD Subcommittee allocated funding to HUD and DOT, with rescissions and offsets impacting the amount of appropriations provided each year. The Subcommittee would have needed an additional $6 billion to maintain the same level of appropriations due to budget savings fluctuating annually."
