    "content": "This report compiles final congressional votes on free trade agreements, trade promotion authority, and U.S. membership to the World Trade Organization. Congress plays a central role in shaping trade policy by defining negotiation priorities, approving FTAs, and overseeing agreements' implementation. Congress has constitutional authority to regulate international trade and has periodically delegated negotiation authority to the President since 1934. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines congressional and executive roles regarding trade agreements. The United States has 12 bilateral FTAs and 2 regional free trade agreements. The USMCA has replaced NAFTA and has been ratified by all three countries. Congress delegates negotiation authority to the President but requires approval of FTAs. Fast-track consideration allows for expedient approval in Congress. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has been ratified by all three parties to replace NAFTA. The agreement will enter into force after necessary legal and regulatory measures are in place. The United States is also part of multilateral agreements, including membership in the WTO, created in 1995 to oversee trade rules and resolve disputes. Congress periodically considers U.S. membership in the WTO and has the authority to vote on withdrawal every five years. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) enables expedited legislative procedures for FTAs, with Congress passing seven measures extending TPA since 1974. TPA has been politically contentious in Congress over time. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), crucial to international trade, has faced political contention in Congress, leading to debates and lapses in authority. Congressional consideration of bills can be complex, often requiring multiple votes. This report focuses on final votes for clarity, with more detailed information available on Congress.gov. Table 1 outlines trade agreements, including signing dates, implementing legislation dates, and TPA legislation used for consideration. Table 2 provides major votes on FTAs, including the final House and Senate votes on FTA implementing legislation. Table 3 provides major votes on U.S. membership to the WTO, including implementing legislation for multilateral agreements and resolutions calling for the United States to withdraw from the WTO. Table 4 provides major votes on TPA legislation, grouped by the trade agreement authority granted to the President. For a list of CRS products on FTAs and TPA, see the Appendix.
