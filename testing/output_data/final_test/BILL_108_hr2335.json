    "content": "The Act titled \"Emergency Targeted Revenue Sharing Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. Findings are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that federal grants to State and local governments have a long history, dating back to before the Constitution. These grants have included land grants for schools and universities, as well as financial grants for various purposes such as highway construction, vocational education, public health, and maternity care. During the Nixon Administration, there was a shift from categorical grants to block grants and general revenue sharing, which provided funds to governments with fewer programmatic requirements. Despite this history of assistance, the Federal Government is not providing. The Federal Government is not providing sufficient aid to States in their current fiscal crisis, with deficits totaling $100 billion. States have been forced to increase taxes and cut funding for essential services like healthcare and education. At least 18 States are planning or considering cuts in spending on education, leading to shortened school years and teacher layoffs. State aid cuts are causing colleges and universities to lay off faculty and raise tuition. Federal spending on the war in Iraq is straining the government's ability to assist States, impacting education, public housing, Medicaid, and other programs. Defense appropriations are growing rapidly, crowding out spending for human needs and threatening homeland security. The Federal Government must help States to avoid further financial crisis. The Federal Government should provide emergency targeted revenue sharing to assist States facing budget cuts in education and other essential services. SEC. 3.
