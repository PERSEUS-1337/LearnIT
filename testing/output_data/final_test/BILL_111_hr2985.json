    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ambassador's Fund for Strategic Exchanges Act of 2009\". Congress finds that the US needs to improve its global image due to low public opinion in many countries. International exchange programs are cost-effective in promoting mutual understanding and advancing national interests. Leaders like Tony Blair and Anwar Sadat have benefited from such exchanges, fostering friendship and openness towards the US. United States exchange programs, like the International Visitors Program, have a significant impact on participants, often changing their anti-American views. The program, organized by the Department of State, targets future leaders from other countries, with positive results. Another key target audience for United States exchanges includes current political, economic, and civil society leaders who have not traveled to the United States before. These leaders, often from less privileged backgrounds, are unable to leave their jobs for a three-week period due to their responsibilities. Some embassies have initiated country-specific exchange programs to cater to this group. Embassy-initiated exchange programs target current leaders who have never traveled to the United States, lasting 5-7 days and bringing together 8-10 participants from a country. These programs have proven effective in impacting leaders in key sectors and advancing US interests such as democratization, human rights, economic reform, poverty alleviation, empowerment of women and girls, and cooperation with the US. Improved cooperation with the United States in confronting threats from organized crime, narco-trafficking, and terrorist groups is facilitated through embassy-initiated exchange programs. These programs promote greater cooperation across sectors, agencies, and regions within a country, as participants share experiences during their trip to the United States. However, the success of these pilot exchanges is limited to a few US embassies worldwide due to the lack of Department-wide guidelines and central funding. The Ambassador's Fund for Strategic Exchanges is established. The Secretary of State establishes the Ambassador's Fund for Strategic Exchanges to bring leaders to the US for short-term visits to advance strategic goals. Each embassy and the Office of International Visitors coordinate these visits for groups of 8-10 participants lasting 5-8 days. The Ambassador's Fund for Strategic Exchanges facilitates short-term visits to the US to advance key strategic goals, such as strengthening democracy, advancing the rule of law, fighting terrorism, reducing poverty, empowering women, and promoting economic reform. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs selects proposals from embassies for these exchange visits competitively. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and US embassies engage in cost-sharing for short-term exchange visits. Funding is authorized from appropriated amounts for the visits, treated similarly to Voluntary Visitor trips. Funding from appropriated amounts is authorized for short-term exchange visits by United States embassies, covering expenses like airfares and pre-departure costs. No restrictions from the Foreign Affairs Manual apply. Restrictions in the Foreign Affairs Manual limit US embassies from paying for airfares of individuals on short-term exchange visits. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary of State to carry out the Act, with an additional $1,500,000 allocated to the International Visitors Program for short-term exchange visits under the Ambassador's Fund for Strategic Exchanges. Administered by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs."
