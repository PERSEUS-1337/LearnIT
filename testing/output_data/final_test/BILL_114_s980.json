    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Defense of Environment and Property Act of 2015\". It pertains to navigable waters. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define navigable waters as waters of the United States, including navigable-in-fact or permanent bodies of water like streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes connected to navigable-in-fact waters, excluding certain types of waters. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define navigable waters as waters of the United States, including navigable-in-fact or permanent bodies of water like streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes connected to navigable-in-fact waters. This definition excludes certain types of waters such as waters that do not physically abut described waters, lack a continuous surface water connection to navigable waters, man-made or natural structures or channels through which water flows intermittently or ephemerally, or wetlands without a continuous surface connection to bodies of water that are waters of the United States. EPA and corps activities are also specified. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act defines navigable waters as waters of the United States, excluding certain types of waters. EPA and Corps activities must not impinge on State authority without explicit authorization. Aggregation of wetlands or waters not described in specific clauses cannot determine Federal jurisdiction. Wetlands described in subparagraph (B)(iii) are not under Federal jurisdiction. Judicial review is available for jurisdictional determinations by the Administrator or the Secretary. If a determination by the Administrator or the Secretary of the Army impacts a State or individual property owner's ability to plan land and water resources development, expedited judicial review can be sought within 30 days in a district court of the United States. Groundwater is considered State water and is not factored into determinations. The provision prohibits the use of a significant nexus test to determine Federal jurisdiction over navigable waters and waters of the United States. It does not affect exemptions under specific sections of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Section 404(f) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the use of a significant nexus test to determine Federal jurisdiction over navigable waters and waters of the United States. SEC. 3. APPLICABILITY OF AGENCY REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE. The regulations and guidance listed shall have no force or effect, including rules from the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency related to the Clean Water Act jurisdiction. The Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency are prohibited from expanding the definition of navigable waters without explicit authorization from Congress. SEC. 4 of the Act clarifies that it does not override a State's authority to regulate its waters or a landowner's obligation to comply with State nuisance laws regarding waters. SEC. 5 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require written consent from property owners for federal representatives to enter private property to collect information about navigable waters. Property owners must be notified of the entry date and have access to the collected data. If consent is given, the landowner has the right to be present during data collection. SEC. 6 states that if a Federal regulation diminishes the value of a property related to navigable waters, the agency must compensate the owner twice the value of the loss. Payment will come from the agency's general operations budget and the regulation will not be enforced until all affected landowners are compensated."
