    "content": "Intelligence Community (IC) spending reveals details about its structure, capabilities, missions, and customers. Program budgets provide resources for intelligence activities such as collection, analysis, and dissemination of information to decisionmakers in national security policy. Customers include the President, National Security Council (NSC), and heads of departments and agencies. The Intelligence Community (IC) categorizes its customers into national/strategic-level and military/tactical-level groups. IC spending is divided into the National Intelligence Program (NIP) for strategic needs and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) for tactical military support. In FY 2016, the total appropriated amount for these programs was disclosed. In FY 2016, the total appropriated amount for the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and Military Intelligence Program (MIP) was $70.7 billion (NIP $53B, MIP $17.7). National/strategic- and military/tactical-intelligence differ in levels of support and focus, ranging from policy objectives to troop-level military operations. National-level strategic intelligence focuses on grand-scale policy objectives, operational intelligence on foreign military situations, and tactical intelligence on detailed planning for military operations at the troop level. The Department of Defense (DOD) integrates intelligence from various sources into national intelligence to support policy processes. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) focuses on defense intelligence for the warfighter, while joint intelligence elements in the DOD provide a coordinated picture for military commanders. The origins of a separate intelligence budget can be traced back to the Nixon Administration, aimed at improving oversight and accountability of the Intelligence Community. The National Intelligence Program (NIP) and Military Intelligence Program (MIP) were formed from three programs, including the National Foreign Intelligence Program. The NIP was created by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which also established the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Funding for military tactical-level intelligence activities was not included in the NIP. The Tactical Intelligence Activities for military were managed separately from the National Intelligence Program as TIARA. In 1994, the Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP) was created for joint defense-wide intelligence programs to improve effectiveness. The term MIP originated in 2005. The MIP was established in 2005 by merging TIARA and JMIP. The line between NIP and MIP can be blurred as many intelligence activities serve both national and tactical purposes. The labels NIP and MIP are not definitive and can change depending on management and justification of the program. The NIP and MIP labels depend on the program's purpose, benefits, and level of urgency. The IC uses the NIP MIP Rules of the Road to determine funding allocation. Programs supporting multiple departments, common IC concerns, SCI, or capabilities are primarily NIP funded. The Secure Compartmented Information Communications (SCI) supports intelligence agencies and Combatant Commands with IT equipment. NIP and MIP funding can be shared based on mutual benefit, with details on IC program funding often classified. The report discusses the debate over disclosing details of the intelligence budget, with proponents of more transparency arguing for accountability while IC leadership warns of national security risks. The NIP and MIP budgets for FY2016 were $53 billion and $17.7 billion respectively, totaling $70.7B, approximately 11% of the national defense budget. There is confusion over whether the NIP or MIP, or both, make up the \"black budget,\" a term without official status. The CRS Report R44381 compares NIP and MIP spending to national defense spending from FY2007 to FY2017. The black budget refers to classified programs, including intelligence programs, with funding figures that are not publicly disclosed. The Intelligence Community (IC) consists of 17 organizations focused on national security, regulated by U.S. Code and E.O. 12333. The DNI's roles and responsibilities are based on the IRTPA of 2004, which charges the DNI with three main roles: head of the IC, principal intelligence advisor to the President, and director of the NIP. Most IC components are housed in separate departments, each with a dual mission to support national and operational-level intelligence activities. NIP programs focus on funding specific intelligence disciplines and agencies. The Intelligence Community (IC) relies on various collection disciplines known as INTs, including Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). Each IC agency contributes unique expertise to the Intelligence Enterprise, with the CIA specializing in all-source national security intelligence and DIA focusing on collecting, producing, and disseminating intelligence. NGA produces and disseminates GEOINT to support commanders, policymakers, and first responders. NRO collects SIGINT and GEOINT through satellites. NSA specializes in cryptology and cyber-related operations. Military service elements provide INT expertise for military operations. Non-DOD departments also contribute to intelligence efforts. The NIP budget includes programs from various intelligence agencies and departments, excluding military operations. It is divided into defense NIP and nondefense NIP for separate management. The NIP budget is divided into defense and nondefense programs, managed separately to fund IC activities. Subordinate programs assist the DNI in integrating intelligence agencies through coordinating budget requirements and mission execution. NIP resources are protected from use by other organizations within their agencies, known as the NIP fence. The NIP budget is protected by the NIP fence within agencies, established as a long-standing tradition. Resources are not to be altered without coordination with the DCI. In contrast, MIP funds are protected but not fenced. The Defense NIP focuses on strategic-level intelligence for military activities and is managed by Program Managers. It is primarily associated with four IC agencies - NSA, DIA, NGA, and NRO - and their capabilities in cryptologic, defense, geospatial, and reconnaissance intelligence. The NIP budget is mainly allocated to five defense NIP subordinate programs, including the Consolidated Cryptologic Program (CCP), General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP), National Geospatial-Intelligence Program (NGP), National Reconnaissance Program (NRP), and Specialized Reconnaissance Program (SRP), which make up about 60% of the total NIP budget. The CCP is overseen by the Director of the NSA. The CCP, overseen by the Director of the NSA, manages funding for SIGINT and IA activities across the IC. NSA's SIGINT mission is limited to gathering information on international terrorists and foreign powers. NSA also plays a role in protecting U.S. intelligence and national security communications for various government agencies. The GDIP program, managed by the Director of DIA, supports national-level defense intelligence activities not covered by other budgets. It includes collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence, such as defense HUMINT and MASINT against foreign targets. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) manages the GDIP program, which focuses on worldwide health threats, foreign medical capabilities, infectious diseases, environmental health risks, biotechnology, and national security. It supports intelligence activities for the DOD, OSD, JCS, and Combatant Commands, including the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS). The DIA Director oversees the Defense Intelligence Resource Program Office (DIRMO) to manage inputs from various sources, including the merger of the FCIP program into the GDIP. The FCIP designation was an accounting tool to track money used solely for counterintelligence purposes. CI can be tracked within the GDIP, but lacking the visibility it had as a separate program, it may have less protection now. The NGP, managed by the Director of NGA, funds national-level GEOINT-related activities throughout the IC, providing three-dimensional maps, charts, and databases. NGA relies on overhead reconnaissance platforms for raw imagery to produce intelligence products like The Globe, a search and discovery system for authoritative GEOINT delivery to analysts monitoring nuclear weapons programs and military activities worldwide. The NGP, managed by the NGA Director, funds commercial imagery for geospatial readiness and responsiveness, supporting air and sea navigation, humanitarian assistance, and sharing GEOINT data across the government and with partners. The NRP, managed by the NRO Director, was established in 1961 to monitor foreign nuclear weapons programs and ongoing military activities worldwide. The NRP, managed by the NRO Director, coordinates U.S. reconnaissance programs, including aerial and space-based operations. It focuses on hardware development and operation of satellites for multi-INT collection, providing various forms of intelligence to the IC. The NRP, managed by the NRO Director, coordinates U.S. reconnaissance programs for multi-INT collection, providing intelligence on military aggression, missile launches, battle damage assessments, high-value individuals, treaty agreements, and disaster relief. The SRP funds special intelligence gathering devices and reconnaissance activities for the IC, with nondefense NIP programs associated with IC elements outside the DOD. Nondefense NIP programs, managed by various IC elements outside the DOD, fund capabilities like human, energy, homeland security, and financial intelligence. These programs compete for IC resources and make up 40% of the total NIP budget. The CIAP, the largest nondefense program, is managed by the Deputy Director CIA and funds the agency's activities independently. Originally focused on intelligence analysis, the CIA now also conducts covert operations. The CIA's most notable activity is covert and clandestine operations, funded by the CIAP. This includes HUMINT, technical intelligence collection, OSINT, counterintelligence outside the US, and research and development. The Reserve for Contingencies, established in 1952, provides funding for unanticipated intelligence activities, including covert actions. The DCIA must notify congressional intelligence committees before transferring funds for covert actions, which cannot be spent on activities denied funding by Congress. The CIARDS is a pension program for certain CIA employees, a form of mandatory spending. Most CIA employees are covered by either CSRS or FERS retirement systems. The ICMA was established in 1992 to support a Community Management Staff created by then-DCI Robert Gates. The IRTPA abolished the position of DCI and created the new position of DNI assisted by an ODNI. The IRTPA abolished the position of DCI and created the new position of DNI assisted by an ODNI. The ODNI absorbed the functions of the old CMS and gained new ones. The CMA continued as the ICMA or CMA within the IC. DOE's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (DOE/IN) provides timely intelligence analyses on nuclear, energy, science, technology, and cyber issues, as well as counterintelligence efforts to protect personnel and facilities from foreign collection efforts. DOE/IN utilizes a reimbursable Intelligence Work Program to leverage the DOE's national laboratories for advanced research in various fields. The program serves non-DOE sponsors like the DOD and IC, with a significant volume of work exceeding IN's budget. Despite some DHS components having robust intelligence organizations, only two NIP funded intelligence elements exist within the DHS. The DHS has operational components with intelligence organizations supporting missions. The NIP funds DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis and some US Coast Guard intelligence activities. The NIP primarily funds intelligence analysis activities. The DHS/I&A manages the NIP Homeland Security program. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) integrates intelligence from various sources to develop homeland security intelligence on threats such as terrorism, border security, human trafficking, and public health. OIA's customers include the U.S. President, border patrol agents, Coast Guard seamen, airport screeners, and local first responders. Initially funded through the NIP, OIA later received separate Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP) funds to support both IC-wide and department-specific missions. The Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP) was established within DHS/OIA to manage intelligence activities serving predominantly DHS missions. The USCG's NIP program is managed by CG-2, focusing on countering illegal smuggling, port safety, counterterrorism, and marine safety. USCG/IN became a formal member of the Intelligence Community in FY2002. The USCG was included as a formal member of the Intelligence Community in FY2002 due to its new capabilities and unique authorities. The definition of national security has expanded to include asymmetric threats such as counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and illegal alien smuggling, in addition to traditional nation-state engagements. USCG intelligence activities are spread across various components, including the investigative service and CI. The USCG's intelligence activities are distributed among various components, including the investigative service, CI service, cryptologic group, cyber program, Intelligence Coordination Center (ICC), and intelligence staffs aligned with regional and field activities. The ICC serves as the liaison between the USCG and other national-level intelligence and law enforcement entities, producing intelligence to support maritime intelligence requirements and managing the collection management process. The FBI is responsible for understanding threats to national security and penetrating networks that pose a threat to the US. The FBI coordinates efforts with its partners to combat national and transnational threats, focusing on terrorist organizations, foreign intelligence services, WMD proliferators, and criminal enterprises. It is the principal investigative arm of the DOJ for counterterrorism operations in the US, with overseas operations coordinated with the CIA. Reforms were made post-9/11 to improve information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The FBI post-9/11 implemented laws and executive orders to enhance counterterrorism efforts, including the IRTPA of 2004. This directed the development of a specialized national intelligence workforce within the FBI. The NIP program funds the NSB, with the CI Division focusing on preventing theft of sensitive information. The Directorate of Intelligence has field offices across the US. The Counterterrorism Division oversees interagency groups to prevent terrorism, while the WMD Division coordinates efforts to prevent chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons use. The Terrorist Screening Center maintains a watch list of known terrorists. The DEA's NIP program funds intelligence activities, with DEA/ONSI being the only IC member. ONSI employs intelligence analysts in U.S. field divisions and offices. The DEA's Office of National Security Intelligence (ONSI) employs intelligence analysts in U.S. field divisions and overseas offices to combat narcotics, terrorism, and protect national security interests. E.O. 12333 directs various departments to collect and analyze intelligence to support missions, including the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) within the State Department. The Assistant Secretary of State Department NIP oversees intelligence activities, funds intelligence analysis, directs research and analysis, ensures intelligence activities align with foreign policy priorities, coordinates intelligence collection and analysis, and facilitates information sharing. The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) handles requests for declassification, access to classified materials, and serves as a reporting channel to intelligence advisory boards. INR produces analysis on various issues for policymakers and operates a 24/7 monitoring center for time-sensitive intelligence. They do not conduct clandestine collection operations. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) within the Department of Treasury manages the NIP program for financial intelligence, funding intelligence analysis activities. The AS/OIA is responsible for coordinating finance intelligence efforts across various focus areas such as terrorist financing and drug trafficking. OIA also provides intelligence support to the IC and the Department of Treasury's regulatory authorities, as well as relevant intelligence to warfighters at the tactical level. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) in the Department of Treasury manages the NIP program for financial intelligence, coordinating finance intelligence efforts across various focus areas. OIA interacts with other IC entities and military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify funding streams for terrorist networks. The AS/OIA and AS/TF report to the Under Secretary of Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (OTFI), whose mission is to safeguard the financial system and combat national security threats. The Senate Intelligence Committee directs the DNI to provide performance assessments for the FIX-ITT initiative. The DNI is directed to provide performance assessments for the FIX-ITT initiative, which aims to integrate financial intelligence activities across IC agencies to combat various threats. The MIP, under the Secretary of Defense, funds activities addressing unique DOD requirements and consists of diverse intelligence assets supporting the Secretary's responsibilities. The MIP, under the Secretary of Defense, funds intelligence and counterintelligence programs to meet warfighters' operational needs. It provides capabilities organic to deployable units across all services and echelons of command, supporting a range of tools from language training to surveillance. Examples include Army's support for detainee operations, Navy's Cobra Judy Replacement radar system, Air Force's Global Hawk unmanned aircraft, and DIA's support to Combatant Commands. The MIP, unlike defense NIP programs, competes for resources within the DOD budget. MIP funds are closely monitored and cannot be reprogrammed without approval. MIP-funded resources are protected by the USD(I) but still subject to DOD budget constraints. MIP-funded personnel and programs can be affected by DOD-wide requirements. For example, during the DOD furlough in 2013, NIP-funded civilian personnel were exempted while MIP-funded personnel were not. Table B-1 briefly describes various MIP programs. The MIP programs are managed separately by Component Managers and funded to support tactical-level intelligence activities. Directors of DIA, NGA, NRO, and NSA oversee NIP and MIP funds, with MIP funds supporting agency activities for tactical-level operations. DIA MIP focuses on supporting COCOMs, including JIOCs and DOD counterintelligence resources, managed by the Director of DIA. NGA MIP funds defense-wide GEOINT activities. The Component Manager oversees NGA MIP funds for defense-wide GEOINT activities, communication, and production system improvements. NRO MIP resources address specific DOD requirements, with the Director of NRO managing the funds. Betty Sapp, the current Director of NRO, highlighted NRO's support to the warfighter in 2015, emphasizing its ability to fuse multi-intelligence data for intelligence needs. The NRO provides key capabilities for military operations, including ISR systems and support for critical missions like countering IEDs and tracking High-Value Targets. The Field Representative program deploys experts to assist combatant commands and improve battlespace awareness. The NRO's strength lies in its ability to fuse multi-intelligence data. The NRO's strength lies in fusing multi-intelligence data to support warfighter intelligence needs, visualizing data patterns, and integrating full motion video data with automated capabilities. OSD MIP funds are managed for planning and oversight of DOD intelligence, CI, and security policy. The OSD MIP funds support special technology programs with DOD-wide applications, including Advanced Sensors Application Program, Foreign Materiel Acquisition and Exploitation Program, and Horizontal Fusion Program. Combatant Commands do not have military forces or equipment directly assigned to them. The U.S. Central Command and other Combatant Commands rely on military departments and defense agencies for forces and equipment. SOCOM, unlike other COCOMs, has its own budget and responsibilities established by Congress in 1987. SOCOM's MIP budget is separate from military services, and NIP funds are requested through Program Managers for review. SOCOM has a joint staff at headquarters level, with the J-2 managing intelligence funds. Tactical-level intelligence resources focus on building organic capabilities and reimbursing support. The SOCOM JIOC is funded through DIA MIP, with special operations forces using various programs for global information flow. Acquisition efforts are prioritized by Admiral McRaven. Commander has directed acquisition efforts to focus on outfitting aircraft with advanced ISR and data storage capabilities. General Votel testified about the reliance on military services for airborne intelligence specialists, creating an increased need for Tactical Systems Operators. This puts a strain on manpower resources for the Air Force and other Services. The military services maintain their own intelligence collection capabilities, focusing on urgent intelligence needs. The Air Force manages resources for globally integrated ISR, electronic warfare, and other intelligence operations. Sustainable funding is crucial for providing enduring capabilities like TSOs. The Air Force manages intelligence collection capabilities for commanders, policymakers, and partners. Five 25th AF wings collect GEOINT, SIGINT, and MASINT using various ISR systems. The RC-135 variants, U-2, MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and RQ-4 Global Hawk are commonly used platforms. The Air Force MIP funds activities at NASIC, analyzing foreign aerospace forces and supporting treaty negotiations. The U.S. Army's intelligence policy, operations, and budget are overseen by the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ODCS/G-2). The Army G-2 coordinates intelligence collection and analysis, including GEOINT, SIGINT, HUMINT, MASINT, and CI. Funding for Army MIP supports activities of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), which includes the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) responsible for collecting and disseminating intelligence on foreign ground force capabilities. NGIC specialists evaluate foreign weapon systems to assess military armament performance and capabilities. The U.S. Army's intelligence operations are overseen by the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ODCS/G-2), which coordinates intelligence collection and analysis. Army Cryptologic Operations (ACO) is responsible for meeting SIGINT collection requirements. Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) have their own MI companies for intelligence production and analysis. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps have their own intelligence policies, operations, and budgets overseen by their respective directors. The Secretary of the Navy (DUSN) for Plans, Policy, Oversight and Integration (PPOI) oversees Navy and USMC MIP projects to ensure adherence to strategy and proper resourcing. The Navy Budget Office ensures proper pricing, budgeting, and execution of MIP projects through Departmental processes, coordinating with BSOs and intelligence staff. Navy MIP funds support maritime intelligence activities. The USMC MIP funds support various aspects of maritime intelligence, including strategic, operational, and tactical plans, foreign naval forces capabilities, technologies, sensors, weapons, cyber operations, and intelligence analysis for irregular forces. It also supports Marine Air-Ground Task Force intelligence units and analysts for battlefield intelligence activities. The NIP funds activities related to intelligence preparation of the battlefield, target analysis, GEOINT, SIGINT, CI, and ISR. Some IC elements receive NIP resources but no MIP resources, while others like DIA, NSA, and NRO have both NIP and MIP funding sources. Additionally, there are other funding streams outside the NIP and MIP, such as the Homeland Security Intelligence Program managed by DHS/OIA. Members of the defense cryptologic community receive additional funds from the Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) for information assurance activities. The DNI has overall responsibility for intelligence support to the President and the day-to-day management of the IC. Both defense and nondefense NIP budgets are determined and controlled by the DNI, from budget development through execution. The Office of the DNI (ODNI), a staff of some 1,500 individuals, works to carry out the DNI's NIP-related responsibilities along with other responsibilities such as those associated with the National Intelligence Council and national intelligence centers. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) replaced the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) position, with the DNI serving as the community manager, principal advisor to the President, and having greater budgetary authorities. The DCI's responsibilities were divided between the Director of the CIA (DCIA) and the DNI, aiming to better integrate the Intelligence Community horizontally and vertically. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) strengthened the Director of National Intelligence's (DNI) budget authorities by giving powers to control spending and participate in the budget process, including developing the National Intelligence Program (NIP) budget and monitoring its implementation. The DNI can also direct how congressionally appropriated funds flow from the Department of the Treasury. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) strengthened the DNI's budget authorities, allowing control over spending and participation in the budget process. This includes directing the flow of funds from the Department of the Treasury to Cabinet-level agencies with IC elements. The DNI has enhanced transfer and reprogramming authority, can allot appropriations directly, and consults with the Secretary of Defense on MIP funds and NIP program budgets. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) strengthened the DNI's budget authorities, allowing control over spending and participation in the budget process. The DNI serves as the exclusive milestone decision authority on major IC acquisitions and coordinates \"services of common concern.\" Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 104 outlines the DNI's roles and responsibilities as program executive of the NIP, including managing NIP appropriations and working with the USD(I) on the MIP. The IRTPA strengthened the DNI's budget authorities, allowing control over spending and participation in the budget process. The MIP is managed by the USD(I) on behalf of the Secretary of Defense, with the position created in 2002 by then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The USD(I) serves as both the USD(I) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Director of Defense Intelligence within the Office of the DNI. The USD(I) serves as the principal advisor on defense intelligence matters to the Secretary of Defense and the DNI. They oversee interagency activities for NIP and MIP integration, with responsibilities including threat perspectives, resource impact forecasts, priority identification, and budget development. The USD(I) oversees defense intelligence matters, provides guidance on NIP and MIP priorities, coordinates with ODNI, and consults with DOD components. They manage the Battlespace Awareness Capability Portfolio to reduce overlap and duplication in DOD-wide assets and activities. The Battlespace Awareness Portfolio includes systems or programs with a secondary mission to provide intelligence. The portfolio manager must consider these programs for potential duplication with MIP programs. Non-intelligence funds associated with the portfolio are classified and not included in the NIP. Defense Intelligence collectively encompasses the defense portion of the National Intelligence Program. The NIP Program Managers oversee intelligence resources and budgets for national-level IC capabilities, consolidating and prioritizing funds across multiple agencies. The same individual may hold various management titles within the IC, such as Program Manager, Component Manager, and IC functional manager. The Program Managers oversee budget and manpower inputs across agencies, guided by ICD 104. MIP Component Managers manage tactical-level intelligence resources in alignment with USD(I) guidance. Their duties include adjusting resources within the MIP, monitoring performance, and serving on the ISR Intelligence Council. IC functional managers handle IC-wide intelligence management. IC functional managers, overseen by the Intelligence Community (IC) Executive Council, are responsible for managing intelligence disciplines such as signals and geospatial intelligence. They develop capability requirements, plans, strategy, doctrine, policy, and directives for the entire intelligence enterprise. Functional managers advise other IC element heads on policies and procedures, assess collection capabilities and gaps, and design technical architectures. For example, the Director of NGA, Robert Cardillo, oversees GEOINT requirements and sensor system performance to meet those needs, focusing on precision targeting in a vast amount of data. IC element heads, like the Directors of NGA or DIA, lead and execute their respective missions. For example, the Director of DIA ensures the organization meets military intelligence requirements. They support Functional Managers by providing information and coordinating activities. National Intelligence Managers serve as advisors on intelligence related to specific countries, regions, or topics. The Director of DIA serves as Program Manager for the GDIP, Component Manager for DIA's MIP resources, Functional Manager for MASINT, and Director of an IC element, focusing on agency-centric issues. They consolidate input, produce budget requests, and manage fund execution in accordance with guidance from relevant authorities. The Director of DIA focuses on agency-centric issues such as the DIA mission, organization, and structure. As the Joint Functional Component Commander for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (JFCC-ISR), they are responsible for global ISR allocation strategic planning. Intelligence programs are managed through separate budget processes within the IC and DOD, with the DNI overseeing the NIP budget and the USD(I) managing the MIP budget. Collaboration between key players in both systems is crucial for integrating NIP and MIP intelligence efforts. The DNI's Chief Financial Officer and USD(I)'s MIP Resource Manager play important roles in the NIP creation process. The NIP Congressional Budget Justification Books (CBJBs) and MIP Congressional Justification Books (CJBs) are crucial documents submitted to congressional committees annually. These classified volumes reflect intelligence priorities outlined in strategy documents like the Quadrennial Defense Review and National Intelligence Strategy. The integration of NIP and MIP budget systems is overseen by the DNI and USD(I)'s MIP Resource Manager. The NIPF and National Intelligence Strategy guide resource decisions within the IC. OMB provides fiscal guidance for budget development, with negotiations at the top-line level. OMB may issue guidance in key areas like counterterrorism and cybersecurity. Budget submissions are reviewed by OMB, ODNI, and USD(I) for guidance. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews budget submissions, provides guidance to the Department of Defense (DOD) and Intelligence Community (IC), and works with agencies to defend their budgets during the legislative process. OMB apportions and reapportions funds, approves agency transfers, and holds mid-year execution reviews with ODNI and OSD. The Director of OMB apportions congressionally appropriated funds at the DNI's exclusive direction. The DNI has the authority to allocate funds to Cabinet-level agencies with IC elements and can withhold funding from agencies that do not comply with priorities. The DNI can also direct appropriations at the sub-Cabinet agency level. Oversight of the IC used to rely on communication among standing committees before the creation of intelligence committees in the 1970s. The HASC and SASC had legislative jurisdiction over intelligence-related activities, with the SSCI and HPSCI established in the 1970s to enhance collaboration and oversight of the Intelligence Community. Their goal was consolidated authority and vigilant legislative oversight to ensure informed and timely intelligence for decision-making. Currently, only specific committees in the House and Senate have the authority to authorize or appropriate funding for Intelligence Community (IC) programs. Other committees like Judiciary, Foreign Affairs/Relations, and Homeland Security focus on drafting intelligence-related legislation. The Judiciary Committees lead intelligence-related legislation on domestic surveillance, including the USA PATRIOT Act. The SSCI and HPSCI have different structures and jurisdictions over intelligence budgets, with HPSCI having exclusive jurisdiction over the NIP budget. The SSCI shares jurisdiction over defense NIP with the SASC. NIP funding is authorized in the annual Intelligence Authorization Act. The SSCI shares jurisdiction over defense NIP with the SASC, while MIP funding is authorized as part of the HASC and SASC's annual NDAA process. The HPSCI participates in the NDAA conference process on MIP-related matters, but the SSCI does not. MIP authorizations are included in the classified Schedule of Authorizations accompanying both the NDAA and IAA. The authorizing legislation passed by the intelligence committees holds power with IC agencies. In 1985, Section 504 of the National Security Act tightened requirements for intelligence agency funds, stating that funds must be specifically authorized by Congress for intelligence activities. The House and Senate intelligence committees receive budget justification books to produce Intelligence Authorization Acts annually. The Annex provides detailed guidance to intelligence agencies, containing budget numbers and committee requirements for classified material. The Schedule of Authorizations is considered public law. The conference process resolves differences between House and Senate versions informally through staff discussions. The House and Senate committee leaders may get involved after initial staff discussions. If productive, informal conversations may lead to a tentative agreement without the need for a formal conference committee. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2016 was part of the \"Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016,\" P.L. 114-113 (Division M), a first in congressional history. Matching authorization and appropriation is referred to as A & A in the IC budget community. The IC budget community refers to matching authorization and appropriation as A & A. Discrepancies between authorized and appropriated amounts may reflect policy disagreements or process separations. The IC has procedures to address discrepancies, such as seeking permission for additional spending or operating at a lower level. If there is no matching authorization, the program may be terminated or not allowed to start. The IC programs discussed in this report equate to approximately $70 billion dollars of national defense spending. Issues affecting IC and DOD leadership's resource utilization are addressed, including IC-wide integration, transparency, and balance. The IPPBE and PPBE processes differ in organization and structure, with the PPBE focusing on program elements and the IPPBE on expenditure centers. The integrated IPPBE/PPBE processes may hinder efficient management of IC programs, as seen in the joint IC/DOD acquisition of a common overhead satellite architecture. Congressional overseers have raised concerns over the years about conflicting requirements between the IC and DOD, leading to challenges in managing overhead program requirements. The report highlights the need for better coordination between DOD and the Intelligence Community for mission-specific requirements. Jointly funded programs in NIP and MIP lead to delayed program starts. Despite recommendations from a 2008 report, issues with acquiring overhead satellite architecture persist. The IAA for FY2016 requires the DNI, Secretary of Defense, and CJCS to develop a strategy for comprehensive interagency review of national security satellite systems. The strategy aims to align commercial systems and partner countries with the National Space Policy. It emphasizes the need for standardized satellite designs to reduce costs and maintain a competitive industrial base. The entire US satellite architecture, including DOD, IC, commercial providers, and foreign partners, should be integrated and not viewed as independent systems. The IC Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE) aims to integrate IT resources across the Intelligence Community to increase efficiency and data storage capabilities. Funding for IC ITE may rely on voluntary contributions rather than DNI budgetary authorities, potentially impacting agency-specific priorities. The IC ITE aims to integrate IT resources across the Intelligence Community, potentially impacting agency-specific priorities. Coordination within DHS for intelligence activities is based on relationships rather than regulations. Total intelligence-related spending is decentralized and difficult to calculate, with NIP and MIP budgets managed separately. IC programs fund only a portion of intelligence activities in the United States. The Intelligence Community (IC) funds only a portion of intelligence activities in the United States. Other intelligence-related programs, such as the ICE Office of Intelligence within DHS, are not part of the IC. State and local entities like the NYPD's Intelligence Division are also not included. There is no comprehensive list of all intelligence-related programs in the U.S. government. The federal government comprises the Domestic Intelligence Enterprise with numerous organizations working on domestic counterterrorism. Calculating the cost of these programs is challenging due to lack of financial tracking, with state and local budgets being the primary source of funding. Congressional oversight is fragmented across multiple committees, with interactions with Intelligence Community officials often occurring in closed sessions. The Intelligence Community (IC) conducts closed sessions for program specifics, with classified transcripts kept by committees. Efforts for financial accountability date back to FY2002, with Senate reports pushing for audits of NRO, NSA, CIA, DIA, and NGA. Declassification for public access remains uncertain. The Senate Intelligence Committee noted that more than ten years after the President's call for action, and more than four years after anticipating auditable statements, the five agencies are still unable to produce auditable financial statements. The current projection for achieving this is at least four years away. The Committee urges the Intelligence Community to ensure its accounts are auditable and establish a business enterprise architecture (BEA) and consolidated financial statement for the National Intelligence Program (NIP). The 2012 auditability timeline is difficult to achieve due to the imperative to construct a BEA, but the Committee supports this work for sustainable financial auditability. The Senate Intelligence Committee has been urging the Intelligence Community to establish a business enterprise architecture (BEA) and a consolidated financial statement for the National Intelligence Program (NIP). The Committee has called for a BEA over the last four years and believes that a consolidated financial statement would provide valuable data on financial trends within the Intelligence Community. The current status of agencies meeting the requirement for full financial audits starting from FY2014 is unclear, and Congress must balance resources to address this issue. In a worldwide threats briefing to Congress, DNI James Clapper listed national security issues facing the United States, including violent extremists, migration, cyber threats, terrorism, and nuclear programs of China and Russia. Congress must balance resources between these priorities, but the allocation of resources within the Intelligence Community is unknown. The NIP budget funds intelligence capabilities to support national priorities, with DNI Clapper prioritizing and balancing resources among competing demands within the Intelligence Community. Maintaining a balance is crucial due to limited resources allocated by Congress each year. The Intelligence Community must maintain balance in allocating limited resources among competing demands, as there are no extra resources available. The Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS) and Community Management Account (ICMA) are unique programs within the IC, funded by Congress and openly discussed in congressional reports. The CIA operates retirement systems for its employees, including the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), and CIA Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS). CIARDS costs are based on the number of eligible recipients, not mission requirements, with all retirement benefits administered by the CIA to protect employee information. The CIA operates retirement systems including CSRS, FERS, and CIARDS. CIARDS is for pre-1984 CIA employees, while FERS covers those hired after 1983. Special categories were created for CIARDS-like retirement under the FERS Act. The Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 (CIARA) created CIARDS for certain CIA employees to provide retirement benefits similar to those for federal law enforcement officers. CIARDS was established to address the needs of CIA employees who were less likely to qualify for CSRS retirement benefits. This aimed to create equity with existing retirement systems for law enforcement professionals and Foreign Service officers. The Agency found that some employees serving abroad may not meet the requirements to retire under the civil service system, so a special retirement system, similar to those for FBI personnel and Foreign Service officers, was needed. Discussions on CIARDS began in 1973 to provide retirement benefits for CIA employees. CIARA was established to provide retirement benefits for CIA employees involved in U.S. intelligence operations abroad who may not meet civil service retirement requirements. It was created due to the unique nature of CIA work, where individuals could burn out or have their cover removed at an early age. The program also served as an incentive for employees serving overseas. The CIARDS program was established to provide retirement benefits for CIA employees involved in U.S. intelligence operations abroad. Eligibility required completion of at least 15 years of qualifying service, including hazardous or specialized duties. The program was updated in 1992 to incorporate changes made between 1964 and 1992. The 1992 update to the CIARDS program allowed CIA employees with 5 years of qualifying service to be eligible for retirement. Employees can retire at age 50 with 20 years of service or at any age with 25 years of service. Contributions to the CIARDS Fund include a required employee contribution of 7% of pay, offset by Social Security for some individuals. The agency also contributes 7.0% of pay for most participants, managed by the DCIA in the U.S. Treasury. The DCIA manages the CIARDS Fund in the U.S. Treasury, with required employee and agency contributions not covering the normal cost of benefit payments. Actuarial calculations are used to estimate annual appropriations needed to meet the CIARDS' costs and unfunded liability. Additional appropriations are necessary to finance benefit payments and reduce the unfunded liability to maintain solvency. The appropriated payment of funds to CIARDS is set out as an entitlement under 50 U.S.C. \u00a72091(d) & (e). The CIARDS funding, established in 1976, is an entitlement under 50 U.S.C. \u00a72091(d) & (e) and has been part of annual appropriations acts since Fiscal Year 1977. The appropriated payment of funds to finance CIARDS includes amounts to pay down unfunded liabilities and meet pension payments. The ICMA replaced an account used to support the DCI's Intelligence Community Staff (ICS) from 1972 through 1992. It was established in 1992 to support a Community Management Staff (CMS) created by then-DCI Robert Gates. The ICMA was created to coordinate cross-program activities, improve budget oversight, and strengthen community management. The DCI's CMS was abolished, and a new position of DNI assisted by an ODNI was created. The ODNI absorbed old CMS functions and gained new ones. The ICMA funds expenditures for the ODNI's organizational elements. The ICS was created in response to a directive from President Nixon to DCI Helms to oversee intelligence activities and produce national intelligence. The Intelligence Community Staff (ICS) was established in response to a directive from President Nixon to DCI Helms to oversee intelligence activities and produce national intelligence. The ICS was renamed and expanded in 1972, formalizing its authority. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) authorized funds for the ICS in 1978 to support the Director of Central Intelligence in managing the resources of the Intelligence Community. The Intelligence Community Staff requested $10.5 million and 196 personnel in fiscal year 1978 to support the Director of Central Intelligence in managing the intelligence community. This includes developing national intelligence requirements, assessing performance, improving planning, and monitoring resources. The IC Staff was later replaced by the Community Management Staff in 1992. The end of the Cold War led to reforms in the intelligence community. The Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) report highlighted the need for centralized management authority in the Intelligence Community (IC). Then-DCI Robert Gates commissioned task forces to review IC operations and recommended the creation of the Community Management Staff (CMS) to strengthen coordination, identify trade-offs, reduce duplication, evaluate investments, find efficiencies, manage intelligence requirements, and evaluate performance in satisfying policymaker needs. The CMS was established to address these issues. The new Community Management Staff (CMS) was established to address the need for centralized management authority in the Intelligence Community (IC). It was headed by an executive director for IC affairs and staffed by employees from across the IC, including an open source coordinator. The IAA for FY1993 endorsed DCI Gates's management decision by recognizing the CMS. Section 104 of SSCI Report 102-324 authorizes appropriations and personnel levels for the Community Management Staff of the Director of Central Intelligence for fiscal year 1993. The Intelligence Community Staff was abolished by the DCI, and its functions were dispersed to other elements within the Intelligence Community. The IRTPA of 2004 created the position of DNI and ODNI, which absorbed the functions of the old CMS and gained new ones. The ICMA now funds the staffs of the DNI. The ICMA now funds the staffs of the DNI, PDDNI, Deputy and Associate DNIs, and all activities associated with the ODNI's mission and support activities. This includes offices responsible for providing intelligence, CI, analysis, research, development, and training. Some larger MSAs include CTIIC, NCTC, NCPC, NCSC, NIU, IARPA, and NIC. ODNI offices focus on acquisition, budget, human capital, policy, strategy, and resource analysis. Oversight offices like General Counsel and Inspector. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) was integrated into the Intelligence Community (IC) without a separate Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP). The OIA serves a diverse customer base within the IC, including the Secretary, DHS policymakers, state and local officials, and private sector partners with varying information classification requirements. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) argued for separate NIP and HSIP funds to support DNI and DHS requirements. The congressional intelligence committees established the HSIP within DHS/OIA for department-specific missions, such as cyber support and governance activities. The Senate Intelligence Committee supported funding OIA through NIP and a new HSIP but maintained jurisdiction over HSIP. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) advocated for separate NIP and HSIP funds to support DNI and DHS needs. The congressional intelligence committees established the HSIP within DHS/OIA for department-specific missions. The Senate Intelligence Committee supported funding OIA through NIP and a new HSIP but is still considering whether other intelligence activities should be included in the HSIP. The Committee plans to oversee and authorize the HSIP. The IAA for FY2015 requires DHS/I&A to report on each intelligence activity, including funding, full-time employees, and contractors. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report on consolidating planning, programming, and resourcing within the HSIP. The HSIP budget was established to fund intelligence activities supporting DHS missions separately from the NIP. However, it has only been used to supplement the budget for the office of Intelligence and Analysis, not for non-IC components conducting intelligence-related activities within DHS. This lack of comprehensive reporting to Congress hinders understanding of the resources and personnel needed for the Department's intelligence activities. The NIP budget funds national-level IC-wide roles within DHS, but not department-specific activities. ICE's Office of Intelligence, for example, receives no funds from the NIP budget. The Secretary of Homeland Security manages intelligence-related budgets outside the NIP, including department-specific activities and non-IC components. Other department secretaries also oversee intelligence activities within their departments, not the DNI. Coordination and oversight of these activities outside the NIP or MIP are unclear. Activities outside the NIP or MIP are managed daily."
