Questions arise about the civil liability of volunteer health professionals who provide medical services in disaster areas. This report discusses federal and state laws that protect volunteers, including VHPs, focusing on midwestern states and the Gulf region. The report discusses laws that protect volunteer health professionals (VHPs) in disaster areas, focusing on midwestern states and the Gulf region. Liability protections shield volunteers from civil liability for negligent conduct, but not for willful or grossly negligent conduct. The Volunteer Protection Act (VPA) provides immunity for ordinary volunteers at both federal and state levels. The Volunteer Protection Act (VPA) passed in 1997 provides immunity for ordinary negligence to volunteers of nonprofit organizations or governmental entities as long as certain conditions are met. The act does not prevent civil action against volunteers or shield entities from liability for volunteer actions. It also preempts state standards that offer less protection. On the state level, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have their own volunteer protection statutes that offer varying degrees of liability protection. These state laws are not overridden by federal law as long as they provide greater liability protections. States like Mississippi and Texas provide broad civil liability protection to volunteers, with exceptions for intentional or grossly negligent conduct. Some states have specific laws for volunteer health professionals. Statutory provisions for volunteer health professionals provide immunity from civil liability, not dependent on emergencies. Texas law shields VHPs from liability if certain conditions are met, such as obtaining a written statement from the patient acknowledging the volunteer's non-compensated care. Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Alabama have statutes that protect volunteer health professionals (VHPs) from civil liability under certain conditions. Oklahoma's law applies to licensed VHPs who receive no compensation and have the patient sign a consent form. Mississippi extends liability protection to licensed medical personnel and those with special volunteer licenses. Alabama provides protection to VHPs offering limited medical services at established free clinics. Under Alabama's statute, VHPs can be licensed in any state to receive protection. Louisiana's statute protecting licensed VHPs at nonprofit medical clinics may not specify if the protection extends to out-of-state licensees. Every state and the District of Columbia has a \"Good Samaritan\" statute that lowers the standard of care for individuals providing emergency assistance. These statutes were initially meant to protect doctors providing emergency aid without a duty to do so. Good Samaritan statutes vary in their scope and coverage. To be eligible for immunity, volunteers must act in good faith without expecting compensation. Some statutes protect only licensed medical personnel, while others extend to bystanders providing emergency assistance. States like Illinois, Alabama, and Louisiana have laws offering varying degrees of protection to medically related personnel. Illinois, Alabama, and Louisiana have Good Samaritan laws that offer varying degrees of protection to medical personnel providing emergency care. Louisiana's statute specifically protects licensed medical personnel at the scene of an emergency. In Louisiana, personnel licensed in another state are not protected under the Good Samaritan statute, but they cannot be prosecuted for practicing without a license if they offer free assistance in an emergency. Iowa's Good Samaritan law protects all individuals who provide emergency care unless their actions are reckless or willful. There is debate on the extent of coverage and actions covered by Good Samaritan laws, as seen in the Van Horn v. Watson case in California. The Van Horn case in California involved a car accident where a passenger pulled the plaintiff out of a car, leaving her paraplegic. The defendant, Torti, was sued for negligence but was not granted immunity under the Good Samaritan provision as she was not providing emergency medical care. California lawmakers later amended the provision to offer more legal liability protections to those who render emergency care. Federal and state governments have sovereign immunity from suit unless waived. The Federal Tort Claims Act waives government immunity for tort liability, allowing government employees to be held liable for torts. One way to shield volunteers from civil liability during emergencies is to declare them non-paid employees of the government. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act allows the Secretary of HHS to appoint volunteers for intermittent service. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act allows the Secretary of HHS to appoint volunteers for intermittent service as part of the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), providing immunity from civil liability similar to Public Health Service employees. Emergency declarations at federal and state levels determine the extent of deployment, utilization, and liability protection for volunteers. Kansas and Alabama have statutes that provide liability protections for state government employees, agents, and volunteers during declared emergencies. Mississippi's statute, on the other hand, only protects state government employees and agents. Some states have statutes that provide civil liability protection to state government employees and agents during declared emergencies. Public health emergency statutes also offer varying degrees of coverage, including liability protection for medical personnel and volunteers. For example, Florida extends liability protections to all volunteers who respond to a public health emergency, while Louisiana's statute limits civil liability for health care providers during a state of public health emergency. In emergencies, governors can grant liability protections to volunteers, as seen in Louisiana where Governor Blanco suspended licensure requirements for medical volunteers during a public health emergency. Emergency mutual aid agreements can be made within states, with neighboring political subdivisions, or internationally with Canadian provinces through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). The Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) provides a structured way for states to request aid from each other during disasters. All 50 states, along with the District of Columbia and other territories, have agreed to EMAC terms. It addresses liability concerns and allows for seamless aid flow between states. Individuals rendering aid are protected from liability for acts done in good faith. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) allows for reciprocity agreements for individuals providing assistance across states. Those with licenses or permits can practice their skills in the requesting state, subject to limitations. However, verification of out-of-state licenses can be challenging during emergencies. The ESAR-VHP program, established after the 2001 terrorist attacks, helps states set up volunteer registration systems for health emergencies. It verifies volunteer credentials in advance to quickly deploy them in local, state, and federal responses."
