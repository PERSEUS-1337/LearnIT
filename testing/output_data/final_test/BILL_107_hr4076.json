    "content": "The \"Agua Fria National Monument Technical Corrections Act of 2002\" includes sections on definitions, boundary modifications, administration of the monument, effects on existing land uses, grazing, land acquisition, water rights, and use of Presidential authority. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Monument - Agua Fria National Monument established by Presidential Proclamation 7263 of January 11, 2000.\n(2) Secretary - Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management.\n(3) Advisory committee - Agua Fria National Monument Advisory Committee established under section 4.\n(4) State - State of Arizona.\n\nSEC. 3. BOUNDARY MODIFICATIONS. SEC. 3. BOUNDARY MODIFICATIONS. The Secretary will remove specific parcels of land from the Monument and adjust the western boundary to be at least 400 feet east of the existing State Department of Transportation right-of-way. The management authority for the Monument is under the Bureau of Land Management, with prohibitions on using other agencies. The Secretary must review the interim management policy. The Secretary must review the interim management policy for the Monument, dated October 1, 2001, to ensure consistency with the Act. Within two years, a comprehensive long-range management plan must be developed with public participation. An advisory committee named the \"Agua Fria National Monument Advisory Committee\" will advise the Secretary. The advisory committee, \"Agua Fria National Monument Advisory Committee,\" will advise the Secretary on the preparation and implementation of the management plan. It consists of eight members appointed by the Secretary, including representatives from the Governor of the State, State Game and Fish Commission, recognized archaeologist, and Yavapai County, Arizona. The Agua Fria National Monument Advisory Committee, appointed by the Secretary, consists of eight members representing various entities. Members include those with grazing permits, backgrounds in wildlife conservation, appointed by the Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona, representing recreational users, and terms are for three years. The Agua Fria National Monument Advisory Committee consists of eight members appointed by the Secretary, with terms lasting three years. Two members are appointed for one-year terms, and three members are appointed for two-year terms. SEC. 5. EFFECT ON EXISTING AND HISTORICAL USES OF FEDERAL LANDS INCLUDED IN MONUMENT. (a) Recognition of Existing Uses.--The Monument designation does not change current authorized land uses. The Secretary considers a land use authorized if it was in place as of January 1, 2000.\n(b) Hunting, Trapping, and Fishing.--Hunting, trapping, and fishing are allowed in the Monument following State laws and consultation with State agencies. The Monument does not affect Arizona's jurisdiction over fish and wildlife management.\n(c) Motorized Vehicles.--Motorized vehicles are permitted on designated roads and trails within the Monument, with off-road use prohibited. The Monument prohibits off-road motorized vehicle use, except for authorized purposes. Nonmotorized wheeled game carriers are allowed for big game removal. The designation does not impact maintenance or access to rights-of-way and easements within the Monument. SEC. 6. EFFECT ON GRAZING. Congress finds that livestock grazing is a historic and traditional use of the Federal lands in the Monument, and it is compatible with the Monument's purposes. The Secretary is required to permit grazing in accordance with all applicable laws. The authorized grazing levels in the Monument will remain unchanged, and the establishment of the Monument will not impact grazing lease holders' ability to maintain and develop the land. Designees and successors in interest are allowed to maintain, develop, and construct necessary structures within their grazing allotments. The Secretary can acquire land within the Monument through donation, purchase, or exchange. The Act does not establish new water rights for the United States. Presidential authority to expand the Monument is not affected. The designation of the Monument by Presidential Proclamation 7263 and this Act prevents the President from using the Antiquities Act to expand its boundaries. A study will be conducted within a year to recommend any boundary changes that would enhance protection of archaeological resources. During a 90-day period, the President may adjust the boundaries of the Monument based on study recommendations, with the total size not exceeding 88,000 acres. This allows for expanded opportunities for public education and scientific research on archaeological resources within the Monument and adjacent lands."
