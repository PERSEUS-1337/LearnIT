    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Conscience Protection Act of 2016\" and includes findings. Congress finds that Thomas Jefferson emphasized the importance of protecting the rights of conscience in the Constitution. The Supreme Court in 1973 ruled that the abortion decision should be left to the pregnant woman's physician, respecting the physician's right to abstain from participating in abortion procedures. State laws also support this policy. The U.S. has enacted laws to protect the right of conscience in healthcare, including the Church, Coats/Snowe, and Hyde/Weldon amendments. However, these laws do not explicitly provide a private right of action for victims of discrimination to defend their conscience rights in court. Enforcement by the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights has been lacking, allowing cases to remain unresolved for years. California has defied the Federal Hyde/Weldon amendment. California's Department of Managed Health Care mandates coverage for all elective abortions in health plans, defying the Federal Hyde/Weldon amendment. Congress questions Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell about California's violation, which began in August 2014. The Department of Health and Human Services acknowledges the violations and is taking them seriously. Other states like New York and Washington are also considering similar actions. The Department of Managed Health Care in California is defying the Federal Hyde/Weldon amendment by mandating coverage for all elective abortions in health plans. Despite complaints, the Department has not resolved the issue. Most medical professionals, including 86% of ob/gyns, do not perform abortions, which could disrupt the healthcare system if all providers were required to participate. The decision not to fund most abortions by Congress does not create new barriers but allows individuals to act freely. This protection does not conflict with other Federal laws, such as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. Reaffirming Federal policy on conscience rights ensures that longstanding laws are upheld. SEC. 245A prohibits governmental discrimination against healthcare providers not involved in abortion. SEC. 245A prohibits penalizing healthcare providers for not participating in abortion-related activities. Benefits coverage for abortion is protected under this section, which also prevents accrediting agencies or government entities from imposing specific competency standards or contractual obligations related to abortion. This section does not impact the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act or supersede state laws regulating insurance. The Secretary is responsible for administration. The Secretary designates the Director of the Office for Civil Rights to receive and investigate complaints of violations related to federal financial assistance for health care services. Definitions for \"Federal financial assistance\" and \"health care provider\" are provided in this section. The term 'health care provider' includes individual physicians, health professionals, hospitals, health care facilities, provider-sponsored organizations, social services providers, and programs of training in the health professions. The term 'health care provider' includes various professionals and organizations in the health care industry. The term 'State or local government that receives Federal financial assistance' encompasses all agencies and units of government that receive such funding. \"SEC. 245B. CIVIL ACTION FOR CERTAIN VIOLATIONS.\" \"A qualified party can seek relief in a civil action for a designated violation, which includes violations of specific sections of the Act or objections to abortion. Administrative remedies are not required for actions under this section.\" In civil actions for designated violations, relief can be granted without needing to exhaust administrative remedies. Actions under this section can include governmental entities as defendants, with relief potentially including money damages. The court must grant relief in such actions. In civil actions for designated violations, the court shall grant necessary relief, including declaratory relief, compensatory damages, and attorneys' fees to prevent or compensate for losses resulting from the violation."
