The \"Creating Jobs From Innovative Small Businesses Act of 2015\" introduces a research-intensive investment tax credit for small technology innovation companies. The tax credit is 20% of the amount paid by the taxpayer to acquire a qualified equity investment in a qualified research-intensive small business concern, with a maximum credit of $100,000 per year. Related parties are treated as one person for credit calculation purposes. The dollar amount in paragraph (1)(A) is allocated among persons under regulations by the Secretary. Related persons are those whose relationship would disallow losses under specific sections. Definitions include a qualified equity investment as an equity investment acquired at original issue solely for cash. The term 'equity investment' includes stock in a corporation and capital interest in a partnership. A rule similar to section 1202(c)(3) applies for redemptions. A 'qualified research intensive small business concern' is defined as a small business with significant research activities. The term 'equity investment' includes stock in a corporation and capital interest in a partnership. A 'qualified research intensive small business concern' is defined as a small business with significant research activities. A concern is considered a small business if it employs fewer than 500 employees and at least 50% of its expenditures are for research or experimental activities. There is a national limitation on research intensive investment tax credits, with specific amounts allocated for different calendar years. The limitation on research intensive investment tax credits is allocated among qualified small businesses by the Secretary. Any excess limitation in one year can be carried over to the next year. Individuals who are employees of the small business concern are not eligible for the tax credit. The basis of qualified equity investment is reduced by the credit amount determined under this section. Regulations will be prescribed to prevent abuse, impose reporting requirements, and apply provisions to newly formed entities. The credit is part of the general business credit under section 38 of the Code. The current year business credit under section 38 of the Code is amended to include the research intensive investment tax credit determined under section 45S. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The research intensive investment tax credit under section 45S applies to investments made after December 31, 2014, in taxable years ending after that date."
