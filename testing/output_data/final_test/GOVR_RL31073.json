    "content": "Congress established a statutory formula in the Clean Water Act (CWA) in 1972 for distributing financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment. The formula has been modified five times since then, with Congress appropriating over $91 billion for wastewater treatment projects. The formula now applies to federal capitalization grants for clean water State Revolving Loan Funds (SRFs). The state-by-state allotment for clean water State Revolving Loan Funds (SRFs) is based on state population and \"need,\" which refers to capital costs for wastewater projects. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has conducted clean water needs surveys since the 1960s to inform policymakers about funding needs. Congress has regularly addressed funding for water infrastructure projects, with amendments made in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA, P.L. 113-121) requested EPA to review the state-by-state allotment formula for clean water State Revolving Loan Funds (SRFs) due to changes in needs and population. Congress has made changes to the formula since 1972, with differences in preferences for population and needs-based factors. The House advocated a needs-based approach for grants distribution, while the Senate favored needs over categorical eligibilities. There have been gradual increases in restrictions on wastewater treatment projects eligible for federal assistance, with a focus on not funding high-cost projects. The House and Senate have differing views on grant distribution, with a focus on needs-based approach and categorical eligibilities. Restrictions on wastewater treatment projects eligible for federal assistance have increased gradually, particularly avoiding funding high-cost projects. The 2014 CWA amendments expanded project categories eligible for SRF funding, including stormwater management and decentralized wastewater treatment systems. The allocation formula components since 1972 are complex, with factors like \"hold harmless\" and \"minimum share\" provisions. \"Total needs\" refer to all project funding needs, while \"partial needs\" focus on specific project categories. Before the 1972 FWPCA, federal aid for municipal wastewater treatment was limited. The federal government previously provided limited aid for constructing municipal wastewater treatment plants, with assistance allocated based on population. Prior to 1968, there was no systematic process for estimating and reporting funding needs for sewage treatment, leading to inconsistent surveys that mainly focused on larger municipalities. The federal government conducted a funding needs survey in 1968 in response to the Clean Water Restoration Act. The survey reported state and national total needs but did not estimate needs for specific waste treatment projects. Congress changed the reporting requirement to biennial in 1974 and provided a needs-based formula for state allocations in fiscal years 1973 and 1974. Despite the limitations of previous surveys, they were used to guide Congress in the 1972 legislation. The 1972 legislation moved away from population-based grants distribution to a needs basis, despite limited needs information. The rationale for this change was explained in the House Public Works Committee's report. The needs formula was considered a sound basis for allocating funds, as there was no necessary correlation between financial assistance needed for waste treatment works and a state's population. The Committee acknowledged the lack of a satisfactory estimate of total funds required for construction of treatment works. The 1972 legislation shifted from population-based grants to a needs basis for distributing funds for treatment works construction. The 1972 Needs Survey report was used to determine state allotments for fiscal years 1973 and 1974. The Senate preferred population as the basis for grants allocation, with little indication of considering alternative approaches. The 1972 FWPCA incorporated a formula based on the survey for grants distribution, covering reported needs in all states and territories. Some restrictions were placed on using federal funds for new collector sewers. The 1972 legislation shifted to a needs-based approach for distributing funds for treatment works construction. Eligibility for funds was limited to existing communities with sufficient treatment plant capacity. EPA prepared a new needs survey in response to the statutory directive. The 1973 Needs Survey was the first to evaluate needs for waste treatment projects, reporting costs for various categories like secondary treatment, sewer rehabilitation, and new collector sewers. The original categorization was later refined to include more specific subcategories. The needs surveys for wastewater treatment and collection system projects have shown fluctuations in estimated costs over the years, ranging from $63 billion in 1973 to $67 billion in 2000. In addition to addressing point source pollution, states have also assessed needs for projects targeting nonpoint pollution sources like agriculture and urban runoff, totaling an additional $14 billion in the 2000 survey. In December 1973, Congress enacted P.L. 93-243, Waste Treatment Fund Allocations, based on EPA's November 1973 Needs Survey. The formula split the difference between total needs and partial needs for various project categories, aiming to keep federal allotments high. The formula for Waste Treatment Fund Allocations in P.L. 93-243 was more stringent than secondary treatment, including a hold harmless provision. It focused on costs for treatment works to achieve secondary treatment, treatment more stringent than secondary, and eligible new interceptor sewers, force mains, and pumping stations. EPA recommended these categories to comply with the Clean Water Act's water quality objectives. EPA found data for other categories to be limited and less reliable. In the 1973 survey, EPA reported nationwide needs of $60.1 billion, with underestimations due to underreporting of CSO needs and incomplete state reporting. The Senate Committee on Public Works found EPA's recommendations would create inequities among states, proposing a distribution formula based on partial needs and 1972 population. The House committee recommended a formula for allocating grant funds to states based on partial needs and 1972 population. The Environmental Protection Agency proposed two tables for allocation, one based on all state needs and the other based on only part of the needs. Testimony from states showed differing impacts under each table. The committee decided to allocate funds based on states' needs, with each state receiving no less than its 1972 allocation. The formula applied for FY1975 and FY1976, benefiting all states in the long run. In 1977, Congress modified the allocation formula for appropriations. The EPA was required to conduct a new comprehensive needs survey by September 1974, including additional categories. The 1974 survey recommended focusing on categories I, II, and IVB due to poor data quality in previous surveys. The EPA Administrator expressed concerns about the poor quality of previous surveys, leading to an inequitable allocation formula for construction grant funds. Refining cost estimates for different categories was challenging due to variations in state approaches. The differences in reported cost estimates for wastewater treatment facilities raised doubts about basing federal fund allocation on current \"needs\" reports. Congress agreed to limit the use of \"total needs\" in the allotment formula. The Talmadge-Nunn Act authorized funds for public works programs, including wastewater treatment construction, to address unemployment. The legislation reintroduced a population factor in the allocation formula, distributing $480 million in FY1977 construction grants to 33 states and 4 territories. The Talmadge-Nunn Act allocated $480 million in FY1977 construction grants to 33 states and 4 territories. The distribution was based on a formula that included partial needs from a 1974 survey and projected population for 1990. Another portion of funds in FY1977, totaling $1 billion, was governed by a different formula outlined in the FY1977 supplemental appropriations act. The 1977 Clean Water Act amendments introduced a new allocation formula based on total needs, partial needs, and population percentages. This formula was extended to 1982 and detailed in a House Public Works and Transportation Committee report. The 1977 Clean Water Act introduced a new allocation formula based on needs surveys and population data. The House version used data from EPA's 1974 needs survey and 1990 estimated population, while the Senate version used 1975 population and 1976 survey data. The final formula combined elements from both versions to ensure fair distribution of funds among states. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act introduced a new allocation formula based on needs surveys and population data. The conferees made changes to the House bill, but it is unclear which population year or needs survey was used in the final allocation formula. The amendments also included the first explicit restrictions on categories eligible for federal grant assistance, such as prohibiting the use of federal funds for projects to control pollutant discharges from separate storm sewer systems. The concerns in category VI of the EPA needs survey were fiscal and environmental, with estimated costs of $235 billion. Federal funds were to be used for critical facilities to reduce pollutant discharges. Controlling stormwater is costly, and the Federal budget limits funding for such projects. Water quality benefits of stormwater control have not been adequately evaluated. Restrictions on sewer systems were not included in the 1977 amendments. The 1977 amendments did not include rehabilitation of existing collectors. The 1981 P.L. 97-117 extended construction grant funds distribution formula through 1986 with eligibility restrictions. The House bill proposed to extend the formula through FY1982 only. The Senate adopted a new formula based on 1980 population and backlog needs for certain categories. The 1981 P.L. 97-117 extended construction grant funds distribution formula through 1986 with eligibility restrictions, incorporating backlog needs for categories I, II, and IVB from the 1980 needs survey. The Senate formula focused on 1980 population and backlog needs, with EPA directed to conduct a new needs survey emphasizing public health and water quality needs for allocation starting in FY1985. The legislation used a combination of House and Senate formulas for 1983-1985. The House and Senate formulas for 1984 included 1980 population, backlog partial needs for specific categories, and a hold harmless provision. Congress extended this formula through 1986 due to delays in reauthorization. The 1981 legislation imposed eligibility restrictions to prioritize funding for areas with the greatest water quality benefit. The 1981 legislation imposed eligibility restrictions to prioritize funding for areas with the greatest water quality benefit, focusing on treatment facilities and interceptor sewers. The Reagan Administration proposed program changes to address budgetary constraints and shift funding responsibilities to local levels. The 1981 amendments prioritized funding for water quality benefits, focusing on treatment facilities and interceptor sewers. Infiltration and inflow projects remained eligible to reduce the need for additional sewage treatment plant capacity. Other categories like new collector sewers and sewer rehabilitation were generally ineligible for federal grants, but governors could allocate up to 20% of their annual allotment for such projects. The legislation continued the prohibition on using federal funds for separate storm sewer projects and recommended eliminating eligibility for reserve capacity to meet future population growth. The 1987 amendments to the legislation maintained the allocation formula established in 1981, with no major changes to project eligibility. The federal share for eligible projects was reduced from 75% to 55% to accommodate more projects with limited federal funds. The prohibition on federal funding for separate storm sewers was also upheld. The 1987 amendments to the legislation focused on establishing state revolving funds as the new funding mechanism, replacing the construction grants program. Congress directed that the new SRF program would be governed by the act's allotment formula, which also applied to construction grants during the transition in 1991. The final allocation formula for distributing funds was not clearly outlined in the legislative history. The Senate proposed a new formula for fiscal years 1987 through 1990 based on needs for specific categories, with a slight population factor for small states. The Senate-reported bill included an 80% hold harmless provision for 11 large states to address changes in eligibility. The formula adopted by the Senate applied full changes in the last three years of reauthorization, with a modified version for the first two years giving large states an 85% hold harmless. The formula was needs-based and merged with the House formula. Since 1987, Congress has considered legislation to modify the allotment formula for water infrastructure financing programs. The House and Senate committees have approved bills to reauthorize these programs, including a revised allocation formula. However, no legislation has been enacted to address allotment formula issues. Bills such as H.R. 1262 and S. 1005 aimed to revise the current allotment for clean water SRF monies, but have not progressed further. The House and Senate proposed bills to revise the allotment formula for clean water SRF monies. The House bill would extend the current formula for two years and then switch to a hybrid approach based on funding needs. The Senate bill suggested a new state-by-state allotment based on the 2004 needs survey, with adjustments like guaranteeing small states a minimum share. In 1996, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to establish a drinking water state revolving loan fund program. The program allocates grants based on each state's needs identified in a national survey, rather than a statutory formula used for clean water SRF funds. Congress has also provided additional assistance through grants in EPA appropriations acts. Congress has provided additional assistance through grants earmarked in EPA appropriations acts for specific communities, both small and large. For example, in FY2010, Congress appropriated $2.1 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $1.4 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, and $187 million in earmarked grants for projects in designated communities. Since FY1989, Congress has allocated $7.5 billion for special project grants. Although a moratorium was imposed on earmarking in FY2011, it could be restored in the future. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 directed EPA to assess the current allotment formula for water quality needs. The EPA report, completed in May 2016, found that the formula does not adequately reflect reported water quality needs or current population for most states. The report suggests various options for updating the allocation formula based on needs survey data, population data, and other elements. The EPA report recommends updating the allocation formula for water quality needs based on survey data, population data, and other factors. The CWA amendments in WRRDA 2014 expanded eligible project categories under the SRF program without changing the state-by-state allotment formula. The EPA report recommends updating the allocation formula for water quality needs based on survey data, population data, and other factors. The CWA amendments in WRRDA 2014 expanded eligible project categories under the SRF program to include decentralized wastewater treatment projects, water conservation measures, watershed projects, and assistance to small and medium wastewater treatment facilities. These new categories aim to benefit water quality protection and improvement. Expanding the scope of eligibility for Clean Water Act assistance through the State Revolving Fund (SRF) program could dilute its historic focus, despite the increasing needs for core projects like wastewater treatment facilities and sewers. EPA and states have conducted multiple needs surveys and updated population data to assess water quality project needs, with total needs fluctuating over time. The recent needs surveys have shown changes in total needs for water quality projects, including traditional wastewater categories and newer categories like stormwater management. Crafting an allotment formula for Clean Water Act funding has been a contentious issue, with significant financial implications and debates over state allocations. When Congress reauthorizes the wastewater infrastructure funding portions of the act, the issue of how to allocate federal funds to states will be a key topic of interest due to the outdated allocation formula."
