    "content": "The Act titled \"Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act Amendments of 1996\" references Title 49 of the United States Code and provides definitions for key terms. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 5901 is amended to include new definitions such as 'gross cargo weight'. SEC. 4. NOTIFICATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS. Section 5902 is amended to require prior notification to motor carriers for loaded containers or trailers with a projected gross cargo weight over 29,000 pounds before intermodal transportation. This applies to anyone in the US tendering such containers or trailers if the first carrier is a motor carrier. A person must provide a certification of a loaded container or trailer with a gross cargo weight over 29,000 pounds to a motor carrier for intermodal transportation. The certification should include the weight, contents description, certifying party's identity, container/trailer number, and certification date. The certification data can be transferred to another document or electronic format by a carrier. The shipping document prepared by the person tendering a container or trailer must contain the required information. The term 'Freight all kinds' is used in this context. After December 31, 2000, the term 'Freight All Kinds' or 'FAK' cannot be used for certification purposes if any commodity in a trailer or container exceeds 20 percent of the total weight. However, it can still be used for rating purposes. A separate document used for certification must be marked 'INTERMODAL CERTIFICATION'. This rule applies to anyone, domestic or foreign, who tenders a container or trailer for intermodal transportation. The certification provided under subsection (b) must be forwarded to subsequent carriers in intermodal transportation. If no certification is received by the subsequent carrier, they may presume that none is required. The act of forwarding the certification does not verify the information's accuracy or completeness. If information is inaccurately transferred or not forwarded, the person responsible is liable for any incurred costs. If inaccurate information is transferred or not forwarded, the responsible party will be liable for costs, including fines, penalties, storage fees, and interest charges. The carrier may place a lien on the container or trailer for the amount owed, along with court costs and legal fees. Additionally, if a motor carrier knows that the cargo weight would violate state laws, they must inform the operator. The motor carrier must inform the operator of a leased vehicle transporting an intermodal container or trailer of the certified gross cargo weight prior to tendering the container. The notice must be in writing or electronically transmitted, and the motor carrier is responsible for proving that the notice was provided. The operator of a leased vehicle transporting a container subject to weight laws may receive a fine if the motor carrier fails to provide required notice. The operator can seek reimbursement from the motor carrier for any fines and court costs incurred. If inaccurate information is transferred on a certification or not forwarded to the subsequent carrier, liability may arise for the person responsible. If inaccurate information is transferred on a certification or not forwarded to the subsequent carrier, liability may arise for the person responsible. This includes costs related to the imposition of the lien, court costs, and legal fees. The notification and certification requirements do not apply to consolidated shipments in intermodal containers or trailers. Intermodal transportation regulations exempt carriers transferring loaded containers to another carrier unless they are also the ones tendering the container initially. Intermodal transportation regulations exempt carriers from legal responsibility for loading property into a container or trailer unless they are the ones initially tendering the loaded container or trailer to the first carrier. SEC. 5. PROHIBITIONS. Section 5903 is amended to include provisions for providing erroneous information and transporting prior to receiving certification for motor carriers. If no certification is received, the carrier may presume the cargo weight is under 29,001 pounds. A copy of the certification is not required to accompany the container or trailer. Section 5903 is amended to change the weight limit for unlawful coercion to 29,000 pounds. A copy of the certification is not required to accompany the container or trailer. SEC. 6. LIENS. Section 5905(a) is amended regarding the intermodal transportation of loaded containers or trailers requiring certification. If a person violates a State's weight laws, they may be required to post a bond or pay fines due to errors in certification information provided to carriers. Section 5905(a) is amended for intermodal transportation of loaded containers or trailers. Errors in certification information may lead to bonds or fines, giving the person posting the bond a lien against the contents until payment is received. Amendments in Section 5905(b)(1) include expanding who can be held responsible for costs incurred. Amendments in Section 5905(b)(1) expand the lien holder's rights to include costs (including storage) and interest charges until all expenses are paid. SEC. 7 amends Section 5906 by simplifying the reference to other sections. SEC. 8 changes the effective date of the chapter. SEC. 9 addresses the relationship to other laws. SEC. 9. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS. Amends Chapter 59 by adding a new section regarding the relationship to other laws, specifically exempting hazardous material transportation regulations and state highway weight or size laws for tractor-trailer combinations."
