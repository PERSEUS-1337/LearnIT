    "title": "SB 263",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 273.6 of the Penal Code is amended to include intentional violations of protective orders, resulting in misdemeanor charges with fines or imprisonment. Orders can include exclusion from the family dwelling, injunctions against specific behaviors, or recognition of out-of-state orders. A subsequent conviction for violating a protective order within seven years of a prior conviction involving violence is punishable by up to one year in county jail. A subsequent conviction for violating a protective order within one year of a prior conviction resulting in physical injury to a victim can lead to a fine of up to $2,000, imprisonment in a county jail for six months to one year, or imprisonment pursuant to Section 1170. The court may reduce the minimum imprisonment if the person is jailed for at least 30 days, based on the seriousness of the case and reasons stated in the record. The court considers the seriousness of the facts, any additional violations during the case, future violation probability, victim safety, and defendant's counseling progress. The prosecuting agency of each county is responsible for enforcing protective orders related to firearm possession. Anyone who violates these orders will be punished under Section 29825. Exceptions apply if the firearm is granted an exemption under specific sections of the law. If probation is granted for certain violations, the court may impose probation with conditions such as making payments to shelters for abused individuals or reimbursing the victim for counseling expenses. The court must assess the defendant's ability to pay fines, payments to a battered women's shelter, or restitution as part of probation. Payments to a shelter cannot impede the defendant's ability to pay restitution to the victim or court-ordered child support. Community property cannot be used to fulfill the offending spouse's liability for restitution until all separate property is exhausted. A person under a protective order cannot operate a drone within a specified distance of another person or capture images of them using the drone, as it would violate the protective order. In this subdivision, definitions for \"unmanned aircraft\" and \"unmanned aircraft system\" are provided. \"Unmanned aircraft\" refers to aircraft operated without direct human intervention, while \"unmanned aircraft system\" includes the aircraft and associated elements needed for safe operation in the national airspace system. Section 4210 of the Public Resources Code is amended to declare findings related to unmanned aircraft and systems. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions. The Legislature amends Section 4210 of the Public Resources Code to emphasize the importance of fire protection in state responsibility areas. The presence of structures in these areas increases the risk of fire ignition and damage to wildlands and watersheds. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of fire protection in state responsibility areas with structures, stating that owners should bear the costs of fire prevention activities to distribute the economic burden equitably among citizens benefiting from these activities. A fire prevention fee is necessary to specifically benefit owners of structures in these areas."
