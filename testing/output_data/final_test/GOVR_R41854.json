Feed costs, which account for 75% of operating expenses, can fluctuate significantly. To mitigate these risks, dairy producers use private and public sector tools to transfer risk to others, such as private sector entities or the government through subsidized insurance programs like the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program. The report discusses market risks faced by dairy farmers and current risk management tools available, including the MILC program. The dairy industry generally supports government policies promoting risk management tools for individual producers but is divided on changes to traditional dairy policies. Federal dairy programs like price supports and milk marketing orders, which address industry-wide issues, are not covered in the report. In the 1970s and early 1980s, farm milk prices were stable due to government price support programs. Congress later reduced support levels in the 1980s to cut costs. Since then, farm milk prices have mostly remained above support levels, with fluctuations becoming routine. Fluctuations in farm milk prices have become routine, with prices moving between lows and record highs from 2006 to 2010. The dairy industry has benefited from increased demand for U.S. dairy exports, making the United States a net dairy exporter. However, this has also exposed dairy producers to price volatility in the global market. In 2011, dairy farmers are facing record high corn prices, along with increased prices for other major feed ingredients like soybean meal and alfalfa. To accurately describe the current farm situation, a \"milk margin\" should be used, which is the milk price minus feed costs. This margin is crucial as it represents the amount available to pay all other costs once the feed bill is settled. The milk margin, calculated by the National Milk Producers Federation based on USDA data, typically ranges between $5 and $10 per hundred pounds of milk monthly. Fluctuations outside this range prompt reversals in the margin. In 2007-2008, milk prices peaked briefly before a sharp decline, while feed costs spiked in 2008. This led to a drop in the milk margin to below $3 per cwt in 2009, causing producers to reduce their herds. By late 2009 and into 2010, milk demand improved, prices rose, and the milk margin returned to $7-$8 per cwt, nearing the long-term average. During the period of rapidly rising margins in 2007, producers added cows to their herds, even as margins deteriorated. The number of dairy cows eventually fell, helping to balance supply and demand. Some industry observers note that dairy farmers reinvest profits to minimize tax liability, potentially building capacity during market downturns. More producers have adopted risk strategies to manage market and income volatility. Producers who actively manage their business risk see market volatility as a profit opportunity. They use strategies to avoid catastrophic events from low milk prices. Some farmers call for government intervention to mitigate market volatility. Risk management tools for dairy producers can be short-run or long-run, delivered by private parties or the federal government. In the short run, producers can lock in favorable prices using forward contracts with milk buyers and feed dealers. In addition to using forward contracts with milk buyers and feed dealers, producers can also establish hedges using brokers with futures or options to lock in favorable prices or margins. Government assistance and insurance products are available for short-run risk management, while long-run strategies may involve diversifying the farm operation to generate additional revenue streams. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program provides payments when milk prices drop below certain levels, offering long-term stability compared to short-term private tools. Pursuing off-farm income can also reduce variability in farm household income, but the labor requirements of dairy operations make it less viable. Forward contracting allows dairy farmers to lock in milk prices for the future, typically up to two years in advance based on the futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Producers sign contracts with their cooperative or milk buyer, avoiding the need for margin money required in futures hedging. This method is beneficial for smaller producers with fewer than 100 cows. Forward contracting allows dairy farmers to lock in milk prices for the future, typically up to two years in advance based on the futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Producers sign contracts with their cooperative or milk buyer, avoiding the need for margin money required in futures hedging. In 2002, USDA reported results from a pilot program on forward contracting that demonstrated the price-smoothing effect of contracts, showing lower risk is associated with lower return and higher risk with higher returns. Producers can benefit from forward contracting or hedging risks by selling milk futures contracts on the CME to protect against declining prices. This approach works well for smaller producers, with prices set relative to futures prices. If prices do decline, farmers can realize a profit when the original contract is liquidated. By using a strategy called \"hedging,\" farmers can lock in a predetermined price for the milk they produce, as well as favorable prices for key feed inputs like corn and soybean meal. This allows dairy producers to protect against a decline in milk prices by selling futures contracts on the CME. If prices fall, losses in the futures market can be offset by gains in the cash market, resulting in a locked-in milk margin. When a producer locks in a price with a futures contract, they can hedge against price fluctuations. If prices decline, they gain in the futures market but see a lower cash price for milk. If prices rise, they get a higher cash price but lose in the futures market. Producers can execute hedges through a broker with a margin account to cover daily losses. Hedging with futures involves giving up potential windfall gains from rising prices in exchange for insurance against downside price risk. Producers can also use options to retain some upside potential without the need for a margin account, although options can be more expensive in terms of price protection per quantity of milk. Hedging is an effective strategy to mitigate market risks for dairy producers, especially for farms with at least 100 cows. Hedging can effectively mitigate market risks for dairy producers. In 2009, producers who took defensive action during the dairy crisis were rewarded with returns exceeding the market. Forward contracts or hedging milk sales could have reduced losses to one dollar per hundredweight instead of five or six dollars per hundredweight. Clients hedging milk last summer are receiving $17 to $18 per hundredweight, compared to base prices of $10 per hundredweight. Producers can benefit from hedging milk prices, but face challenges. They need a hedge line of credit for margin payments. Consistency in the price difference between farm and futures prices is crucial for effective hedging. Market observers note that dairy producers face challenges in determining consistent basis due to the nature of milk pricing. The cost of margin protection can deter producers from implementing hedging strategies, as low margins may erase potential profits. Producers also fear missing out on profits or locking in losses. Federal involvement in risk management tools is another option for dairy producers. The Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy Cattle insurance policy (LGM-Dairy) provides protection against a loss in gross margin for dairy producers. Administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, it hedges both the output price (milk) and input price (feed) simultaneously. Participation has been low due to producers still learning how to use it and the lack of premium subsidies until recently. In 2010, USDA began subsidizing policy premiums for the LGM-Dairy insurance product to encourage its use. Policy sales increased sharply but were halted when allocated funds ran out midway through FY2011. Policies were subsidized at approximately 40% of the total premium in FY2011. The Federal Crop Insurance Act limits expenditures on livestock policies to $20 million per year. The LGM-Dairy insurance product saw increased policy sales in 2010 after USDA began subsidizing premiums. However, the guarantee level was lower than expected during the 2009 milk price crash, resulting in producers receiving loss payments. Market conditions greatly impact the attractiveness of LGM-Dairy, as seen in examples where actual margins were higher than guarantees. RMA also offers whole-farm crop insurance policies like AGR and AGR-Lite, which insure the revenue of the entire farm. Whole farm insurance policies offer a revenue guarantee based on average gross farm revenue, using five years of income and expense data. These policies are mainly for small, diversified livestock and specialty crop farms, but are not widely popular due to the extensive tax data required and relatively high premium costs. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program is another federal program that provides risk management for dairy farmers. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program provides monthly payments to dairy farmers when milk prices drop below the target price of $16.94 per cwt. Payments are calculated as 45% of the difference between the actual price and the target price. The program has a production limit of 2.985 million pounds annually and addresses only a portion of the risk farmers face when prices decline. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program provides payments to dairy farmers when milk prices drop below the target price. Concerns include program effectiveness during market downturns, coverage for larger farms, and debate over federal support for dairy farm income. Policymakers are considering various options for dairy policy in the next farm bill. In the next farm bill, policymakers are considering options to address risk management for dairy producers, such as private hedging, expanding LGM-Dairy margin insurance, farm savings accounts, national margin insurance program, and modifying the MILC program. Congress may also decide on federal dairy policy changes or reducing federal assistance. The USDA's Dairy Industry Advisory Committee and a workshop in May 2011 emphasized the need for more education on hedging market risks for dairy producers and bankers. Some bankers work closely with farmers to manage price risks, while others need convincing from experienced producers. Private companies, cooperatives, and manufacturers offer hedging programs, but securing lines of credit may be necessary to serve more producers. Education programs are being developed to address these needs. The USDA's Dairy Industry Advisory Committee and a workshop in May 2011 highlighted the importance of education on hedging market risks for dairy producers and the need for more accessible lines of credit. Suggestions were made for the government to provide or guarantee lines of credit to encourage the use of risk management tools among dairy producers. Calls were also made to expand or simplify the LGM-Dairy insurance product to streamline the decision-making process for producers. The USDA may not extend FY2011 subsidy rates for LGM-Dairy when funding for livestock insurance products becomes available in FY2012. Subsidies in FY2011 crowded out private hedging, leading producers to switch to LGM-Dairy for similar protection at a lower cost. Policymakers are concerned about fairness between crops and livestock in federal spending on insurance. The federal crop insurance program spent an average of $6 billion per year in FY2009 and FY2010, much higher than the capped $20 million for livestock insurance. Farm savings accounts have been proposed as a way for producers to manage revenue risk, with potential benefits including increased savings/cash reserves and reduced industry price volatility. Proposed farm savings accounts aim to reduce industry price volatility and discourage overinvestment in dairy farms during market downturns. Concerns about complexity and effectiveness have led to alternative proposals like the Dairy Producer Margin Protection Program by the National Milk Producers Federation. The National Milk Producers Federation proposed a program to protect margins for milk producers by offering free coverage for a modest margin on historical production and allowing the purchase of supplemental coverage at higher levels. The program aims to provide protection from catastrophic market events without encouraging additional milk production or guaranteeing a profit. The average margin from 2000-2010 was between $7 and $8 per cwt, with margins dropping below $4 per cwt during the 2009 crisis. Supplemental coverage at $6 per cwt would have resulted in margin payments during that time. The proposed program by the National Milk Producers Federation offers free coverage for a modest margin on historical production and allows the purchase of supplemental coverage at higher levels. Producers would need to evaluate the cost of supplemental coverage relative to the protection they might receive. The program aims to protect margins without encouraging additional milk production or guaranteeing a profit. Comparing the program with MILC, research indicates that the margin program would make larger payments as margins decline further. FAPRI estimates a slight increase in milk output due to program benefits encouraging production. The USDA's Dairy Industry Advisory Committee recommended modifying the MILC program to a margin program while keeping production limits for small farms. Critics suggest adding a supply management component to dairy policy. Individual dairy producers have various risk management tools available. Private risk tools like forward contracting and hedging are used by dairy producers to manage financial effects of volatile milk prices. Additional training for producers and bankers could increase their use. USDA's changes to LGM-Dairy insurance in FY2011 increased demand, but it's unclear if subsidies actually boosted risk management or just transferred money from taxpayers to farmers. Proponents of farm savings accounts argue it would be beneficial. Proponents of farm savings accounts (FSAs) argue that it would help dairy producers manage cash flows and prevent overinvestment in dairy operations. Policymakers may need to consider setting a minimum margin through a \"margin insurance\" program to address market fluctuations. Policymakers should also consider the risk implications of margin protection in dairy operations, as excessive protection could lead to overproduction and lower returns for producers."
