    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Chronic Wasting Disease Support for States Act. It includes provisions for a national database, surveillance programs, support for state management efforts, and research regarding chronic wasting disease. The Chronic Wasting Disease Support for States Act includes provisions for surveillance programs, diagnostic testing capacity expansion, and research support for chronic wasting disease in captive herds of deer and elk. General provisions cover rulemaking and definitions. The Act defines chronic wasting disease as a transmissible nervous system disease affecting deer and elk. It also defines eligible grant recipients as entities conducting scientific research on the disease. The Act defines chronic wasting disease as a transmissible nervous system disease affecting deer and elk. The term \"Indian tribe\" is defined in accordance with the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that chronic wasting disease is a significant threat to deer and elk populations and requires increased research and management efforts to contain the disease. The States have primary authority in wildlife management, including addressing chronic wasting disease. The Federal Government should provide financial and technical support to States, wildlife departments, agriculture departments, colleges, universities, and research centers working on chronic wasting disease. Federal agencies should offer consistent support to State administrators to prevent the spread of the disease between captive and wild cervids across different land management jurisdictions. The Federal Government should provide financial and technical support to States, wildlife departments, agriculture departments, colleges, universities, and research centers conducting scientific research on chronic wasting disease. Federal authorities can offer consistent support to State administrators to prevent the spread of the disease across different land management jurisdictions. SEC. 101. NATIONAL DATABASE REGARDING CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE. The Secretary of the Interior will establish and maintain the official national database for surveillance and monitoring data on chronic wasting disease in cervid populations. The database will also include other relevant information on the disease from various sources, serving as a resource for Federal and State agencies, Indian tribes, and foreign governments. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a national database for chronic wasting disease data, serving as a resource for Federal and State agencies, research institutions, and international wildlife authorities. The Department of Agriculture's collected data will be included in the database, with an authorization of $750,000 for its establishment and maintenance. SEC. 102. Surveillance and monitoring program for chronic wasting disease in wild deer and elk herds. The Secretary of the Interior will develop a national surveillance program to monitor chronic wasting disease in wild deer and elk herds, including identifying infection rates, spread causes, and potential reservoirs. Financial and technical assistance will be provided to States and tribes for program implementation. Cooperation with State and tribal agencies will be ensured during program development. The Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, will establish uniform standards for collecting and assessing samples for the surveillance and monitoring program. $1,000,000 is authorized to support the program, with funds remaining available until expended. SEC. 103. SUPPORT FOR STATE EFFORTS TO MANAGE AND CONTROL CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE. The Secretary of the Interior, through the United States Geological Survey, will allocate funds to State or tribal agencies for wildlife management to address chronic wasting disease. Funding priorities will be based on the relative scope of the disease incidence on lands administered by the State or Indian tribe. The Secretary of the Interior will allocate funds to State or tribal agencies for chronic wasting disease management based on the disease incidence. Priority will be given to those with the highest financial commitment and integrated policies for disease management. Rapid response to new outbreaks is also emphasized. Authorization of $2,000,000 for State and tribal efforts to manage chronic wasting disease, with funds remaining available until expended. The Secretary of Interior will provide grants for research on chronic wasting disease, including detection, genetic resistance, tissue, and environmental studies. $3,000,000 is authorized for these grants. Additionally, there is a surveillance and monitoring program for chronic wasting disease in captive herds of deer and elk under the Department of Agriculture activities. The Secretary of Agriculture will develop a surveillance program to identify chronic wasting disease infection rates in captive deer and elk herds, monitor disease spread, and identify potential infection reservoirs. Financial and technical assistance will be provided to States and Indian tribes for program implementation. Cooperation with State and tribal agencies managing the disease is required. The Secretary of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, will establish uniform standards for collecting and assessing samples for chronic wasting disease surveillance. $1,000,000 is authorized for the surveillance program, with funds remaining available until expended. Expansion of diagnostic testing capacity. The purpose of the text is to address the inadequate laboratory capacity for diagnostic testing of samples collected under chronic wasting disease surveillance programs. The Secretary of Agriculture will upgrade federal and certified laboratories to process samples in a timely manner. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide grants to upgrade certified laboratories for timely processing of samples from surveillance programs. $1,000,000 is authorized for this purpose. Expansion of research on chronic wasting disease through the Agricultural Research Service, including detection, genetic resistance, and environmental studies, with $5,000,000 authorized for funding. Additionally, support for research through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service is expanded. The Secretary of Agriculture will increase grants for research on chronic wasting disease, with $7,000,000 authorized for appropriations. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture will jointly promulgate rules to ensure compatibility of surveillance and monitoring programs for the national database required by the Act, without following certain procedures due to the urgency of addressing chronic wasting disease. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture will jointly promulgate rules without delay, using authority under section 808 of title 5, United States Code, to address chronic wasting disease. This does not require any delay in promulgating rules by the Secretary of Agriculture on interstate transportation of captive deer or elk."
