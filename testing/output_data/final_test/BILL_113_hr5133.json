Section 943 of title 11, United States Code is amended to include provisions for modifying collective bargaining agreements and retiree benefits protected by nonbankruptcy law. The amendment to Section 943 of title 11, United States Code allows for the modification of collective bargaining agreements and retiree benefits. The authorized representative for retirees receiving benefits covered by a collective bargaining agreement is the labor organization signatory to the agreement, unless they no longer represent active employees in the same bargaining unit. If this is the case, the authorized representative will be the labor organization currently representing active employees in that unit, unless the organization elects not to serve or the court rules otherwise. The court may appoint a different representation for individuals receiving retiree benefits if deemed appropriate. If the labor organization declines to represent these individuals or the court decides on different representation, a committee of retired employees may be appointed by the United States trustee upon motion by a party in interest. The court may appoint a different representation for individuals receiving retiree benefits if deemed appropriate. The party requesting relief has the burden of proof. For retired employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the court may order the United States trustee to appoint a committee of retired employees if the debtor seeks to modify or not pay retiree benefits. The party making the motion has the burden of proof. The United States trustee shall appoint a committee on a per capita basis to comply with the court's order. The trustee appoints individuals from organizations representing retirees based on membership. A committee cannot recommend changes to retiree benefits unless at least 2/3 of members support the recommendation."
