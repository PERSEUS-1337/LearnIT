The Act of 2003, also known as the \"____ Act,\" introduces a new section on Reserve Component Employment Credit in the Internal Revenue Code. This section outlines the calculation of the employment credit for qualified employees and self-employed individuals participating in qualified reserve component duty. The Reserve Component Employment Credit in the Internal Revenue Code allows qualified employees to receive a credit for participating in reserve component duty during the taxable year, excluding normal employment duties. The credit is based on the average daily qualified compensation of the employee. The Reserve Component Employment Credit allows qualified employees to receive a credit based on the average daily military pay and allowances for participating in qualified reserve component duty during the taxable year. The Reserve Component Employment Credit provides a credit for qualified employees participating in reserve component duty based on their compensation. The Reserve Component Employment Credit allows qualified employees to receive compensation for reserve component duty without reducing their vacation time, sick leave, or other leave previously earned. A qualified employee is defined as someone who has been employed by the taxpayer for 21 days before participating in reserve component duty. The self-employment credit for qualified self-employed taxpayers is equal to 100 percent of the excess of their average daily self-employment income over the average daily military pay and allowances received while participating in qualified reserve component duty. The taxpayer's duties during qualified reserve component duty days in the taxable year, including time in a travel status, determine the self-employment credit. Average daily self-employment income is calculated by dividing self-employment income plus medical care insurance payments by the difference between 365 and the number of reserve duty days. The term 'average daily military pay and allowances' is defined as the amount paid to the taxpayer for participating in qualified reserve component duty, divided by the total number of days spent on duty, including travel time. A 'qualified self-employed taxpayer' is someone who meets specific criteria. A qualified self-employed taxpayer is defined as someone with net earnings from self-employment and is a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the US Armed Forces. The employment credit provided is in addition to any deduction for compensation paid to a qualified employee during reserve duty. No credit is allowed if the taxpayer fails to comply with employment or reemployment rights of reserve component members. The tax credit under subsection (a) is disallowed for a taxpayer under a final order from a district court for a violation of chapter 43 of title 38 of the United States Code, for the taxable year and the following 2 years. The credit is also not allowed for a taxpayer if the person on whose behalf the credit would be allowed is called to active duty for training under title 10, United States Code. The term 'qualified reserve component duty' includes active duty designated in the reservist's military orders. Military pay refers to pay as defined in section 101(21) of title 37, United States Code, and allowances are the allowances payable to a member of the Armed Forces under chapter 7 of that title. A person is considered to be participating in qualified reserve component duty if they do not engage in normal employment or self-employment duties unless on authorized leave. During qualified reserve component duty, individuals are prohibited from engaging in normal employment or self-employment activities, except during authorized leave. Rules similar to those in section 52 apply for this purpose. Additionally, a conforming amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes a new paragraph on the reserve component employment credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new reserve component employment credit under section 45G(a). A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The new reserve component employment credit under section 45G applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002."
