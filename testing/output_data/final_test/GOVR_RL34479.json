The revised standard was published in the Federal Register on November 12, 2008, marking the final step in a lengthy review process. Lead emissions from vehicles significantly decreased after the phase-out of leaded gasoline in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. By 2007, emissions had dropped by over 98% and ambient lead concentrations had fallen by 94%. Only two areas with a total population of 4,664 people still had air quality violations of the 1978 lead NAAQS as of March 12, 2008. The 2008 NAAQS for lead was approved by EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson, following a review process. Lead emissions had significantly decreased due to the phase-out of leaded gasoline, with ambient lead concentrations falling by 94%. Despite some suggesting no need for a lead standard, the Administrator, supported by scientific advisers, strengthened the standard to 90% below the 1978 level and implemented new monitoring requirements. This report details the background, process, emission reductions, proposed changes, and potential effects of the revised lead standard. The NAAQS are standards for outdoor air pollutants that may endanger public health or welfare. They include primary standards for public health protection and secondary standards for public welfare. NAAQS define what EPA considers clean air and are essential to the Clean Air Act. EPA uses monitoring data to identify areas that exceed these standards. The EPA uses monitoring data to identify areas that exceed air pollutant standards. Nonattainment areas must produce plans to reduce pollution levels and meet the standards within a specified timeframe. Lead nonattainment areas have up to five years to comply, with a possible extension. The Administrator also expanded lead monitoring requirements to ensure compliance. Implementing the new standard for air quality compliance is a lengthy process due to the need for monitoring and compiling data over three years. The EPA enforces national standards for pollutants through regulations on products and emission standards for new sources. The Clean Air Act mandates a review of NAAQS every five years, often leading to lawsuits for non-compliance. Lead NAAQS review was last completed in 1978, with a lawsuit in 2004 establishing a review schedule for EPA. The EPA reviews the NAAQS standard every five years, with a schedule for proposing revisions by May 1, 2008, and final decisions by October 15, 2008. The process involves scientific literature review, criteria document preparation, and staff paper summarization for the Administrator's decision-making on indicators and numerical levels. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review the NAAQS standard every five years. An independent Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) is appointed to ensure scientific standards are met. CASAC, along with expert panels, reviews the agency's work during NAAQS-setting and NAAQS-revision. The EPA Administrator can add or delete pollutants from the list of criteria pollutants for NAAQS based on endangerment of public health or welfare. Lead emissions have been reduced significantly since 1970, from 224,100 tons to 1,300 tons in 2007, showcasing a key success of the Clean Air Act and EPA. Lead emissions have been significantly reduced since 1970, from 224,100 tons to 1,300 tons in 2007. The reduction of lead in ambient air did not primarily result from the 1978 NAAQS or the Clean Air Act's prescribed methods. EPA identified nonattainment areas only in 1991, with most lead reductions occurring before 1990 as a side-benefit of other Clean Air Act measures. The reduction of lead emissions since 1970 was mainly due to Clean Air Act programs, particularly regulations on emissions from new automobiles. Catalytic converters were installed on cars to meet stricter emission requirements, leading to the mandate of unleaded fuel in the early 1970s. Despite the decrease in emissions, lead remains in the environment, impacting human health. Research since the 1970s shows lead has health impacts at lower levels than previously thought. Current sources of emissions include various industries and activities, leading to exposure through soil, dust, and air pollution. EPA strengthened lead NAAQS in 2008 to address ambient air lead levels. The 1978 primary standard for lead exposure was 1.5 \u00b5g/m3 over three months, with most of the U.S. meeting this standard. However, evidence shows health effects at current exposure levels, including neurological effects in children and cardiovascular risks in adults. Lead exposure is linked to increased blood pressure, hypertension, cardiovascular mortality, and reduced kidney function, especially in individuals with diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. EPA staff and CASAC recommend strengthening the NAAQS, suggesting a lower standard of 0.1-0.2 \u00b5g/m3 for public health protection. The EPA staff and CASAC recommended lowering the primary NAAQS for Lead to 0.15 \u00b5g/m3. The Administrator proposed two options for revising the averaging time and form used to determine compliance with the standard. The EPA staff and CASAC recommended lowering the primary NAAQS for Lead to 0.15 \u00b5g/m3. The Administrator proposed two options for revising the averaging time and form used to determine compliance with the standard, including considering shorter time scales for blood lead concentrations. The EPA will use a rolling three-month average over a three-year period to determine violations of the NAAQS for Lead. To be redesignated to \"attainment,\" an area must have three years of rolling averages meeting the standard. This approach is stricter than the previous method but not as protective as using the second highest monthly average. Currently, 17 counties show nonattainment with the new standard, compared to only two counties under the old standard. Less than 3% of the nation's counties have active lead monitors, so more counties may be found in nonattainment as the monitoring network expands. The EPA's current review found that the monitoring network for lead pollution is inadequate, with only 2.3% of counties having active lead monitors in 2008. Despite new studies linking lead pollution to adverse effects, there is a lack of evidence linking specific levels of lead in the air to these effects. As a result, the secondary standard for lead remains identical to the primary standard. In 2008, only 2.3% of states had active lead monitors, leaving many areas without means to determine lead NAAQS violations. Twenty-four states, including those with major lead emissions, had no monitors due to decreased emissions. Areas without monitors may not be in compliance with the new lead standard. Major lead emission sources are shown in Figure 2. In response to the lack of lead monitors in several states, the EPA proposed requiring monitors near sources emitting over one ton of lead per year. Additionally, monitors would be placed in urban areas with populations of 500,000 or more to assess lead exposure. The final rule reflected industry concerns and set different thresholds than initially proposed. The EPA proposed changes to monitoring requirements for lead emissions, including a 0.5 ton threshold for source-oriented monitors and the establishment of a network of 80 multi-pollutant monitoring sites known as NCore. EPA estimates that the proposal would. The EPA proposed changes to monitoring requirements for lead emissions, including a 0.5 ton threshold for source-oriented monitors and the establishment of a network of 80 multi-pollutant monitoring sites known as NCore. EPA estimates that the proposal would increase the number of monitors by about 140, with initial costs estimated at $4.5 million and operational costs at $3.5 million annually. The December 2009 rule would increase ambient air monitoring costs by an additional $1.8 million, leading EPA to request an additional $15 million in its FY2011 budget. Additionally, the agency is seeking an $82.5 million increase in total budget authority for state and tribal assistance grants in FY2011 to support new NAAQS implementation activities. The EPA proposed changes to monitoring requirements for lead emissions, including a 0.5 ton threshold for source-oriented monitors and the establishment of a network of 80 multi-pollutant monitoring sites known as NCore. CASAC and EPA staff concluded that airborne lead still meets the NAAQS criteria and that the 1978 NAAQS needed to be significantly strengthened. The Administrator agreed with the need for stronger standards. The Administrator proposed a range for the final NAAQS for lead, with the final choice falling within the recommended range by EPA staff and CASAC. The decision was supported by uncertainties in the science and did not provoke controversy. The Administrator's decision on the final NAAQS for lead was supported by scientific studies and the CASAC review panel. Some expressed concerns about economic impacts, but the Clean Air Act prohibits considering costs in setting NAAQS. The Administrator's decision on the final NAAQS for lead was supported by scientific studies and the CASAC review panel, despite some economic concerns. The EPA's Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee recommended a stricter standard, but most environmental groups supported the tenfold reduction in lead standard. The EPA's decision on the final NAAQS for lead was based on scientific studies and expert advice, with a focus on protecting at-risk children from airborne lead exposure. The agency released a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the new lead standard, which highlighted both the costs and benefits of the regulation. EPA acknowledged limitations and uncertainties in the cost and benefit estimates, emphasizing the importance of data accuracy. The Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the new lead standard highlighted costs and benefits, with estimates only developed for 17 counties currently showing nonattainment. The cost estimates ranged from $150 million to $2.8 billion annually, with over 94% of emission reductions achieved through identified controls. EPA's inability to demonstrate attainment in all areas led to uncertainties in the estimates. The EPA's analysis of emission controls for the new lead standard shows that over 94% of emission reductions can be achieved through identified controls, costing $130 million to $150 million annually. However, achieving unspecified emission reductions may cost from $20 million to $3.1 billion annually, depending on the methodology used. The analysis assumed all emission reductions would come from point source emissions, but 45% of emissions actually come from aviation fuel. The EPA is analyzing a petition from Friends of the Earth to reduce or eliminate lead from aviation gasoline. The agency notes that industrial sources emit small quantities of lead and that implementing pollution controls could be prohibitively expensive. The EPA is considering measures to reduce lead emissions from industrial sources, such as modifying production processes or implementing pollution prevention techniques. The benefits of the proposed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for lead are estimated to outweigh the costs, with expected annual benefits ranging from $3.7 billion to $6.9 billion in 2016. These benefits mainly stem from preventing IQ loss in children under seven years old due to lead exposure. The EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) focuses on children's health effects from lead exposure, including unquantified effects like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and neurobehavioral function. The agency cannot currently quantify these effects, leading to substantial uncertainty in both costs and benefits of the lead NAAQS. The EPA is facing uncertainties in implementing the NAAQS due to the number of affected areas and funding needs for monitoring. They have requested a budget increase for state and tribal assistance grants to support new monitors and workload for implementing revised NAAQS for lead and other pollutants."
