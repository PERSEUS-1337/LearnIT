    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is a proposed regional free trade agreement among 12 Pacific Rim countries, with provisions on textile trade being a major point of contention. The agreement could have implications for the U.S. textile manufacturing industry, which exported about $14 billion in yarns and fabrics worldwide in 2013. The TPP could impact the U.S. textile industry by allowing duty-free access to the U.S. market for Asian manufacturers. This could lead to job loss in the Western Hemisphere as producers may lose market share to countries like Vietnam. The U.S. textile industry faces challenges from Asian manufacturers in the TPP, with retailers pushing for inclusion of textiles and apparel in the agreement. Textile manufacturing is a key supplier industry, with apparel consuming a small percentage of U.S.-manufactured fibers. Textile output is used in various sectors, including home textiles, floor coverings, and technical textiles. The U.S. textile industry faces challenges from Asian manufacturers in the TPP, with retailers pushing for inclusion of textiles and apparel in the agreement. Textile manufacturing occurs in highly automated factories, while apparel manufacturing is decentralized and globally dispersed. U.S. apparel shipments totaled over $13 billion in 2013, with most U.S.-headquartered apparel firms having limited or no U.S. manufacturing capabilities. The United States accounts for only 1% of global apparel exports, with China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Mexico being the top suppliers. Domestic functions like design, branding, and marketing are done locally. The U.S. home furnishings industry is more resilient to import competition due to automation in manufacturing. The automation of manufacturing processes in the carpet and rug mills industry led to a decline in employment from 49,000 workers in 2003 to 31,200 in 2013. Shipments from U.S. carpet and rug mills totaled $8.9 billion in 2012. The health of the industry is influenced by domestic housing and commercial building markets, raw material prices, and competition from foreign producers. Technical textile mills supply various industrial sectors, with automotive manufacturers using over 200,000 tons of textiles for interior fabrics. The Industrial Fabrics Association International estimated that about 160,000 workers in the United States produced fabrics in 2013. In 2013, about 160,000 workers in the United States produced fabrics for the technical textile market. Textile manufacturing starts with fiber, which can be natural (e.g., cotton, wool) or synthetic (e.g., polyester, nylon). The process includes yarn production, fabric production (weaving or knitting), finishing (bleaching, dyeing), and fabrication into various products. The textile industry produced 86.6 million metric tons of textiles in 2013, with man-made fibers accounting for over two-thirds of total production. China led in man-made textile manufacturing, producing about two-thirds of the total, while the United States accounted for 5%. Cotton is the most important natural fiber, with China being the largest producer at 7 million metric tons in 2013, followed by India and the United States. Other major cotton producers include Pakistan, Brazil, Uzbekistan, and Turkey. The top consumers of cotton are China, India, Pakistan, and Turkey. U.S. textile mills have seen a 70% drop in cotton use due to competition from imports. Australia and New Zealand are leading wool-growing nations. Vietnam is a top 10 silk producer, while China and India lead in silk production. U.S. textile output remains below pre-2008 levels. The textile industry in the U.S. has seen a decline in production, with a 30% decrease in textile product mills since 2007. Shipments were valued at nearly $57 billion in 2013, a 5% increase from the previous year. Despite investments in new technologies, there were 2,555 fewer textile manufacturing establishments in 2012 compared to 2003. Domestic manufacturers have focused on technology to reduce costs, such as using air-jets in industrial looms for faster weaving speeds. The U.S. textile industry has invested in new technologies to reduce costs and increase production efficiency. Modern industrial looms now weave at speeds of 2,000 picks per minute, with some mills almost fully automated. Several manufacturers have announced plans to expand U.S. production of textiles by building new plants or expanding current facilities. Textile production requires higher worker skills than apparel production, making it less prone to relocation to lower-wage countries. The textile industry in the United States, Japan, and South Korea has maintained significant production due to skilled labor availability and capital investment in weaving and spinning mills. Despite automation and closure of less efficient mills, the industry has seen a loss of over 200,000 jobs in the past decade. In 2013, the domestic textile industry employed about 230,700 workers, accounting for less than 2% of all factory jobs in the country. In 2013, domestic textile industry employed about 230,700 workers, less than 2% of all factory jobs. Average annual pay was $39,000, far below the manufacturing average. Employment has declined by two-thirds since 1990, with Bureau of Labor Statistics predicting further shrinkage to 180,000 by 2022. Most textile production is in southeastern states and California, with Georgia and North Carolina having over one-third of textile jobs. Top 10 states accounted for two-thirds of textile jobs in 2003 and 2013. Apparel manufacturing in the U.S. has seen a decline in employment over the past two decades, with 800,000 fewer jobs in 2013 compared to 1990. Some retailers like Brooks Brothers have brought back manufacturing to the U.S., but overall industry employment dropped to 144,000 in 2013. Developed countries, including the U.S. and EU, previously protected their textile and apparel sectors through multilateral agreements. The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) imposed quotas on textile imports from over 70 countries, limiting the quantities of textiles and garments that could enter the US and EU annually. This led to sourcing from multiple countries instead of concentrating production where it was cheapest. The expiration of the ATC in 2005 removed all textile and apparel quotas for WTO members, allowing buyers to source from any WTO country, subject to tariffs. US tariffs on textile imports vary based on bilateral and regional agreements. The average U.S. tariff rates for textiles and clothing in 2012 were 7.9% and 11.4% respectively, with some products facing rates as high as 32%. China dominated the global textile market in 2013 with a 35% market share at $107 billion, experiencing significant export growth since joining the WTO in 2001. The EU and India were the second and third-largest textile exporters. China, the EU, the US, Vietnam, and Hong Kong were the top importers of textiles in 2013. In 2013, Vietnam and Hong Kong were among the top five textile importers globally. Apparel trade is more diversified than textile trade, with China, the EU-28, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Vietnam leading clothing exports. The US had a trade surplus in fabrics and yarns but a deficit in textile articles, with import penetration reaching 37% in 2013. In 2013, the share of U.S. demand met by textile imports increased to 37% from 31% in 2008. U.S. exports of yarns and fabrics are mainly sold to NAFTA and CAFTA-DR countries, despite being more expensive. Mexico is the largest foreign market for the U.S. textile industry, with exports of $4.2 billion in 2013. However, textile exports to Mexico have decreased compared to 2000 due to rising labor costs. Less than $400 million of U.S.-made yarns and fabrics were exported to other TPP member countries like Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. In 2013, textile exports to other TPP member countries like Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam were less than $400 million. China, Canada, and the EU-28 provided over half of the yarns and fabrics imported by the United States in 2013. Textile imports are sensitive to the economy, with fluctuations in import levels between 2008 and 2013. U.S. apparel imports reached almost 90% of demand in 2013, with a trade deficit of $77 billion. China was the largest source of imported apparel, followed by Vietnam and Mexico. In 2013, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean shipped small quantities of apparel to the United States, mostly using textiles produced in the U.S. These regions accounted for 16% of U.S. apparel imports, down from a third in 2000. They have limited textile production but ample capacity for cut, make, and trim apparel assembly. Canada's textile sector differs from Latin America's CMT operations. U.S. textile exports to Canada totaled $1.8 billion in 2013. In Central America, textile mills produce knit and woven fabrics, man-made fibers, and mixtures. U.S. textile manufacturers, along with companies from South Korea, Taiwan, and China, have manufacturing capabilities in the region. Mexico is a significant producer of yarns and fabrics, with U.S.-based firms producing denim there. Mexico's apparel industry heavily relies on the U.S. market for exports, using U.S.-made fabrics for basic garments like denim jeans. Mexico is the largest yarn and fabric market for the United States, with significant purchases of various textiles. However, competition from countries with lower wages is reducing the competitiveness of Mexican apparel. U.S. clothing imports from Mexico have decreased, while Honduras, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala are important markets for U.S. textile exporters in the CAFTA-DR region. The United States exports fibers and man-made filaments to Honduras, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala for basic apparel production. Nicaragua benefits from a tariff preference level provision in the CAFTA-DR agreement, allowing U.S. trade preferences for Nicaraguan apparel. Costa Rica also has a similar provision for wool and women's swimwear. Apparel manufacturers in the Caribbean region have preferential access to the U.S. market under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. The Caribbean Basin Trade Preference Act (CBTPA) program allows Caribbean cut and assembly factories to rely on U.S.-made fabrics and yarns for garment production. U.S. exports to the region totaled $75 million in 2013, with the Dominican Republic being a major textile producer. Other countries like Haiti also use U.S.-made textiles for apparel production. U.S. retailers source basic knitwear garments from the region, focusing on men's and boys' wear. U.S. imports of industrial fabrics from the CAFTA-DR region are minimal at $1.5 million in 2013. Apparel producers in the Western Hemisphere have advantages in serving the U.S. market due to geographic proximity and duty-free access for apparel manufactured from U.S. textiles. Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Basin have higher wage rates compared to some Asian apparel suppliers. The average hourly cost of labor in the apparel industry is $2.06 in Mexico and $0.51 in Vietnam. Tariff preferences play a crucial role in keeping Western Hemisphere apparel producers competitive in the U.S. market. A potential TPP agreement could disrupt this balance, as duty-free access for apparel from Asian TPP countries may displace U.S. textile exports. Vietnam's growing textile industry could further impact U.S. textile exports if TPP allows Western Hemisphere producers to use textiles from any TPP member country. Vietnam has become the second-largest exporter of garments to the U.S., surpassing China. Vietnam has become the second-largest exporter of garments to the United States, surpassing China. Apparel imports from Vietnam to the U.S. have grown rapidly, reaching $8.2 billion in 2013. Additionally, U.S. imports of technical fabrics from Vietnam have also expanded, totaling $186 million in 2013. Vietnam is the only Asian and Pacific country in the TPP with significant textile and apparel trade with the U.S., with China and other Asian countries being its main competitors in the clothing market. Vietnam's apparel sector is a significant player in the U.S. market, surpassing China as the second-largest exporter of garments. The country specializes in selling shirts, suits, and overcoats to the U.S., with a focus on women's clothing. Vietnam primarily sources its yarns and fabrics from China and other Asian suppliers, with a growing textile industry but still heavily reliant on imports for materials. Vietnam's textile and garment industry heavily relies on imports for fibers, fabrics, and yarns. The Vietnam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex) aims to increase production to reduce dependence on imports. Vinatex's exports were $2.95 billion in 2013, with a target of $5 billion by 2016. The Ministry of Trade and Industry plans to increase fabric production to 2 million metric tons by 2020 and fiber production to 650,000 metric tons by the same year. Vinatex aims to reduce Vietnam's dependence on imported materials by increasing production. Projects include a joint venture to build a polyester fiber plant and a new textile complex. Foreign investments in spinning, weaving, and dyeing sectors have surged in anticipation of TPP agreement, with over $1 billion invested in the textile and apparel sector. Foreign investments of over $1 billion have been made in Vietnam's textile and apparel sector in anticipation of a TPP agreement. Major Chinese companies like Texhong and Pacific Textile are opening new plants in Vietnam attracted by lower costs. Other manufacturers from Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Austria, and Australia are also expanding production in Vietnam. The potential TPP agreement could create new business opportunities for U.S. fiber, yarn, and fabric producers in Vietnam. Vietnamese textile mills are subject to specific rules governing textile and apparel trade, including rules of origin (ROOs) determining duty-free access. ROO requirements are based on production processes, with distinctions like Fiber Forward and Yarn Forward criteria. Man-made fibers must be extruded in the trading area. Yarn Forward rule requires all components, from yarn to final product, to be made within the free trade area. Fabric Forward allows the use of fibers from any country, but fabric must be knitted or woven in FTA member countries. Cut and Sew only requires the cutting and sewing to be done in FTA member countries. The US mostly follows the \"yarn forward\" standard for textiles and apparel, with exceptions for Jordan and Israel. The United States follows a \"yarn forward\" standard for textiles and apparel, with exceptions for Jordan and Israel. U.S. tariffs increase with each stage of manufacturing, with higher rates on apparel than on yarn or fabric inputs. Vietnam's apparel tariffs range from 5% to 20%. U.S. negotiators have proposed a unified yarn-forward rule in the TPP agreement, but some countries, including Vietnam, oppose this and support a \"cut and sew\" rule instead. The U.S. supports a \"yarn forward\" rule for textiles and apparel in the TPP agreement, while Vietnam prefers a \"cut and sew\" rule. U.S. domestic interests, including the Textile and Apparel Alliance for TPP (TAAT), advocate for the yarn-forward rule to prevent Vietnamese apparel manufacturers from using Chinese textiles and undermining U.S. textile production. Over 165 Members of Congress have endorsed TAAT's position. The U.S. Trade Representative supports a yarn-forward rule for textiles and apparel in the TPP agreement, while U.S. retailers and importers advocate for a more flexible rule. The TPP Apparel Coalition opposes the yarn-forward rule and calls for a more liberal standard, allowing garments to qualify for duty-free status with sewing done in a TPP country. Members of Congress are divided on this issue. Concerns about the health of domestic textile manufacturing have influenced past trade negotiations and are now a key factor in the TPP talks. The inclusion of Vietnam in the agreement could shift global trading patterns, potentially displacing apparel from the Western Hemisphere in the U.S. market. This could weaken export markets currently served by U.S. textile producers in Mexico and Central America. The TPP talks involve concerns about domestic textile manufacturing and the potential impact of including Vietnam in the agreement. U.S. textile manufacturing interests are pushing for a \"yarn forward\" rule in the TPP to limit the use of non-TPP yarns and fabrics in products for the U.S. market. The TPP talks involve concerns about domestic textile manufacturing and the potential impact of including Vietnam in the agreement. U.S. textile manufacturing interests are pushing for a \"yarn forward\" rule in the TPP to limit the use of non-TPP yarns and fabrics in products for the U.S. market. This rule would affect U.S. apparel consumers and household textiles markets, as products made in TPP countries from yarns and fabrics produced elsewhere would not qualify for duty-free treatment. Domestic manufacturers of household and technical textiles may not be immediately affected by the TPP agreement due to their international competitiveness and Vietnam's low labor costs providing little comparative advantage in highly automated production sectors. Vietnam has been expanding into industrial fabrics and higher-end textiles, including tire cord and coated fabrics, but is unlikely to be a significant global competitor in the near future."
