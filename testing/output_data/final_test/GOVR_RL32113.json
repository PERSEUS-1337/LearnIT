    "content": "The tension between Congress and the Executive, stemming from the separation of powers, leads to interbranch conflict. Congressional interventions in administrative proceedings can sometimes result in court challenges for undue political influence. The report provides an overview of the legal and ethical issues surrounding congressional influence on administrative decision-making processes, including challenges to the integrity of agency processes and disciplinary proceedings before ethics committees. Past incidents have raised questions about the propriety of congressional interventions in rulemakings, ratemakings, and agency investigations, but there is a lack of authoritative commentary on the guiding principles applicable to the roles of Members in oversight and representative capacities. Part II of the report reviews the judicial development and application of standards for determining whether congressional pressure or influence taints an agency proceeding. The courts tend to protect congressional prerogatives in balancing oversight obligations with the rights of parties before agencies. They intervene only when political pressure forces consideration of factors Congress did not intend to make relevant in informal decision-making processes. In agency adjudication, a stricter standard is applied where an appearance of impropriety can taint the proceeding. Courts require pressure to be directed at the ultimate decisionmaker regarding the merits of the case before intervening. Part III of the report examines the ethics and conflict of interest rules for Members of Congress and their staff intervening in administrative matters. Congressional intervention is recognized as a legitimate oversight function. The ethical and statutory conduct restraints for Members of Congress focus on preventing improper enrichment or financial benefits from official actions, as well as coercion or promises of favoritism. There are also broad ethical guidelines regarding the acceptance of gifts, favors, donations, and benefits that could raise concerns. Members of Congress are advised to avoid any appearance of a connection between campaign contributions and their official interventions. They should establish procedures to ensure decisions are based on merit, not on the receipt of contributions. The case law establishes limits to congressional influence in agency proceedings, with key cases such as Pillsbury Co. v. FTC and D.C. Federation of Civic Associations v. Volpe. However, determining if these limits have been breached in specific instances is often challenging due to limited court decisions and reluctance of courts. The analysis of court decisions in cases involving congressional influence reveals a consistent pattern despite limited court rulings and lack of congressional representation. Factors such as the nature of the proceeding, political pressure on decision-makers, and the purpose of political intercession play a role in court determinations. This report will explore how courts are establishing standards for future cases based on existing case law. The law of undue influence in administrative proceedings is complex and evolving, with courts cautious about political interference. Case law provides guidelines for analysis, especially in cases resembling judicial action or formal rulemaking. In administrative proceedings, insulation of decision-makers from political influence is justified by due process. Judicial intervention is less justified in informal rulemaking resembling the legislative process. The courts do not mechanically apply categorizations, considering each case individually. The courts determine the type of proceeding and apply relevant factors, focusing on adjudication or rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act. Insulation from political influence is justified in administrative proceedings for due process. Judicial intervention is less justified in informal rulemaking resembling the legislative process. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) distinguishes between adjudication and rulemaking, each with different procedural requirements. Adjudication involves the formulation of orders, while rulemaking is the process of creating, amending, or repealing rules. Orders are final dispositions by agencies, while rules are statements that implement laws or policies. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) distinguishes between adjudication and rulemaking. Rulemaking involves the approval or prescription for the future of various aspects such as rates, wages, prices, and policies, while adjudication deals with past and present rights and liabilities. Adjudication is like a judicial trial, focusing on past actions and resulting in an order for or against a party. Rulemaking, on the other hand, involves formulating policies for future application to all involved in regulated activities. Administrative processes can be informal or formal, with informal rulemaking allowing for public participation after a proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. Formal rulemaking under the APA requires a trial-type hearing with the opportunity for parties to present evidence and cross-examine. Judicial review of formal rulemaking decisions must be supported by substantial evidence on the record. Formal adjudication under the APA involves a trial-like hearing where parties can present evidence and cross-examine. Judicial review is based on the substantial evidence standard. Informal adjudication, not covered by section 554, lacks the protections of a formal trial but still implicates constitutional due process. The courts recognize that issues of general policy implicate constitutional due process values. Informal adjudications must conform to the principles of fairness in due process. Judicial review of agency decisions is based on the arbitrary and capricious standard under the APA. Informal decisionmaking, which constitutes the majority of government actions, does not involve evidentiary hearings or formal records. Informal action is the primary mode of government operation, accounting for a significant majority of government actions. Only a small fraction of federal government actions are based on evidentiary hearings, with informal action prevailing in importance. Courts have given special attention to informal decision-making processes. Investigation plays a crucial role in shaping administrative actions, both in informal and formal proceedings. Administrative agencies must have lawful authorization to demand information for investigations, with constitutional limitations in place. Courts generally defer to agency discretion in conducting investigations, except in cases of bad faith or abuse of the judicial process. The identification and categorization of proceedings are deemed significant in relevant case law. The 1966 decision in Pillsbury Company v. Federal Trade Commission highlighted the issue of impermissible congressional influence in agency adjudicatory proceedings. Senators' intense interrogation of FTC officials during a Senate subcommittee hearing on an antitrust case involving Pillsbury Company led to a divestiture order being deemed invalid due to tainted decisional process. The Senate committee criticized the FTC for its interpretation of the Clayton Act in Pillsbury's favor. The Commission later ruled against Pillsbury as suggested by the Committee. The appeals court deemed the Senate inquiry as improper intrusion into the Commission's adjudicatory process, emphasizing the need for fair trial and impartiality in judicial proceedings. The subcommittee's action was criticized for potentially compromising the impartiality of decisionmakers. Congressional intervention in an agency's judicial function raises concerns about fair trials and the appearance of impartiality. Administrators should be free from external influences when making decisions in pending cases. The Senate subcommittee's criticism of a judge's decision in a pending case may compromise impartiality in American judicial justice. Congressional intervention in agency decisions raises concerns about fairness and impartiality. Officials should be free from external influences when making decisions. The intrusion into the adjudicatory process by Congress can compromise impartiality in judicial justice. D.C. Federation of Civic Associations v. Volpe provides insight on the boundaries of permissible congressional action in influencing administrative decisions. The court found that the Secretary did not comply with statutory requirements for the Three Sisters Bridge construction approval. Additionally, there were concerns about external pressures influencing the decision-making process, specifically threats from a congressional subcommittee chairman. Judge Bazelon believed that external pressures were sufficient to invalidate the Secretary's approval of the bridge project, regardless of statutory compliance. Judge Fahy disagreed, stating that critical determinations should not be affected by allegations of pressure. The disagreement between the judges was not about the law but about the district court's findings. The District Court's decision was not based on whether extraneous pressure influenced the Secretary, but on the need for new determinations to be made strictly on the merits without any outside considerations. Judge Bazelon and Judge Fahy agreed that any external congressional influences impacting an agency decision would render it invalid. The District Court's decision focused on ensuring that agency actions are based solely on merits without external influences. The Secretary's action was not considered judicial or quasi-judicial, making certain legal doctrines irrelevant. If bias or pressure had been present, arguments could have been made against the decision's validity. In judicial decision-making, the appearance of bias or pressure can also be problematic. The Secretary's action was not judicial or legislative, making certain legal doctrines irrelevant. The approval of the bridge by the District of Columbia City Council cannot be invalidated based on motives, as the court does not sit in judgment of legislative decisions. The City Council's approval of the project was deemed sufficient by the District's legislative body. The Secretary's decision was not purely judicial or legislative, falling between the two, but still governed by basic principles. If his decision considered irrelevant factors, it was based on an erroneous premise. The court viewed undue influence cases on a continuum, with the standard of conduct depending on the nature of the case. If a proceeding involves judicial functions, the highest standard is required. If it is purely legislative, a showing of interference with impartiality is necessary. The Secretary's decision fell between judicial and legislative, and if it considered irrelevant factors, it was based on an erroneous premise. In cases of purely legislative policymaking, courts are highly deferential to political processes. In informal decision-making, interference claims require a showing of actual effect. The rulings in Pillsbury and D.C. Federation have been criticized for not considering the values of the political process. Professor Richard J. Pierce, Jr.'s influential 1990 article reflects practical concerns about the Pillsbury court decision. Pierce agrees that the decision was defensible, but raises issues of fact being adjudicatory and intense interrogation creating pressure. He suggests that the FTC may have resolved facts against Pillsbury in response to congressional attacks. Pierce criticizes the 5th Circuit for not deciding the case on narrow grounds. Professor Richard J. Pierce, Jr. argues that congressional investigations into an agency's decision-making processes could interfere with its adjudicatory function. He believes that applying a broad prohibition in such cases could lead to findings influenced by congressional pressure, undermining the political process of policymaking. Pierce emphasizes that the FTC should be free to change its policy based on legislators' views, as this is a normal part of the political process. Professor Richard J. Pierce, Jr. argues that the judiciary should not interfere with the FTC's policy changes based on legislators' views. He believes that political process values should prevail over judicial process values, except when an individual is targeted. Pierce criticizes the D.C. Federation case for involving a political dispute over transportation funds allocation between the agency and Congress. The D.C. Federation case involved a political dispute over transportation funds allocation between the agency and Congress. A compromise was reached to build both a subway and a bridge, but the appeals court intervened, citing impermissible bias due to legislative branch pressure. Professor Pierce questions the interference of the judiciary in the FTC's policy changes based on legislators' views. The case highlights the importance of constant policy compromises between the executive and legislative branches to govern effectively. The Constitution established a system of shared policymaking, with features like the President's role in legislation and the Senate's approval of officials. Professor Pierce's pragmatic views have influenced undue influence case law since the Pillsbury decision. Pierce's pragmatic views have influenced case law since the Pillsbury decision. Recent judicial rulings show a tendency to defer to congressional actions involving legislative oversight. In Koniag v. Kleppe, a district court set aside decisions of the Secretary of the Interior due to improper congressional pressure. The congressional subcommittee held oversight hearings on the administration of the Act, which the district court found went beyond oversight. The hearings delved into contested cases and the rule-making process, probing details and seeking information on pending proceedings. The congressional subcommittee conducted oversight hearings on the administration of the Act, delving into contested cases and the rule-making process. The Committee questioned the accuracy of data and procedures, interjected into decision-making processes, and expressed doubts about the proper implementation of the law. The Chairman encouraged protest and appeals, indicating that some results were contrary to congressional intent. The Chairman requested a review by the Comptroller General before the Secretary's determination on village eligibility. The district court vacated the Secretary's decisions, reinstating the BIA's initial decisions. The appeals court disagreed with the lower court's application of the law but not its validity. The Chairman's conduct during the hearings was criticized by the appeals court. The appeals court found fault with the Chairman's conduct during the hearings called by Congressman Dingell in June 1974. None of the agency officials interrogated were decisionmakers in the cases discussed. The Pillsbury decision was deemed not applicable as none of the individuals called before the subcommittee were decisionmakers. The appeals court criticized the Chairman's conduct during hearings in June 1974. Agency officials present were not decisionmakers in the cases discussed. The court found the Chairman's letter compromised the Secretary's impartiality, leading to a remand of the matter for a fair review by a new Secretary. Courts have upheld congressional intercessions in adjudicatory proceedings against political influence challenges. In Gulf Oil Corporation v. FPC, petitioners challenged a Federal Power Commission order for more natural gas delivery. The appeals court rejected claims of improper interference by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. The court recognized the legislative importance of congressional committees in oversight and investigation. The court found that congressional oversight of regulatory agencies is important, and in the case at hand, the subcommittee's actions did not interfere with the agency's decision-making process. The court distinguished this case from a previous one involving Pillsbury, noting that the subcommittee's focus was on expediting the agency's compliance procedures rather than influencing specific decisions. The court determined that any intrusion into the agency's decision-making was minimal and did not significantly impact the outcome. The court found that the subcommittee's actions did not interfere with the agency's decision-making process, as the agency did not accede to Members' requests and continued with the show cause proceeding. The court concluded that the claim of prejudice could not be sustained under the facts and circumstances of the case, highlighting the importance of Congressional oversight of regulatory agencies and the agency's strong backbone in resisting subcommittee pressure. In Peter Kiewit Sons ' Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the court ruled that legislative conduct did not affect the fairness of the Commission's proceedings. The plaintiff claimed a Senator's involvement compromised the integrity of the debarment proceeding, but the court reversed the district court's decision. The District of Columbia Circuit Court reversed a decision regarding a debarment proceeding, stating that pressure on the decisionmaker alone could invalidate a proceeding. The court found no evidence of congressional interference in the case, as the Senator had not directly communicated with the decisionmaker. This ruling was in line with a previous case rejecting challenged congressional communications in an adjudicatory setting. In Power Authority of the State of New York v. FERC, a series of decisions by FERC were challenged due to alleged ex parte communications between four Members of Congress and FERC officials regarding the allocation of power from the Niagara River. The communications included a letter from two House Members to President Reagan, which was forwarded to FERC, and a press conference where the defendants urged reversal of a decision. Despite claims of tainting the proceeding, FERC denied a motion for rehearing. The Commission denied a motion for rehearing in a case involving ex parte communications with Congressmen. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the appeal, stating that recusal would only be necessary if the communications posed a serious likelihood of affecting the agency's ability to act fairly and impartially. The Commission denied a motion for rehearing in a case involving ex parte communications with Congressmen. The communications did not contain new evidence, were not secret, and MEUA had the opportunity to respond. The Commission properly denied MEUA's motion. The Commission properly denied MEUA's motion in a case involving ex parte communications with Congressmen, emphasizing the courts' trend not to interfere with congressional attempts to influence quasi-adjudicatory proceedings. In State of California v. FERC, a hydroelectric facility license applicant challenged the award of a conditioned license due to undue influence from the Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The agency did not follow the new dispute resolution procedures under the Federal Power Act. FERC reopened negotiations with State and federal fish and wildlife agencies in response to complaints. The Chairman urged the agency to review its interpretation of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, which was supported by a report from the General Accounting Office. FERC initially rejected the Chairman's view but later reversed its decision during the licensing process. The appeals court rejected objections to FERC's decision to open the dispute resolution process after receiving the GAO report, stating it did not show undue congressional influence. FERC's change in interpretation of FLPMA was deemed necessary to establish fair procedures for the parties involved. The court upheld FERC's decision to open the dispute resolution process after the GAO report, stating it did not show undue congressional influence. The court explained that FERC provided a reasoned explanation for its reversal of its interpretation of FLPMA, supporting its claim of addressing the right-of-way issue independently. The court found that intense congressional opposition did not influence the decision-making process. The intense opposition of Members of Congress to ATX's application to operate a new airline did not fatally flaw the DOT proceeding. Congressional opposition was based on Frank Lorenzo's reputation, leading to DOT's denial of the application due to ATX's alleged unfitness. The Department of Transportation (DOT) rejected ATX's application to operate a new airline due to concerns about managerial competence and regulatory compliance. Congressional opposition, led by Members of Congress, was based on Frank Lorenzo's reputation. The court acknowledged the congressional opposition towards the applicant in a quasi-judicial proceeding required close scrutiny to address due process concerns. Congressional pressure challenged by ATX was deemed insufficient under the established framework. The court found that the congressional pressure challenged by ATX was not enough to invalidate the adjudication. The court emphasized that the decision was based on the administrative record and not influenced by external factors. The testimony of the congressman did not create bias, as it was already known to the ALJ and not relied upon in the final decision. The court concluded that the congressional pressure did not affect the outcome, as the decision was based on the administrative record and not influenced by external factors. The testimony of the congressman was known to the ALJ but not relied upon in the final decision. The court found that political influence did not impact the decision on ATX's airline certificate eligibility. The case involved a FPC ratemaking process under section 553 of the APA, with Representative John Moss questioning the Commissioners. Despite congressional pressure, the decision was based on the administrative record and not influenced by external factors. Opinion 770 faced criticism despite the Commission's warning that decisions were subject to reconsideration. Chairman Moss expressed strong opposition to Order 770, questioning its fairness and reasonableness. The court noted adversarial questioning by the Subcommittee Counsel regarding cost analysis, leading to claims of prejudice. The court considered disqualifying the Commission, referencing the Pillsbury case and its implications. The court expressed doubts about classifying the ratemaking process by the Power Commission as solely judicial, legislative, or a combination of both. It emphasized the need for impartial decision-making and warned against Congressional intervention during agency decision-making. Despite acknowledging the importance of decisional integrity, the court did not disqualify the agency due to the producers' failure to request it. The court emphasized the need for impartial decision-making in the ratemaking process by the Power Commission. It stated that a party cannot stay silent with knowledge of bias and then seek reversal of an unfavorable decision. The court considered the seriousness of the interference but ultimately did not disqualify the agency. The court's decision in the case focused on the lack of actual influence of congressional intervention on the agency's decision regarding income tax. The court considered the proceeding similar to D.C. Federation and emphasized impartial decision-making by the Power Commission. In Town of Orangetown v. Ruckelshaus, the Town sought to prevent the EPA and NYSDEC from approving grants to modernize a sewage treatment plant due to political pressure. The Second Circuit required proof that political pressure influenced the agency's action in non-adjudicatory proceedings involving fund disbursement. The court emphasized that elected officials could bring relevant factors to the EPA's attention. The EPA decision on imposing conditions for grants was deemed administrative, not adjudicatory, in Town of Orangetown v. Ruckelshaus. Elected officials can bring factors to administrators' attention, as seen in Sierra Club v. Costle. Orangetown's claims of political influence lacked evidence. Due process was not violated in communications with public officials. Chemung County v. Dole involved a contract dispute with the FAA. The contract for a station was initially awarded to Elmira, New York but later given to Buffalo, New York due to alleged political pressure from two New York congressmen. The appeals court found no undue political influence, stating that the congressmen's efforts were limited to writing letters and meeting with investigators. The FAA had the right to suspend a contract pending an audit, and ultimately awarded it to NFTA as they had submitted the lowest bid. The FAA was obligated to award the contract to NFTA as per statutory regulations. The Representatives' letter urged the FAA to re-evaluate telecommunications cost estimates in line with GAO findings. The letter aimed to ensure compliance with statutory obligations. In DCP Farms et al v. Yeutter, the 5th Circuit addressed potential political influence in denying farm subsidy payments. Prior to a Department of Agriculture adjudication, farm subsidy payments were influenced by a powerful congressman, leading to a potential $1.4 million subsidy for DCP Farms. The Inspector General's report highlighted DCP Farms as violating the $50,000 per person limit, attracting attention from the House Agriculture Committee. In late 1989, the House Agriculture Committee discussed issues raised by the IG report, specifically mentioning DCP Farms. The Chairman wrote to the Secretary of Agriculture about abuses in the subsidy program, citing DCP Farms as an example. The Secretary assured the Chairman that the DCP Farms case was under review and that the Department would take aggressive action. In June 1990, an administrative decision found that DCP Farms had evaded payment limitation provisions. DCP Farms was found to have evaded payment limitation provisions and was deemed ineligible for subsidy payments for the 1989, 1990, and 1991 crop years. Despite appealing and requesting a hearing, the Fifth Circuit rejected their argument, stating that political oversight is necessary in issues entrusted to agency decisionmakers. The hearing was successfully enjoined on the grounds of improper congressional interference. The court rejected DCP Farms' application for farm subsidy payments due to their abandonment of the administrative process. Congressman Huckaby's concern was about the administration of a congressionally created program, not the decision-making process. Applying Pillsbury's bias standard at this stage would hinder Congressional oversight and restrict administrative processes unnecessarily. The court emphasized the importance of not restricting communications between Congress and executive agencies over policy issues. The standard for evaluating such cases is whether the communication actually influenced the agency's decision, rather than focusing on the appearance of bias. This approach recognizes that members of Congress may have varying degrees of involvement in administrative proceedings, and it would be unrealistic to expect agencies to ignore their input. The agency's duty is to give congressional comments deference based on merit, without being influenced by extraneous factors like political pressure. Congressional interference should not impair agency flexibility in dealing with Congress. The focus should be on whether the communication actually influenced the agency's decision, rather than the appearance of bias. The force of logic and ideas carries its own pressure, not extraneous. Congressional views on laws and subsidies are not impermissible political pressure. DCP Farms cannot ignore administrative procedures. Previous court cases have found impermissible congressional intervention in agency proceedings. In Texas Medical Association v. Mathews, the court considered congressional pressure invalidating a decision of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare dividing Texas into nine Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSRO). HEW initially planned for one statewide PSRO but changed to nine after a meeting with Senator Wallace Bennett and a Senate Finance Committee staff member. The court questioned the sudden reversal without adequate explanation from HEW. The court found evidence of undue influence by Congressional sources in HEW's decision to change the number of PSROs in Texas. The court applied the principle that agency action is invalid if influenced by Congressional pressure, especially when financial leverage is involved. This decision was deemed inconsistent with the D.C. Federation principle. Judge Bazelon noted that courts give absolute deference to legislative actions, specifically by the D.C. Council. However, when similar actions are taken by an administrative agency, courts accord great but not absolute deference due to lack of direct accountability to the electorate. In Mathews, evidence of congressional intrusions overcame the agency's decision presumption. This ruling is not inconsistent with D.C. Federation but differs from U.S. ex rel Parco v. Morris and Sierra Club v. Costle. The case of U.S. ex rel Parco v. Morris involved a challenge by deportable aliens to the rescission of a longstanding operating instruction by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The change in policy was influenced by Representative Peter Rodino, but the court rejected the challenge based on its interpretation of the D.C. Federation. The court rejected a challenge based on a congressman's threat to withhold funds unless an agency official complied, emphasizing the importance of the nature of the proceeding. Judge Bazelon's analysis distinguished between \"judicial\" or \"quasi-judicial\" agency actions and \"legislative\" actions, noting that extraneous influences undermine fairness in adjudication. The court distinguished between \"judicial\" or \"quasi-judicial\" agency actions and \"legislative\" actions, emphasizing that extraneous influences can undermine fairness in adjudication. In cases of purely \"legislative\" agency actions, decisions cannot be invalidated based on impermissible motivations, requiring a more stringent standard of proof. The court ruled that in cases of \"purely\" legislative actions, a more stringent standard of proof is required to invalidate decisions based on impermissible motivations. The seminal case in this line is Sierra Club v. Costle, where the court found that political pressure exerted during the rulemaking process did not warrant setting aside a rule. The court emphasized that there must be a showing that extraneous considerations affected the decision-making process. The court found that post-comment period communications, including oral conversations with private parties and government officials, were vital to the effectiveness of governmental processes. The court emphasized that in cases of general policymaking, the concept of ex parte contacts is of questionable utility and refused to require the docketing of all post-comment period conversations. The legitimacy of governmental processes relies on openness, accessibility, and responsiveness to public needs. Judges should not dismiss lobbying efforts solely based on their context. Continuing contact with regulated industries and affected groups is crucial for effective regulation. The court emphasized the importance of public input in regulatory processes, requiring oral comments of central relevance to be included in the record. The Environmental Defense Fund expressed concerns about the agency's discretion in determining the significance of oral communications, but acknowledged EPA's authority to decide which documents are relevant for the docket. The court emphasized the importance of public input in regulatory processes, requiring oral comments of central relevance to be included in the record. The appeals court concluded that a blanket requirement for all post-comment period oral communications to be docketed would contravene limited powers of review and stifle experimentation by Congress and agencies. Non-docketed post-comment meetings, including those with the Senate majority leader and the President, were deemed unnecessary to be docketed. The court emphasized the importance of public input in regulatory processes, requiring oral comments of central relevance to be included in the record. It stated that before an administrative rulemaking could be overturned simply on the grounds of political pressure, it had to be shown that the pressure was designed to force decisions on factors not relevant by Congress and that the determination made must be affected by extraneous considerations. The court found that although the majority leader expressed his views strongly on the rulemaking, there was no evidence of commitments made or the use of extraneous pressures to further his position. The court upheld the Senator's efforts in rulemaking as part of the political process, allowing representatives to voice grievances. It is proper for Congress to represent constituents before agencies, as long as they stay focused on the rule's substance. Agencies must balance Congressional pressure with other sources to maintain legitimacy. The court upheld the Senator's role in rulemaking as part of the political process, allowing representatives to voice grievances. It is essential for agencies to consider various sources of information for legitimacy, even if influenced by political considerations or Presidential input. Agencies sometimes resist congressional oversight of investigations to prevent potential compromise of open cases by disclosing internal documents. This resistance is based on the fear that such disclosures could be used by attorneys to argue that investigations are politically motivated. The appellate court ruling in SEC v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp is often cited to argue against agency contact with Members of Congress to avoid any appearance of influence. However, the ruling actually states that enforcement efforts can only be deemed an abuse of process if there is clear evidence of congressional influence and agency complicity. The SEC v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp case involved an informal investigation initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission after a Senator's letter suggested a violation. The court ruled that agency contact with Congress is only an abuse of process if there is clear evidence of influence and complicity. The SEC ordered a formal investigation of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp after a Senator's letter suggested a violation. The company's CEO refused to answer certain questions in response to a subpoena, claiming it was issued in bad faith and for harassment. The district court refused to enforce the subpoena, rejecting the claim of bad faith. The court refused to enforce the subpoena issued to Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp, citing concerns about biased third parties influencing the investigation process. The Third Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that administrative subpoenas should be enforced if issued in good faith pursuit of a statutorily authorized purpose. The Third Circuit en banc remanded the case to the district court in light of its ruling that administrative subpoenas should not be enforced if issued due to congressional influence and agency knowledge of abuse. Members of Congress often intrude in administrative proceedings, impacting the process. The IRS must execute tax laws faithfully and balance congressional oversight with executive powers. The duty of the SEC is to consider information provided to it. The SEC is obligated to consider information provided to it by congressmen but should only give congressional comments as much deference as they deserve. An administrative agency conducting an extensive investigation at the behest of a powerful Senator without reasonable expectation of proving a violation, and then seeking federal court enforcement of its subpoena, could be seen as using the judiciary for illicit purposes. The appeals court clarified that agency acquiescence in an abuse of its own process may lead to a finding of abuse of the court's process, even if bad faith is not the sole basis for denial of enforcement. The court emphasized that the focus in a challenge to an administrative subpoena should be on the agency's own motivation, not that of third parties. It stated that finding \"institutional\" bad faith, rather than individual agent bad faith, is necessary. The court questioned whether the SEC's actions were based on objective factors. The court questioned whether the SEC's decision to investigate was independent or influenced by external factors, emphasizing the need for objective determination. The origin of investigations based on tips from third parties, even with ulterior motives, does not negate enforcement of subpoenas. However, initiating a formal investigation solely due to political pressure, without Commission's objective assessment, is different. The respondents are entitled to a decision by the SEC free from political pressure, based on an independent agency determination. If allegations of improper influence are credible, respondents can challenge the SEC's private investigation order. The court's focus is on the judicial process, and respondents can challenge the summons on any appropriate ground. The Third Circuit requires litigants to establish a factual basis for claims of political pressure tainting investigative proceedings. The Wheeling-Pittsburgh case represents a liberalization in court review of agency subpoena enforcement requests, criticized by some courts. Some courts still adhere to the traditional standard of high deference to agency subpoena issuance decisions. The Wheeling-Pittsburgh case may have limited impact outside the Third Circuit, as no court has used its standard to reject enforcing an administrative subpoena due to alleged congressional influence. Courts have applied this rationale in cases involving subpoenas by the Department of Energy. The defendant company claimed improper influence by a congressional committee on agency decisions to issue subpoenas, but courts rejected the claims. In United States v. Armada Petroleum Corp., the court found that congressional involvement aimed at accelerating regulatory enforcement did not affect the fairness of the agency's proceedings. The 4th Circuit in United States v. American Target Advertising, Inc. rejected the defendant's claim that an investigative subpoena was harassment. The court stated that bad faith must be proven by the party initiating the investigation, which was not the case here. Discovery was denied by the appeals court, emphasizing that it is prohibited in summary enforcement proceedings without extraordinary circumstances. The 4th Circuit in United States v. American Target Advertising, Inc. denied discovery, stating that extraordinary circumstances are required to obtain it. The court emphasized that the target must distinguish themselves from an ordinary respondent to be entitled to discovery. The court concluded that American Target failed to do so and therefore was not entitled to discovery regarding the genesis of the Postal Service's inquiry. The Wheeling-Pittsburgh precedent does not establish an \"appearance of partiality\" standard with respect to congressional contacts. A high degree of proof is needed to show that an agency's motivation in continuing an investigation is solely due to congressional influence. The courts have shown a strong inclination to accept congressional influence in agency decision-making processes, especially in informal rulemaking. They intervene only when political pressure forces consideration of factors by the agency decision-maker. The courts intervene in agency decision-making processes when political pressure forces consideration of factors by the decision-maker, with a stricter standard applied in agency adjudication. Congressional intrusion in an agency's investigative process leads to court intervention only if it is shown that the inquiry was influenced by Congress and the agency knowingly allowed abuse to occur. The 1989 legal commentary criticizes the trend of Congress intervening in agency proceedings, arguing that it allows for manipulation of the actual influence standard. Judge Gesell stated that proving agency influence by congressional intervention is virtually impossible. The author suggests applying the \"appearance of impartiality\" standard to address this issue. The comment criticizes Congress's use of informal oversight mechanisms to influence agency proceedings, suggesting that it circumvents the Constitution and the Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha. It argues that if Congress believes an agency has misinterpreted a statute, the proper response is to amend the law formally, not through informal means. The comment criticizes Congress's use of informal oversight mechanisms to influence agency proceedings, suggesting it circumvents the Constitution and the Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha. Congress has the authority to create the bureaucratic infrastructure of the Executive branch and determine the nature, scope, and power of the duties. The Supreme Court has broadened the legislative power over offices. Congress has plenary power over offices, including creation, location, powers, duties, and oversight. The courts intervene only if the exercise of power is deemed unconstitutional. Congress can effectively monitor its creations and compel information when needed. Congress has plenary power to compel information from executive agencies and individuals, influence governmental conduct, and express opinions to influence law execution. The courts have recognized Congress' authority to investigate and influence executive actions without improper control. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress' right to investigate the Government's conduct of civil and criminal litigation, as seen in the case of McGrain v. Daugherty. The Court supported the Senate's action in citing the brother of the Attorney General for contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena related to the investigation. The investigation focused on whether the Attorney General and his assistants were fulfilling their duties in prosecuting crimes and enforcing remedies, a matter within the Senate's jurisdiction for potential legislation. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress' right to investigate the Government's conduct of civil and criminal litigation. The courts have recognized the potentially prejudicial effect congressional hearings can have on pending cases, but agencies may not deny Congress access to agency documents. Congressional publicity may harm prosecutorial efforts. Congressional oversight and investigatory authority can be fulfilled through access to information under secure conditions, without necessarily interfering with the Executive's prosecutorial efforts. The decisional law development in this area mirrors the broad oversight power that courts have granted Congress over Executive agencies. The courts balance Congress' constitutional prerogatives with the interests of agencies or private parties involved. In a non-adjudicatory setting involving general policymaking, congressional prerogatives are likely to be weighed and found persuasive unless countervailing constitutional privileges of the President are implicated or applicable statutory considerations are ignored due to pressure. The Sierra Club court outlined conditions for overturning a rulemaking due to congressional pressure, emphasizing that decisions must not be influenced by extraneous factors forced by Congress. In informal policy rulemaking, Congressional representatives can advocate for constituents as long as they do not go against Congress's intent or procedural rules. Judicial sensitivity to political pressure in agency adjudications is based on protecting individual rights and due process values. Both public and secret congressional influence on agency decisions can potentially violate due process rights. Congressional attempts to influence agency decisionmaking may undermine due process rights in informal adjudications by depriving parties of notice and the opportunity to respond, compromising impartiality and objectivity. Judicial deference to congressional prerogatives is evident, with taint only found if pressure directly affects the decisionmaker, concerns the case's merits, and is significant. The Gulf Oil MEUA, California v. FERC, and ATX litigations exemplify these principles. The Gulf Oil MEUA, California v. FERC, and ATX litigations demonstrate how congressional influence on agency decision-making can impact due process rights in adjudications. Taint was only found when pressure directly affected the decision-maker, concerned the case's merits, and was significant. In Gulf Oil, the court determined that the subcommittee interrogations did not influence the agency's decision, and the agency maintained its impartiality. In the MEUA case, the Second Circuit found minimal ex parte communications that were promptly disclosed to the public and did not contain new factual information. In California v. FERC and ATX cases, congressional intercessions were meant to correct procedural problems and question the agency's application of legal standards. The court emphasized that agency determinations were based on independent analysis of congressional objections with reasoned explanations. In ATX, intense congressional pressure did not taint the proceeding as it did not affect the outcome, with no threats and decision-maker insulation noted. The court emphasized the importance of protecting the integrity of the agency's decision-making process, looking for evidence that the agency itself ensured fair proceedings. Courts tend to uphold agency actions unless there is direct interference with the decision-maker or significant congressional influence that impacts the outcome. Since the Pillsbury decision in 1966, only one successful challenge based on adjudicatory interference (Koniag v. Andrus) and one tainted rulemaking (Texas Medical Association v. Mathews) have been noted. Judicial deference in this area aims to maintain Congress' ability to communicate freely with administrative agencies, with tainted proceedings resulting in a remand for reconsideration. The administrative bureaucracy is crucial for the public acceptability of the modern administrative state. The perception of Congress having control over agencies is key for legitimacy. Public accountability is through Congress, and restrictions on its power reduce agency accountability and erode popular sovereignty. Legislative intrusions into the administrative process are seen negatively by administrators. The report discusses the importance of congressional supervision over agency actions in a democratic society. It also addresses ethical considerations when a Member of Congress intervenes in administrative matters on behalf of constituents. The traditional role of a Member of Congress as a representative is highlighted in this context. The traditional role of a Member of Congress as a representative to constituents involves contacting government agencies and intervening in administrative matters on their behalf. This practice is seen as a key responsibility beyond legislative acts, rooted in the concept of checks and balances in a representative democracy. Senator Paul Douglas emphasized the ethical context of congressional intervention in his work Ethics in Government. In a representative democracy, members of Congress often deal with constituents' requests regarding administrative matters, which is discouraged in countries dominated by civil servants like imperial Germany and Great Britain. The bureaucracy in these countries believes legislators make laws while public administrators administer them, without interference from each other. This attitude towards civil servants as devoted public servants contrasts with the perception of legislators as \"impure.\" In contrast to the perception of legislators as \"impure,\" there is a deep distrust of democratic government and processes by those advocating for an \"administrative state\" where power is held by self-selecting officials. However, there is an ethical basis for legislators to represent the interests of constituents in dealings with administrative bodies, as well as a practical necessity for it. The American people have always been hesitant to fully trust their individual or collective interests to others. The American people rely on elected representatives, not civil servants, to protect their interests from a self-perpetuating bureaucracy. The service function of representing constituents before federal agencies is a major responsibility of Members of Congress today. Members of Congress negotiate on behalf of their constituents with the Federal government, assisting with various issues such as obtaining federal contracts, resolving problems with Social Security checks, and arranging meetings with officials. This intervention is not seen as improper influence but rather a discretionary and expected function of their role. Members of Congress act as intermediaries between constituents and government agencies, with the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics emphasizing the importance of this role. While there are opportunities for abuse, there are statutory and ethical constraints in place to regulate these activities. Members of Congress and their staff have restrictions on receiving compensation for representational activities, as ruled by the Supreme Court. The Court clarified that such activities are within the Member's discretion and not violative of statutory restraints as long as no compensation is accepted. The Supreme Court ruled that Members of Congress can engage in representational activities without interference with their duties, as long as they do not receive compensation. Ethical considerations include accepting gifts from individuals or groups involved in interventions or inquiries to federal agencies. Members and staff must exercise prudence in accepting gifts. Members of Congress and staff must be cautious when accepting gifts from private individuals or groups, especially if it could be seen as a reward for assisting constituents with federal agencies. Campaign contributions are more common and acceptable, but questions arise when contributions come from those who have been helped with federal matters. Restrictions exist regarding payments or gifts in exchange for representational activities or personal interests in a matter. General ethical considerations and guidelines aim to prevent undue influence by legislative branch members over executive officers and employees. These guidelines are based on the separation of powers doctrine, due process, fairness in administrative proceedings, and the misuse of political influence in decision-making processes. Certain executive decisions, like federal contracts and civil service hiring, must be made based on competitive merit principles or specific statutory criteria. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in 1973 incorporated ethical standards into an advisory opinion on Members' offices communicating with federal agencies. Members can communicate with agencies for various reasons like requesting information, urging prompt consideration, arranging interviews, expressing judgment, and calling for reconsideration. Members can communicate with federal agencies for interviews, appointments, expressing judgment, and calling for reconsideration of administrative responses not supported by law. The overall public interest should be prioritized, and Members should uphold standards of conduct, avoiding favoritism or reprisal. The Senate Rule, Rule 43, allows Senators to assist petitioners with executive and independent government officials and agencies. This Rule was adopted in response to disciplinary proceedings involving Senators intervening in executive branch investigations. A Member of the Senate or a Senate employee can communicate with government officials on various matters, such as requesting information, urging prompt consideration, arranging appointments, expressing judgments, and providing other services. Assistance to petitioners should not be based on political contributions or personal interests. Senators should ensure accuracy in representations made by Senate employees on their behalf. The rule ensures accurate representations by Senate employees in a Member's name and allows Members and staff to perform legislative responsibilities. Ethical concerns arise regarding receiving things of value in connection with services, potentially implicating criminal laws and ethical guidelines. The bribery statute penalizes public officials who corruptly seek or accept anything of value in return for being influenced in official acts. This includes illegal gratuities and covers a broad range of items like cash, gifts, discounts, or campaign contributions. The bribery statute prohibits public officials from seeking or accepting anything of value in exchange for being influenced in official acts, including gifts, contributions, or benefits for third parties. The statute requires that the thing of value be \"corruptly\" received or sought by the official in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act. A bribe involves a corrupt bargain or agreement where something is given in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act. It must be the prime mover of the act and not just a general contribution or goodwill payment without a specific quid pro quo agreement. The federal bribery statute distinguishes between bribes and illegal gratuities. Illegal gratuities do not require a corrupt intent or a quid pro quo agreement. Instead, they involve a public official receiving something of value personally for or because of an official act. An illegal gratuity does not require a corrupt intent or a quid pro quo agreement, but it involves a public official receiving something of value personally for or because of an official act. An illegal gratuity involves a public official receiving something of value personally for or because of an official act, with the knowledge that they are being compensated for a specific act. The recipient must have guilty knowledge that the payment is for an official act, and evidence of this knowledge is sufficient for a bribery charge. The Supreme Court clarified in Sun-Diamond that \"status gifts\" unrelated to any official act do not constitute illegal gratuities. To violate the illegal gratuities clause, compensation must be received personally by the public official for their acts. Payments directed to third parties may not be considered as personal compensation. Members of Congress and government officials are prohibited from receiving compensation for representational services before any agency of the United States Government. Proof of compensation for services rendered is required, without the need to prove corrupt intent. In a case involving a Member of Congress contacting the War Department about military contracts, it was shown that receiving compensation for services rendered is a violation of the conflict of interest statute. The court found that receiving private compensation for representational services before any agency of the United States Government, even if the services were deemed proper, violated the conflict of interest statute. This was demonstrated in a case involving a Member of Congress contacting the War Department about military contracts. The court ruled that receiving private compensation for services related to matters in which the United States is interested, even if the services were proper, violates the conflict of interest statute. This includes cases where a Congressman receives payment for acts done for a private party that involve government departments. The key issue is the receipt of compensation, regardless of the nature of the act performed. The conflict of interest statute prohibits the receipt of compensation for services related to matters of interest to the United States, regardless of the nature of the act performed. Section 203 of the statute prohibits officers or employees from accepting compensation for representational services, even if not within their official duties, covering a broader range of activities than the illegal gratuities clause. This extends to sharing in or receiving compensation for someone else's representational services before a federal agency. The \"Hobbs Act\" prohibits interference with commerce through extortion, defined as obtaining property with consent induced by force, violence, or fear. Elected officials demanding payments from private citizens, even for campaign contributions, may violate the extortion provisions if there is wrongful use of their official position. Extortion and bribery under federal law are considered different sides of the same coin. Extortion and bribery under federal law, such as the \"Hobbs Act,\" are parallel in their intent requirements. The extortion provisions necessitate demonstrating a quid pro quo, where campaign contributions are exchanged for official acts. A conspiracy to defraud the United States, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7371, can encompass schemes to exert wrongful influence on government agencies. The conspiracy statute is broad and covers actions aimed at defrauding the U.S. impartially. A conspiracy to defraud the United States does not necessarily involve cheating the government out of money or property, but rather interfering with its lawful functions through deceit or trickery. It aims to obstruct the proper functioning of government agencies by misrepresentation or dishonest means. Conspiracy to defraud the United States involves obstructing lawful government functions through deceit or trickery. It requires an agreement to do an illegal act, knowledge of the conspiracy, and at least one overt act in furtherance of the scheme. Examples include improper attempts to influence federal agencies. Martin Sweig and Nathan Voloshen were charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States by exerting improper influence on government agencies. The indictment stated that they conspired to obstruct government functions by conducting business dishonestly and obstructing officials from transacting official business unhindered. The indictment charged Martin Sweig and Nathan Voloshen with misusing the Speaker of the House's office and pressuring federal agencies. They were accused of accepting fees to influence agencies on behalf of certain individuals and using the Speaker's resources for this purpose. The indictment accused Martin Sweig and Nathan Voloshen of misusing the Speaker of the House's office to influence federal agencies on behalf of individuals. Sweig acted as an agent for these individuals, while Voloshen falsely pretended to be a member of the Speaker's staff. Telephone calls and personal visits were used to express the Speaker's interest in these matters. Voloshen received fees for his representations, but Sweig, a congressional employee, did not. The court sustained the indictment against Sweig, who was not alleged to have taken money or other things for his part in the conspiracy. Sweig was acquitted on influence peddling charges but found guilty of perjury. Nathan Voloshen pleaded guilty to conspiracy and perjury charges. Defense counsel Smith argued that Sweig's actions in contacting federal agencies were customary on Capitol Hill and not unlawful, despite being found guilty of perjury. Smith emphasized that Congress had not criminalized Sweig's alleged acts, stating it would be unconstitutional for the judiciary to impose standards on legislative employees when Congress had not done so. In a separate case, United States v. Burgin, a conspiracy to defraud the government was upheld involving a former State senator and a current State Legislature member in a \"silent scheme.\" The court found that a State senator and a member of the State Legislature were involved in a \"silent scheme\" to influence a State agency administering federally financed contracts. The court determined that this constituted obstruction of a lawful governmental function and agreed with the government's charge that the scheme amounted to \"influence peddling\" by a public official with a financial interest in the contracts. The court found that a public official's financial interest in influencing agency decisions could lead to a charge of conspiracy to defraud. In cases of conflict of interest, breaching the duty of disinterested advocacy for personal gain may be considered wrongful, even if the means used are not improper. Campaign contributions are a necessary part of privately financed congressional campaigns and are considered legitimate and acceptable. The connection between official interventions and solicitation of campaign contributions is a persistent issue, but unlike personal gifts to officials, contributions have a facial legitimacy in our system of government. The House and Senate ethics committees state that campaign contributions are legitimate and necessary for Members of Congress to represent constituents before federal agencies. Members should not be prohibited from representing supporters, and interventions should be based on the merits of the matter and public interest, not on campaign support received. Campaign contributions can be considered a \"bribe\" if there is a corrupt agreement between parties for a specific official act in return for the contribution. The public official must be influenced to act in exchange for the campaign donation. The Supreme Court has noted that bribery is a blatant form of public corruption, and campaign contributions can be considered bribes if there is a corrupt bargain involved. Politicians are not completely unaware of the motivations behind campaign contributions, and contributions given in appreciation for official acts can also be seen as bribes. Campaign contributions can be considered bribes if there is a corrupt bargain involved, as noted by the Supreme Court. Contributions given in appreciation for official acts may also be seen as bribes, according to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Campaign contributions are not considered bribes unless there is an explicit agreement for an official act in exchange for the payment, as clarified by the Court of Appeals in United States v. Allen. Vague expectations of future benefits do not qualify as bribes in the context of political contributions. Judge John T. Noonan, Jr. discusses the concept of campaign contributions as a form of reciprocity and \"obligation\" in his work on the differences between donations and bribes. He highlights that contributions are given with the expectation that the recipient's views align with the giver's, leading to a tacit reciprocity. Campaign contributions are seen as imperfect gifts meant to express support for a cause, rather than personal relations. Campaign contributions are not absolute obligations and differ from bribes as they are given in response to work done or expected. There is a theory of \"reciprocity\" in political processes where legislators rely on donations from their constituents. Judge Noonan suggests that large campaign contributions may serve as an \"access\" payment in our system. In our system of private funding for campaigns, campaign contributions can be seen as a form of \"access\" payment. Large contributors may argue that they are not buying votes but seeking to ensure their views are heard. This payment establishes reciprocity and aims for favorable attention from legislators, similar to a bribe to a judge. However, the distinction lies in the fact that legislators are not held to the same standards as judges. The prevailing assumption in America is that campaign contributions are not the same as bribes, as there is an expected identity of interest between constituents and legislators. While there may be some tacit reciprocity, especially in terms of \"access\" to elected officials, it has not been considered enough to equate campaign contributions to bribes. The distinction between campaign contributions and bribes lies in the criminal intent required for an illegal gratuity, where no specific illegal bargain is needed but a wrongful receipt of payment is distinguished from a lawful campaign contribution. The court noted that campaign contributions are given to elected officials in support of their acts, but this does not necessarily equate to bribery. The criminal intent required for an illegal gratuity is a knowing and willful receipt of payment as \"compensation\" for doing an official act, with specific knowledge of the act intended to be compensated for. The payment must be made because of a specifically identified act, with guilty knowledge. The Supreme Court defines guilty knowledge as knowing that compensation is received for an official act. Evidence of this knowledge is crucial, along with showing that the compensation was received personally. Even if contributions were received with guilty knowledge, if directed to a lawful entity like a campaign committee or charitable organization, they may not be considered illegal. Campaign contributions for federal elections may not be considered as personal compensation for a Member of Congress if they are received for a campaign committee or charitable organization, rather than for personal use. Candidates and Members of Congress are prohibited from converting campaign contributions for personal use under federal law. In the Brewster case, illegal gratuity payments were made to a sham committee that was the \"alter ego\" of the Senator, allowing him to freely use the funds for personal use. These payments were distinguishable from legitimate campaign contributions, which are not considered illegal gratuities because they are not for the candidate's personal benefit. Contributions or payments made to a third party for official acts may be considered for personal benefit if used to financially enrich the Member. The Supreme Court distinguishes between legitimate campaign contributions and illegal gratuities, requiring evidence of a quid pro quo for extortion to occur. The Supreme Court distinguishes between legitimate campaign contributions and illegal gratuities, requiring evidence of a quid pro quo for extortion to occur. In McCormick v. United States, the Court clarified that the timing of campaign contributions in relation to official acts does not necessarily indicate extortion, emphasizing the need for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official in exchange for the contributions. The Supreme Court in McCormick clarified that legislators do not commit extortion when acting for the benefit of constituents or supporting legislation, even if campaign contributions are received from those beneficiaries. Extortion requires evidence of a quid pro quo, not just the timing of contributions. The Supreme Court clarified that campaign contributions made with the hope of favorable treatment in the future do not constitute extortion without evidence of a quid pro quo. The Hobbs Act prohibits arrangements where official action is exchanged for money, beyond mere anticipation. It is unclear if a conspiracy to defraud the government exists if the connection between campaign contributions and intervention activity does not meet the elements of bribery, extortion, illegal gratuity, or compensation. The Supreme Court reviewed a conviction of a Member of Congress for conflicts of interest and conspiracy to defraud the United States in a scheme involving campaign contributions and intervention with federal agencies. The government alleged that undisclosed payments were made to \"buy\" a Congressman, not as legitimate contributions or legal fees. The evidence focused on financial transactions and activities related to the Department of Justice. The conspiracy involved impairing government functions, including financial remuneration to campaign coffers influencing official actions. The government alleged undisclosed payments were made to \"buy\" a Congressman, not as legitimate contributions or legal fees, focusing on financial transactions related to the Department of Justice. The conspiracy involved impairing government functions, including financial remuneration to campaign coffers and attempting to influence agency decisions, potentially raising concerns of a \"conspiracy\" to defraud the United States. Both House and Senate committees have warned about the appearances of impropriety in linking campaign contributions with efforts to assist constituents before federal agencies. The Senate Rules now specifically provide that decisions on providing assistance to petitioners should not be influenced by contributions or promises of contributions to political campaigns. The Select Committee on Ethics emphasized the importance of Senators avoiding the appearance of being influenced by campaign contributions or other benefits from individuals with legislative or governmental interests. The Senate Rules emphasize that Senators should not be influenced by campaign contributions when providing assistance to petitioners. However, if a Senator believes a case is in the public interest or cause of justice, they are obligated to pursue it, while being mindful of the appearance created. Members are not required to determine if someone is a contributor before providing assistance, but should avoid linking contributions to actions to maintain public trust. Members can assist supporters based on the merits of the matter. The Senate Rules emphasize that Senators should not be influenced by campaign contributions when providing assistance to petitioners. Members are obligated to assist any constituent based on the merits of the matter, without discrimination towards political supporters. Campaign contributions should not be presented as payment for services rendered. The legislator should not suggest or pressure recipients of favors for campaign contributions. Any gifts should be voluntary, without the expectation of favors in return. Contributions should be based on personal friendship and belief in the legislator's effectiveness, not as a quid pro quo. Office management and workload systems should evaluate constituent requests for intervention independently of campaign contributions. Criteria for authorizing interventions should prioritize the strength of the constituent's case, justice and equity issues, intervention type, consistency with office practices, and importance to the district, State, or Nation. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics provides suggestions for offices to consider in requested interventions. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics provides suggestions for offices to consider in requested interventions, including evaluating the merits of the constituent's case, the viability of the claim, the nature of the agency involved, and whether the individual is a contributor. Consideration should also be given to the amount of money contributed and if it exceeds the average contribution. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics suggests evaluating the merits of a constituent's case, the nature of the agency involved, and whether the individual is a contributor. Consideration should also be given to the amount of money contributed and the proximity of money and action. Federal law prohibits gifts to Members and employees of Congress. Federal law prohibits government officials from receiving gifts from certain prohibited sources, such as those doing business with their agency. Each House of Congress has detailed rules for gift acceptance. A gift is defined separately from other forms of benefits. Gifts received by Members and congressional staff employees are distinguished from more sinister rewards or bribes based on the intent of the transaction. A gift is given without \"strings attached\" and is not tied to any official act. It can be a token of appreciation for public service in general, unrelated to specific duties. When something of value is given or received in exchange for being influenced in the performance of an official act, that is, where there is a \"corrupt\" bargain or agreement to receive something of value in return for doing an official act (often called a quid pro quo), then the bribery provision is implicated. The Rules of the House of Representatives and of the Senate provide that \"gifts\" from private, outside sources may generally not be accepted by Members and staff, except when such gifts are expressly permitted by the respective Rule. The House and Senate Rules allow for the receipt of gifts of nominal value, such as baseball caps or pens, with a de minimis exception for gifts under $50 in value. There are also explicit exceptions to the general no gifts rule, which are marginally relevant to constituent intervention. Additionally, a Code of Ethics for Government Service adopted in 1958 advises against accepting gifts. The Code of Ethics for Government Service prohibits government officials from accepting favors or benefits that could influence their duties. Concurrent resolutions do not have legal binding effect outside of Congress, and the Code is not meant to establish new ethical standards but rather to express existing principles. The Code of Ethics for Government Service serves as a guiding principle for elected and appointed officials, with the House of Representatives using it for disciplinary actions. The Code includes a \"gift\" rule to prevent influence on official duties, although it has not been specifically enforced. The Code of Ethics for Government Service includes a rule on gifts and favors to prevent influence on official duties. This rule has not been specifically applied in a Senate disciplinary ruling but has been used in the House of Representatives. It is possible that the terms \"benefit\" or \"favor\" in the Code of Ethics could be broader than the terms \"gifts\" or \"compensation\" in congressional rules. There may not need to be a specific connection between the favor received and any official act done under this ethical standard. The standard for gifts and favors in government service is concerned with appearances of impropriety rather than a direct connection to official acts. Common questions arise in constituent service when small gifts are given as thanks for assistance with bureaucratic issues. The issue lies in accepting items of value due to official acts performed by staff, such as inquiries or interventions. The illegal gratuities provision of federal law prohibits accepting items of value, even small ones like candy or flowers, in exchange for official acts performed by congressional staff. This includes inquiries or interventions into administrative matters in a federal agency. The statute does not have a de minimis exception, so even seemingly insignificant gifts may still be considered a violation of the law. The federal illegal gratuities law prohibits accepting small gifts in exchange for official acts. While there is no de minimis exception in the statute, the Department of Justice may recognize reasonable practices with de minimis exceptions in conduct rules. The Office of Government Ethics has established standards of conduct regulations for executive branch employees. The Attorney General has set standards of conduct regulations for executive branch employees, allowing a de minimis exception for gifts of $20 or less. Following these rules ensures that receiving small tokens of appreciation for official duties does not violate the illegal gratuities law. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics have clarified that small tokens of appreciation, such as perishable items or decorative items, are not considered illegal gratuities when shared with staff, constituents, or donated to charity. The Justice Department is responsible for enforcing the statute on illegal gratuities, but these provisions do not extend to these types of gifts. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics advises on gifts and financial interests. Staff employees filing financial disclosures cannot intervene in matters involving their financial interests. Members of Congress and staff must adhere to conflict of interest rules. Members of Congress and staff are advised not to allow benefits or compensation to accrue from improperly exerted influence. The rule covers a broad prohibition against deriving financial benefit from official positions. The Senate Rule prohibits members of Congress and staff from receiving compensation for improperly exerted influence, as found by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. This includes using official influence for personal financial gain, violating Senate Rule 37. The Senate Rule prohibits members of Congress and staff from receiving compensation for improperly exerted influence, as found by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. The Rule does not require further evidence of undue pressure or coercion beyond mere intervention if the end result is improper. The Rule is similar to the House Rule 43(3) and aims to prevent conflicts of interest. The House Rule aims to prevent conflicts of interest by establishing standards to prevent the improper use of official influence for personal economic interests. In 1987, an investigation into Representative Fernand J. St Germain's activities revealed allegations of improper influence for personal benefit in financial institutions. The investigation into Representative Fernand J. St Germain's activities in 1987 revealed allegations of improper influence in financial institutions, specifically regarding Florida Federal's acquisition of First Mutual Savings Association of Pensacola. The Committee found no evidence of an improper motive for the intervention, but implied that there could have been improper influence if such a motive had been proven. Paul Nelson, a Banking Committee staff member, made calls to the chairman of the Bank Board on behalf of a congressman to inquire about Florida Federal Savings & Loan's application. The purpose of the calls may have been to expedite the processing of the conversion application, but there is no evidence that it influenced the ultimate approval by the Bank Board. The congressman, a depositor at Florida Federal, had an ownership interest that allowed him to purchase shares upon conversion. Speculation about his motive for seeking expedited conversion was not supported by evidence. There was no direct evidence of any improper motive or that he influenced the calls made by Mr. Nelson. In mid-1983, the congressman purchased $30,000 worth of Florida stock. The congressman purchased $30,000 worth of Florida Federal stock in mid-1983, failing to report it as a \"transaction\" in his 1983 Financial Disclosure Statement. The Committee does not attribute improper action based on inferences and speculation, but admonishes all Members to avoid situations that could suggest improper action. Concealed personal financial interests could lead to charges of fraud against the United States. The defendant, a former official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States by influencing a contract in which he had a financial interest. The conspiracy involved deceiving HUD in the performance of development contracts, violating conflict of interest regulations. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and Senate Rule XXXVII address improper conduct, conflicts of interest, and abuse of a Member's representational role during interventions in administrative matters. This includes threats, promises of favors, and ethical considerations towards agency personnel. The Subcommittee chaired by Senator Paul Douglas explored ethical considerations in governmental interventions in administrative matters in the 1950s, issuing recommendations in the area of governmental ethics. The Subcommittee chaired by Senator Paul Douglas explored ethical considerations in governmental interventions in administrative matters in the 1950s, issuing recommendations in the area of governmental ethics. It is ethically permissible for legislators to recommend specific actions on administrative agency matters as long as argued on its merits and not inherently damaging to the administrative process. Legislators may introduce constituents for fair consideration, vouch for them, or recommend favorable action indirectly or directly. Legislators have moral obligations to ensure interventions in administrative matters are based on merit and free from personal economic interests. They must also be cautious of improper personal interests that may influence political decisions, such as seeking support in pending elections. A second moral obligation for legislators is to ensure that interventions in administrative matters are not damaging to the process or legislative-administrative relations. Senator Douglas emphasized ethical principles in congressional intervention, cautioning that fixed rules may not always be satisfactory. The legislator should not accept money for representing constituents before government departments, as it would be using public office for private gain. They should be courteous and knowledgeable when representing individual interests before administrative bodies, avoiding bullying or intimidation. Ethical guidelines from the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and Senator Douglas should be followed to maintain integrity in interventions. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, led by Senator Douglas, investigated former Speaker James C. Wright for possible undue influence on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Despite concerns of coercion, the Committee found no evidence of reprisal or threats to agency officials. The Special Counsel's Report highlighted that undue influence could involve improper means or ends. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct investigated former Speaker James C. Wright for possible undue influence on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. The investigation included a meeting where concerns were raised about the Bank Board's tactics in Texas. Representative Wright left the meeting early, but other Congressmen stayed to express their concerns. The Special Counsel found the meeting to be a proper interaction. The investigation into former Speaker James C. Wright involved inquiries and statements to Edwin Gray regarding a financial institution and a Bank Board representative's conduct. Wright expressed dissatisfaction with the Bank Board's treatment of a specific individual and Texas savings and loans. He may have delayed a recapitalization bill to show his displeasure. The Special Counsel suggested these actions could be improper. The Special Counsel argued that the Congressman's actions, including expressing dissatisfaction with the Bank Board's treatment of a constituent and delaying a bill, may have been improper. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct did not pursue charges of undue influence. Other interventions included advocating for regulatory improvements and complaining to Edwin Gray about a friend mistreated by Bank Board regulators. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct found no undue influence in Speaker Wright's interventions with the Bank Board, including appointing an independent counsel to investigate mistreatment of a constituent, expressing complaints about regulators, and requesting delays in thrift institution closings. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct found no undue influence in Speaker Wright's interventions with agency regulatory matters, despite some concerns about his conduct. The Committee emphasized the importance of legislators effectively representing constituents' concerns with executive agencies. The House Committee found no undue influence in Speaker Wright's interactions with agency regulatory matters, emphasizing the importance of legislators representing constituents' concerns with executive agencies. The Committee was not convinced that Wright exerted undue influence in his dealings with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, stating that such findings must be based on concrete evidence rather than inference or circumstances. Members of Congress are frequently asked by constituents for references or recommendations for federal employment. Members of Congress can provide reference or recommendation letters for federal employment, focusing on the applicant's character or residence. Hiring officials are instructed to consider statements from Members regarding the applicant's work performance, ability, and qualifications. Congressional recommendations were briefly prohibited under the \"Hatch Act\" revisions but have since been allowed. The \"Hatch Act\" revisions in the 103rd Congress prohibited Members of Congress from making recommendations for federal employment based on political affiliation. However, in 1996, Congress amended the law to allow for recommendations based on character and residence, returning to the previous state of the law. The current statutory language, identical to pre-1994 changes, prohibits officials from considering recommendations from Members of Congress for federal positions, except for character or residency. Members of Congress are not expressly prohibited from making recommendations. The current federal law prohibits officials from considering recommendations from Members of Congress for federal positions, except for character or residency. However, Members are not explicitly prohibited from making recommendations. The law also protects against political influences in civil service hiring by prohibiting the consideration of political factors and discrimination based on political affiliation. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct advises that Members of Congress should only provide recommendations for competitive service employments based on the applicant's character or residence if they do not have personal knowledge of the applicant's work ability. Recommendations for civil service positions should be on personal stationery, not official congressional letterhead. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics allows Members to write letters for individuals applying for positions in the competitive service. Members of Congress can write letters of recommendation for individuals applying for positions in the Executive Branch, as long as it is based on personal knowledge or records. Recommendations can also be made for political positions and appointments to military academies, but are prohibited in certain cases. Government contracts are awarded based on federal acquisition rules and guidelines, typically through competitive processes. Contracts should prioritize the best interests of the United States, focusing on overall value and performance. Price and cost to the Government are key considerations, and contracts should not be influenced by personal or political favoritism. Government contracts should be awarded impartially without favoritism. Congressional intervention in procurement procedures to influence contract awards may violate federal contracting principles and ethical standards. If a Member of Congress communicates with an agency on behalf of a business or individual, a letter of introduction is sometimes provided. When a Member of Congress communicates with an agency on behalf of a business or individual, they may provide a letter of introduction and request fair consideration in contract awards. It is advised to act in the overall public interest, treat constituents equally, and avoid political considerations. Members and staff should address agencies and advocate positions impartially.
