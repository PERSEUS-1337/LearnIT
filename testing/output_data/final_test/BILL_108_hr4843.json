    "content": "The \"Federal Wetlands Jurisdiction Act of 2004\" clarifies the jurisdiction of the Federal Government over waters of the United States, provides consistency nationwide, and consolidates authority in one Federal agency for implementing permitting programs under the Federal Water Pollution Act. Section 404(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to clarify the jurisdiction of waters of the United States under the permitting program. This includes navigable waters, waters hydrologically connected to navigable waters, and wetlands adjacent to these waters. The jurisdiction of waters of the United States under the permitting program includes waters hydrologically connected to navigable waters. Perennial or intermittent streams that contribute flow to navigable waters are considered connected, while sheet flow is excluded. The jurisdiction of the permitting program established by this section includes sheet flow, ephemeral waters, ground water, manmade ditches, pipelines, municipal separate storm sewer systems, and fastlands. Connecting waters are not subject to this jurisdiction. A person with ownership interest in property or written authorization can request the Secretary to determine the presence of waters of the United States under the permitting program. The request can be limited to specific types of waters. The Secretary may request additional information to make a jurisdictional determination for waters described in a request. The determination and notification must be made within 90 days of receiving the initial request or 60 days after receiving additional information. The authority to seek immediate judicial review for a jurisdictional determination allows any person to request review or injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the district where the property is located. The administrative appeals process allows for judicial review, injunctive relief, or administrative appeal for waters described in specific paragraphs. Any person who chooses the administrative appeals process retains the right to seek review in the United States District Court. The United States District Court allows for judicial review of the final decision of the Secretary under the administrative appeals process. SEC. 4. SINGLE AGENCY IMPLEMENTATION. Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's authorities under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act are transferred to the Secretary of the Army. The Administrator retains the authority to comment on permits issued under section 404(a) and general permits issued under section 404(e). All funds appropriated to the Administrator for these authorities are transferred to the Secretary. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended accordingly. In subsection (b), the Administrator's role is revised. Subsection (c) is removed. In subsection (q), agreements cannot elevate permit decisions above the District Engineer level. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include definitions for \"navigable\" and \"wetlands,\" specifying the criteria for each term. The amended Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act includes definitions for \"navigable\" and \"wetlands,\" with wetlands being areas with vegetation adapted for saturated soil conditions, including swamps, marshes, and bogs. Adjacent wetlands are those physically touching described waters, culverts convey streams under linear structures, and fastlands are areas behind manmade structures like levees. Fastlands are areas behind manmade structures like levees, constructed for commercial, industrial, or residential purposes in accordance with local land use planning requirements."
