    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) is up for reauthorization, last reauthorized in 1998. Title IV authorizes federal student aid programs, including student loan programs. In FY2003, $45.8 billion in new loans were provided. This report discusses issues likely to be considered during reauthorization, including background information on student loan programs and potential areas for attention. The Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program and the William D. Ford Direct Loan (DL) program are major student loan programs authorized by the Higher Education Act (HEA). These programs provide loans to students and parents for postsecondary education costs. The FFEL program involves private lenders with federal guarantees, while the DL program is operated by the U.S. Department of Education using federal funds. Despite differences in funding sources and administration, both programs offer the same types of loans. The DL program was established in 1993. The DL program, established in 1993, competes with the FFEL program in providing student loans. In FY2003, both programs collectively issued $45.8 billion in new loans, with FFEL averaging $4,009 per loan and DL averaging $4,075 per loan. They offer Stafford loans to undergraduate and graduate students at low interest rates. Variable rate loans are available to undergraduate and graduate students, with interest rates adjusting annually based on a market-indexed formula. Subsidized Stafford loans require financial need and have the government pay the interest while the borrower is in school. PLUS loans are for parents of dependent undergraduate students, and consolidation loans offer refinancing options for borrowers with multiple loans. Consolidation loans allow borrowers with multiple loans to simplify repayment by combining them into one, potentially lowering monthly payments and securing a fixed interest rate based on the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. There are underlying tensions in loan programs related to program costs and borrower benefits. Enhancements to borrower benefits in federal loan programs can increase subsidy costs. In the FFEL program, subsidy costs rise when borrower fees decrease and interest subsidy payments to lenders increase. In the DL program, subsidy costs increase when borrower fees or repayment revenues to the government are reduced. Tensions arise from differences in loan terms and conditions between the two programs. Some support aligning terms and conditions more closely, while others do not. Interest Rates on Stafford and PLUS Loans are currently variable but will switch to fixed rates in July 2006. The debate over this change has been ongoing since the 1998 reauthorization. The formula for Stafford loan interest rates is based on the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus 1.7% while in school, and plus 2.3% during repayment. The current interest rates on Stafford and PLUS loans are variable, with Stafford rates capped at 8.25% and PLUS rates capped at 9%. The formula for calculating interest rates on PLUS loans is based on the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus 3.1%. The decision to move towards a comparable maturity rate was made in 1993 within the context of phasing in the Direct Loan program to replace the guaranteed loan system. The HEA amendments of 1998 temporarily installed rate setting formulas for student loans until June 30, 2003. In 2002, P.L. 107-139 extended the variable rate setting formulas through June 30, 2006, and set fixed interest rates for Stafford and PLUS loans. The upcoming reauthorization of the HEA may address borrower interest rates. In the upcoming reauthorization of the HEA, borrower interest rates will be debated. Some support the 6.8% fixed rate for new loans, while others prefer a variable rate to take advantage of low market rates. The focus will be on enhancing borrower benefits and concerns about federal subsidy costs in the FFEL program. In the FFEL and DL programs, federal subsidy costs increase when repayment revenues are reduced, and more generous borrower benefits generally increase federal costs. Borrower fees, such as origination fees for Stafford and PLUS borrowers, contribute to offset program costs and have been the subject of recent proposals for reduction. The origination fee for PLUS and Stafford borrowers is 3%, with lenders having the option to pay it on behalf of the borrower. FFEL borrowers may also have to pay a 1% insurance premium, which can be waived by guarantors. There may be a reduction in borrower origination fees in the future to help students, but finding alternative revenue sources is a challenge. Borrower origination fees generated $1.3 billion in revenue in FY2003. The text discusses borrower fees charged in loan programs and the establishment of annual and aggregate Stafford borrowing caps to limit government subsidy costs and borrower debt. Dependency status determines student borrowing limits, with dependent students having lower limits than independent students. Some argue for expanding loan limits to keep pace with tuition increases, while others oppose it due to concerns about student debt and federal subsidy costs. Repayment plans are also a topic of discussion. Repayment plans in the Direct Loan (DL) and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs offer different options. FFEL borrowers can choose standard, graduated, income-sensitive, and extended repayment plans. DL borrowers can choose standard, graduated, extended, and income-contingent repayment plans without restrictions. In FFEL and DL programs, repayment options differ. FFEL offers standard, graduated, income-sensitive, and extended plans with a 10-year repayment term. DL offers standard, graduated, extended, and income-contingent plans without restrictions. Interest in aligning repayment options and adding an \"interest only\" option exists. Consolidation loans offer borrowers low \"interest-only\" payments initially, delaying repayment of loan principal. Congressional debates focus on the cost of fixed rate benefits. Introduced in 1986, consolidation loans aimed to simplify repayment and offer relief through extended repayment. The current interest rate formula allows for refinancing benefits. The current consolidation loan interest rate formula allows borrowers to secure a fixed rate equal to the weighted average of rates on underlying loans being consolidated. Borrowers have been consolidating to lock in favorable rates, with $63 billion in loan volume consolidated over the last two years. This poses potential high subsidy costs for the federal government. The government faces high subsidy costs in student loan programs due to guaranteed lender returns and reduced repayment revenue. Supporters of fixed rate setting argue it provides valuable benefits to borrowers and signals manageable repayment. Removing the fixed rate option would take away a benefit borrowers rely on. The removal of the fixed rate option for Stafford loans would result in a significant loss of interest subsidy for borrowers. Critics argue that the current rate setting formula is overly generous and costly, questioning the need for a refinance benefit. They also raise concerns about the repayment period subsidy disproportionately benefiting certain groups of students. The debate on \"reconsolidation\" focuses on borrowers who may miss out on more advantageous variable rates by locking in fixed rates through consolidation. Offering multiple refinance opportunities could help borrowers secure better rates, especially for those using consolidation for repayment relief. Eliminating consolidation loans' fixed rate benefit could prevent borrowers from locking in disadvantageous rates in the future, but would not assist those who have already done so. Provisions have been enacted to regulate competition for consolidation loan refinance business among loan holders within the FFEL program and across the DL and FFEL programs, limiting borrowers' ability to choose among consolidators. If a borrower cannot get a loan from a lender or an income-sensitive repayment plan, they can seek consolidation loans from other FFEL lenders. Borrowers with loans from multiple FFEL lenders can consolidate through any FFEL lender. If unable to secure a consolidation loan through FFEL lenders, borrowers can pursue a DL consolidation loan. DL borrowers can consolidate within the DL program or through FFEL lenders. Proposals to eliminate restrictions on borrowers' choice of consolidators may be considered during reauthorization. Some suggest changes to allow all borrowers to shop among consolidators, while FFEL lenders object due to potential income loss. Interest exists in aligning consolidation benefits across FFEL and DL programs, with differences in borrower choice and benefits highlighted. In School consolidation: Borrowers can pursue consolidation with FFEL loans in repayment or grace period, while DL consolidation allows consolidation of fully disbursed loans even in in-school period. DL consolidation offers a broader time frame to lock in lower in-school rates. Repayment term: Borrowers with less than $7,500 in outstanding loans can consolidate in FFEL. Repayment term: Borrowers with less than $7,500 in outstanding loans can consolidate in FFEL for a maximum of 10 years or in DL for 12 years. Joint Consolidation is available for married individuals with eligible loans, where only one borrower needs to meet eligibility requirements. Concerns have been raised about disadvantages associated with joint consolidation. Concerns have been raised about complications that may arise from joint consolidation loans, where both borrowers must meet eligibility requirements for deferment or forbearance. Guaranty agencies administer the federal government's loan guarantee within the FFEL program, with their role evolving since the program's inception. The federal government initially aimed to promote state loan insurance programs, but eventually took over the role of providing insurance. Guaranty agencies now manage the federal guarantee and perform program administrative tasks. The 1998 reauthorization of the HEA focused on defining the role of guaranty agencies within the FFEL program, emphasizing the connection between financing and tasks. Changes included a \"risk sharing\" approach, restricting reserve use and allowing flexibility in operating funds. This aimed to strengthen the relationship between revenues and activities, and improve efficiency. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of reserves and operating funds in guarantor agencies, with a focus on revenue streams and fund solvency. Concerns have been raised about shrinking reserves and proposals have been made to strengthen them through insurance premiums. Observers suggest guarantor fees for loan collections to support agency operations and student financial aid expenditures. The federal government provides lenders with a loan subsidy known as a special allowance payment (SAP) to ensure a specified level of interest income on loans. Lenders may receive \"floor income\" when interest income from borrowers exceeds the SAP rate. Some argue that lenders should not be compensated above the SAP rate, which is designed to approximate fair market compensation. Recent proposals suggest establishing the SAP rate as the sole lender reimbursement rate to reduce federal subsidy costs. The SAP rate is proposed as the sole lender reimbursement rate, with lenders' floor income refunded to the government. Loans with a guaranteed 9.5% interest rate, known as 9.5% floor loans, are being targeted for rate guarantee reduction. Congressional support is strong for curbing this guarantee, which originated from provisions in the Tax Reform Act of 1976 to capitalize the FFEL program through tax-exempt student loan bonds. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 included loan bonds that are exempt from federal taxation and used by states to finance low-interest rate student loans. Concerns about the profitability of tax-exempt student loans led to the 1980 HEA amendments, which reduced the SAP rate on these loans but also established minimum SAPs to ensure a minimum return of 9.5%. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 eliminated the floor on tax-exempt student loans, allowing them to have the same SAP rates as taxable loans. Loans made or purchased with tax-exempt funds obtained before October 1, 1993 retained a 9.5% floor reimbursement structure. Regulatory guidance from ED established funds for holders to finance 9.5% floor loans from debt issued in the specified period. The Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-409) aims to phase out the guarantee for nonprofit lenders on 9.5% floor loans by eliminating the guarantee on new loans from refinancing obligations issued between October 1, 1980, and October 1, 1993. This act does not affect the 9.5% floor on existing loans. The Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act of 2004 aims to phase out the 9.5% guarantee on new loans from refinancing obligations issued between October 1, 1980, and October 1, 1993. This phase out would result in savings in mandatory spending that could offset new expenditures."
