    "content": "Developing Text-Filter conditioning Generative Adversarial Network (TFGAN) for text-to-video synthesis is a challenging yet crucial research topic in machine learning. TFGAN utilizes a novel conditioning scheme to improve text-video associations and generates photo-realistic videos from text on real-world datasets. Extensive experiments show TFGAN outperforms existing approaches and can create videos of novel categories not seen during training. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successful in generating images, and efforts have extended to texts, graphs, and now videos. Generating videos is challenging due to the high dimensionality and the need for both diversity and consistency. This work focuses on text-conditioned video synthesis, where text descriptions are used as input. Text-conditioned video synthesis involves generating videos based on text descriptions. Recent works like BID6 and BID9 use conditional GAN models but have limitations such as fixed-length videos, low-resolution training, and simple text conditioning methods. In this work, the authors address limitations in text-conditioned video synthesis by proposing a new model called Text-Filter conditioning GAN (TFGAN). The model utilizes a recurrent neural network for videos of varying lengths, a Resnet-style architecture for high-resolution video generation, and a multi-scale text-conditioning scheme. A benchmark synthetic moving shapes dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed conditioning scheme. The authors proposed a new conditional GAN with a multi-scale text-conditioning scheme for video generation. They used a benchmark synthetic dataset and achieved photo-realistic video synthesis with a deeper generator-discriminator architecture.GANs and Variational Autoencoders are popular approaches to generative modeling. Autoencoders (VAEs) and GANs are popular generative modeling approaches. GANs involve a generator and discriminator in a minimax game, while VAEs optimize a variational lower bound of data log-likelihood. GANs, especially conditional GANs, have gained interest for producing high-fidelity and diverse images. Text conditioning is relevant to this work, with methods focusing on improving image resolution through stacking multiple GAN architectures. BID3 proposed stacking multiple GAN architectures for image generation, while Xu et al. (2018) used an attention mechanism for fine-grained conditioning. Video generation has seen limited progress, with Vondrick et al. (2016) using 3D convolutions for fixed-length videos. BID12 introduced a recurrent neural network for variable-length videos. BID6 and BID9 focused on text-conditioned video synthesis using 3D convolutions. Conditional generative models aim to produce high-resolution videos of varying lengths, addressing limitations of fixed-length low-resolution videos generated by 3D convolutions. The model learns to sample from the unknown conditional distribution p(v|t) by optimizing a transformation function G(z, t) using an adversarial training procedure. The proposed architecture is illustrated in FIG0. The proposed model utilizes a text encoder to extract frame-level and video-level representations from a text description. These representations are then used in a recurrent neural network to generate a trajectory in the latent space, which is passed to a frame generator model to produce a video sequence. The generated video is evaluated by two discriminator models - one for frame-level classification and one for overall video authenticity. The discriminator models in the GAN model classify frames and videos as real or fake based on text encoding inputs. To improve video-text associations, negative pairs are sampled for training. Previous methods used simple concatenation for feature fusion, but it was found to be ineffective. Our proposed model Text-Filter conditioning GAN (TFGAN) focuses on improving text conditioning by generating convolutional filters from text features. These filters are then convolved with the discriminator response and passed through additional convolutions before being pooled to get a single video-text representation. The proposed Text-Filter conditioning GAN (TFGAN) generates convolutional filters from text features, which are then used to classify (v, t) pairs as real or fake. The model imposes semantic constraints from input texts on generated frames and video clips at different feature abstraction levels using deep Resnet-style architectures. Stabilizing GAN training is achieved by penalizing the norm of discriminator gradients. The optimization objective is to classify (v, t) pairs as real or fake using convolutional layers and pooling. The text encoder T is optimized based on real and fake data distributions. Two discriminator networks are used in the model. The training algorithm involves alternating between minimization and maximization problems. Experimental validation of the TFGAN model is discussed, along with a benchmark synthetic dataset created for the task. The curr_chunk discusses the creation of a benchmark synthetic dataset for text-to-video generation and its analysis. It also presents results on the Kinetics human action video dataset and extends the method to text-to-image synthesis using the CUB birds dataset. A synthetic dataset of moving shapes with control parameters is introduced, resulting in 360 unique configurations. Samples from this Shapes-v1 dataset are shown. The Shapes-v1 dataset contains videos with static backgrounds, while the Shapes-v2 dataset has dynamic backgrounds generated from the Kylberg Texture Dataset BID5. The moving object is blended with the background textures, making the dataset more challenging for generative models. The Shapes-v1 dataset contains videos with 16 frames at a 64 \u00d7 64 resolution. It includes experiments on generating sequences and smooth transitions between sentences. A synthetic dataset allows for quantitative evaluation of text-conditioning using attribute classifiers trained on real data. The study involves training attribute classifiers on a dataset and using them to verify the attributes of generated videos based on input text descriptions. Different models are experimented with, including FeatCat, FeatCat branchingD, and TFGAN with Text-Filter conditioning. The architecture and hyper-parameter details are provided in Appendix C. The study involves training attribute classifiers on a dataset and using them to verify the attributes of generated videos based on input text descriptions. Different models are experimented with, including FeatCat, FeatCat branchingD, and TFGAN with Text-Filter conditioning. The architecture and hyper-parameter details are described in the Appendix C. TFGAN with text-filter conditioning achieves the best performance among the three models on both datasets. The effectiveness of the method comes from how text conditioning is applied using convolutions at multiple layers of the discriminator network. Some exploratory experiments are reported on the Shapes dataset, including conditional interpolation in video frames transitioning between two sentences.

Some exploratory experiments are reported on the Shapes dataset, including conditional interpolation in video frames transitioning between two sentences. Frames in a video transition correspond to the interpolation between two sentence descriptions, resulting in smooth transitions and novel categories being generated by the TFGAN model. In an experiment with the TFGAN model, 20 configurations are held out from the training set to test attribute classification accuracy. Results show good accuracy, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize. Another experiment involves training on 16-length video sequences and generating 32-length sequences, showcasing the model's capability to produce variable-length sequences easily. The RNN model can generate latent trajectories of any length, producing videos with shared acting. The model successfully performs zig-zag motion beyond 16 frames. Experiments are conducted on real-world video datasets with various action classes like biking, playing hockey, jogging, etc. The dataset is challenging for video tasks. The dataset used for video generation includes activities like swimming, sailing, and water skiing. The TFGAN model trained on the Kinetics dataset produces higher quality videos compared to the BID6 method, with finer motions and higher resolution. Inception score is used to evaluate the model's performance on real and generated data. Our method achieves higher accuracy than the BID6 method in various categories such as kite surfing, playing golf, biking in snow, sailing, swimming, and water skiing. The focus of the paper is on text-to-video synthesis, but the framework can also be extended to text-to-image synthesis by removing certain components. Additional results and details can be found in Appendix C. Our GAN model with Text-Filter conditioning on the CUB-Birds dataset generates photo-realistic images with higher Inception scores than comparison methods. We address the problem of generating videos conditioned on text using a novel text-conditioning framework that outperforms other techniques. By using deeper architectures in the discriminator and generator networks, we produce photo-realistic videos. The generator and discriminator networks create photo-realistic videos on the Kinetics dataset. Control parameters in Shapes-v1 and Shapes-v2 datasets determine object shape, size, color, motion type, and direction. Various motion patterns like straight line, zig-zag, and diagonal are defined, with zig-zag motion generated using a sinusoidal function. Architecture blocks like ResnetBlock(x, y) are used in the process. The text discusses the architecture blocks used in the process, including ResnetBlock and ResnetBlock3D, as well as the transformation of output using 1D convolution and text embedding through F C(d \u2192 5.5.8.8) before passing through conv-2D layers. The architecture involves passing convolved feature maps through conv-2D layers with Avg-Pool, reshaping to 128-dimensional vectors, and concatenating them to classify input as real or fake. For Video discriminators, 3D filters of size 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 are used. Text encoder utilizes GloVE embeddings and a 1D-CNN network with Conv1D(512, kernel=3) \u2192 ReLU \u2192 MaxPool(2) \u2192 Conv1D(512). Shapes-v1 and Shapes-v2 datasets employ ResnetBlock architecture. The 1D-CNN network architecture used in this case consisted of Conv1D(512, kernel=3) \u2192 ReLU \u2192 MaxPool(2) \u2192 Conv1D(512, kernel=3) \u2192 ReLU \u2192 MaxPool(2) \u2192 Conv1D(256). Zero padding was applied to ensure uniform sentence dimensions. LSTM model yielded similar performance to 1D CNN."
