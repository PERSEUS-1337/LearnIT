The Act \"Federal Civilian and Uniformed Services Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999\" introduces a new chapter on Long-Term Care Insurance to the United States Code. Section 9001 provides definitions for terms such as employee, annuitant, and qualified relative. The Act \"Federal Civilian and Uniformed Services Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999\" defines terms related to long-term care insurance, including the definition of a sponsoring individual and a carrier. A sponsoring individual includes the spouse, parent, or other specified relationships, while a carrier is a nongovernmental organization providing long-term care services under group insurance policies. The Act \"Federal Civilian and Uniformed Services Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999\" defines terms related to long-term care insurance, including the definition of a sponsoring individual and a carrier. The term 'qualified long-term care services' is defined by section 7702B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term 'Office' refers to the Office of Personnel Management. The term 'appropriate Secretary' varies depending on the specific agency or department. Sec. 9002 of the Act outlines eligibility for long-term care insurance coverage under the Public Health Service. Eligible individuals include employees with 6 months of service, annuitants, and members of the uniformed services on active duty for more than 30 days. The eligibility requirements for long-term care insurance coverage under the Public Health Service include individuals with 6 months of service, annuitants, and members of the uniformed services on active duty for more than 30 days. Qualified relatives of sponsoring individuals must meet certification requirements as specified in section 9006(c). The Office may contract with qualified carriers to provide group long-term care insurance under this chapter, without the need for competitive bidding. The certification of the claimed relationship and the disqualifying condition for immediate benefit eligibility must be met for coverage. Contracts under this section require more than 3 qualified carriers licensed to issue group long-term care insurance in all States and the District of Columbia. Each contract must detail benefits, rates, and other agreed-upon terms. Rates charged must also be specified. The rates charged under contracts must reflect the cost of benefits provided. Benefits and coverage must be guaranteed to be renewable and noncancelable. Contracts require carriers to pay benefits as determined by the Office and participate in dispute resolution. Each contract under this section shall be for a term of 5 years, renewable automatically unless terminated. Group long-term care insurance coverage obtained under this chapter terminates under specific circumstances. Each contract under this section shall terminate upon the death of the insured, exhaustion of benefits, insolvency of the insurer, or any event justifying cancellation. The contract must preserve all parties' rights and responsibilities despite termination. Sec. 9004 of the document outlines that long-term care benefits will be provided through qualified insurance contracts as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The benefits will not be terminated due to changes in status, such as separation from government service or ceasing to meet requirements for qualified relative status. Each contract under section 9003 must include adequate consumer protections, protections in case of carrier bankruptcy, and availability of benefits upon certification of an individual's inability to perform daily activities due to disability. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, determines disability levels. Contracts must offer choice between cash or service benefits, inflation protection, and portability of benefits. At least one policy under this chapter should include additional specific matters. At least one policy under this chapter must provide length-of-benefit options, coverage in various settings, elimination periods, nonforfeiture benefits, and benefits upon medical necessity certification. The Office aims to ensure governmentwide long-term care benefits plans. The chapter requires that at least one long-term care benefits plan be a Governmentwide plan, defined as a group insurance policy for qualified long-term care services. This plan is not subject to certain exceptions in the chapter. The chapter allows for provisions in contracts that may conflict with certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It also states that if a State imposes stricter requirements than those outlined in subsection (b)(1), the State's requirements will be considered met. Additionally, it defines activities of daily living as eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, and dressing. Sec. 9005 of the chapter discusses the financing of long-term care insurance coverage, stating that individuals are responsible for 100% of the charges. The terms \"nursing home,\" \"assisted living facility,\" and \"home and community care\" are defined in relation to specific acts. Enrollment charges for long-term care insurance shall be withheld from employee pay, annuitant annuity, uniformed services member basic pay, or retired/retainer pay. Voluntary withholdings for qualified relatives can also be arranged in the same manner. Enrollment charges for long-term care insurance can be withheld from various sources of income. Direct payments of withheld amounts are to be made to the carrier. Enrollees with insufficient income for withholdings must pay the shortfall directly to the carrier. Carriers must keep funds received under this chapter separate from other funds. The Office shall prescribe regulations for carriers to reimburse administrative costs incurred under this chapter. Regulations will also outline enrollment procedures for long-term care insurance, including an annual open enrollment period. Consultation is required for regulations to apply to eligible individuals. The Office will prescribe regulations for carriers to reimburse administrative costs for eligible individuals under this chapter. Application and operation of the regulations will be in consultation with the appropriate Secretary. The amendments made by this Act will take effect on the date of enactment, with coverage starting in the first calendar year after an 18-month period from enactment."
