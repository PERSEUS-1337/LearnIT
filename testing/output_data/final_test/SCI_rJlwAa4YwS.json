    "content": "We introduce lattice representation learning, where the representation of an object is a lattice point in Euclidean space. Our main contribution is a new objective function that eliminates lattice quantization, allowing for gradient descent optimization. This technique, called dithered stochastic gradient descent, only uses local information. The connection between lattice representations and Gaussian priors in Variational Auto-Encoders is also discussed. The text discusses using lattice representations in a traditional encoder/decoder architecture to explore Gaussian distribution. Experimental evidence shows the potential of lattice representations in modifying the \\texttt{OpenNMT-py} architecture for Gaussian dithering and vector quantization. The majority of practical research in representation learning assumes object representations as vectors of real numbers for optimization algorithms. However, using discrete structures for object representation is appealing, especially in settings like reinforcement learning. Lindsay (1983) showed results for maximum likelihood learning of mixture models. Lindsay (1983) demonstrated that the optimal mixing distribution for maximum likelihood learning of mixture models can be discrete, leading to discrete representations in variational inference. Training networks to produce and use discrete representations poses challenges due to difficulties in differentiation and gradients. Progress has been made in addressing these challenges, such as the work by Jang et al. (2017) on categorical variables. The idea of using a continuous approximation for categorical distributions, improved by Tucker et al. (2017), involves a parameter to control the fidelity of the approximation. Straight-through estimation (Bengio et al., 2013) is a method where quantization is applied in the forward direction and replaced with the identity operator in the backward differentiation step. VQ-VAE (van den Oord et al., 2017) utilizes general vector quantization for discrete representations. In this article, the use of structured vector quantizers in VQ-VAE is explored, drawing from information and coding theory to improve network training and performance approximation compared to continuous Gaussian VAEs. In this article, the use of structured vector quantizers in VQ-VAE is explored, drawing from information and coding theory to improve network training and performance approximation compared to continuous Gaussian VAEs. The article discusses the application of lattices in information theory for building structured codes with good space packing and covering properties, useful in channel coding and lossy source coding applications. The relationship between machine learning and lossy compression is also highlighted, referencing classical work on the information bottleneck. Our work builds on previous research exploring the connection between maximum likelihood estimation and rate distortion, as well as the use of lattices in information theory for machine learning problems. We introduce dithered stochastic gradient descent algorithms, which involve adding random noise to quantized signals to reduce the impact of quantization. Dithering is important for reducing the effect of quantization in computational networks. The \"Crypto-Lemma\" is used to optimize networks with quantization using gradient techniques. Our work connects lattice representation learning with generative modeling using variational autoencoders. We demonstrate how to train a continuous VAE that can be interpreted as a discrete VAE using a finite dimensional lattice. In the context of a standard encoder/decoder architecture, a given object's representation is produced using an encoder and then decoded using a decoder. There is a difference in how the terms \"encoder\" and \"decoder\" are used in information theory and machine learning. In information theory, they are used to represent and retrieve information digitally, with an emphasis on efficiency. In machine learning, an encoder's output is typically a continuous vector. The work focuses on optimizing the representation cost for objects in machine learning applications by using discrete representations. Each element in the representation space X is assigned a probability, allowing for the creation of a code mapping elements to a specific number of bits. In machine learning applications, discrete representations are used to optimize the representation cost of objects. A code is created to map elements in the space X to a specific number of bits, with the ideal code length being -log p(x) to minimize expected bits. This ideal length is typically achieved with block codes that compress multiple elements simultaneously. In machine learning, discrete representations are utilized to optimize the representation cost of objects by mapping elements to a specific number of bits. The average representation cost for training data is a key metric, with the designer specifying another metric typically in the form of a loss function. Variational autoencoders trained using ELBO and quantization of continuous representations are also discussed. The end-to-end objective function involves the encoder, decoder, and representation code in training quantizers within a computational network. The importance of the representation cost is controlled by parameter \u03bb. The goal is to design good quantizers that can be trained end-to-end, adding mathematical rigor to the VQ-VAE concept. Dithered stochastic gradient descent principles are borrowed from information theory, using a basis for Rm to define a matrix B. The Crypto-Lemma is a mathematical tool used in the analysis of lattices, particularly in information theory. It involves defining a lattice \u039b in Rm and using basis vectors to create a matrix B. The Crypto-Lemma states that for a given m-dimensional lattice \u039b, a random vector U uniformly distributed over P0(\u039b) has a specific distribution. This lemma is crucial for training computational networks using gradient methods. The Crypto-Lemma is essential for training computational networks using gradient descent algorithms and explicit quantization steps, with a theoretical guarantee of equivalence. Additional mathematical preliminaries include notation for independent random vectors and conditional independence. Probability measures are denoted by uppercase P, and the notation P(A=a) summarizes the probability of an event. The main contribution focuses on a new result regarding representation cost for dithered SGD, involving random vectors and probability measures. The theorem discusses the use of a lattice and random vectors distributed according to specific probabilities. The proof of the result involves a dual application of the Crypto-Lemma and is based on random vectors distributed according to specific probabilities. The right hand side of the equation does not involve quantization, and the expression in the expectation relies on a density specified by the designer. This approach avoids the problem resulting from the gradient of a quantized lattice. The machine learning algorithms derived from Theorem 1 are called dithered stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The discrete lattice representation Z in Equation (7) depends on the dither value U and is encoded using a code that also depends on U. The code - log P\u1e90 |U may not be the optimal choice. The discrete lattice representation Z in Equation (7) for dithered stochastic gradient descent algorithms depends on the dither value U. The code - log P\u1e90 |U may not be the best choice, as it may not be the optimal representation cost. However, training the encoder parameters can help adapt the encoder to produce representations that approximate the desired prior. The discrete lattice representation Z in Equation (7) for dithered stochastic gradient descent algorithms depends on the dither value U. The code - log P\u1e90 |U may not be the best choice, as it may not be the optimal representation cost. However, training the encoder parameters can help adapt the encoder to produce representations that approximate the desired prior. The connection between Theorem 1 and the information theoretic result linking entropy coded dithered quantization and mutual information (Zamir & Feder, 1996) is that Theorem 1 generalizes this result to a setting where the optimum code is not necessarily used, which is useful in stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The system being studied involves an encoder/decoder architecture coupled to a loss function, with pre/post dithered quantization on the left and subtractive dithering without quantization on the right. Equation (5) of Theorem 1 discusses pre/post dithered quantization in lattice representation learning. The code for encoding Z is constructed using a distribution P\u1e90 |U. The designer can choose any distribution PX and then construct random vectors X, U independently. The distribution P\u1e90 |U incurs a cost for encoding Z as the lattice representation of D. The optimization objective in Equation (3) involves the designer-specified loss function value (D, g(Z \u2212 U)). The difficulty lies in optimizing this objective due to Z being the result of quantization operation. By leveraging Lemma 1 and Theorem 1, the objective function is transformed to incorporate subtractive dithering and representation cost. Stochastic gradient descent is feasible as fX \u2212U does not require global information about the training data D. The proposed optimization approach is akin to stochastic gradient descent. The proposed optimization approach involves sampling a dither U for every training data D and performing gradient descent with U as a constant in the network. The loss function quantifies the likelihood of the data given the dithered lattice representation Z - U, representing the cost in bits needed to encode the data. U is considered common randomness shared between the encoder and decoder. The optimization approach involves sampling a dither U for each training data D and using it as a constant in the network. The cost of encoding the data is represented by the likelihood of the data given the dithered lattice representation Z - U. Common randomness shared between the encoder and decoder eliminates the cost of transmitting the data. The expression relates to the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) in variational autoencoders, with terms associated with the KL divergence and the decoder. The distribution of U in VAE approximates i.i.d. Gaussian noise. Concepts from lattice theory are introduced to explain this. The second moment of lattice cells and the normalized second moment are key metrics. Optimal lattices have the smallest second moment. The normalized second moment of an optimal lattice converges to that of a hyper-sphere. The normalized second moment of high dimensional lattices approaches that of a hyper-sphere as the dimension grows to infinity. This connection strengthens the link between variational autoencoders using Gaussian approximate posteriors and lattice representations. The distribution of X - U in a high dimensional lattice can be similar to that derived from VAE theory. In lattice representations, only the mean of the approximate posterior depends on the encoder output, unlike in VAEs where both the mean and correlation matrix can be complex functions of the encoder output. This observation suggests that many results from VAE theory can be re-interpreted in the context of lattice representations. The VAE community has achieved results using lattice quantized representations with pre/post quantized dithering. Good lattices approximate Gaussian VAE behavior. Theorem 1 can implement finite lattices practically. Lattices offer a theoretically sound basis for achieving Gaussian VAE-like performance with discrete representations. The VAE community has achieved results using lattice quantized representations with pre/post quantized dithering. To implement training of a VAE using a lattice, a prior distribution on X needs to be specified. Choosing a Laplacian distribution for X ensures that the distribution of X - U has a simple form, where U is uniformly distributed over the lattice cell. In general, we assume a collection of potentially distinct parameters for the Laplacian distribution of X. A comparison of performance between different VAE models is conducted using static MNIST in experiments. The encoder consists of a three-layer network with specific dimensions for the intermediate layer outputs. The decoder network consists of layers with specific dimensions and activation functions. A batch size of 100 and Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 5e-4 are used. The model tracks the best validation set performance and stops the experiment if no improvement is seen after 50 epochs. Improved log likelihood estimates are computed using importance sampling with 1000 samples per test example. Training objectives for an MNIST image are defined for the finite dimensional lattice. The decoder network for MNIST image D involves the encoder network e c and decoder network Q. Two types of Gaussian VAEs are trained: Lattice Gaussian VAE and Gaussian VAE. Results show that the performance of the rectangular lattice VAE is not as good as the two Gaussian VAEs due to simpler lattices performing less effectively. The performance of the rectangular lattice VAE is competitive with Gaussian VAEs, showing potential for higher dimensional lattices. Importance sampling was used to evaluate negative log likelihood, with results showing competitive performance for the rectangular lattice VAE. Increasing lattice dimension can improve performance, such as using hexagonal or higher dimensional lattices. The present work explores the use of hexagonal or higher dimensional lattices for training complex systems in representation learning. Information theory and lossy compression theory are seen as effective foundations for designing practical algorithms. Lattices are introduced as a way to create discrete representations, with a fundamental result allowing for training computational networks using lattice quantized dithering. This result enables gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent by using only local information during optimization. The study explores the use of high dimensional lattices for training complex systems in representation learning. It establishes a connection between lattices and Gaussian dithering in generative modeling. Initial experimental evidence shows the potential of using lattices in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) setting. The recommendation is to consider lattices and train them using dithered stochastic gradient descent for close performance to Gaussian VAEs with discrete representations. The proof relies on Lemma 2, stating conditions for random vectors X, U, Z. The steps involve definitions, change of variables, and applications of the Crypto Lemma to joint distributions. In the autoencoding setting, a stronger statement is made about the benefits of using better lattices for creating representations with high fidelity. The second moment of a lattice with \"white\" dither controls quantization error for arbitrary functions. In the context of creating representations with high fidelity in the autoencoding setting, the second moment of a lattice with \"white\" dither controls quantization error for arbitrary functions. Lattices achieving G m have white dithers, with the normalized second moment of a lattice spanned by a matrix proportional to I m being G 1 = 1/12. Applying Lemma 3 twice reveals the difference between lattices. The quantization error in representation learning can be improved by up to 30% by using a better lattice, without increasing the representation cost. This comparison experiment focuses on two techniques for quantized representation learning using stochastic gradient descent. The quantization error in representation learning can be improved by up to 30% by using a better lattice, without increasing the representation cost. Two techniques for quantized representation learning using stochastic gradient descent are discussed. One technique involves scalar or vector quantization in the forward direction, while the other technique uses non-data dependent Gaussian dithering to approximate a uniform distribution over a lattice in high dimensions. An experimental setting with a seq2seq autoencoder is chosen for implementation. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of a seq2seq autoencoder using OpenNMT-py for encoding text into a vector representation and decoding it back into text. The experiment aims for the decoder to produce the exact same text as the input. The source code for this experiment will be released. The experiment involves modifying an open source package to apply quantization techniques to the communication between encoder and decoder in a seq2seq setup. The loss function is the average word negative log likelihood at the decoder output. A tradeoff exists between representation cost and loss function quality. The architecture includes a 2-layer bidirectional GRU recurrent neural network for both encoder and decoder. The experiment involves modifying an open source package to apply quantization techniques to the communication between encoder and decoder in a seq2seq setup. The architecture includes a 2-layer bidirectional GRU recurrent neural network for both encoder and decoder, with each direction having 250 dimensions in its internal state and in the GRU's output vector. The OpenNMT-py package implements an optional global attention, which was disabled for simplicity. Adam is used as the optimizer with an initial learning rate of 1e-4, decaying by a factor of 0.75 every 50k steps. The total number of training steps is 500k, and the parameter \u03bb for representation cost is annealed from 0 to 1.0. The bi-directional GRU in the experiment can be quantized in different ways, such as using N = 250 scalar quantizers with M levels or N = 125 quantizers with M = 4 two-dimensional code vectors. Each quantizer is independent and optimized using gradient descent. The representation cost is the average code length of the encoded representations. Gaussian dithering is used, where the encoder output is linearly transformed and then dithered. The text discusses the use of Gaussian dithering in an autoencoding experiment with over 4 million English sentences. The dithered signal is passed through a linear operator, and the representation cost is computed using techniques from Variational Autoencoders. The experiment uses data from Google's NMT tutorial for a German/English translation system. The experiment involves using Gaussian dithering in autoencoding with over 4 million English sentences. The results for the test data show a tradeoff between representation cost and word negative log likelihood. Good lattice performance surpasses specific quantizers trained with straight-through estimation. The assumption of high dimensionality in Gaussian dithering approximation to good lattices may lead to unrealistic projected performance, but a good lattice in 250 dimensions is likely well approximated with a Gaussian."
