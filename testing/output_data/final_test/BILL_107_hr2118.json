The LIIFT Act acknowledges Lyme disease as a common bacterial infection transmitted by tick bites. Early detection is crucial to prevent serious health issues, as the disease can mimic other illnesses and lead to severe heart, neurological, eye, and joint problems if left untreated. Lyme disease is responsible for the majority of vector-borne infections in the US. Cases of tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease, have increased significantly in the United States. The ticks responsible for spreading these diseases also transmit ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and other Borrelia strains, making diagnosis and treatment challenging. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported a 25-fold increase in tick-borne disease cases since 1982, with the majority of cases concentrated in ten states. Studies suggest that the actual number of cases is much higher than reported due to underreporting. Patients with Lyme disease face challenges in obtaining diagnosis, treatment, and insurance coverage. Clinicians fear backlash for their treatment decisions, leading to delays in care. The cost of Lyme disease to the nation is estimated to be between $1-2 billion annually, with significant impacts on medical costs, productivity, and patient suffering. Despite 14 years of Federal funding, there is still no accurate test for Lyme disease, making treatment challenging. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's funding for tick-borne research has only increased by 7 percent in the past 10 years, while expenditures for infectious diseases rose significantly. The National Institutes of Health have also increased their funding over the same period. The National Institutes of Health increased expenditures from $13.1 million in 1991 to $26 million in 2000. The Lyme disease vaccine was approved by the FDA in 1998, but has since received over 1,000 adverse event reports, including severe arthritic symptoms and Lyme disease cases. The Tick-Borne Disorders Advisory Committee is established to provide a public voice, assure communication and coordination between agencies, and promote coordination with other government entities. Establishment of Tick-Borne Disorders Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services on public needs, interagency coordination, and collaboration with other entities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall appoint 11 voting members to the Committee, including scientific community members and representatives of national tick-borne disorder voluntary organizations. The Committee will coordinate efforts with other Federal agencies and tick-borne disorder national nonprofits, and develop informed responses to constituency groups regarding the Department's efforts and progress. The Committee appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will consist of 11 members, including clinicians, patient representatives, and ex-officio members. The clinicians will have extensive experience in diagnosing and treating tick-borne diseases, while the patient representatives will be individuals diagnosed with such illnesses or with affected family members. The Committee appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will consist of 11 members, including clinicians, patient representatives, and nonvoting ex-officio members from various health organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health with expertise in Lyme disease research and treatment. The Committee appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will consist of 11 members from various health organizations with expertise in Lyme disease research and treatment. Members include representatives from Health Resources and Services Administration, Social Security Administration, Department of Defense, United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine, and Health Care Financing Administration. Additional members may be added from other Departments if needed. The Assistant Secretary for Health (Department of Health and Human Services) will serve as the co-chairperson of the Committee. The Committee, appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, consists of 11 members with expertise in Lyme disease research and treatment. The public co-chairperson serves a 2-year term with voting rights, and all members serve 4-year terms. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and members can serve until their successors take office. The Committee holds public meetings at least twice a year, with additional meetings as needed. The Committee, appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, consists of 11 members with expertise in Lyme disease research and treatment. Meetings are conducted as required by applicable laws and Departmental regulations. The Secretary shall submit reports to Congress on activities under this Act, including progress in diagnostic tools, case definitions, and public awareness initiatives.

The Secretary shall submit reports to Congress on activities under this Act, including progress in diagnostic tools, case definitions, and public awareness initiatives. Education initiatives aim to improve knowledge of healthcare providers and the public on preventing, diagnosing, and treating tick-borne disorders. Improved access to disability benefits for those with tick-borne disorders and recommendations for resolving medical and scientific differences are also included. Authorization of $250,000 for each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 is provided for this Act. SEC. 5. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are appropriated $14,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to focus on developing better diagnostic tools for tick-borne disorders and expanding educational efforts. An additional $7,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 is allocated for collaboration with other agencies for further research on tick-borne disorders. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will coordinate research on tick-borne diseases across Institutes to encourage collaboration with the Tick-Borne Disorders Advisory Committee."
