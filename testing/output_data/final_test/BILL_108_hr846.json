Postpartum depression is a mood disorder that affects many women during and after pregnancy. It can be categorized into three subgroups: \"baby blues,\" postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, and postpartum psychosis. \"Baby blues\" is characterized by mood swings, tearfulness, irritability, poor sleep, and vulnerability. Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders include symptoms like worsening baby blues, postpartum psychosis involves losing touch with reality, and each year over 400,000 women experience mood changes after childbirth. The causes of postpartum depression are complex and not fully understood, with theories pointing to hormonal changes post-delivery. Postpartum depression can be caused by a rapid drop in hormone levels after childbirth, difficulty during labor or pregnancy, a premature birth, or a lack of support from spouse, friends, or family. It is treatable with a personalized regimen of care including social support, therapy, medication, and sometimes hospitalization. Postpartum depression often goes undiagnosed or untreated due to social stigma, the myth of motherhood, and economic pressures. Untreated, it can lead to further depression, substance abuse, loss of employment, and impact society through the infant's well-being. Child abuse, neglect, or death of the infant or siblings can impact the infant's physical and psychological development, as well as disrupt the family.
