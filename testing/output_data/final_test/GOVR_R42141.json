    "content": "One argument for a statutory minimum wage is to ensure workers are paid a living wage and fair compensation for limited skill jobs. Another reason is to boost purchasing power for low-wage workers, increasing demand for goods and services. Opponents argue that a minimum wage can limit employment opportunities for less-skilled workers and may not effectively raise incomes for low-income families. Requiring time-and-a-half for overtime aims to reduce involuntary unemployment by shortening workweeks and increasing overall employment. When the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted in 1938, an exemption was provided for executive, administrative, and professional employees from minimum wage and overtime pay. Proponents argue that paying more for overtime can shorten workweeks and increase employment, while opponents see it as government interference in labor markets. The terms for exempt employees were to be defined by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the Department of Labor issued regulations for exempting executive, administrative, and professional employees based on salary and job duties tests. Computer employees may also be exempt under the EAP exemption. The FLSA was amended in 1990 to exempt certain computer-related occupations, treating them as professional employees. The exemption for professional employees has roots in the National Industrial Relations Act of 1933. The National Industrial Relations Act of 1933 (NIRA) allowed industries to establish codes of fair competition, excluding professional employees from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements. Justifications for the exemption include the ability of professional employees to individually bargain over wages and the flexibility of their work schedules. Amendments to the FLSA and regulations affecting computer-related occupations are also discussed in the report. Congress amended the FLSA in 1990 to exempt certain employees in computer-related occupations, directing the Secretary of Labor to include computer systems analysts, programmers, and software engineers in the EAP exemption. Regulations were issued to qualify these workers as exempt executive, administrative, or professional employees under the FLSA. Before the 1990 amendments to the FLSA, DOL regulations explained why certain employees in computer-related occupations were not exempt as \"learned professionals.\" The regulations stated that learned professionals require \"knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study.\" The regulations said that an academic degree, as opposed to just a high school education, was the best evidence of professional training. The regulations added that the areas where the professional exemption may apply were clarified. The 1990 amendments to the FLSA expanded the areas where the professional exemption may apply, allowing employees trained in new fields to be exempt as learned professionals. Computer programmers and systems analysts were not considered learned professionals due to the lack of universally accepted academic requirements. The EAP exemption required employees to be paid a salary, not an hourly wage, and to receive their full salary for any week worked. Exempt professional employees had to be paid between $170 and $249.99 a week under the long test, with their primary duty requiring advanced knowledge. In 1992, the Department of Labor implemented regulations treating computer employees as professional employees under the EAP exemption. Highly skilled computer workers like systems analysts, programmers, and software engineers were included as professional employees. The 1992 regulations exempted highly skilled computer workers, such as systems analysts, programmers, and software engineers, from the EAP exemption. The regulations set a minimum hourly pay of $27.63 and specified the primary duties of computer professionals. The 1992 regulations exempted highly skilled computer workers from the EAP exemption, setting a minimum hourly pay and specifying primary duties. The new language added hourly employee coverage for computer-related work, with specific compensation criteria. Employees in the computer software field, such as systems analysts, computer programmers, and software engineers, may be exempt as professionals under Section 13(a)(1) of the Act. They are highly skilled in computer systems analysis, programming, and related software functions, with job titles like computer programmer, systems analyst, software engineer, and more. Job titles alone do not determine eligibility for this exemption. Employees in the computer software field, such as systems analysts, computer programmers, and software engineers, may be exempt as professionals under Section 13(a)(1) of the Act. Job titles alone are not determinative of the applicability of this exemption. To be considered for exemption under Section 541.3(a)(4), an employee's primary duty must involve systems analysis techniques, development of computer systems or programs, or design of computer programs related to machine operating systems. The exemption applies to highly-skilled employees in the field. The exemption for highly-skilled employees in the computer software field under Section 13(a)(1) of the Act does not include trainees or entry-level positions. Qualification for this exemption is based on a level of proficiency achieved through education and experience, rather than specific academic degrees or certifications. In 1996, Congress amended the FSLA to add a specific statutory exemption for computer professionals, fixing the minimum hourly wage at $27.63 an hour. The amendments included regulatory language defining the primary duties of computer professionals. The 1992 regulations exempt certain computer professionals from minimum wage and overtime standards under the FLSA. These professionals include computer systems analysts, programmers, and software engineers, whose primary duties involve systems analysis, design, development, and testing of computer systems and programs. After the 1996 amendments to the FLSA, the regulations for computer professionals were revised in 2004. The updated regulations set a minimum weekly salary of $455 for exempt professional employees. Computer professionals paid hourly must meet duties test and earn at least $27.63 per hour to be exempt. The revised duties test removed previous requirements for exempt computer employees. The 2004 regulations for computer professionals removed the requirement for exempt employees to consistently exercise discretion and independent judgment. Computer systems analysts, programmers, software engineers, and similar skilled workers are exempt from minimum wage and overtime standards if they meet specific duties related to systems analysis, design, development, and testing. The 2004 regulations clarified that employees in computer-related occupations are exempt from minimum wage and overtime standards if they meet specific job duties and are paid a salary of at least $455 a week or a wage of at least $27.63 an hour. Job titles do not determine exemption status, and skilled computer workers are not necessarily exempt. The exemption does not include employees engaged in manufacturing or repair. In 2006, the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of DOL issued an opinion letter stating that IT Support Specialists are not exempt from minimum wage and overtime standards. Their primary duty involves installing, configuring, testing, and troubleshooting computer applications, networks, and hardware. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of DOL concluded that IT Support Specialists are not exempt as computer professionals. Legislation from the 112th Congress aimed to amend the FLSA to include computer and IT workers in the exemption. Senator Kay Hagan introduced the Computer Professionals Update Act to expand the exemption criteria to include various IT-related occupations. The proposed legislation aimed to amend the FLSA to exempt employees in computer- and IT-related occupations who meet specific criteria, including a wage or salary test and expanded job duties. The amendment would apply to employees paid at least $27.63 per hour or $455 per week. The proposed legislation aims to amend the FLSA to exempt computer and IT workers who meet specific criteria, including a wage or salary test and expanded job duties. This includes individuals working with systems, networks, databases, software, hardware, security, internet, intranet, or websites in various roles such as analyst, programmer, engineer, designer, developer, or administrator. Their primary duties involve applying analysis techniques, designing, developing, testing, securing, and directing the work of others in similar roles. Senator Lindsey Graham introduced S. 495, a bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to clarify the exemption for certain computer professionals. A companion bill, H.R. 1996, was introduced in the House by Representative Joe Wilson. S. 495 aimed to extend the exemption to include network and database analysts, designers, and developers, modifying the job duties test. The legislation introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham aimed to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to clarify the exemption for certain computer professionals, including network and database analysts, designers, and developers. It would have modified the job duties test to include employees whose primary duty involved applying network or database analysis techniques and procedures. Employees whose primary duty was to configure, integrate, secure, or resolve problems for computer systems, networks, databases, or programs would have been exempt. Additionally, employees who managed or trained employees meeting the modified job duties test would have also been exempt.

The House approved legislation to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act for certain computer professionals, with a minimum hourly compensation of less than $27.63. Representative Robert Andrews introduced H.R. 3038, while Representative John Shimkus introduced H.R. 3846 to increase the minimum wage. H.R. 3846 was passed by the House and appended to H.R. 3081. H.R. 3081, the Small Business Tax Fairness Act of 2000, sponsored by Representative Rick Lazio, passed the House but was not taken up by the Senate. H.R. 3846, added to H.R. 3081, aimed to exempt certain computer professionals from the Fair Labor Standards Act.
