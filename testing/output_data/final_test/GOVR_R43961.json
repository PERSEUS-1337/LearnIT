    "content": "Social Security is a federally administered entitlement program financed by payroll taxes. It provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their families, as well as to the family members of deceased workers. Eligibility is based on work history. Social Security provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their families, as well as to the family members of deceased workers. Eligibility is based on work history, with 10 years of covered employment needed for a retired-worker benefit. As of December 2014, there were approximately 59 million Social Security beneficiaries, including retired workers, disabled workers, and survivors of deceased workers. To qualify for a disabled-worker benefit, a worker needs 40 earnings credits (10 years of covered employment). The number of credits required varies based on the age of the worker when disabled. Disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 12 months. A worker can receive a retirement benefit as early as age 62. A worker can receive a retirement benefit as early as age 62, but if taken before full retirement age, the benefit is permanently reduced. The full retirement age ranges from 65 to 67 depending on the birth year. Retired workers make up 66% of beneficiaries, while disabled workers account for 15%. Monthly Social Security benefits are based on career-average earnings, with the primary insurance amount calculated using indexed earnings over the highest 35 years. The Social Security benefits are calculated based on the highest 35 years of indexed earnings, which are divided by 420 months to determine the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). A progressive benefit formula is then applied to the AIME, with lower-wage workers receiving a higher replacement rate. The monthly benefit payable to a worker may be less or greater than their Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) depending on various factors such as claiming retirement benefits before or after full retirement age. Social Security benefits can be adjusted based on age and other factors like simultaneous entitlement to multiple benefits or receiving a pension not covered by Social Security. Average monthly benefits in December 2014 were $1,329 for retired workers and $1,165 for disabled workers. Benefits can also be received by eligible family members like spouses, children, and dependent parents. Social Security benefits are payable to eligible family members like spouses, children, and dependent parents of a deceased worker. A mother's/father's benefit is available to a young widow(er) caring for a deceased worker's child under 16 or disabled. Dependents and survivors of retired, disabled, or deceased workers made up 19% of beneficiaries in December 2014. Relationship requirements to the Number Holder must be met to qualify for these benefits as an eligible family member. The applicant must meet relationship requirements to the Number Holder as set out in the Social Security Act. State law affects entitlement to benefits as a family member of a retired, disabled, or deceased worker. SSA looks to the laws of the state where the Number Holder is domiciled for determining family relationship for benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse. The applicant must meet relationship requirements to the Number Holder as set out in the Social Security Act. SSA interprets \"domiciled\" as the true and fixed home of a person. The relationship requirement is met if the applicant and the Number Holder were validly married under state law or if the applicant would inherit a spouse's share of the Number Holder's property under state intestate law. The Uniform Probate Code does not explicitly define \"spouse\" or \"marriage\" for intestate laws. State legislatures are directed to incorporate their legal definition of marriage. If a valid marriage cannot be established, benefits may still be available under certain circumstances, such as going through a marriage ceremony in good faith. Under current Social Security law, entitlement to benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse can vary from state to state, regardless of the gender of each individual in a couple. For same-sex married couples to qualify for Social Security benefits, they must have been validly married in a state that permits same-sex marriage and the Number Holder must be domiciled in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage at the time of application. Surviving spouse benefits for individuals in civil unions or nonmarital legal same-sex relationships can qualify for Social Security benefits. Family members can receive a percentage of the worker's PIA, with a maximum family benefit. Spouses may receive up to 50% of the retired worker's PIA, while widows/widowers may receive up to 100%. Benefits are adjusted based on age, receipt of other Social Security benefits, and non-covered work pensions. There is an overall limit on total family benefits based on the worker's record. The Social Security Administration provides benefits to family members based on a worker's record, with a maximum family benefit limit. Spouses and widows/widowers can receive a percentage of the worker's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). Benefits are adjusted for age, receipt of other Social Security benefits, and non-covered work pensions. Same-sex marriages or nonmarital legal relationships are recognized for family benefits eligibility. The Social Security Administration provides family benefits based on a worker's record, with a maximum limit. SSA approves family benefit claims based on valid family status under state law. SSA processes claims from states allowing same-sex marriage or nonmarital legal relationships. The Social Security Administration recognizes states with nonmarital legal relationships meeting family status requirements. After the Windsor decision in 2013, President Obama directed the Attorney General to assess its impact on federal programs for swift implementation. SSA worked with DOJ to resolve legal questions and develop guidance for processing claims affected by same-sex marriage. The Social Security Administration began processing claims affected by same-sex marriage gradually after the Windsor decision in 2013. By June 2014, SSA published new guidance to recognize nonmarital legal relationships as marriages for determining entitlement to benefits. Currently, SSA is processing all types of family benefit claims impacted by same-sex marriage or nonmarital legal relationships. This section addresses common questions about same-sex couples and Social Security eligibility criteria. The Social Security Administration recognizes same-sex marriages for determining entitlement to benefits. To be eligible, the couple must have a valid marriage and be domiciled in a state that recognizes such marriages at the time of application. If all requirements are met, the applicant can receive Social Security benefits. Lauren is eligible for Social Security benefits based on the recognition of same-sex marriages by the state where the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of application. The couple does not need to reside in the state where they were married for benefit eligibility. The state where the Number Holder lives must recognize the out-of-state same-sex marriage for the couple to be considered validly married for benefit eligibility. For example, if David and Michael marry in WA where same-sex marriage is recognized, and then move to CA, they can still be eligible for benefits. After a same-sex marriage ceremony, the couple moves to California, which recognizes out-of-state same-sex marriages. If the state where the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of application recognizes the same-sex marriage, spousal benefits can be obtained. The Social Security Act does not require couples to be domiciled in the same state for marital relationship eligibility. The determination of marital status for benefits depends on the state where the Number Holder is domiciled. The Social Security Act considers the validity of a same-sex marriage for benefit eligibility based on the state where the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of application. If the state recognizes same-sex marriage, spousal benefits can be obtained, regardless of where the applicant is domiciled. If the state where the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of application recognizes the marriage, SSA considers the couple as married for benefit entitlement, even if they move to another state. For example, if a same-sex couple marries in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage and files for spousal benefits while domiciled there, SSA will recognize the marriage even if they move to a state that also recognizes same-sex marriage. The Social Security Administration recognizes same-sex marriages for spousal benefits if the state of domicile acknowledges the marriage. If the state does not recognize same-sex marriage, the SSA will not consider the couple as married for benefit entitlement, including survivor benefits. Under SSA's interpretation of the Social Security Act, same-sex marriages are recognized for spousal benefits if the state of domicile acknowledges the marriage. The duration-of-marriage requirement for benefits is one continuous year before the application is filed. Children of Number Holders are considered for entitlement to child's benefits under the Act. Stepchildren may also be entitled to benefits on a Number Holder's record. Stepchildren can receive benefits on a Number Holder's record if their relationship was established through the Number Holder's marriage to the child's biological or adoptive parent. Same-sex marriage eligibility depends on the state's recognition. SSA may require legal opinions for cases involving same-sex marriages due to state law variations. Domicile is determined by the claimant's true and fixed home. The claimant's domicile determines state law for benefits eligibility based on family status. Marital status is not relevant for retirement or disability benefits in same-sex marriages. Civil unions grant rights and benefits depending on state laws, with some states treating them like marriages. The Social Security Act allows recognition of civil unions for inheritance rights. SSA considers state laws on civil unions for benefits eligibility based on family status. The agency determines marital relationship validity using intestate laws of the Number Holder's domicile. SSA considers state laws on civil unions for benefits eligibility based on family status. If the Number Holder's domicile-state recognizes a nonmarital legal relationship for same-sex couples under intestate laws, SSA will consider it a marital relationship for Social Security benefits. If the state does not grant inheritance rights to nonmarital relationships, the marriage will not be considered valid for benefits determination. For example, Colorado's \"Civil Union Act\" grants similar rights to spouses in a legal marriage. The Social Security Administration considers state laws on civil unions and domestic partnerships for benefits eligibility based on family status. Colorado's civil union law allows same-sex couples to inherit as spouses, and SSA would treat them as spouses for determining entitlement to spousal benefits. Domestic partnerships are established through a legal declaration and some states grant same-sex couples in a domestic partnership the right to inherit property. Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act permits recognition of an applicant in a domestic partnership with the Number Holder as the spouse if the state allows inheritance rights. The SSA considers state laws on civil unions and domestic partnerships for benefits eligibility based on family status. If a state's domestic partnership laws grant inheritance rights to same-sex couples, the SSA will generally treat the couple's domestic partnership as a marital relationship. The SSA determines if a nonmarital legal relationship qualifies as a marital relationship under the laws of the state of the Number Holder's domicile using intestate laws. If an applicant could inherit a spouse's share of the Number Holder's personal property under the state's intestate laws, the SSA will consider the same-sex couple's relationship as a marital one. If the Number Holder dies without a will, SSA will consider the same-sex couple's relationship as a marital one for Social Security benefits entitlement. However, if the domicile state does not recognize nonmarital legal relationships for same-sex couples, the marriage may not be considered valid for spousal benefits. For example, in Washington state, a state-registered domestic partnership can inherit the partner's estate without a will, meeting SSA's requirements for a marital relationship. Foreign marriages are defined as ceremonial marriages celebrated outside of a state for determining marital status. For Social Security benefits eligibility, the SSA considers same-sex marriages valid if recognized in the jurisdiction of celebration and by the courts of the Number Holder's domicile state or the District of Columbia. State intestate law is used to determine marital status for nonmarital legal relationships. The SSA considers same-sex marriages valid if recognized in the jurisdiction of celebration and by the courts of the Number Holder's domicile state or the District of Columbia. State intestate law is used to determine marital status for nonmarital legal relationships, ensuring inheritance rights for spouses of the Number Holder. The SSA recognizes same-sex marriages based on the laws of the state of domicile. If the ceremony occurred before the state recognized same-sex marriage, the couple may not be considered married for Social Security benefits. The application is processed based on the current state laws at the time of application. The SSA determines marital status for Social Security benefits based on state laws. If a same-sex couple married in a state that later recognized same-sex marriage, SSA may consider them validly married. SSA will not approve applications for benefits if the marriage is not recognized. Applications may be held based on Department of Justice guidance on state laws. The SSA determines marital status for Social Security benefits based on state laws and may consider same-sex couples validly married if married in a state that later recognized same-sex marriage. Applicants dissatisfied with decisions can request further review through SSA's administrative process within 60 days. This includes reconsideration, a hearing before an administrative law judge, and an appeal to the Appeals Council. Only after SSA's final decision can an applicant seek judicial review in federal court. The federal court reviews SSA's final decision using the \"substantial evidence\" standard. The place-of-domicile rule has been used since the creation of family benefits under the Social Security Amendments of 1939. Congress specified that determinations of family status would be made according to the law of the state where the Number Holder was located or died. Specifically, Section 209(m) of the Social Security Act determines family status based on the state's law on devolution of intestate personal property. The place-of-domicile rule for determining family status under the Social Security Act is based on the law of the state where the insured individual is domiciled at the time of application or death. Congress later moved this provision to Section 216(h) of the Act in 1950 without providing reasons for the change. Congress maintained the place-of-domicile rule in Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act, with benefits for family members based on a percentage of the worker's PIA. Table A-1 outlines eligibility requirements and benefit amounts before adjustments."
