It introduces Title V, which outlines findings and policy related to this issue. The Children's Environmental Protection Act amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to address the unique health risks children face from environmental pollutants. Congress finds that children are more vulnerable to these dangers due to their higher intake of food, fluids, and air relative to their body weight. Risk assessments by the EPA do not adequately differentiate between risks to children and adults. The effects of pesticides on infants and children are not adequately considered in current risk assessments, leading to insufficient protection for them. Data is lacking to evaluate child-specific susceptibility and exposure to environmental pollutants, as well as bioaccumulation. This lack of data hinders effective government regulation and denies individuals the right to make informed decisions. The policy of the United States emphasizes addressing disproportionate risks to children from environmental health risks and making information readily available to the public and relevant agencies to enhance understanding of environmental threats to children. The United States policy focuses on addressing risks to children from environmental hazards and providing information to the public and agencies to study the health effects of cumulative exposures to pollutants. The United States policy aims to protect children from environmental hazards and study the health effects of cumulative exposures to pollutants. SEC. 502 defines key terms. The United States policy aims to protect children from environmental hazards by defining key terms related to areas accessible to children, children's age, environmental pollutants, Federal properties, and vulnerable subpopulations. The United States policy defines vulnerable subpopulations as groups like children, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals with serious illnesses who are at higher risk from environmental pollutants. \"SEC. 503. SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN AND OTHER VULNERABLE SUBPOPULATIONS.\" The Administrator is required to evaluate environmental health risks for vulnerable subpopulations, ensure EPA standards protect children and vulnerable groups, and either conduct a separate risk assessment or provide an explanation if not done. The Administrator must evaluate environmental health risks for children and vulnerable subpopulations as part of regulatory decisions. Within a year, they must develop a strategy for reviewing standards, publish a list of standards needing revision for protection, and prioritize them accordingly. The Administrator must prioritize environmental standards for expedited review to protect children and vulnerable subpopulations, identify standards needing additional research, and propose at least 20 revised standards within 6 years. The Administrator must propose at least 20 revised standards within 15 years and report annually to Congress on progress. SEC. 504. SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN. The Administrator must identify environmental pollutants accessible to children, create lists of harmful and safer substances, and establish guidelines to reduce children's exposure to pollutants. The Administrator will create a family right-to-know information kit with guidance on reducing children's exposure to environmental pollutants, make the information available to the public, and cooperate with the Centers for Disease Control. The Administrator will review and update lists of environmental pollutants at least once a year. The Administrator, Secretary of Agriculture, and Secretary of Health and Human Services will coordinate research on the health effects of pesticides and pollutants on children. Biennial reports on actions taken will be submitted to Congress. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the implementation of environmental protection measures for children under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The table of contents is amended to include a new section on safeguarding children and vulnerable populations."
