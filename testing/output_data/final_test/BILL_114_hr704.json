    "content": "The \"RFS Reform Act of 2015\" includes amendments to the Clean Air Act related to renewable fuel standards and regulations on gasoline containing more than 10-volume-percent ethanol. The Act prohibits gasoline blends with over 10-volume-percent ethanol and waivers, and includes a misfueling rule. The \"RFS Reform Act of 2015\" amends the Clean Air Act to redefine renewable fuel as fuel produced from renewable biomass, used to replace fossil fuel in transportation fuel, and classified as advanced biofuel starting from January 1, 2015. It also adjusts the description of renewable fuel in the Act. The Clean Air Act is amended to adjust applicable volumes for renewable fuel, with changes in numerical values for different categories. The Clean Air Act is amended to adjust applicable volumes for renewable fuel, with changes in numerical values for different categories from calendar years 2015 through 2022. Conforming amendments are also made for other calendar years. The Clean Air Act is amended to adjust applicable volumes for renewable fuel, with changes in numerical values for different categories from calendar years 2015 through 2022. Other calendar years are also addressed, including amendments to clauses and reduction levels. Amendments to the Clean Air Act adjust renewable fuel volumes for various calendar years, including changes in numerical values for different categories from 2015 through 2022. Waivers are also addressed for years before 2015 in subparagraphs (D)(i) and (E)(ii). SEC. 102. CELLULOSIC BIOFUEL REQUIREMENT BASED ON ACTUAL PRODUCTION. Section 211(o)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act is amended to provide estimates of cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the following calendar year. The Energy Information Administration Administrator is tasked with determining these estimates based on production data from cellulosic biofuel facilities. The Energy Information Administration Administrator determines estimates of cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the current calendar year based on actual production data from facilities. The Energy Information Administration Administrator determines estimates of cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the current calendar year based on actual production data from facilities, including calculating the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility starting production after January 1. The Energy Information Administration Administrator determines estimates of cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the current calendar year based on actual production data from facilities, including calculating the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility starting production after January 1. The estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility is determined for the current calendar year, with projections for the following year based on total estimated annual volumes of production for all facilities. Section 211(o)(7)(D)(i) outlines the reduction in the applicable volume for cellulosic biofuel production. Section 211(o)(7)(D)(i) of the Clean Air Act is amended to specify using exact data for volume reduction in cellulosic biofuel production, requiring a reduction by the same volume. SEC. 103 of the Clean Air Act amendments applies to calendar years 2015 and after, with regulations to be implemented within 1 year. SEC. 201 prohibits gasoline blends with over 10-volume-percent ethanol. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is prohibited from allowing gasoline with more than 10-volume-percent ethanol to be introduced into commerce, including through waivers under the Clean Air Act. The waiver granted before the enactment of this Act allowing gasoline with over 10-volume-percent ethanol for use in vehicles is revoked. This includes specific waivers mentioned in the subsections. The Administrator decided to limit the ethanol content of gasoline to 15 percent. SEC. 203. MISFUELING RULE. The rule to mitigate misfueling of vehicles with gasoline containing more than ten percent ethanol will no longer be in effect 60 days after the enactment of this Act."
