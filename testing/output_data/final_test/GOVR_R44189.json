    "content": "The ATF is the primary federal agency for enforcing laws on firearms, explosives, arson, and alcohol/tobacco diversion. It is funded by Congress through the DOJ and has faced controversy over mishandling criminal investigations, including a gun trafficking operation to Mexico. Gun control advocates argue that ATF lacks adequate funding and faces undue conditions from Congress. ATF's FY2016 budget justification states it lacks resources for monitoring the firearms industry and conducting firearms traces for other agencies. Congress appropriated $1.24 billion for ATF in FY2016, prompting a need to assess ATF's balance between administrative and enforcement missions amidst budget constraints. In FY2016, Congress appropriated $1.24 billion for ATF, representing a 3.4% increase over FY2015 but $21.2 million less than the Administration's request. ATF's challenges include attrition of staff, increased workloads, and the need for accurate intelligence data to combat violent crime. The Administration requested $1.261 billion for ATF in FY2016, a 5.3% increase over the previous year. In FY2016, Congress appropriated $1.24 billion for ATF, a 3.4% increase over FY2015 but $21.2 million less than the Administration's request. The proposed net increase of $63.4 million over ATF's FY2015 appropriation included funding to address deficiencies in Investigative Support Services, staffing restoration, and other base adjustments. The budget decision units for law enforcement operations and investigative support services allocate resources and staff to enforcement and regulatory operations. Prior to FY2015, ATF's budget structure included three units: firearms, explosives and arson, and alcohol and tobacco. Firearms-related operations received the majority of resources. The FY2015 FTE level was 4,880, with a requested FY2016 level of 5,106, showing a net increase of 226 FTEs. The $30.2 million funding for \"staffing restoration\" included 221 FTEs to be restored due to a DOJ-wide hiring freeze. The $25.1 million for \"base adjustments\" represented resources needed for FY2016 to maintain current service levels. The Administration requested termination of ATF's personnel management demonstration project for FY2016. The ATF sought permanent legislative authority to compensate employees without a pay reduction, which was granted in Section 206 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. Special agents accounted for nearly half of the permanent positions under the FY2016 request, while Industry Operations Investigators made up 16.3% of the positions. The ATF requested permanent legislative authority to compensate employees without pay reduction, with special agents and Industry Operations Investigators accounting for a significant portion of the positions. The level of funded positions for various job series remained stable, with a requested increase in \"other\" positions for FY2016. Additionally, the Administration sought to eliminate two long-standing provisos related to ATF appropriations language. The ATF requested permanent legislative authority to compensate employees without pay reduction, with special agents and Industry Operations Investigators accounting for a significant portion of the positions. Congress included futurity language in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 to alter the regulatory definition of \"curios and relics\" and require federally licensed gun dealers to conduct physical inventories. Some gun control-related spending limitations have been placed on ATF, with some provisos no longer appearing in the appropriations language due to futurity language included by Congress in either FY2012 or FY2013. The ATF has faced challenges in inspecting every federal firearms licensee for compliance due to appropriations limitations, an increase in the number of licensees, and a surge in firearms-related commerce. In FY2014, ATF could only conduct 10,000 compliance inspections, a 24% decrease from the previous year. For FY2015, ATF allocated 84.6% of its budget for law enforcement operations, proposing a similar percentage for FY2016. ATF allocated 84.4% of its budget for law enforcement operations in FY2016, leaving less than 16% for \"investigative support services.\" This unit funds activities like FFL qualification inspections and firearms traces. Congress may consider reallocating resources towards regulatory efforts if firearms-related crime continues to decrease nationally. The ATF's regulatory mission includes monitoring FFLs and explosives licensees. The civilian gun stock in the U.S. has seen a significant increase over the years, with a net annual increase of over 9 million firearms by 2011. This growth reflects the ATF's increasing responsibilities in regulating the domestic firearms industry. The ATF reported that many states have relaxed laws on silencers and allow their use for hunting and recreational shooting. Since 2011, 15 states have legalized suppressors for hunting, 13 states have passed legislation requiring chief law enforcement officers to sign off on suppressor applications, and two states have legalized suppressor ownership. Under the Gun Control Act (GCA), ATF regulates firearms business, including manufacturing, importing, and selling. Federally licensed gun dealers, known as FFLs, must follow regulations on sales, record-keeping, and interstate transfers. While the US doesn't have a registry of firearms or owners, FFLs maintain transaction records under ATF guidance. Some states have relaxed laws on suppressors, leading to increased ATF workload. ATF oversees firearms business, including sales and record-keeping by FFLs. Successful firearm traces aid criminal investigations and highlight trafficking trends. Controversy surrounds public release of trace data, with Congress limiting ATF's disclosure. In its Congressional Budget Submission, Fiscal Year 2016, ATF reported incidents of murder, robbery, and aggravated assault involving firearms in 2012. Two-thirds of murders and half of homicides are committed with firearms and handguns, respectively. Homicide rates have been lower from 1999 to 2013 compared to 1968, while firearms-related robberies and aggravated assaults have also decreased. If violent crimes with firearms continue to decrease, Congress may see a positive trend. ATF suggested allocating more resources towards regulatory mission to monitor firearms and explosives commerce, improve intelligence on gun trafficking and mass shootings in public spaces. Congress defined \"mass killings\" as \"3 or more killings in a single incident\" after the tragedy in Newtown, CT in 2012. The definition of homicides is based on victim counts, with categories such as single, double, triple, mass, spree, and serial murders. Federal agencies lack longitudinal data on multiple victim homicide incidents, except for the DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics. Based on FBI data, there were 987 four or more victim homicide incidents from 1980 to 2011, averaging 31 incidents per year. Some of these incidents may have been serial or spree murders. Additionally, there were 2,355 triple homicides during the same period, averaging 74 incidents per year. These incidents accounted for 0.64% of all murder and nonnegligent manslaughter cases. Over a 32-year period, there were an estimated 7,065 victims of triple homicides and 4,797 victims of quadruple or greater victim homicides, totaling 11,862 victims. These incidents accounted for 2.16% of all murder and non-negligent manslaughter cases. Grant Duwe's definition of mass public shootings involves offenders gunning down victims without a clear motive. During the twentieth century, there were 116 mass public shootings with firearms, excluding those related to criminal activities like robbery or drug dealing. Data from 1970-2013 shows an average of 1.1 incidents per year in the 1970s and 4.0 incidents per year in the 1980s, resulting in multiple victims being killed or wounded in each incident. The prevalence of \"mass public shootings\" increased in the 1970s and 1980s, and continued to rise in the 1990s, 2000s, and early 2010s. Congress could inquire about ATF's plans to address these incidents and data gaps on offender acquisition of firearms. The House Committee on Appropriations reported an FY2016 CJS appropriations bill that would have provided ATF with $1.25 billion for FY2016, a 4.1% increase over the previous year. The funding aimed to help ATF meet staffing requirements, process NFA applications, and expand the National Integrated Ballistics Information system. The House passed H.R. 2578 with amendments reducing ATF appropriations by $5 million each. Another amendment to further reduce funding by 20% was rejected. The House also adopted gun control-related amendments during floor consideration. The House passed H.R. 2578 with amendments reducing ATF appropriations by $5 million each. Amendments related to ATF regulations on armor-piercing ammunition, firearms rights restoration, and gun control limitations were debated. The House passed H.R. 2578 with amendments reducing ATF appropriations by $5 million each. ATF proposed a framework for determining if certain rifle cartridges should be considered \"armor piercing\" and whether the Attorney General should waive them from the ban. This was justified due to the availability of certain semiautomatic pistols in the US. The House and Senate Chairs of the Judiciary Committees objected strongly to ATF's framework for potentially banning certain rifle cartridges. ATF withdrew the framework due to public backlash. Representative Hudson's amendment prohibited funding for classifying certain ammunition as armor piercing. Representative Massie's amendment prohibited funding for banning any ammunition as armor piercing. The House and Senate Chairs of the Judiciary Committees objected strongly to ATF's framework for potentially banning certain rifle cartridges. ATF withdrew the framework due to public backlash. Representative Hudson's amendment prohibited funding for classifying certain ammunition as armor piercing. Representative Massie's amendment prohibited funding for banning any ammunition as armor piercing. Additionally, Representative Paul A. Gosar offered an amendment that would have prohibited the use of funding provided under the bill to continue a ban on the importation of 5.45x39mm ammunition as armor piercing, which was agreed to by voice vote. The ATF requires individuals applying for NFA tax stamps to get the signature of the CLEO in their community. NFA weapons can also be registered to trusts, where the responsible person undergoes a background check. A proposed rule would make all trust parties undergo background checks to prevent prohibited persons from owning NFA weapons. The amendment was agreed to by voice vote. For FY1993 and every year thereafter, a proviso has been included in the ATF salaries and expenses language that has prevented the agency from using funds to consider applications for disabilities relief from individuals ineligible to possess firearms. There are nine classes of persons prohibited from owning firearms or ammunition under current law. Persons prohibited from owning firearms or ammunition include fugitives from justice, unlawful users of controlled substances, mentally defective individuals, unauthorized immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, former citizens, individuals under court restraints for domestic violence, and those indicted for a crime punishable by over a year in prison. Under the Gun Control Act (GCA), it is illegal to sell firearms or ammunition to prohibited persons. The Attorney General can consider petitions for \"relief from disabilities\" to restore firearms eligibility, but appropriations limitations have hindered this process since FY1993. The only way for a prohibited person to regain firearms eligibility is through restoration of civil rights or clearing disqualifying criminal records. The process for restoring firearms eligibility involves having civil rights restored, expunging disqualifying criminal records, or receiving a pardon. The ATF processed thousands of applications for firearms disabilities relief, granting privileges to some and denying others. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 maintains limitations on appropriations. Representative Diane Black proposed an amendment to prohibit disclosing race or ethnicity in connection with firearms transfers under federal law. The ATF modified Form 4473 to include a question requiring disclosure of race or ethnicity when purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer. Ethnicity includes Hispanic or Latino, while race includes categories like American Indian or Asian. The ATF modified Form 4473 to include a question requiring disclosure of race or ethnicity when purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer. The form includes categories such as Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Any person of other ethnicity is directed to select the closest representation. The ATF modified Form 4473 to include a question on race or ethnicity for firearm purchases. This change allows for background checks on prospective buyers through the NICS system. Some critics argue it serves no purpose beyond categorizing gun ownership by ethnicity. The amendment by Representative Elizabeth Esty to remove this question was not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. Representative Elizabeth Esty offered an amendment to strike provisions in a bill related to shotgun imports and multiple rifles sales reporting, but it was withdrawn. Section 532 of H.R. 2578 prohibits ATF from banning certain shotguns with \"non-sporting\" features. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 includes language that prohibits funds from denying the importation of certain shotgun models. The curr_chunk discusses the prohibition of funding for an ATF information collection initiative related to multiple rifle sales reporting. This initiative requires federal firearms licensees to report sales of specific types of firearms to unlicensed individuals. The House CJS appropriations bills have consistently included language to block this initiative since FY2011. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 does not include a provision to block the ATF information collection initiative related to multiple rifle sales reporting. Representative Doug Lamborn's amendment to prohibit the use of appropriations for collecting information about individuals attending gun shows with electronic license plate readers was not considered due to a violation of House Rule XXI, clause 2. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2016 CJS appropriations bill (H.R. 2578) providing ATF with $1.201 billion, the same as FY2015. The report addressed areas of ATF operations including combating gun violence and enforcing gun laws, United States-Mexico firearms trafficking, US Bomb Data Center, and National Center for Explosives Training and Research. No additional funding was proposed for FY2016, but the amount was deemed adequate for ATF to administer and enforce existing federal firearms laws and programs, such as the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN). The Senate version of the FY2016 CJS appropriations bill provided ATF with $1.201 billion, the same as FY2015. The report addressed areas of ATF operations including combating gun violence, United States-Mexico firearms trafficking, and National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN). The report also directed ATF to continue reporting on firearms recovered by the Government of Mexico and the tracing of those firearms. The bill includes a provision banning DOJ agencies from transferring firearms to known or suspected \"drug cartel\" agents without continuous monitoring. This provision originated in FY2012 and is a response to \"Operation Fast and Furious.\" The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 also includes this provision. Additionally, the report praised ATF for co-locating the U.S. Bomb Data Center with the National Center for Explosives Training and Research. The DOJ directed its agencies to use the ATF Bomb Arson Tracking System for explosives-related incidents. ATF was directed to provide space for FBI and DHS analysts at the U.S. Bomb Data Center and maintain operations at NCETR for training technicians in fire investigations and explosives disposal. Congress imposed provisos on ATF appropriations for gun control and included \"futurity\" language in the provisions. The Congress included \"futurity\" language in the provisos of the Justice, Science, and Related Appropriations Act, with one proviso being the \"Tiahrt amendment\" since FY2005. This proviso restricts ATF from releasing unfiltered firearms trace data and using it for civil lawsuits. Gun control advocates call for the repeal of these limitations, arguing they hamper law enforcement, while gun rights supporters believe they prevent ATF from exceeding its authority. For FY2012 and FY2013, Congress included futurity language in several provisos related to firearms regulations. The Administration has requested the repeal of certain provisions for FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. The House CJS appropriations bills for FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015 included futurity language in various provisions related to firearms regulations. Some provisos were not included in the enacted appropriations laws, including Firearms Parts Exports to Canada and Curios and Relics Imports. Legislation has been introduced in the 114th Congress to repeal certain provisos. The ATF S&E appropriations language included a proviso from FY1979 to FY2012 requiring firearms data collection, but Congress deemed it exceeded ATF's authority. A proviso also prohibits ATF from creating a registry of firearms or owners, with futurity language added in FY2012 to potentially make it permanent. The proviso in the ATF S&E appropriations language prohibits the use of funds for consolidating or centralizing firearm records within the Department of Justice. Another proviso from FY1996 to FY2013 prevents ATF from changing the definition of \"curios or relics\" to restrict the importation of surplus military firearms. The ATF has consistently opposed importing certain surplus military firearms from World War II era. Congress included language in FY2013 making a proviso permanent, preventing changes to firearm definitions. The Administration has requested the repeal of this proviso for FY2014-FY2016, but it remains unchanged in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) does not repeal the ATF S&E Proviso Three, which prevents the agency from using funds to consider applications for firearms disabilities relief. The House report justified this by stating that resources should be focused on fighting violent crime instead. The ATF S&E Proviso Four prohibits the use of funds to investigate or act upon applications for relief from Federal firearms disabilities for corporations. This provision was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), maintaining the appropriations limitation described above. For FY1994 and onwards, Congress allocated funds to process disability relief applications for corporations seeking relief from Federal firearms disabilities under section 925(c) of title 18, United States Code. This provision was included in various appropriations acts, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113). Congress included a proviso in ATF appropriations to prevent dismantling the agency in response to a recommendation to transfer ATF's law enforcement functions to the FBI. This proviso prohibits transferring ATF functions to other agencies or departments. The ATF appropriations include limitations on transferring functions to other agencies or departments, with specific provisions like the Tiahrt Amendment restricting the release of trace data to non-law enforcement parties. The ATF appropriations include restrictions on disclosing unfiltered trace data to non-law enforcement parties, with specific provisions like the Tiahrt Amendment. The proviso exempts trace reports for statistical purposes and firearms trafficking trend analysis. The language of the proviso has been revised multiple times, with a futurity language included since its inception. The ATF appropriations include restrictions on disclosing trace data to non-law enforcement parties, with specific provisions like the Tiahrt Amendment. Data can only be shared with law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, foreign agencies for criminal investigations, or federal agencies for national security purposes. Disclosure is prohibited if it compromises undercover officers or ongoing investigations. The Tiahrt Amendment restricts the disclosure of trace data to non-law enforcement parties. Data can only be shared with specific entities for criminal investigations or national security purposes, and is protected from legal processes. The Tiahrt Amendment limits the sharing of trace data to law enforcement agencies for criminal investigations or national security purposes. It also includes provisions for sharing information among different law enforcement entities and publishing statistical reports on regulated products. The proviso related to ATF appropriations after FY2012 has not reappeared, indicating a potential permanency in law. The FY2003 Treasury-Postal appropriations act included a provision that may prohibit ATF from using funds for processing FOIA requests for trace data. The provision aims to maintain databases confidential for criminal investigations and officer safety, as releasing the information could pose risks to law enforcement, homeland security, and privacy. SEC. 644 prohibits the use of funds for taking action on records collected under specific statutes related to arson, explosives, and firearm tracing. This provision aims to restrict the disclosure of such records under FOIA, with language suggesting it is intended to be permanent law. The Tiahrt amendments prohibited FOIA disclosures and included a proviso in ATF S&E appropriations language that prevented requiring federal firearms licensees to conduct inventories before an inspection. The provision was intended to be permanent law, but the Administration requested its repeal in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016 budget requests. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 does not change the appropriations limitation on ATF's ability to search computerized records of out-of-business FFLs. The provision prohibiting this search was included in ATF S&E appropriations language from FY1997 to FY2012, with futurity language in FY2012 suggesting it be permanent law. The ATF S&E Proviso Nine from FY2004 to FY2013 prohibited ATF from denying or renewing dealer licenses for lack of business, in response to efforts to reduce convenience-based federal firearms licenses. This provision was part of the FY2004 Tiahrt amendment. The ATF S&E Proviso Nine from FY2004 to FY2013 prohibited ATF from denying or renewing dealer licenses for lack of business activity. This provision was not included in subsequent appropriations after 2013, possibly due to futurity language in P.L. 113-6. Additionally, Congress included an Anti-Gun Walking Amendment in annual CJS appropriations acts from FY2012 to FY2015 to prevent the investigative tactic of \"gun walking\" in flawed investigations like \"Operation Fast and Furious.\" The DOJ Office of the Inspector General found that ATF agents did not act promptly in arresting suspected \"straw purchasers\" in Operation Fast and Furious. Senator John Cornyn sponsored an amendment in FY2012 to prevent \"gun walking\" in firearms trafficking to Mexican drug organizations. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act allows Federal law enforcement officers to transfer firearms to suspected drug cartel agents if monitored. Congress included this provision in various appropriations acts from FY2015 to FY2016. The provision in the annual CJS appropriations acts prohibits the Department of Justice from charging a fee for firearms-related background checks under the NICS. Congress also requires the FBI to destroy background check records within 24 hours for eligible individuals starting from FY2004. The provision in the annual CJS appropriations acts prohibits the use of funds for implementing certain tax or fee related to firearms background checks. It also mandates the destruction of identifying information for eligible individuals within 24 hours. This provision was not included in subsequent CJS appropriations after FY2012. The provision in the FY2004 CJS appropriations bill, known as the Tiahrt amendment, required disclaimers on tracing studies by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The language aimed to clarify that trace data cannot be used to draw broad conclusions about firearms-related crime. Authorities conduct firearm traces for investigations, but not all firearms used in crime are traced. The selected firearms for tracing are not representative of all firearms used by criminals. Traced firearms are usually linked to the first retail seller, but the sources reported may not reflect how firearms are generally acquired for criminal use. The provision in the FY2006 Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds to require certain export licenses for firearms parts, in response to regulations that made it costly for Canadians to acquire parts from U.S. dealers. The FY2006 Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds to require export licenses for firearms parts when exporting to Canada, as long as the total value does not exceed $500 wholesale in any transaction. This exemption does not excuse exporters from filing necessary documentation. The FY2006 Appropriations Act allows for the export of firearms parts to Canada without a license if the total value is under $500 wholesale. However, exporters are still required to file necessary documentation. Additionally, certain items such as fully automatic firearms and components, barrels, cylinders, and breech mechanisms for certain firearms listed in Category I, and articles for export from Canada to other foreign destinations still require a license for export. The President may require export licenses on a temporary basis if Canada has inadequate import controls leading to diversion of articles for terrorism or conflict escalation. The license requirements will be terminated when the reasons for them have ceased. The provision to require export licenses on a temporary basis has ceased, as stated in the Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. The House Committee on Appropriations included futurity language in previous versions but not in enacted laws for FY2013-FY2015. For FY2016, provisions in H.R. 2578 do not include futurity language. Section 517 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 continues to prohibit the use of funds for export license requirements. The Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 included a provision to prohibit the use of funds to deny certain import applications for firearms, parts, or ammunition. This provision was originally numbered \u00a7521 and was included in the act. The House Committee on Appropriations included futurity language in previous versions but not in enacted laws for FY2013-FY2015. The FY2016 appropriations law included provisions prohibiting the denial of import applications for certain firearms. This provision was first included in the FY2012 CJS appropriations law in response to an ATF study on \"non-sporting\" shotguns. The FY2016 appropriations law included a provision prohibiting the denial of import applications for certain firearms, specifically shotguns not suitable for sporting purposes. This provision was first introduced in the FY2012 CJS appropriations law in response to an ATF study on non-sporting shotguns. The FY2016 appropriations law (P.L. 114-113) prohibits the use of funds to deny the importation of certain shotguns not suitable for sporting purposes. This provision was first introduced in the FY2012 CJS appropriations law in response to an ATF study on non-sporting shotguns."
