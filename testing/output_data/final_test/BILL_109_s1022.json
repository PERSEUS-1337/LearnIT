    "content": "The Resource Efficient Appliance Incentives Act of 2005, also known as the Energy Efficient Appliance Credit, provides a credit for energy-efficient appliances under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified energy efficient appliances produced during the taxable year. The credit amount is determined by multiplying the applicable amount by the eligible production for each type of appliance. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit offers a credit for energy efficient appliances manufactured in specific years and meeting Energy Star program requirements. For dishwashers, the applicable amount is based on energy savings, while for clothes washers, it ranges from $50 to $100 depending on manufacturing year and MEF. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit applies to appliances manufactured in certain years and meeting Energy Star requirements. For clothes washers, the credit amount varies based on manufacturing year and energy/water savings. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit offers savings for refrigerators meeting specific energy consumption criteria. For refrigerators manufactured in 2005 or 2006 consuming 15% less energy than 2001 standards, the savings amount is $75. For those consuming 20% less energy, the savings amount is $125 for 2005 models. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit provides savings for refrigerators manufactured in 2005, 2006, or 2007, with a $175 rebate for models consuming 25% less energy than 2001 standards. Refrigerators manufactured in 2008 with 25% energy savings receive a $150 rebate. The Energy Efficient Appliance Credit offers rebates for refrigerators made in 2005-2007 and dishwashers in 2008-2010. The energy savings amount is calculated based on the Energy Star program requirements. The Energy Star program sets requirements for dishwashers in 2005 and 2007. The energy and water savings amount is calculated based on the MEF and WF savings percentages. The MEF and WF savings percentages are calculated based on the Energy Star program requirements for clothes washers in 2010 compared to 2007. The Energy Star program required a Water Factor (WF) for clothes washers in 2007 and 2010. Eligible production of energy-efficient appliances is determined by the excess of appliances produced in a calendar year compared to the average production over the previous three years. The eligible production of energy-efficient appliances is determined by the excess of appliances produced in a calendar year compared to the average production over the previous three years, with special rules for refrigerators and 2005 production. The types of energy-efficient appliances eligible for production incentives include dishwashers, clothes washers, and special rules apply for 2005 production. The production incentives for energy-efficient appliances include clothes washers and refrigerators, with a limit of $75,000,000 per taxpayer per year. The production incentives for energy-efficient appliances include a limit of $20,000,000 per taxpayer per year, which can be increased to $25,000,000 with an election. The production incentives for energy-efficient appliances allow for a maximum credit of $50,000,000 per taxpayer for specified appliances, with a potential increase to $25,000,000 from the initial limit of $20,000,000. The production incentives for energy-efficient appliances provide a tax credit based on gross receipts, limited to 2 percent of the average annual gross receipts for the preceding 3 years. The specified appliances include clothes washers and refrigerators, with additional refrigerators qualifying for the credit. For tax credits based on gross receipts, the definition of qualified energy efficient appliances includes dishwashers, clothes washers, and refrigerators subject to energy conservation standards. The terms defined in the text include 'clothes washer', 'refrigerator', 'MEF', 'EF', 'WF', and 'produced'. The 2001 energy conservation standard refers to the standards set by the Department of Energy in July 2001. Special rules apply, treating certain groups as single producers. The 2001 energy conservation standard sets guidelines without regard to subsection (b)(2)(C). Verification is required for tax credit eligibility. Section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include the energy efficient appliance credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new item in part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new energy efficient appliance credit, effective for appliances produced after the enactment date in taxable years ending after that date."
