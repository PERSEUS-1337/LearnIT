In this Act, the term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. \"Qualified revenues\" include bonus bids, rentals, and royalties from leases in the South Atlantic planning area. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The \"South Atlantic planning area\" is the outer Continental Shelf area.

The term \"workforce investment board\" refers to a State or local board established under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. SEC. 3. ENHANCING STATE RIGHTS. The Secretary will establish regulations for managing surface occupancy in the South Atlantic planning area for lease sales under this Act. States have authority over surface facilities within 12 nautical miles from the coastline for oil or gas production. Without state authorization, only sub-surface facilities can be installed between 12 and 20 nautical miles seaward from the coastline. The regulations for managing surface occupancy in the South Atlantic planning area under this Act allow for new offshore production facilities while minimizing impacts on coastal vistas. Onshore facilities within 12 nautical miles of the coastline are permitted for oil and gas development. Temporary surface activities related to outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leases are not restricted by these regulations. The Secretary is required to reinstate Virginia Lease Sale 220 within 2 years of the Act's enactment. Additionally, a South Carolina Lease Sale is also mandated. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a lease sale off the coast of South Carolina within 2 years of the Act's enactment, focusing on areas with promising hydrocarbon resources. This sale must cover at least 25 percent of the leasable area within South Carolina's offshore administrative boundaries. The Secretary is required to conduct a lease sale off the coast of South Carolina within 2 years, focusing on areas with hydrocarbon resources. A multisale environmental impact statement is to be completed for the lease sales conducted under the Act. The Secretary is mandated to conduct 3 lease sales in the South Atlantic planning area by June 30, 2017, based on analysis and industry nominations. Additionally, the South Atlantic planning area will be included in the 2017-2022 leasing program with 1 lease sale per year for a total of 5 sales. SEC. 7. BALANCING MILITARY AND ENERGY GOALS. In recognition of the importance of the outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing program to national security, the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense will collaborate to ensure that lease sales do not interfere with military operations. This includes maintaining readiness of the Armed Forces and allowing effective exploration and production of energy resources in the United States. The Act ensures that lease sales on the outer Continental Shelf do not conflict with military operations, as determined by agreements between the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior. SEC. 8 of the Act outlines the allocation of revenues from the Outer Continental Shelf, including deposits into special accounts for deficit reduction and distribution to the general fund of the Treasury. The qualified revenues deposited in the account under section 8(1) are distributed to each State based on a formula established by the Secretary. The distribution is inversely proportional to the distances between the coastline and the geographic center of the leased tract. Each State is entitled to a minimum allocation. Each State is entitled to a minimum allocation of 10 percent of qualified revenues allocated under subsection (a) and may use the funds according to State law. SEC. 10. VETERANS JOBS GRANT PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. Establishment of the \"Oil and Gas Production Veterans Workforce Training Fund\" in the Treasury of the United States to provide grants for oil and gas exploration, development, and production workforce training programs at eligible institutions of higher education and workforce investment boards. To be eligible for a grant under this section, institutions of higher education or workforce investment boards must establish or expand an oil and gas workforce training program, giving priority to veterans. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. Administrative expenses are limited to 0.5 percent of the funds available. 0.5 percent of funds available can be used for administrative expenses of the programs described. SEC. 11.

Research will focus on hydrocarbon potential in the South Atlantic Planning Area and promote the study of these sciences at US universities. Governors may nominate institutions for participation in the partnership. The Director will select higher education institutions for a partnership focusing on geological and geophysical sciences on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf. Governors can nominate institutions, with a preference for those admitting veterans and meeting specific criteria. The selected institutions must demonstrate excellence in the field. The Director selects higher education institutions for partnership focusing on geological and geophysical sciences on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf. Institutions must demonstrate excellence in geophysical sciences, engineering, or technical studies related to seismic research. Selected institutions can conduct research with a permit from the South Atlantic Regional Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Under this section, research using explosives requires a permit from the Director. Geological and geophysical activities are considered scientific research, with data not for commercial use or sale, and must be made public. Data collected must be submitted to BOEM within 60 days by selected higher education institutions. Under subsection (c)(3), higher education institutions must share requested data with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The Director cannot charge fees for data provision, except for a data reprocessing fee. The Director must report data from partnerships to the Senate and House committees every 180 days. SEC. 12.
