    "content": "In the 115th Congress, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 (H.R. 10, FCA) was introduced and passed in the House on June 8, 2017. The bill aims to reduce budget deficits by $33.6 billion over the next 10 years and includes 12 titles that would provide regulatory relief to financial firms, investors, and borrowers. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 aims to repeal or amend provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, a regulatory reform legislation passed after the financial crisis. President Trump and Chairman Hensarling seek to dismantle Dodd-Frank, while the minority on the House Financial Services Committee opposes the FCA's changes to critical safeguards. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 aims to repeal or amend provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, a regulatory reform legislation passed after the financial crisis. Dodd-Frank improves accountability in the financial system and protects consumers, investors, and the economy from abusive Wall Street practices. This report highlights major policy proposals in the version of the bill as passed in the 115th Congress, providing context for these proposals in the form of background and policy debate. Some argue excessive regulation hinders economic growth and access to credit, while others believe regulations strengthen financial stability and protect consumers. The debate centers on finding a balance between regulatory relief for financial institutions and maintaining stability in the financial system. The FCA would provide regulatory relief to banks and securities markets' participants through various provisions aimed at assisting community banks and all banks, modifying or repealing rules from the Dodd-Frank Act, and targeting long-standing regulatory practices. The FCA includes provisions that provide relief to banks and securities markets, such as the Volcker Rule and leverage ratio. These provisions aim to facilitate capital formation by relaxing restrictions on eligible investors, regulatory requirements for licensed professionals in the securities industry, and firms issuing capital or securities. Strengthening prudential regulation post-financial crisis has been a major goal, focusing on bank capital adequacy to ensure banks can meet obligations and absorb losses. Capital is the difference between a bank's assets and liabilities, indicating its financial stability. The bank's capital decreases by $5 to $95, with $90 in liabilities. Capital requirements are based on ratios of capital to assets, including a leverage ratio and a risk-weighted asset ratio. Failure to meet these ratios could result in regulatory action, potentially leading to the bank's closure. Leverage ratios treat all assets equally, while risk-weighted ratios assign different risk weights to assets based on their likelihood of losing value. The Basel Committee sets capital ratios for banks based on asset risk weights. Basel III is the latest reform proposal. Capital requirements vary by bank size and complexity. Simple leverage ratios are also considered. Large banks are required to meet a 4% leverage ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio ranging from 3% to 6% based on size and organizational unit. The supplementary ratio considers off-balance-sheet assets. Economists argue for both risk-weighted and leverage ratios to balance risk and return. Without risk weighting, banks may favor riskier assets due to capital costs. Banks may shift out of certain businesses if leverage ratios replace risk-weighted ratios. Risk-weighted ratios can be inaccurate and distort bank behavior, as seen with highly rated mortgage-backed securities before the crisis. The leverage ratio acts as a backstop to ensure banks hold sufficient capital. Some argue that the risk-weighted system is needlessly complex. Some argue that the risk-weighted system is unnecessarily complex and benefits larger banks. They suggest replacing it with a simpler leverage ratio to ensure banks hold more capital. This change could prevent banks from investing in risky assets favored by politicians and governments. Some argue for a higher leverage ratio to replace complex risk-weighted regulations, believing sufficient capital is key for bank safety. This approach may eliminate other prudential regulations but could lead to less regulatory micromanagement. Others argue that various regulations, including capital requirements, are essential for ensuring financial institution stability. The new regulatory approach offers banks relief from various regulations, including risk-weighted capital ratios and other restrictions. Banks can choose to follow current regulations or opt for the higher leverage ratio with exemptions from certain rules. The relief applies to all banks and larger banks with assets ranging from $50 billion to $700 billion. The new regulatory approach offers banks relief from various regulations, including risk-weighted capital ratios and other restrictions. Banks can choose to follow current regulations or opt for the higher leverage ratio with exemptions from certain rules. The 10% leverage ratio is significantly more capital than banks are currently required to hold, but many banks already meet or exceed this requirement. The bill provides regulatory relief for traditional banks that are already above a 10% ratio without requiring them to hold more capital. The CBO estimates that larger banks are less likely to elect the 10% leverage ratio than smaller banks. It is uncertain which banks would choose to hold the 10% leverage ratio, with CBO estimating that half of banks exceeding the ratio would elect to do so. This would account for roughly 9% of total bank industry assets. The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits banks from proprietary trading of risky assets and certain relationships with risky investment funds. It includes exemptions for legitimate trading activities like risk-mitigating hedging and market making. Named after Paul Volcker, it aims to reduce additional risks in the financial system. Volcker proposed the rule to prevent commercial banks from engaging in speculative activities that pose risks and conflicts of interest. He argued that these activities are better suited for other areas of the financial markets and are not essential for commercial banks. The presence of deposit insurance also creates moral hazard problems as banks are implicitly backed by taxpayers. Support for the Volcker Rule is often framed as preventing banks from \"gambling\" in securities. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent banks from engaging in risky activities like proprietary trading and hedge fund sponsorship to reduce moral hazard and systemic risks. It is debated whether these activities pose greater risks to bank solvency compared to traditional banking activities. The rule prohibits these activities in any subsidiary within a bank holding company to mitigate concerns about moral hazard and taxpayer risk. The Volcker Rule presents challenges in differentiating between proprietary trading and permissible activities like hedging and market making, leading to regulatory complexity and potential burdens on banks. The House Financial Services Committee report argues that the rule may undermine financial stability rather than preserve it, as banks may alter their behavior to avoid regulatory burdens. The report argues that banks will change behavior to avoid regulatory burden, reducing financial market efficiency. The Volcker Rule will increase borrowing costs for businesses, lower investment returns for households, and constrain market-making activity, impacting liquidity in key fixed-income markets. The FCA proposes repealing the Volcker Rule entirely. Small and emerging companies may face challenges in accessing funds for investment due to compliance costs with SEC regulations. The JOBS Act of 2012 provides regulatory relief for small capital issuers issuing unregistered securities. This relief may impact SEC disclosures, balancing investor protection and capital formation goals. Small and emerging firms are considered risky investments, but expanding securities options could benefit investors. Expanding securities options for investors can increase risk diversification. SEC disclosures may not always facilitate informed investing due to potential information overload. Small issuers exempt from certain disclosure requirements may reduce investor willingness to pay for equity. The FCA contains provisions for regulatory relief related to capital issuance by small firms, including exemptions from auditor attestation requirements for public companies with a small public float. The FCA would increase the exemption from Section 404(b) to nondepository corporate issuers with a public float from $75 million to $500 million, allowing for equity crowdfunding without SEC registration. The FCA is considering loosening regulations on equity crowdfunding, allowing companies to raise unlimited funds and investors to invest without limits. Issuers could offer securities directly to investors, bypassing intermediaries. SEC Regulation D exempts certain securities offerings from registration requirements. The FCA is considering loosening regulations on equity crowdfunding, allowing companies to raise unlimited funds and investors to invest without limits. SEC Regulation D exempts certain securities offerings from registration requirements, while prohibiting issuers from publicly marketing them via general solicitation. Critics argue that the SEC policy lacks clarity on whether general solicitation is allowed during demo days. The FCA proposes revising Reg D to allow general solicitation at demo days as long as it does not specifically reference a securities offering. XBRL Exemptions aim to improve financial data dissemination for publicly traded companies. The FCA is considering exempting emerging growth companies and small public companies with annual revenues under $250 million from using XBRL for SEC disclosures. Additionally, there is a proposal to raise the Investment Company Act registration threshold for venture capital funds organized and run by their general partners. The FCA is considering exempting emerging growth companies and small public companies with annual revenues under $250 million from using XBRL for SEC disclosures. Concerns exist over the 100-owner limit for venture capital funds, leading to the creation of qualifying venture capital funds (QVCFs) with a $50 million investment limit and up to 500 owners before registration is required. SEC-registered investment advisers are fiduciaries under federal securities laws. SEC-registered investment advisers are fiduciaries under federal securities laws, obligated to act in the client's best interest. Brokers and dealers, who receive commissions, are held to a less demanding standard of making suitable investment recommendations. The SEC has not yet established a uniform standard of client responsibility for broker-dealers and investment advisers. The Department of Labor broadened the fiduciary obligation for financial professionals, including broker-dealers and insurance agents, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Department of Labor broadened the fiduciary obligation for financial professionals under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. President Trump directed the DOL to analyze the impact of the fiduciary rule, which was later delayed to June 9, 2017. The rule aims to address concerns about investment advisers and consultants managing retirement accounts and potentially conflicting interests. The Department of Labor's fiduciary rule aims to address conflicts of interest in investment advice, including steering IRA owners based on advisers' financial interests. Critics argue it could harm retirees and increase costs. The Financial Choice Act would repeal the rule, with the SEC required to report on potential impacts before implementing a new standard. The fiduciary standard could impact broker-dealers negatively and limit retail investor access to personalized investment advice. The DOL cannot reissue a fiduciary rule until after the SEC does. Securitization involves turning debt into securities for investors, reducing banks' risk and enhancing financial stability. Nonbank lenders can also benefit from securitization. Securitization enhances financial stability by allowing nonbank lenders to make loans with limited long-term funding sources, increasing credit availability. The growth of securitization before the financial crisis drove loan origination but led to a decline in ABS value during the crisis. Post-crisis, ABS issuance has grown but remains below precrisis levels, with securitizers now required to retain some risk under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires securitizers to retain at least 5% of risk unless assets meet underwriting standards. Securitizers cannot hedge retained credit risk and must conduct due diligence on underlying assets. ABS investors receive more information about underlying assets to prevent origination of loans without proper underwriting, which contributed to the financial crisis. During the financial crisis, private-label securitization in subprime and nonconforming mortgage markets exacerbated turmoil. Losses in the RMBS market caused wider issues, leading to a lack of confidence in financial firms due to uncertainty about RMBS exposure. One solution is requiring securitizers to retain some default risk, known as \"skin in the game,\" to maintain underwriting standards. However, this may reduce credit availability in securitized loan markets. Requiring securitizers to retain some default risk, known as \"skin in the game,\" may reduce credit availability in securitized loan markets. This could lead to less funding for new loans and increase costs for borrowers. Concentrating risk in certain financial sectors could also increase financial instability. Opponents argue that certain loan types have different characteristics and securitization practices that reduce the incentive problem. The FCA proposes amending the risk retention rule to only apply to securities composed of residential mortgages, excluding nonresidential mortgage ABS. Federal policy does not regulate executive compensation levels but requires disclosure. The \"say-on-pay\" provision from the Dodd-Frank Act is an example of current disclosure requirements for public companies. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates disclosure requirements for executive compensation, including \"say-on-pay\" and \"pay ratio\" provisions. Additionally, federal financial regulators are required to establish rules to prevent incentive-based compensation that encourages inappropriate risks at financial institutions with over $1 billion in assets. Critics argue that current executive compensation disclosure requirements impose unnecessary costs without providing useful information to maximize shareholder return. Compliance challenges and costs of generating worker pay data for pay ratio calculations are particularly burdensome for large multinational firms with decentralized payroll systems. The debate centers on whether high executive pay reflects productivity or corporate governance issues, with research showing a disconnect between executive pay and financial performance. The FCA proposes changes to executive compensation rules, including eliminating mandatory shareholder votes on pay and repealing the CEO-worker pay ratio disclosure requirement. Critics argue against these changes, fearing talent exodus and disputing their effectiveness in mitigating systemic risk. The debate continues on whether high executive pay is justified by productivity or governance issues. The Dodd-Frank Act's incentive compensation mandate may be repealed, impacting \"too big to fail\" financial firms. The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the issue, with firms like Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, and AIG needing government assistance to avoid insolvency. Financial firms are considered TBTF when their failure could disrupt financial stability due to size or interconnectedness, creating moral hazard. The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to address the issue of \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) financial firms by implementing an enhanced regulatory regime administered by the Federal Reserve. This regime holds systemically important firms to stricter prudential standards, including capital and liquidity requirements, to prevent implicit subsidies and promote market discipline. Prudential regulation, previously limited to banks, now applies to nonbank financial firms as well. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced enhanced regulatory standards for financial entities, including capital and liquidity requirements, stress tests, risk-management standards, and \"living will\" requirements. Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in assets are automatically subject to these regulations. Additionally, a subset of the largest BHCs faces additional capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements through U.S. regulations implementing Basel III. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced enhanced regulatory standards for financial entities, including capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements. Nonbank financial firms and FMUs are subject to enhanced regulation if designated as systemically important financial institutions by FSOC. Eight FMUs and four nonbank financial firms have been designated, with some designations being removed or overturned. The Act also included provisions to limit the size of financial firms and restrict emergency authority to prevent future bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced enhanced regulatory standards for financial entities, including capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements. Nonbank financial firms and FMUs are subject to enhanced regulation if designated as systemically important financial institutions by FSOC. Debate continues on whether the TBTF problem has been solved, with critics questioning the effectiveness of prudential regulation in curbing excessive risk-taking. Critics of enhanced regulation fear that designating specific firms as systemically important will undermine market discipline, leading to increased risk-taking and instability in the financial system. Proponents question the credibility of letting firms fail, citing past government interventions during the 2008 crisis as evidence of market discipline failure. The assistance provided to failing firms in 2008 may have already weakened market discipline. Government assistance in 2008 may have undermined market discipline going forward, as it weakened the credibility of allowing firms to fail. Systemic risk is a concern as investors do not fully consider the impact on society. Market discipline faces limits such as creditors lacking access to confidential information. Extending prudential regulation to nonbank SIFIs raises questions about effective adaptation and tailoring regulation to match their risks. The FSOC's designation process for nonbank SIFIs is questioned due to the lack of consensus on measuring systemic importance. The role of large insurance firms in systemic risk and the effectiveness of state-level prudential regulation are also debated. The source of systemic risk for nonbanks is examined, with a focus on firm size versus market practices. The FCA proposes repealing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act related to TBTF, including FSOC's ability to designate nonbank financial firms as SIFIs. The FCA proposes repealing enhanced regulations for firms and FMUs designated as SIFIs, including early remediation requirements and stress testing modifications. It would also remove regulatory exemptions for banks qualifying under the 10% leverage ratio and repeal provisions restricting the size and activities of financial firms posing a threat to financial stability. The FCA proposes repealing enhanced regulations for firms designated as SIFIs, including stress testing modifications and early remediation requirements. It would also remove regulatory exemptions for banks under the 10% leverage ratio and repeal provisions limiting the size and activities of financial firms posing a threat to financial stability. The changes could impact the riskiness of large financial firms and the financial system, depending on the balance between market discipline and reduced prudential regulation. The response to potential failures and the use of emergency authority during the financial crisis are also key considerations. During the financial crisis, emergency authority was used to provide loans and guarantees to financial firms and markets. The Dodd-Frank Act and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act narrowed the scope of these authorities to prevent bailouts for insolvent firms while allowing emergency liquidity for healthy but illiquid firms. Government intervention was deemed necessary to avoid financial instability, as seen with Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. Critics argue against repeated bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) to liquidate failing financial firms if their imminent failure threatens financial stability. OLA is an administrative resolution forum modeled after the FDIC's process for resolving failing banks. The FDIC can provide resources to the failing firm's estate if it lacks sufficient assets to prevent creditor reactions from causing financial instability. Any payments made by the FDIC would be recouped through the liquidation of the failed firm's assets or assessments on surviving firms in the financial industry. The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) is a fallback alternative to insolvency regimes for failing financial firms, created by the Dodd-Frank Act. It is modeled after the FDIC's process for resolving failing banks and can provide resources to the failing firm's estate. The FDIC can recoup any payments made through the liquidation of the failed firm's assets or assessments on surviving firms in the financial industry. The FDIC's Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) is used to resolve failing financial firms instead of the Bankruptcy Code due to the FDIC's guarantee to depositors and the threat of financial instability. OLA focuses on maintaining financial stability, unlike the Bankruptcy Code, which may take longer to resolve financial crises. Critics argue that the advantages of OLA, such as speed and certainty in resolving financial crises, could be achieved through a new chapter in the Bankruptcy Code tailored for large financial institutions. The continuous need for credit makes bankruptcy impractical for large financial institutions. Critics argue that government financing is necessary during a financial institution's bankruptcy, as private markets may not provide sufficient funding. The FDIC's use of government funds under OLA has been criticized for promoting expectations of bailouts for creditors and counterparties. OLA is meant for winding down failing firms, but it could potentially bail out creditors by compensating them. The FDIC's use of government funds under OLA has been criticized for potentially bailing out creditors by compensating them more than in bankruptcy. Critics worry about the FDIC's discretion in treating creditors differently. The FCA would repeal Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and introduce a new subchapter in the Bankruptcy Code for handling financial institution failures. The Financial Choice Act (FCA) would introduce a new subchapter in the Bankruptcy Code to handle financial institution failures, allowing for resolution through the courts with input from financial regulators. Covered financial institutions could be liquidated or reorganized under certain conditions to protect creditors and financial stability. The FCA would also impose limits on the Fed's emergency lending authority and restrict FMU access to the discount window. The Financial Choice Act (FCA) would introduce a new subchapter in the Bankruptcy Code to handle financial institution failures, allowing for resolution through the courts with input from financial regulators. It imposes limits on the Fed's emergency lending authority and eliminates various emergency authorities and funds. CBO projects a $14.5 billion deficit reduction over 10 years by eliminating the Orderly Liquidation Authority. The Financial Choice Act (FCA) would impact the independence and accountability of regulators like the Fed and the CFPB. The FCA raises concerns about reducing independence and increasing congressional oversight, affecting policymaking and regulatory outcomes. The FCA raises concerns about reducing independence and increasing congressional oversight for financial regulators like the CFPB and the Fed. Congress influences agency size, scope, and activities through annual appropriations and reauthorization legislation. Most financial regulators determine their own budgets and generate income from fees, except for the CFTC and the CFPB. The CFTC's funding comes from general revenues, while the CFPB's funding is transferred from the Federal Reserve's revenues. Congress can influence agency activities through appropriations and authorization processes, reallocating resources or placing limitations on funds. This control reduces agency independence and increases accountability to Congress. The Financial Accountability Act (FCA) aims to bring financial regulators and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) into the appropriations process, potentially leading to lower agency funding levels. The FCA would exclude spending related to monetary policy for the Fed and the Deposit Insurance Fund for the FDIC. The Consumer Law Enforcement Agency (CLEA) would not receive transfers from the Federal Reserve, impacting its revenue source. Certain agency fees would be classified as offsetting collections in the federal budget. The Financial Accountability Act (FCA) aims to bring financial regulators and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) into the appropriations process. The FCA would reauthorize the SEC through 2022 and the CLEA through 2018, potentially reducing direct spending by $18.4 billion over 10 years. Before the Consumer Financial Protection Act, federal consumer financial protection regulatory authority was divided among multiple agencies. The banking agencies had regulatory authority over consumer financial protection laws, enforcement, and supervision of individuals and companies offering financial products. Their jurisdictions varied based on the type of institution and financial activities. The OCC regulated national banks, the Fed regulated domestic operations of foreign and state-chartered banks, the FDIC regulated state-chartered banks, the NCUA regulated federally insured credit unions, and the OTS regulated institutions with a federal thrift charter. The banking agencies had broad authority to regulate depository institutions for safety, soundness, and consumer compliance. They conducted regular on-site examinations and had enforcement powers to address compliance issues and consumer harm proactively. The FTC lacked upfront supervisory powers over nondepository financial companies, relying on enforcement actions triggered by consumer complaints or similar events. Unlike banking agencies, the FTC could not regularly examine or impose reporting requirements on these companies. Before the Dodd-Frank Act, the rulemaking authority for federal consumer financial protection laws was mainly with the Fed, while enforcement authority was divided among banking agencies, the FTC, and HUD. Critics argued that this fragmented regulatory regime failed to adequately protect consumers and created market inefficiencies. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent agency within the Federal Reserve System, with a single director appointed by the President and funded through nonappropriated funds from the Federal Reserve System's earnings. The CFPB was created to strengthen consumer financial regulatory powers and consolidate them in a single regulator with a consumer-centric mission. The CFPB, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, has regulatory jurisdiction over consumer financial products and services, with supervisory authority over nondepository financial companies. Other agencies also have powers in this field, and certain industries are exempt from CFPB regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred consumer compliance authority over larger depositories to the CFPB, while banking agencies retain safety and soundness authority. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over 19 consumer laws and can prohibit unfair practices. The CFPB has the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts related to consumer financial products. It can enforce consumer financial protection laws through courts or administrative adjudications, imposing penalties and restitution. Criticisms include concerns about its broad powers, independence, and accountability. Discussions focus on whether the CFPB is appropriately structured for a balance between independence and transparency. Critics question the CFPB's independence and lack of diverse viewpoints due to a single director structure and non-traditional funding. Supporters argue that biannual congressional testimony and funding caps ensure transparency and accountability. Structural characteristics aim to insulate the CFPB from political pressures for focused policymaking. The CFPB's rulemakings aim to balance consumer protection with access to financial products while safeguarding lenders from burdensome regulations. Regulation may increase costs for providers, potentially limiting product availability and raising prices for consumers. Some believe the CFPB has achieved a suitable balance in its rulemaking. The CFPB's rulemaking aims to balance consumer protection with access to financial products while safeguarding lenders from burdensome regulations. Some believe the CFPB has struck an appropriate balance, while others argue that compliance costs imposed by the rules may restrict credit availability. The FCA proposes replacing the CFPB with a \"Consumer Law Enforcement Agency\" and making significant changes to the federal consumer financial regulatory system established by the Dodd-Frank Act. The CLEA, proposed to replace the CFPB, would have a different administrative structure and funding mechanism. Unlike the CFPB, the CLEA would not conduct examinations or supervisory activities but would have similar enforcement powers and rulemaking authority. The CLEA director could be removed at-will by the President. The proposed CLEA would acquire the CFPB's rulemaking authority over consumer laws, analyze costs and benefits before enforcement actions, and transfer consumer compliance regulation powers to banking agencies. Unlike the CFPB, the CLEA would not have authority to prohibit unfair practices in financial markets. The Federal Reserve has a unique role in monetary policy and payment system operations. The Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which includes seven governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four regional bank presidents. The Fed's financial statements are audited annually by a private sector auditor, and its policies are evaluated by GAO. The Dodd-Frank Act allowed GAO to audit the Fed's monetary policy and lending activities for waste, fraud, and abuse. During the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the Fed provided extensive credit to banks and nonbanks. During the 2009 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve provided credit to banks and nonbanks using emergency powers under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Criticisms arose over the bailouts of Bear Stearns and AIG, but the funds were repaid with interest. The Dodd-Frank Act limited Section 13(3) to prevent aid to failing firms, while still allowing the Fed to offer liquidity to healthy firms. Congress aimed to increase the Fed's independence from political influence, granting it discretion to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and stable prices. Congressional oversight remains a topic of debate. The FCA proposes expanding GAO audits of the Fed, reducing Fed's discretion over monetary policy, requiring annual audits, and implementing a mathematical rule for setting monetary policy. The proposed bill would require the Fed to compare traditional Taylor Rule with Directive Policy rule, trigger a GAO audit for non-compliance, change FOMC voting membership, restrict Fed's emergency lending powers, and create a commission to examine monetary policy. The proposed bill would require the Fed to examine and make recommendations on monetary policy, the dual mandate, macroprudential regulation, and lender of last resort functions. It would also enhance oversight by moving nonmonetary policy activities to appropriations and subjecting Fed rulemaking to cost-benefit analysis requirements. Rulemaking is a tool used by federal agencies to implement public policy. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 establishes rulemaking procedures for federal agencies, including independent regulatory agencies. Three proposals in the FCA would impact regulator discretion and accountability in the rulemaking process by requiring cost-benefit analysis, modifying the Congressional Review Act, and overturning the judicial Chevron Doctrine. Cost-benefit analysis involves examining the total costs and benefits of implementing a proposed rule. Financial regulators are not required to conduct a quantified cost-benefit analysis (CBA) before finalizing rules. The analysis they perform is often narrow and specific, focusing on effects like those on small businesses or compliance burdens. Financial regulators, classified as independent regulatory agencies, are exempt from Executive Order 12866, which sets federal CBA principles. EO 12866 establishes principles for federal CBA and a review process by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to ensure rulemaking adherence. Financial regulators are not required to conduct quantified CBAs, leading to debates on their independence and accountability. Some argue against rigid legal structures for CBAs, especially in quantifying costs and benefits. Financial regulation's effects are difficult to quantify due to behavioral, microeconomic, and macroeconomic responses. Increasing rulemaking requirements may hinder regulation effectiveness. Some argue for stricter CBA requirements for financial regulators. The CBA is seen as necessary for disciplining agencies in implementing rules and assessing regulation desirability, even in financial regulation. Performing CBA for financial regulations is deemed feasible, with available data for estimating benefits and costs. The FCA mandates financial regulators to conduct CBA, outlining 12 areas of analysis to evaluate the necessity, efficacy, benefits, and costs of rules. The bill proposes restrictions on rule implementation based on CBA findings, with agencies unable to proceed if costs outweigh benefits without a waiver. Adversely affected parties can seek judicial review, and financial regulators must conduct retrospective CBAs post-implementation. The Congressional Review Act serves as an oversight tool for Congress to invalidate regulations. The Congressional Review Act provides Congress with expedited procedures to invalidate federal agency rules they oppose. This includes limited debate and amendment on a joint resolution disapproving a rule, with a simple majority vote required. If both houses agree on the resolution, it is sent to the President for approval or veto. If enacted, the rule in question will not take effect. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to invalidate federal agency rules through expedited procedures. If a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, the rule will not take effect. The CRA prohibits judicial review of any actions under the act. Congress has used the CRA to overturn 13 rules issued by the Obama Administration in the 115th Congress. In recent years, there has been bipartisan consensus that the Congressional Review Act (CRA) has not been effective as an oversight tool for administrative rules. Despite its promise, the CRA has produced few results according to a House 2015 committee report. The increased use of the CRA in the 115th Congress may influence opinions on its effectiveness. Prior to 2017, the CRA had overturned only one agency rule in 20 years due to the supermajority requirement in Congress. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires a two-thirds supermajority in Congress to enact a resolution of disapproval for administrative rules. The process tilts the playing field towards the President, making the CRA largely unworkable as an oversight mechanism. Restructuring proposals have been introduced to address these concerns. Proposals aim to change the CRA disapproval mechanism to require Congress to approve major rules before they can take effect. The REINS Act (H.R. 26) is a key proposal in this regard, passed by the House on January 5, 2017. Supporters argue this would shift power to Congress in rulemaking, while opponents have concerns. The FCA proposes amending the CRA to require congressional approval for major financial agency rules, increasing accountability to Congress. This would apply only to rules from federal financial agencies listed in Table 1, with reporting requirements and a fast-track approval process. The FCA proposes amending the CRA to require congressional approval for major financial agency rules, increasing accountability to Congress. Major rules would not take effect without a joint resolution of approval within 70 session days. There is a provision for a 90-day period for a major financial rule to take effect without approval in cases of emergency or national security. The Financial Choice Act (FCA) proposes changes to the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to increase accountability of financial agencies to Congress. It includes a provision for court review of agency interpretations of the law, addressing ambiguity in congressional delegations of authority. The Supreme Court's Chevron decision limited the role of courts in reviewing agency interpretations. The Chevron decision limited the role of courts in reviewing agency interpretations of law, emphasizing deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. This has been a cornerstone of administrative law for over three decades, allowing federal agencies to resolve ambiguities in implementing authority provided by Congress. The Chevron decision established principles for courts to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes, based on authority delegated by Congress. This \"Chevron two-step\" test requires judges to uphold agency interpretations unless Congress has clearly spoken on the issue. The Chevron decision established principles for courts to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes when Congress has not directly addressed the issue. The court must determine if the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. The Chevron decision established principles for courts to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. Congress delegated authority to agencies to clarify ambiguity, and the Supreme Court reasoned that agencies are best suited to interpret statutes due to their technical expertise and ability to make policy decisions within complex regulatory schemes. Courts lack expertise compared to administrative agencies, as acknowledged in Chevron. Judges should defer to agency interpretations of statutes, as agencies are politically accountable and have the authority to implement policy judgments. If the agency's interpretation is undesirable, the electorate can voice their concerns through the democratic process. The Chevron deference allows for agency expertise in interpreting statutes, but some argue it gives agencies too much power to expand their authority. A recalibration of judicial review may be necessary to ensure statutes are interpreted as intended by Congress. The Federal Courts Accountability Act (FCA) aims to recalibrate judicial review over agency interpretations of statutes to hold federal financial agencies more accountable. This could lead to increased scrutiny of agency decisions and more legal challenges to rulemakings, potentially delaying new regulations and increasing costs. The FCA would require courts to conduct de novo review of administrative actions instead of deferring to agency interpretations under Chevron. The Federal Courts Accountability Act (FCA) proposes de novo review of administrative actions, removing deference to agency interpretations. It would bar courts from using gaps in the law to expand agency authority or defer to their interpretations. The bill does not explicitly prohibit considering agency reasoning and technical expertise. The Federal Courts Accountability Act (FCA) proposes de novo review of administrative actions, removing deference to agency interpretations. It would bar courts from expanding agency authority or deferring to their interpretations. The FCA would give courts greater latitude to set aside, overrule, and modify agency interpretations. Another major administrative tool held by federal financial agencies is their power to enforce laws within their jurisdictions, which can be affected by various factors such as statutory authority, enforcement powers, and resources available. The Federal Courts Accountability Act (FCA) proposes changes to enforcement authorities of federal financial regulators, including increasing civil penalties for violations of laws and constraining enforcement powers. The Financial CHOICE Act proposes changes to the enforcement powers of federal financial regulators, including repealing the SEC's authority to prohibit individuals from serving as officers or directors of securities issuers under certain circumstances. It also restricts legal settlements that involve payments to non-victims of alleged wrongdoing and could impact the funding and enforcement resources of regulators. The Financial CHOICE Act proposes changes to federal financial regulators' enforcement powers, including repealing the SEC's authority to prohibit individuals from serving as officers or directors of securities issuers. It also restricts legal settlements involving payments to non-victims, impacting regulators' funding and enforcement resources. The Act includes selected provisions in the FY2018 Appropriations Act, combining bills in Division D of H.R. 3354. Notable changes include repealing the Conflict Minerals provision. H.R. 10 repealed the Conflict Minerals provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, while H.R. 3354 prohibited the use of funds for enforcing it. H.R. 3354 also repealed the Department of Labor's 2016 Fiduciary Rule."
