    "content": "Doping in sport involves the use of substances or methods to enhance athletic performance, with concerns about health effects and ethical implications. Anti-doping rules have been in place since the 1920s, but enforcement is limited by lack of uniform standards. The International Convention Against Doping in Sport, adopted in 2005 by UNESCO, aims to harmonize anti-doping commitments globally. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) leads the fight against sport doping and established the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in 1999 to enforce anti-doping activities. WADA developed the World Anti-Doping Code to harmonize policies globally. The Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping in Sport was signed by 191 countries in 2003, including the United States. The Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping in Sport, signed by 191 countries in 2003, identifies the World Anti-Doping Code as the foundation for global anti-doping efforts. The declaration aims to ensure national anti-doping policies align with the Code and recognizes WADA's role in coordinating international anti-doping activities. UNESCO's 2005 International Convention Against Doping in Sport requires State Parties to harmonize their laws with the Code, including measures to restrict prohibited substances, grant therapeutic use exemptions, fund anti-doping programs, sanction violators, promote research and education, and facilitate international cooperation. The Convention requires States Parties to provide status reports on compliance every two years. WADA is an advisory organization to the Conference of Parties. U.S. ratification of the treaty does not require changes to domestic laws or additional funding. The Administration considers ratification a priority and the President has transmitted the treaty to the Senate for ratification. The White House Press Secretary justified the need for ratifying the Convention to rid athletics of cheating through chemistry. International commitments to anti-doping can set a positive example for athletes and discourage the use of performance-enhancing substances. Lack of ratification could result in a ban from hosting and participating in international competitions, including future Olympic Games. The IOC requires governments to ratify the treaty by January 1, 2009, or face exclusion from future games. The Senate approved the treaty for anti-doping in sports with conditions on funding and athlete definition. President Bush signed the ratification in August 2008, impacting Chicago's bid for the 2016 Olympics. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) enforces the Code for Olympic sports in the United States and reports spending on anti-doping tests. Major professional sports leagues have their own anti-doping policies. The U.S. Office on National Drug Control Policy aims to eliminate doping in sports. The U.S. government enforces laws to combat doping in sports, prohibiting the use of substances listed in the Code. Law enforcement agencies, such as the DEA, are involved in investigating doping cases, as seen in Operation Raw Deal which led to 124 arrests in 2007. Operation Raw Deal in 2007 led to 124 arrests and seizure of steroids, money, vehicles, boats, and weapons. USADA supports anti-doping research and education with a budget of $2 million per year. Other funding comes from U.S. government agencies like the DEA and Department of Education. The U.S. government participates in international anti-doping efforts. The U.S. government, as a signatory to the 2003 Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping in Sport, recognizes the role of WADA in setting international anti-doping standards. Congress provides funding to support WADA, with $1.7 million appropriated in FY2008. The U.S. also engages in anti-doping activities through various organizations in the Americas. The International Convention Against Doping in Sport does not apply to U.S. professional sports, but some athletes may follow the Code when competing internationally. Article 20 of the Convention requires States Parties to encourage professional sports associations to develop anti-doping principles consistent with the Code. International anti-doping efforts are hindered by a lack of effective tests to detect prohibited substances, leading to challenges in identifying new undetectable substances. The use of steroids in sports was widespread by the early 1970s, but a reliable test method was not found until 1974. They were added to the IOC's list of prohibited substances in 1976. Anti-doping efforts have faced challenges with designer steroids and concerns about gene doping. Critics question if the Code adequately protects athletes and argue that punishments are too harsh. Some critics question the legitimacy of WADA in international anti-doping policy, citing lack of transparency and resistance to scrutiny. Concerns include handling drug testing samples, avoiding contamination, and dealing with false positives. The International Convention Against Doping in Sport requires funding from States Parties, committing the United States to continue funding WADA and domestic anti-doping tests. Some critics argue that the cost of anti-doping activities, including legal expenses, may outweigh the benefits of deterring performance-enhancing substance use in sports. USADA's legal costs in 2006 exceeded 15% of its total expenses, and in 2008, they sought over $1 million in financial support from WADA for a legal case against cyclist Floyd Landis."
