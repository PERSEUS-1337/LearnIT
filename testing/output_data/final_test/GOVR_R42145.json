    "content": "At the start of the 112th Congress, the economy showed signs of recovery but housing markets remained fragile. Policy questions arose about government intervention in housing markets and the impact of scaling back government involvement. Prioritizing housing programs for low-income populations in a tight fiscal environment was also a concern. During the 112th Congress, housing markets across the country were fragile due to home price declines, weak demand, and high foreclosure rates. Homeownership markets saw falling prices and low demand, with some signs of improvement in 2012 such as lower inventory levels and rising home sales. During the 112th Congress, housing markets were fragile with falling prices, weak demand, and high foreclosure rates. Despite some positive signs in 2012 like lower inventory levels and rising home sales, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures remained high. The national homeownership rate dropped to 65.6%, the lowest since 1997, due to delayed homeownership and former homeowners becoming renters after foreclosure. The national homeownership rate has been declining since 1990, with analysts predicting it to decrease further due to impending foreclosures. Many households are opting to rent instead of buying homes, leading to decreased demand and lower house prices. The housing market saw a sharp increase in prices until the mid-2000s, followed by a slowdown and eventual decline. Figure 2 shows the trend in house price appreciation using the HPI published by the FHFA. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) publishes the Housing Price Index (HPI), showing a national trend of steady house price gains until around 2006 when prices began to appreciate more slowly and then depreciate. House prices continued to decline nationally for several years, with a slight increase in the first quarter of 2012 and a 3% increase in the second quarter. Regional differences in house prices are masked by the national trend. Falling house prices have led to many homeowners having negative equity, with nearly 24% of households in this position as of the first quarter of 2012. Regional differences in negative equity exist, with Nevada having the highest percentage at 61% and Alaska the lowest at 6%. Negative equity can hinder households from avoiding foreclosure and selling their homes at a sufficient price to pay off their mortgage debt. It can also limit the ability to refinance and reduce overall wealth, impacting consumer spending. High foreclosure rates in the homeownership market may affect U.S. rental markets as owner-occupied units could be converted to rental housing. The increase in rental housing supply from owner-occupied units being converted to rentals by homeowners unable to sell at desired prices or by investors purchasing foreclosed homes could lead to reduced rental rates. This trend may also result in former homeowners becoming renters, potentially increasing demand for rental housing and leading to higher rents. Tightening rental markets with lowering vacancy rates and rising rental rates are being observed nationwide, impacting affordability due to weak income gains and rising housing costs. The 2000s saw a decrease in real renter incomes, while rents and energy costs rose sharply, leading to affordability issues, especially for low-income families. HUD's study showed a 20% increase in families with worst case housing needs between 2007 and 2009, with most facing severe rent burdens. This section discusses housing finance, mortgage markets, and access to housing. The 112th Congress addressed housing finance issues, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac being placed into conservatorship in 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act required recommendations for ending the conservatorship, leading to a report in 2011 recommending winding down the GSEs. In February 2011, a report recommended winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, proposing three options for the government's future role in housing finance. The options included targeting federal mortgage programs to low- and moderate-income households, expanding federal programs during crises, and providing catastrophic reinsurance behind private capital. The government would provide reinsurance on certain types of mortgages, charging the private sector for this service. Over 60 bills have been introduced in Congress to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with two becoming law. H.R. 3765 requires increased fees on mortgage sellers, with proceeds going to the Treasury. S. 2038 prohibits bonuses to senior executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while in conservatorship. The Federal Housing Administration, part of HUD, insures home mortgages made by private lenders. If a borrower with an FHA-insured mortgage defaults, FHA pays the lender the unpaid amount. FHA's program is funded through the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund and has historically been self-financing. The FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund has been strained due to increased default and foreclosure rates on FHA-insured mortgages. The capital reserve ratio, which should be 2% or higher, fell to 0.24% in FY2011, raising concerns about the Fund's ability to cover future losses. FHA has taken steps to strengthen the Fund, including raising reserves. The FHA has taken steps to strengthen the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, including raising insurance premiums and tightening underwriting criteria. The 112th Congress has also considered additional measures to improve the Fund's financial position, such as increasing reporting requirements and giving FHA more authority over lenders. Legislation like the FHA Emergency Fiscal Solvency Act of 2012 has been passed by the House of Representatives. FHA's market share has also increased significantly in recent years. In recent years, FHA has seen a sharp increase in its market share. There are debates about FHA's role in the mortgage market, with some calling for a reduction in its involvement. Congress may take actions to decrease FHA's role in the short term, while its future role will be part of discussions on the U.S. housing finance system. The 112th Congress has held hearings on this topic. The 112th Congress is facing issues regarding the conforming loan limits for the GSEs and FHA. The conforming loan limit is currently $417,000 but was temporarily increased to $729,750 in high-cost areas by the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. However, this limit was reduced to $625,500 in 2011. The FHA loan limits are based on area median home prices and vary widely by area. The national floor and ceiling set loan limits in low-cost and high-cost areas, respectively. The ESA temporarily raised FHA loan limits in high-cost areas to 125% of area median home prices, with a limit of $729,750. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act established new limits at 115% of area median home prices in most areas. The FHA loan limits were temporarily raised in high-cost areas to 125% of area median home prices, with a limit of $729,750 under the ESA. The new statutory limits set loan limits at 115% of area median home prices in most areas, with a high-cost area limit of $625,500. The higher limits were extended until the end of FY2011, reinstated under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, and not extended for GSE conforming loan limits. The 110th Congress temporarily increased the FHA maximum mortgage amount and GSE conforming loan limit in high-cost areas in response to tightening lending standards. The GSE and FHA loan limits were increased to help more borrowers purchase homes, but some policymakers argue they should be allowed to fall to reduce federal involvement in the mortgage market. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 enacted financial reform legislation, but there are differing opinions on whether the loan limits should be lowered while housing markets are still fragile. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 included housing and mortgage-related provisions, establishing minimum residential mortgage underwriting standards. Lenders offering \"qualified mortgages\" will be presumed to comply with ability to repay requirements. Negative amortization is not allowed in qualified mortgages. The Federal Reserve proposed a rule in 2011 regarding qualified mortgages, which must meet specific criteria such as no negative amortization or balloon payments. The rulemaking authority was later transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which could issue new regulations different from the original proposal. The CFPB re-opened the comment period to seek further comments on the litigation risks that could arise from new requirements related to ability to repay standards and the QM definition. Comments were to be narrowly focused and based on mortgage data provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The closing date for comments was July 9, 2012. Additionally, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act requires securitizers to retain a portion of credit risk in certain circumstances to ensure loan originators have a stake in loan quality. The Dodd-Frank Act requires loan originators to have a stake in loan quality, even if loans are sold to investors. An exception is made for \"qualified residential mortgages\" (QRM) with lower default risk features. Regulators will define QRMs through rulemaking. Proposed rules for QRMs are stricter than for regular mortgages. The proposed QRM definition for mortgages requires a 20% downpayment for borrowers seeking to purchase residential property. The Dodd-Frank Act aims to reduce mortgage defaults and financial market turmoil but may also limit mortgage credit availability. The Dodd-Frank Act aims to reduce mortgage defaults and financial market turmoil by implementing QM and QRM rules. However, this may lead to less mortgage credit availability or higher costs for borrowers who do not meet the underwriting standards. Members of Congress, industry, and consumer groups are interested in the effects of these rules on mortgage finance activity and housing markets. Additionally, mortgage disclosures are being implemented to address concerns about borrower awareness of loan terms. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated the consolidation of loan disclosures to ensure borrowers are fully informed about mortgage terms. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau developed the Loan Estimate form and settlement disclosure to address concerns about predatory lending and discriminatory practices. For more information on mortgage disclosures and the CFPB, refer to CRS Report R41980 and R41338. Real estate appraisers measure property value for purchases or refinances, serving as collateral in mortgage contracts. Questions arose about regulation effectiveness during the housing crisis, leading to changes in appraiser regulation through the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred rulemaking authority for residential appraisals to the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred rulemaking authority for residential appraisals to the CFPB, along with federal oversight of appraisal management companies. The 112th Congress deliberated on various appraiser-related issues, including recent rulemakings by regulatory agencies and oversight of the Appraisal Subcommittee. Estate Appraisers, by [author name scrubbed], discusses the high rates of home mortgage default and foreclosure since 2006. Data from the OCC shows 7.0% of mortgages in delinquency and 4% in foreclosure in 2012. Despite previous initiatives to address foreclosures, some argue for new programs due to perceived shortcomings. Some argue for new programs to address high rates of home mortgage default and foreclosure since 2006. The House passed bills to terminate ineffective foreclosure prevention programs, while the Senate has not considered them. The 112th Congress has also explored policy options to limit foreclosures and ease the financial burden on homeowners. In response to high rates of home mortgage default and foreclosure, various options have been proposed, including expanding refinancing opportunities, mortgage modifications, and addressing excess vacant homes. The Federal Housing Finance Agency made changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program in 2011 to help borrowers with little equity refinance. Legislation has been introduced to further expand refinancing opportunities and offer principal reduction for certain borrowers. President Obama has supported creating a program similar to HARP for non-GSE mortgages. Legislation has been introduced regarding principal reduction for certain borrowers. Advocates argue it can reduce foreclosures cost-effectively, benefiting both borrowers and financial institutions. However, opponents claim it is costly, hard to target, and may incentivize mortgage default. FHFA has not allowed GSEs to offer principal reductions on mortgages they own or guarantee, sparking debate in Congress. The Director is urged to continue prohibiting GSEs from offering principal reduction to prevent impacts on homeowners, communities, and housing markets. Congress has introduced bills to address excess foreclosed properties, such as H.R. 1548 and the American Jobs Act (H.R. 12 and S. 1549) which includes Project Rebuild. The Obama Administration has also initiated a pilot program to address the foreclosed housing inventory held by FHA and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA is implementing a pilot program to sell foreclosed Fannie Mae properties to investors for rental conversion. Various foreclosure prevention and mitigation initiatives are detailed in CRS reports. Mortgage servicers also play a significant role in the process. The role of mortgage servicers in the housing finance system has come under scrutiny due to high foreclosure rates and investigations into foreclosure irregularities. Congress is considering national servicing standards to protect consumers and investors, but some in the industry argue against certain proposed options. Some proposals for national mortgage servicing standards aim to protect consumers by requiring a single point of contact for borrowers and prohibiting dual tracking by servicers. Some proposed mortgage servicing standards include prohibiting dual tracking, establishing staffing requirements, and ensuring servicers act in the best interest of mortgage holders. Non-legislative avenues may also be used to adopt these standards. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) issued proposed rules on August 10, 2012, to establish mortgage servicing standards for all servicers and mortgages in the United States. The rules would amend Regulation Z and Regulation X to require compliance with billing disclosure standards, advanced notice of interest rate changes, and contact with delinquent borrowers to provide foreclosure mitigation options. Additionally, restrictions would be imposed on mortgage servicers. The CFPB proposed rules on mortgage servicing standards include restrictions on charging borrowers for force-placed hazard insurance. The public comment period is open until October 9, 2012, with final rules expected by January. These rules are part of broader efforts to improve mortgage servicing, including agreements with major servicers and consent orders with top U.S. mortgage servicers to address deficiencies in servicing delinquent mortgages and foreclosures. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is establishing servicing standards for mortgages in default held or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgage servicers are required to comply with various servicing standards as part of legal settlements and consent orders. The CFPB proposed rules on mortgage servicing standards include restrictions on force-placed hazard insurance charges. In the fall of 2010, employees from large mortgage servicers raised concerns about systematic mortgage documentation and procedural improprieties, including signing affidavits without personal knowledge, back-dating documents, notarization failures, lost paperwork, excessive fees, improper payment accounting, and eligibility assessment issues for mortgage modification programs. Multiple state and federal regulators launched investigations and legal actions in response to concerns about misconduct by mortgage servicers. The regulators' varying legal authorities affected the speed and remedies of the resolutions. The largest U.S. mortgage servicers are regulated by the OCC or the FRB, which oversee their mortgage servicing activities to ensure safe and sound operations. The federal banking regulators have strong enforcement powers to conduct examinations of institutions to rectify any issues that may jeopardize financial soundness. In 2010, they found critical weaknesses in servicers' foreclosure processes and oversight of third-party vendors. In 2010, banking regulators found critical weaknesses in servicers' foreclosure processes and oversight of third-party vendors. This led to binding consent orders with 14 mortgage servicers and third-party providers to redress past harm and improve future behavior. Additionally, a separate investigation was initiated by various state and federal entities into foreclosure-related violations by the top five mortgage servicers. The \"National Mortgage Settlement\" was announced on February 8, 2012, involving five major financial institutions. It provides relief for individuals who lost homes through foreclosure and struggling homeowners. The settlement includes servicing standards and approximately $25 billion in aid to homeowners and government programs in exchange for a release of liability for legal claims. The National Mortgage Settlement announced in 2012 involves five major financial institutions and provides relief for individuals who lost homes through foreclosure. It includes servicing standards, direct aid to homeowners, and an independent monitor to oversee servicers and enforce the agreement. Legal issues related to the mortgage crisis extend beyond foreclosure-related improprieties. Mortgage market players are facing legal actions and investigations for improprieties related to foreclosures. Mortgage brokers and originators are charged with fraudulent activities and fair lending violations. Bank directors and officers are also facing fraud charges. Entities purchasing mortgages in the secondary market are seeking indemnification for losses due to underwriting standards not being met. Investors have filed federal and state securities law claims against institutions for alleged misstatements in mortgage-backed securities. Billions have been paid out in legal claims, with more expected in the future, causing uncertainty in the housing market. Financial institutions have set aside cash reserves for potential legal claims, limiting their use for other purposes. Investors have filed securities law claims against institutions for misstatements in mortgage-backed securities, leading to billions in payouts and uncertainty in the housing market. Financial institutions have reserved cash for legal claims, limiting their use for other purposes. Congress is concerned about the outcomes of these legal proceedings and their impact on the market, as well as issues related to housing assistance for low-income individuals and families. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget is mostly discretionary and focused on three main programs: Section 8 rental assistance vouchers, Section 8 project-based rental assistance subsidies, and public housing. The cost of the Section 8 voucher program has been increasing due to the creation of more vouchers each year and growing gaps between low-income tenants' incomes and market rents. The project-based Section 8 program costs have also been rising. The Section 8 program has been growing as more rental assistance contracts expire and are renewed, leading to pressure to increase funding for public housing. This funding pressure must be balanced against maintaining or increasing funding for other HUD programs like the Community Development Block Grant and grants for homelessness assistance. HUD's funding needs are determined by the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations subcommittee, with HUD's budget making up the largest share of the discretionary T-HUD appropriations bill each year. For more information on FY2013 appropriations, refer to CRS Report R42517. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is HUD's largest direct housing assistance program, serving over 2 million low-income families at a cost of over $18 billion in FY2012. Congress has considered reforms to streamline the program's administration, which provides portable rental subsidies to very low-income families through public housing authorities. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program provides rental subsidies to low-income families, but faces criticism for complexity and cost. Recent reform bills aim to simplify income eligibility, rent determination, and inspection processes. Proposed legislation also seeks to establish a permanent formula for allocating voucher funding to public housing authorities. Recent Section 8 voucher reform proposals aim to modify and expand the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration, allowing selected Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to seek waivers of federal rules. Legislation like the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2009 and the Section Eight Savings Act (SESA) have been introduced in Congress, but no action has been taken yet. The Affordable Housing and Self Sufficiency Improvement Act (AHISSA) is also being considered. The Affordable Housing and Self Sufficiency Improvement Act (AHISSA) includes administrative streamlining provisions and an expansion of the Moving to Work (MTW) program. There are over 1 million units of public housing in need of capital repairs, costing nearly $26 billion according to HUD. The public housing stock requires nearly $26 billion for physical needs, but Congress's annual appropriations fall short. Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) turn to private market loans for funding, limited by federal rules from mortgaging properties. The Obama Administration proposed the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative, known as PETRA/RAD, to address these challenges. The Obama Administration proposed PETRA/RAD to create new rental assistance contracts for PHAs, allowing them to convert public housing contracts. This would potentially provide higher subsidies and remove restrictions on mortgaging properties. While some support the proposal, others fear privatization of public housing if PHAs default on loans. The House Financial Services Committee reported a public housing reform bill, H.R. 5814, which would authorize HUD to guarantee notes for rehabilitating public housing units. A modified version of the Rental Assistance Demonstration was included in the FY2012 appropriations law, allowing HUD to convert up to 60,000 units of public housing to project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts. The public housing reform bill, H.R. 5814, includes tenant protection and preservation provisions requested by advocates. Conversions will be funded by existing public housing funds, potentially limiting units eligible for conversion based on funding levels. Affordable housing preservation efforts aim to maintain affordability of rental properties subsidized by HUD, USDA, or Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Owners entered contracts with HUD in the 1960s to provide affordable housing. In the 1960s, owners entered contracts with HUD or RHS to provide affordable housing with government assistance. Various reasons may lead owners to exit subsidized housing programs, such as paying off mortgages or allowing rental-assistance contracts to expire. HUD or RHS may terminate contracts for violations. Ending restrictions on these properties poses a risk of losing affordability. In the 1960s, owners entered contracts with HUD or RHS to provide affordable housing with government assistance. When the restrictions on these properties end, there is a risk that they will become unaffordable or unavailable to low- and moderate-income tenants, leading to displacement. In the 111th Congress, the Housing Preservation and Tenant Protection Act (H.R. 4868) aimed to address issues in preserving HUD-subsidized housing but was not enacted. HUD has proposed a more limited preservation proposal called the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) in the 112th Congress. The HUD FY2012 budget requested $200 million for a new form of rental assistance to retain affordable housing properties. The final FY2012 appropriations law provided authority for HUD's RAD proposal, limited primarily to public housing and properties with Section 8 moderate rehabilitation contracts. Additional preservation provisions included an expansion of tenant protection vouchers for at-risk tenants. The 110th Congress established a national Housing Trust Fund in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA, P.L. 110-289) to provide dedicated funding for affordable housing activities. This fund would provide annual grants to states for affordable rental housing targeted at people with extremely low incomes. For more information, refer to CRS Report R41182, Preservation of HUD-Assisted Housing. Affordable housing advocates have sought alternative funding sources for the Housing Trust Fund after contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were suspended. Critics have opposed funding the program and have tried to eliminate it altogether. Critics argue that the Housing Trust Fund could be used for political activities and duplicate other HUD programs. Advocates defend the fund, stating it targets extremely low-income individuals for rental housing. Bills in Congress propose both funding and eliminating the program. The Housing Trust Fund is supported by statutory authority. H.R. 2441 has been reported out of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program is a block grant program that provides funds for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income households. States and localities can use the funds for various housing activities such as acquisition, rehabilitation, and construction of rental or homeownership housing. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program provides flexibility in using funds for affordable housing activities. States and localities are responsible for monitoring the funds to expand their capacity in meeting long-term housing needs. An article in The Washington Post highlighted mismanagement of HOME funds for rental housing developments, with 15% of projects facing delays and $400 million in funds stalled. HUD oversight of awarded funds was also questioned. The Washington Post article raised concerns about HUD's oversight of HOME funds, citing mismanagement and stalled projects. The House Financial Services Committee held hearings on the program, with Members of Congress expressing worries about fund usage. HUD defended its oversight, stating mismanagement is minimal and stalled projects are due to the weak economy. Appropriations to the HOME program were reduced by 12% in FY2011. In FY2011, appropriations to the HOME program were reduced by about 12% due to a more austere funding environment. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55) appropriated nearly 38% less to the program in FY2012. Additional requirements for the use and oversight of HOME funds were included in the FY2012 and FY2013 appropriations bills. HUD proposed a new rule in November 2011 to strengthen oversight of HOME program funds, the first substantive changes since 1996. The proposed rule for the HOME program, published in December 2011, includes provisions for oversight and other issues similar to FY2012 appropriations law. The final rule is expected by fall 2012. The U.S. Department of Agriculture administers housing assistance programs for low and moderate income residents in rural areas, including rental housing development, rent subsidy programs, and single-family direct loan programs. These programs are available only in designated \"rural\" areas. The USDA is updating its list of designated rural areas based on Census 2010 data, which may result in some areas losing their rural designation and eligibility for housing programs. Congress is considering bills to grandfather certain areas affected by the updated data. Two housing-related tax benefits enacted during the housing crisis are set to expire soon, one at the end of 2012, the other at the end of 2013. Several bills have been introduced in the 112th Congress that would extend the exclusion of canceled mortgage debt income. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 temporarily changed the low-income housing tax credit rate to not less than 9% for new construction placed in service before December 31, 2013, ensuring a 70% subsidy for affordable housing construction. The House and Senate versions of the proposal in the 112th Congress aim to extend the 9% credit floor for new construction, exceeding the 70% subsidy in the current interest rate environment. There are also plans to establish a permanent floor for the 4% credit for rehabilitated construction. Congress is considering addressing concerns about the country's budget deficits and long-term outlook, which includes discussions on revenue needs and tax reform. Recent proposals in Congress have brought attention to the tax benefits for homeowners as a way to address revenue needs and tax reform. Suggestions include reducing or eliminating these benefits to simplify the tax code, promote equity among taxpayers, and increase economic efficiency. While changes to the mortgage interest deduction have been considered, concerns remain about the strength of the housing market. Gradual reduction of tax benefits over time has been proposed as a potential solution. Some suggest gradually reducing tax benefits for homeowners to allow the market to adjust and reduce uncertainty. For more details on proposals and budget effects, refer to CRS Report R41918. For analysis on subsidizing homeownership and current tax incentives, see CRS Report R41596."
