Congress finds that research and development in global health is crucial for sustainable solutions, improving health systems, and increasing access to services for vulnerable populations. Advances in health technologies have significantly increased life expectancies in low- and middle-income countries. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) plays a crucial role in assessing local health conditions in low- and middle-income countries and partnering with stakeholders to introduce culturally acceptable health tools. USAID emphasizes the importance of health research in achieving global health and development objectives through innovation and affordable health products. In 2006, USAID outlined a five-year health research strategy with various initiatives to advance science, technology, and innovation for development. This includes public-private collaboration, leveraging support for early stage research and development of health technologies. The early stage research and development of health technologies aim to encourage private sector investment in late-stage technology development and product introduction in developing countries. This benefits the US economy by investing in the growing US global health technology sector, providing skilled jobs, creating opportunities for US businesses, and enhancing US competitiveness in the global economy. Investments in affordable health technologies reduce disease transmission and contribute to economic development in developing countries, enhancing US national security. Product development partnerships (PDPs) are non-profit entities accelerating research for global health interventions in resource-poor settings by managing resources and partnerships across sectors. These partnerships reduce disease transmission, benefit the developing world, and result in significant cost savings for development assistance funds. USAID has supported the development of new products through the PDP model, advancing them towards registration and use in low-resource settings. Through the Health Technologies program, USAID maximizes resources for global health and ensures products reach those in need. Through the Health Technologies program, USAID has developed 85 technologies with many being used globally. Private-sector collaborators have matched USAID dollars two to one. The program's translational research complements other agencies' work, such as the Global Health Initiative. The Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development and the QDDR emphasize the importance of innovation in addressing development challenges and promoting US leadership in science for a safer, healthier, and more stable world. The purpose of the Act is to codify the Health Technologies program, supported by USAID, to improve global health, reduce mortality rates, combat diseases, and support research consistent with global development strategies. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to establish a Health Technologies Program under USAID to develop affordable technologies to improve health, reduce mortality rates, and combat diseases in developing countries. The Health Technologies Program under USAID aims to develop technologies for global health through a cooperative agreement with institutions experienced in advancing and integrating practical field experience into research and development. This program, known as the Health Technologies program, does not establish a new cooperative agreement but supports the development of technologies for global health. SEC. 5. REPORT ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT USAID. The Administrator of USAID must submit an annual report to Congress on research and development activities, including updates on research funds strategy, collaborations with other agencies, investments in science and technology, and how these complement other federal efforts. The annual report to Congress by the Administrator of USAID includes updates on research activities, collaborations with other agencies, investments in science and technology, and technologies introduced into field trials or use."
