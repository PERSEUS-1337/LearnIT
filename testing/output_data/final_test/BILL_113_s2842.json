    "content": "The \"Caregiver Corps Act of 2014\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to establish a program to support caregivers. Congress finds that a significant number of Americans, including older adults and individuals with disabilities, require assistance to live in a home or community-based setting. There are over 800,000 home health aides providing essential care, and an estimated 52,000,000 to 65,000,000 informal caregivers supporting individuals in need. Informal caregivers provide assistance to adults with disabilities and illnesses, focusing on tasks like shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, and laundry. Despite the availability of direct care workers, there is a shortage of support for individuals needing extra assistance to stay in the community. Only 12 percent of caregivers use respite services to take a break from their duties. The purpose of establishing a Caregiver Corps program is to create volunteer community service opportunities to address the shortage of assistance available for older adults. Respite volunteer programs offer incentives to volunteers, such as time-banking or modest stipends from private and public sources. The Caregiver Corps program aims to address the shortage of assistance for older adults and individuals with disabilities. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF CAREGIVER CORPS PROGRAM.
