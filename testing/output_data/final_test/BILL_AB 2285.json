    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California recognizes its unique obligation to children and youth in the foster care system, aiming to provide for their safety, well-being, and preparation for adulthood. Foster youth aging out of the system face challenges in finding employment, with a high estimated unemployment rate of 50%. Despite being a major employer, state law lacks provisions to assist these youth in becoming civil service employees. The state has a responsibility to help foster youth secure permanent employment and demonstrate the importance of hiring them. A Former Foster Youth Job Readiness Training Pilot Program is being developed in Sacramento County to prepare aged-out foster youth for employment. The Sacramento County Office of Education is developing a program to prepare aged-out foster care youth aged 18 to 25 for entry-level employment in state service. They will award grants to organizations for job readiness training and stipends for participants who meet training requirements. The Sacramento County Office of Education is implementing a program for aged-out foster care youth aged 18 to 25 to prepare them for entry-level employment in state service. Participants without a high school diploma must attend a high school equivalency exam preparation class. The office will collect data on program enrollment, completion, placements, and state employment. Eligible organizations will receive grants for job readiness training. Eligible organizations must be tax-exempt, show expertise in job readiness training, and meet additional criteria set by Sacramento County Office of Education. Eligible participants are individuals aged 18 to 25 certified by the State Department of Social Services. The curr_chunk states that individuals aged 18 to 25 who have been in foster care or a foster care program in California are eligible for job readiness training to prepare for entry-level employment in state service. This article will be in effect until January 1, 2020, and then repealed. The Department, in collaboration with the State Department of Social Services and the Sacramento County Office of Education, will support foster youth in the Former Foster Youth Job Readiness Training Pilot Program to train for entry-level positions in Sacramento County for potential future employment in classified positions within state agencies. Participants must meet minimum qualifications for the positions they apply for. After three months of training in an unclassified position, participants in the pilot program must take a written examination for their trained classification. If they do not pass the exam or receive a favorable rating, they will be released from the program. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2020. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the trial implementation of a new education code in a specific county before expanding statewide. $1.1 million is allocated for the Sacramento County Office of Education to implement the program. The Former Foster Youth Job Readiness Training Pilot Program is established under the Education Code. If the state mandates costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
