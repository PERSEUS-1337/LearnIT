    "content": "The \"Made in America Deduction Enhancement (MADE) Act\" enhances the deduction for certain domestic production. The \"Made in America Deduction Enhancement (MADE) Act\" adds a new subsection to Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, allowing eligible taxpayers to increase their deduction by a percentage of qualified core manufacturing income, production activities income, or taxable income. The term 'eligible taxpayer' refers to a taxpayer whose domestic input percentage for a taxable year exceeds 75 percent. The domestic input percentage is the ratio of domestically produced input costs to the total costs of direct material inputs allocable to gross receipts from qualified property. The term 'domestically produced input costs' refers to costs for materials that are integral to property produced by the eligible taxpayer, with the majority produced in the United States. The determination of these costs is based on specific units or groups of units of property produced by the taxpayer. The determination of whether a material is produced in the United States is based on guidelines similar to the Federal Trade Commission's rules for goods advertised as Made in USA. All or virtually all of a material must have a reasonable basis to support the claim of being produced in the United States. The United States includes any possession of the United States for qualified core manufacturing income and qualified property, excluding certain types of tangible personal property. The amendment made by this section applies to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act, relating to the extraction of natural resources or property produced in a farming business."
