    "content": "The Act may be cited as the National Employment Dispute Resolution Act of 2001 (NEDRA). The Congress finds that the prohibitive costs and emotional toll of litigation, along with the backlog of employment civil rights claims, have hindered workplace civil rights protection. Mediation is seen as a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional dispute resolution methods, allowing for creative solutions and potentially preserving employment relationships. A national program of mandated mediation for certain employment and contract disputes is proposed to address these issues. The purpose of this Act is to establish a fair and effective alternative means for resolving discrimination in the workplace, aiming to address overt and subtle forms of discrimination that hinder equal opportunity. Discrimination in the workplace causes economic and noneconomic costs, creating barriers to achieving equal opportunity and goes against public policy promoting equality. The Act aims to address workplace discrimination by providing mediation early in disputes to reduce costs, preserve relationships, and decrease formal complaints. Participation in mediation does not prevent access to the public justice system. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to provide counseling services for claims of unlawful discrimination and require employers to provide materials on discrimination to employees. Additionally, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance is amended to include provisions for addressing discrimination. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance will use mediation to address discrimination claims. Employers with approved conflict management programs and certified mediators will receive bidding preference for government contracts. Employers involved in government contracts will cover mediation costs, including fees and employee expenses over 25 miles. Settlements will include attorney fees. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance will enforce mediation for discrimination claims by employers with government contracts. Retaliation or evidence destruction will lead to sanctions. Mediation is optional for employees and does not limit access to EEO agencies or courts. Non-compliance with mediation may result in contract loss and disqualification for future contracts. Resolutions must not violate collective bargaining agreements. The voluntary settlement outcome and agreement must align with the collective bargaining agreement between an employer with a government contract and a labor union or certified bargaining representative. SEC. 4 amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to include counseling services for claims of discrimination and a requirement for employers to provide materials to employees. SEC. 5 makes an amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. SEC. 5 amends the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to provide counseling services and resolve claims of unlawful discrimination using certified mediators. SEC. 6 addresses mediation. Definitions for this section include the terms \"employer\" as any Federal agency or business receiving over $200,000 in Federal funds or having 20 or more employees, \"mediator\" as a neutral third-party trained in mediation and employment law, and \"trained mediation professional\" as someone with experience in employment mediation. The term \"certified mediation center\" refers to entities qualified to facilitate employment or contract mediation and provide training on dispute resolution, including organizations like the American Arbitration Association and the American Bar Association. Employers must establish an internal dispute resolution program that allows employees access to certified mediators. They must participate in mediation if requested by the employee or claimant, even if the outcome is voluntary. The employer must inform the employee of their right to legal representation and mediation. If the employee agrees to mediate, the statute of limitations is paused, and they have 90 days to resolve the dispute. If mediation fails, the employee retains the right to pursue the matter through legal channels. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and State or local authorities must offer technical assistance to unrepresented parties in proceedings, including pre-mediation counseling and help with understanding case law and potential remedies. Submission of a claim for mediation does not prevent seeking other relief. The mediation process allows for seeking other relief, but parties must wait until mediation concludes. Settlements are voluntary and confidential, preserving the privacy of all parties involved. Attorneys must inform clients about mediation and their obligation to participate in good faith. Judicial enforcement can be sought for mediation agreements. Judicial enforcement can be sought in a Federal district court for a mediation agreement, with confidentiality provisions protecting discussions from being used in future legal proceedings."
