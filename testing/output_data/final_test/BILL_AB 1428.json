    "title": "AB 1428",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 8880.5 of the Government Code is amended to create the California State Lottery Education Fund within the State Treasury. The fund is continuously appropriated for education purposes, with payments distributed quarterly to public school districts based on average daily attendance. In each fiscal year from 2008-09 to 2014-15, average daily attendance for public school programs, including adult classes and regional occupational centers, will be calculated based on the 2007-08 fiscal year. Payments will also be made to public school districts serving community colleges based on average daily attendance. Payments will be made directly to the California State University, University of California, and Hastings College of the Law based on the number of full-time equivalent units. The funds will be deposited in specific education funds or local trust accounts as per regulations. Payments will be made directly to various educational programs and institutions based on attendance or enrollment, including programs for children with disabilities and state hospital education programs. No Budget Act or other statutory provision shall direct payments for public education to be used for certain authorized purposes and programs. School districts and agencies receiving funds may choose to use allocated funds for enrichment or expansion of prescribed programs. Each school district and county superintendent of schools must create a separate account for lottery education funds. The commission will gather and publish information on these accounts on their website. In the 1998\u201399 fiscal year and onwards, average daily attendance will be increased by the statewide average rate of excused absences from 1996\u201397. Funds from the California State Lottery Education Fund must be used solely for education purposes, not for noninstructional purposes like real estate or research. The Legislature declares that this act aligns with the California State Lottery Act of 1984, enacted by Proposition 37."
