Some argue that current regulations have hindered economic growth and consumer access to credit, while others believe they have strengthened financial stability. The 114th Congress is considering regulatory relief for banks to address increased regulation post-financial crisis. Some argue current regulations have strengthened financial stability and consumer protections, while others fear relief could harm consumers and market stability. Proposals in the House and Senate have been combined into comprehensive packages for review. The 114th Congress is considering regulatory relief for banks post-financial crisis. The report focuses on proposals addressing traditional banking areas like deposits and loans, with some adjustments to pre-crisis policies. It covers legislative action on banking legislation for relief, varying in type and recipients. The report classifies regulatory relief proposals into categories such as safety and soundness, mortgage and consumer protection, supervision and enforcement, or capital issuance. It assesses the trade-off between the benefits and costs of regulation, including enhancing safety and soundness, protecting consumers and investors, and promoting financial stability. The presence of regulatory burden, which refers to the costs associated with government regulation, does not necessarily mean a regulation should be repealed. Regulatory requirements often impact financial service providers, with banks frequently discussed in relation to regulatory burden. While some costs may be passed on to consumers, any benefits of regulatory relief must be balanced against potential reductions in consumer protection and other regulation benefits. Regulatory burden contrasts with unduly burdensome, focusing on the costs of regulation. The regulatory burden is about the costs of regulation, while unduly burdensome refers to the balance between benefits and costs. Policymakers debate whether certain regulations are unduly burdensome for banks, with some advocating for relief and others believing the benefits outweigh the burden. Relief proposals for banks involve assessing who would receive relief and how it would be provided. Regulatory relief for small banks in the 114th Congress has been a focus, with proposals including size thresholds. Relief can take various forms such as repealing provisions, exemptions, or tailoring requirements to be less burdensome. Examples of tailoring include streamlining regulations, grandfathering existing entities, or phasing in new regulations. In financial regulation, Congress sets broad goals in statute, leaving regulators to fill in details. Some legislative proposals aim to change specific details of regulations issued by regulators, leading to debates over Congress overriding regulator discretion. Congress may intervene if regulators misinterpret its will or neglect other policy objectives. The goal of safety and soundness regulation is to ensure banks remain profitable and avoid failure, protecting taxpayers and maintaining financial stability. Regulators monitor risk profiles and set metrics for areas like capital and liquidity. Reforms post-financial crisis aim to prevent bank failures, but opinions differ on their effectiveness and cost. H.R. 5983 allows well-rated banks to opt for higher regulation at 10%. Banks with high ratings on recent examinations can opt for a higher 10% leverage ratio, exempting them from certain regulations like risk-weighted capital ratios, liquidity requirements, and merger restrictions. They can choose between current regulatory requirements or this new approach, which provides relief from various regulations, including some that apply only to larger banks. The Dodd-Frank Act's Section 165 enhances prudential regulations, including capital standards, liquidity standards, counterparty limits, risk-management standards, and \"living will\" requirements. Regulators can still conduct stress tests on banks with over $50 billion in assets but are limited in requiring them to alter their capital levels. Strengthening prudential regulation has been a key goal of post-crisis financial reforms due to over 500 bank failures between 2007 and 2014. One of the main areas of focus in assessing a bank's activities is its capital adequacy, which is the difference between its assets and liabilities. Capital ratios, such as a leverage ratio and a risk-weighted ratio, are used to measure a bank's ability to absorb losses. A 10% capital ratio would mean $10 of capital for every $100 of assets. Banks must meet various capital ratios to ensure financial stability. The capital ratios used to assess a bank's financial stability fall into two main categories: leverage ratio and risk-weighted asset ratio. Failure to meet these ratios could result in regulatory action, including potential closure of the bank. The leverage ratio treats all assets equally, while the risk-weighted asset ratio assigns a risk weight to each asset based on its likelihood of losing value. These ratios require banks to hold sufficient capital to absorb potential losses. The specifics of these ratios were proposed by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision and implemented in the U.S. The Basel Committee proposed capital ratios for banks, with the most recent reform known as Basel III. Banks must meet varying capital requirements based on size and complexity. Most banks need a 4% leverage ratio, while large banks face a supplementary ratio of 3% to 6%. This supplementary ratio considers off-balance-sheet assets and exposures. The Basel III reform proposed capital ratios for banks based on size and complexity. Banks must meet different risk-weighted ratios depending on capital quality, with a 4.5% requirement for high-quality capital and 6-8% for lower quality. Additional capital conservation buffers and surcharges apply to certain banks, including global systemically important banks. A countercyclical buffer may also be imposed on large banks if deemed necessary by regulators. Some economists argue for both risk-weighted and leverage ratios in banking policy to balance risk and return. Risk weighting prevents banks from favoring riskier assets due to capital costs, but it can be inaccurate, as seen with highly rated MBSs leading to unexpected losses during the crisis. The leverage ratio acts as a backstop to prevent banks from holding insufficient capital and incentivizing excessive risk-taking within a risk weight. Critics argue that the risk-weighted system is overly complex and benefits larger banks, leading to poorly calibrated risk weights that encourage investments in risky assets. This can distort credit allocation and provide cheaper funding for government-favored projects. Some economists advocate for a balance between risk-weighted and leverage ratios in banking policy. Critics argue for eliminating the risk-weighted system in favor of a simpler leverage ratio to prevent distortion in credit allocation. H.R. 5983 proposes a 10% leverage ratio for traditional banks, providing regulatory relief for those already meeting or exceeding this requirement. The debate over bank regulation includes whether to have both a risk-weighted ratio and a leverage ratio or just a leverage ratio. Some argue for a higher leverage ratio and eliminating other regulations, while others believe all forms of regulation are necessary for financial institution safety. Capital can absorb losses but cannot prevent them like other regulations can. The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits banks from proprietary trading of risky assets and certain relationships with risky investment funds. It includes exemptions for legitimate trading activities like risk-mitigating hedging and market-making. The final rule was adopted in 2014, and there is a proposal to repeal the Volcker Rule entirely. The Volcker Rule, named after Paul Volcker, aims to prevent commercial banks from engaging in speculative activities that pose risks and conflicts of interest. Section 901 of H.R. 5983 proposes to repeal the Volcker Rule entirely, arguing that these activities are better suited for other areas of the financial markets and are not essential for commercial banks. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent commercial banks from engaging in risky activities like proprietary trading and hedge fund sponsorship, which could pose moral hazard and systemic risk issues. These activities are seen as better suited for other parts of the financial markets and not essential for banks. The rule prohibits these activities within a bank's subsidiary to reduce the likelihood of failure and diversify risks. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent risky activities like proprietary trading in bank subsidiaries to reduce the likelihood of failure and diversify risks. However, a House Financial Services Committee report argues that the rule is unnecessary and undermines financial stability by making it challenging to differentiate between proprietary trading and permissible activities like hedging and market making. Regulatory challenges arise in determining the motives behind holding securities, whether for market making, hedging, or speculative investment. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent risky activities like proprietary trading in bank subsidiaries to reduce the likelihood of failure and diversify risks. The House Financial Services Committee report argues that the rule is unnecessary and undermines financial stability by making it challenging to differentiate between proprietary trading and permissible activities like hedging and market making. Regulatory challenges arise in determining the motives behind holding securities, whether for market making, hedging, or speculative investment. The Volcker Rule may increase borrowing costs for businesses, lower investment returns for households, and reduce economic activity overall by constraining market-making activity and reducing liquidity in key fixed-income markets. Section 115 of S. 1484 (Section 916 of S. 1910) would exempt banks with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less from the Volcker Rule, but regulators would still have discretion to apply the rule to individual small banks if necessary. The Volcker Rule allows regulators to apply it to individual small banks if their activities pose a risk to the bank's safety. Small banks with activities covered by the rule can comply within existing policies. Community banks mostly have little involvement in prohibited activities and may not have compliance obligations under the rule if they do not engage in covered activities. Regulators argue that most community banks not engaging in covered activities face minimal compliance burden under the Volcker Rule. Some officials support exempting small banks from the rule to reduce regulatory focus on unlikely issues. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig believes that most community banks can comply with Volcker Rule requirements by having clear policies and procedures in place. He estimates that less than 400 out of approximately 6,400 smaller banks in the U.S. will face significant compliance costs, but most will find their trading activities exempt from the rule. Hoenig argues that smaller institutions with expertise in complex trading should also have the expertise to comply with the Volcker Rule. A blanket exemption for smaller institutions to engage in proprietary trading and be exempt from the Volcker Rule is unwise as it would not provide meaningful regulatory burden relief for community banks. The Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act (H.R. 37) passed the House on January 14, 2015, and would modify the Volcker Rule's treatment of certain collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) as impermissible covered fund investments. H.R. 37 aims to extend the compliance deadline for banks with investments in certain CLOs under the Volcker Rule until July 21, 2019. CLOs are a type of securitization providing significant financing to U.S. companies. The Volcker Rule prohibits banks from owning securities with ownership-like rights in risky investment funds, including certain CLO-related securities. H.R. 37 aims to extend the compliance deadline for banks with investments in certain CLOs under the Volcker Rule until 2019. The extension applies only to existing CLOs funded by commercial loans issued before January 31, 2014. Banks would need to comply with the Volcker Rule for participation in newly issued CLOs. The economic impact of H.R. 37 depends on the characteristics of CLO-related obligations held by banks. Proponents argue for extending the conformance period for banks with CLO holdings under the Volcker Rule until 2019 to prevent rapid divestiture and potential losses. Opponents, including the White House, believe that extending the deadline could allow risky securities to remain in the banking system, leading to future destabilizing losses. The Investor Clarity and Bank Parity Act (H.R. 4096) passed by the House aims to allow affiliated investment advisors to share their name with hedge funds or private equity funds under certain criteria. This is in response to the Volcker Rule which prohibits banking entities from certain relationships with risky investment funds. The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities from sharing names with hedge funds or private equity funds to prevent reputational risks and potential conflicts of interest. This rule applies to all bank and thrift institutions, financial holding companies, foreign banking operations in the US, and their affiliates and subsidiaries. H.R. 4096 aims to modify the Volcker Rule by allowing an investment advisor to share its name with a fund it manages if certain criteria are met, even if it is affiliated with a bank. This change is supported by industry practice. Critics of H.R. 4096 argue that allowing investment managers to name funds after themselves could create reputational risks for affiliated banks, citing the example of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. They suggest that this practice could imply implicit sponsorship and lead to market confusion. Critics of H.R. 4096 are willing to withdraw their objection if regulators are given discretion over granting specific exemptions from naming restrictions. CBO estimates the bill would have minimal impact on spending and revenues. The Collins Amendment under the Dodd-Frank Act mandates certain capital and leverage requirements for financial institutions. Trust preferred securities are no longer eligible under this amendment. The Collins Amendment under the Dodd-Frank Act mandated capital and leverage requirements for financial institutions. Trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010, were grandfathered until January 1, 2016 for institutions with over $15 billion in assets, and permanently grandfathered for institutions with less than $15 billion in assets. Instruments issued before May 19, 2010, were eligible for capital requirements for institutions with less than $1 billion in assets. Section 123 of S. 1484 changed the threshold determination date to \"December 31, 2009 or March 31, 2010.\" The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act included a provision affecting Emigrant Bank's capital instruments. The Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act was ordered to be reported by the House Financial Services Committee. It would require federal banking regulators to consider risk and business models when promulgating rules. The legislation aims to tailor regulations to limit compliance impact and burden. The legislation aims to tailor regulations by giving banking regulators discretion to exempt banks with less than $10 billion in assets from certain rules if they are deemed burdensome or unnecessary for safety and soundness. Regulators would be required to report annually to Congress on tailoring efforts. Granting regulators more discretion to provide tailoring or exemptions could be useful if specialized expertise is needed to identify burdensome regulations. Requiring regulators to consider tailoring or exemptions may be necessary if they are not currently doing so. Proponents of certain legislation claim regulators are applying regulations designed for large banks to small banks, while others argue that Congress is better suited to make policy trade-offs on a case-by-case basis. Critics argue that granting regulators more discretion for tailoring or exemptions may result in regulatory relief different from Congress's intent. Some believe legislation is unnecessary as regulators have already provided exemptions in recent rules. Regulators overriding Congress by granting exemptions could be a concern. A \"look back\" at regulations could be time-consuming and divert attention from current initiatives. CBO estimated H.R. 2896 would increase direct spending by $20 million in 2017 and reduce revenues by $24 million from 2017 to 2026. The Mortgage Servicing Asset Capital Requirements Act of 2015 (H.R. 1408) was passed by voice vote in the House on July 14, 2015, and included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. It requires federal banking regulators to study capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets. The bill initially aimed to delay Basel III implementation for smaller institutions but that provision was removed before passage. The Mortgage Servicing Asset Capital Requirements Act of 2015 (H.R. 1408) was passed by voice vote in the House on July 14, 2015, and included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. It requires federal banking regulators to study capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets. Mortgage servicers collect payments from borrowers, work with delinquent borrowers, and can sell the right to service a mortgage to another servicer, making mortgage servicing a valuable asset. The Mortgage Servicing Asset (MSA) is an asset resulting from servicing loans secured by real estate owned by third parties. Banks must fund their assets with capital to protect against potential losses, with the Basel III framework providing guidelines on capital requirements. Federal bank regulators have implemented rules on capital treatment for MSAs, which is considered costly for banks. The new capital requirements mandate more capital for Mortgage Servicing Assets (MSAs), making it costly for banks to hold MSAs. Some banks have started selling their MSAs to nonbanks, which are not subject to Basel III capital requirements. Concerns arise about nonbank servicers cutting costs to compete for business, potentially putting homeowners at risk. Additional review is needed to determine if more capital is necessary for MSAs. Supporters of additional review argue that Basel III is an international agreement, while MSAs are unique to the U.S. housing finance system. Some Members of Congress support a study on the implications of servicing migrating to nonbanks but do not want it to delay Basel III implementation. Critics of H.R. 1408 opposed delaying Basel III for all but the largest institutions. They emphasize the importance of Basel III for safety and soundness. The study on Basel III's importance for banking system safety and soundness was completed. H.R. 1408 would have a minimal impact on the federal budget over the next 10 years. Dodd-Frank Act's Title I addresses the \"too big to fail\" issue by creating stricter regulations for large bank holding companies and non-bank SIFIs. The Fed sets stringent safety and soundness standards for BHCs with over $50 billion in assets and designated SIFIs. The proposed legislation aims to adjust the asset threshold for bank holding companies (BHCs) subject to enhanced prudential regulation by the Fed. Currently, BHCs with assets over $50 billion are regulated, but the new bill would raise this threshold to $500 billion. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) would have the authority to designate BHCs with assets between $50 billion and $500 billion as systemically important. The bill also suggests indexing these thresholds annually based on GDP growth. At least two-thirds of FSOC members would need to agree on a BHC's systemic importance based on specified factors. The bill S. 1484 / S. 1910 proposes changes to the designation process for systemically important financial institutions. It would require FSOC to provide more information to institutions and increase public disclosure requirements. Additionally, it would amend provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to BHCs subject to enhanced supervision. Section 202 of S. 1484 (Section 932 of S. 1910) would raise the threshold for BHCs to form a risk committee and conduct stress tests to $50 billion, indexed to GDP growth. Section 506 of S. 1484 (Section 966 of S. 1910) requires a GAO study on the Fed's regulatory regime. H.R. 1309 and H.R. 6392 aim to remove the $50 billion asset threshold for enhanced prudential regulation by the Fed for BHCs. The bill would subject banks designated as \"globally systemically important banks\" (G-SIBs) to enhanced prudential regulation by the Fed. For banks not designated as G-SIBs, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) could designate them as systemically important, requiring enhanced regulation. At least two-thirds of FSOC's voting members would need to find a bank systemically important using the Basel Committee's measurement approach. The bill includes a one-year phase-in period for firms undergoing the designation process. H.R. 1309 and H.R. 6392 aim to modify parts of the Dodd-Frank Act for banks subject to enhanced supervision. H.R. 6392 allows assessments on banks being considered for designation. Section 211 of H.R. 5983 would repeal certain provisions for banks with over $50 billion in assets, including early remediation requirements and emergency divestiture powers. Banks over $50 billion subject to the 10% leverage ratio would no longer be subject to certain regulations. The final rule implementing parts of Subtitle C for banks was adopted in February 2014, requiring compliance by January 1, 2015. It includes stress tests, capital planning, liquidity standards, living wills, early remediation, and risk management. Banks with over $50 billion in assets must comply with a 15 to 1 debt to equity limit if deemed a \"grave threat\" by the FSOC. Exposure limits of 25% per single counterparty have not been finalized. Enhanced capital requirements are not mandatory for all BHCs with $50 billion or more in assets. Enhanced capital requirements for banks with over $50 billion in assets have been proposed, but only the largest banks have implemented them. Foreign banks with over $50 billion in assets in the US must establish intermediate BHCs subject to heightened standards. Critics argue that many banks above the $50 billion threshold are not systemically important. Critics debate the distinction between \"regional banks\" and \"Wall Street banks\" in terms of their size and business models. Some argue that enhanced prudential regulation may not be necessary for all banks above the $50 billion threshold. Proponents advocate for practices like living wills and stress tests as essential risk management tools. Economists suggest that the issue of \"too big to fail\" is more about complexity and interdependence rather than just size. Critics argue that the \"too big to fail\" issue is not solely about size but also about complexity and interdependence. Policymakers are hesitant to let complex firms fail, leading to moral hazard and excessive risk-taking. A size threshold may not effectively identify all systemically important banks. Policymakers face a trade-off between using a simple, transparent but imperfect proxy for systemic importance, or evaluating banks on a case-by-case basis. The case-by-case designation process would be more time-consuming and resource-intensive. FSOC may not correctly identify systemically important BHCs until they become distressed. Some fear FSOC may make incorrect judgments on a bank's systemic importance due to lack of banking expertise or Treasury Secretary's veto power. Concerns exist about international agreements overriding domestic laws in financial regulation. H.R. 1309 and H.R. 6392 aim to codify G-SIB designation in U.S. statute, with potential budget deficit increase. Section 125 of S. 1484 would include Dodd-Frank Act in Economic Growth. The Dodd-Frank Act would be included in the EGRPRA review, requiring participation from the NCUA and CFPB. The NCUA and CFPB are not currently mandated to review their regulations under EGRPRA, but the CFPB is required by the Dodd-Frank Act to review its significant rules every five years. The OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC are conducting a review every 10 years to reduce regulatory burden on insured depository institutions. In 2014, banking regulators decided to expand the scope of the EGRPRA review to cover more recent regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act. Some argue that reviewing Dodd-Frank regulations would be premature and unwise, as many reforms have not been fully implemented yet. Critics argue that the EGRPRA review should not be limited to the impact on regulated entities but should also consider the benefits of regulations in preventing future financial crises. Supporters believe including Dodd-Frank, NCUA, and CFPB in the review is necessary to assess the regulatory burden on financial institutions effectively. H.R. 2209, passed in 2016, aims to require a review of liquid municipal bonds. H.R. 2209, passed in 2016, requires municipal bonds to be treated as high-quality liquid assets for LCR compliance. This bill impacts state and local government borrowing, as well as bank profitability and riskiness. CBO estimates minimal effect on the federal budget. Banking regulators implemented the LCR in 2014 as part of Basel III and Dodd-Frank Act requirements. Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act introduced international liquidity standards for banks in response to the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act requires heightened prudential standards, including liquidity standards, for banks with over $50 billion in assets and designated non-banks. The LCR applies to two sets of banks based on asset size. The LCR rule applies to depositories with $50 billion to $250 billion in assets, excluding those with significant insurance or commercial operations. Around 40 institutions must comply with the LCR. The rule does not apply to credit unions, community banks, foreign banks in the US, or non-bank SIFIs. Regulators plan to issue liquidity regulations for large foreign banks and non-bank SIFIs later. The LCR requires banks to hold enough high-quality liquid assets to match net cash outflows over 30 days in a stress scenario. HQLA must be less risky, likely to remain liquid during a crisis, actively traded, stable in price, easily valued, and accepted by the Fed as collateral. The LCR rule applies to depositories with $50 billion to $250 billion in assets, around 40 institutions must comply. HQLA must be unencumbered and include assets like bank reserves, U.S. Treasury securities, and certain corporate debt securities. Assets are categorized into Levels 1, 2A, and 2B based on liquidity, with Level 1 assets receiving more credit. The 2014 final rule did not consider municipal bonds as HQLA for the LCR, but a subsequent rule by the Fed allows banks to count a limited amount of municipal debt as Level 2B HQLA. This includes investment-grade, U.S. general obligation state and municipal securities that meet liquidity criteria similar to corporate debt securities. The amount that can qualify is based on the liquidity characteristics of the securities. The Fed's rule allows a limited amount of municipal debt to be included as HQLA, based on liquidity characteristics. Dedicated revenue bonds do not qualify. Banks must prove a security's liquidity in stressful markets for it to qualify. The rule applies to Fed-regulated institutions. The OCC and FDIC have not issued similar rules. Proponents of H.R. 2209 argue that the Fed's rule alone may not mitigate the impact of the LCR on municipal bonds. The impact of the LCR on municipal bonds is limited as banks' holdings of municipal securities are restricted. Banks subject to the LCR held about $490 billion of municipal securities in 2015, equal to 13% of the total outstanding. Even banks under the LCR can still hold municipal bonds with a stable funding source. Arguments that municipal bonds should qualify as HQLA due to low default risk are misleading. The inclusion of municipal bonds as HQLA is debated due to their low default risk but potential illiquidity. This could impact the effectiveness of the LCR and increase systemic risk. Regulators face challenges in determining which municipal securities should qualify. Some municipal securities are more liquid than others, with the 50 most actively traded municipal bond CUSIP numbers traded at least 1,970 times per year. Proponents argue that some municipal securities are more liquid than current HQLA assets like corporate debt. However, regulators argue that municipal bonds should not qualify as LCR due to difficulties in using them as collateral for liquidity access from repo markets. The Fed's final rule on accessing liquidity from repo markets did not estimate how many municipal securities would qualify as HQLA. Estimates suggest only a small portion of outstanding bonds would be eligible. There is concern that excluding 95% of the market may not strike the right balance. The classification of municipal bonds as Level 2B and Level 2A HQLA under the Fed's rule differs from H.R. 2209, making them less attractive for banks' LCR compliance. The share of municipal securities qualifying as HQLA under H.R. 2209 would depend on future rulemaking. The House passed H.R. 3791 on April 14, 2016, which would increase the threshold for BHCs and THCs subject to the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from below $1 billion to below $5 billion in assets. It also raises the threshold for exemption from the \"Collins Amendment\" to the Dodd-Frank Act. The bill passed by the House increases the threshold for BHCs and THCs under the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from below $1 billion to below $5 billion in assets. It also raises the threshold for exemption from the \"Collins Amendment\" to the Dodd-Frank Act, with CBO estimating insignificant effects on spending and revenues. After acquiring a bank, the holding company must gradually reduce debt levels and faces restrictions on dividends until debt is reduced. The Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement allows for streamlined compliance and exemption from certain regulations for banks subject to the policy. Holding companies under the policy are also exempt from the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. The Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement exempts holding companies from certain regulations and Basel III capital requirements. The threshold was raised to $1 billion in assets in the 113th Congress. Proponents see the legislation as providing regulatory relief to banks with assets between $1 billion and $5 billion. The Federal Savings Association Charter Flexibility Act of 2015 (H.R. 1660) allows federal thrifts to operate like national banks without changing their charter. This bill was reported by the House Committee on Financial Services and included in H.R. 5983. Federal thrifts historically focused on residential mortgage lending but have expanded to offer products similar to national banks. If a federal thrift wants to engage in activities allowed for national banks but prohibited for them, it would need to convert its charter, which can be costly. Supporters of H.R. 1660 argue that the proposal would provide federal thrifts with additional flexibility to adapt to changing economic conditions and business environments by allowing a less costly process for expanding their permitted activities without having to convert charters. The bill would not pose a safety and soundness risk as federal thrifts are regulated by the OCC, the same regulator as national banks, and the OCC would have authority to issue regulations to safeguard safety and soundness. The bill H.R. 1660 aims to provide federal thrifts with more flexibility in expanding their permitted activities without changing their corporate form. Critics argue that the bill should also assist credit unions in expanding their lending opportunities. The bill H.R. 1660 aims to expand opportunities for federal thrifts without changing their corporate form. It raises the question of offering different charters for businesses with similar activities, potentially weakening the benefits of diverse charters. Banks are regulated for consumer protection, with bills modifying regulations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB now has increased authority in consumer protection previously held by bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the CFPB to implement new mortgage-related policy changes through rulemakings. The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2015 (H.R. 650) passed by the House aims to amend definitions in the Truth-in-Lending Act for manufactured housing market. Sections of other bills contain similar provisions to H.R. 650. Manufactured homes are factory-built single-family housing often located in rural areas. Manufactured homes are factory-built single-family housing often located in rural areas. Consumers can purchase a manufactured home without owning the land it's placed on, unlike site-built homes. The Dodd-Frank Act changed mortgage originator and high-cost mortgage definitions to protect borrowers, potentially impacting credit availability for manufactured housing. Proposed modifications aim to increase consumer protections. The proposal aims to modify the definitions of mortgage originator and high-cost mortgage to increase credit availability. Critics are concerned about reducing consumer protections. The first part of the proposal would impact manufactured-home retailers, while the second part would affect banks directly. The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 and the Dodd-Frank Act established new requirements for mortgage originators. The legislation aims to redefine mortgage originators to exclude manufactured-home retailers unless they receive more compensation for a sale with a loan. Supporters argue the current definition is too broad and hinders the manufactured-housing market. Supporters of the bills argue that allowing manufactured-home retailers to provide minimal assistance to consumers without being deemed loan originators would simplify the purchase process. However, opponents believe that expanding the exemption could lead to conflicts of interest and higher costs for consumers. The proposals aim to narrow the definition of high-cost mortgages for manufactured housing, providing additional consumer protections under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). The Dodd-Frank Act expanded these protections in 2013, including special disclosure requirements and restrictions on loan terms for high-cost transactions. Lenders must receive written certification from consumers before originating high-cost mortgages. The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) requires lenders to obtain written certification from consumers before originating high-cost mortgages. These loans come with added legal liability and consumer protections, but lenders may be less willing to originate them due to the associated costs. High-cost mortgages breach thresholds related to annual percentage rate (APR) or points and fees. APR is a measure of loan costs expressed as an annualized rate, including interest and certain fees. The APR calculation includes interest rate and fees like lender compensation. A loan is deemed high-cost if APR exceeds APOR by certain points. Points and fees cover costs like prepayment penalties and lender compensation. The points and fees test determines if a mortgage is high cost based on fees exceeding a certain percentage of the total loan amount. Proposed changes would create a third category for manufactured-housing loans, with a higher threshold for points and fees. This would make it less likely for manufactured-housing loans to be deemed high-cost. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's report shows that manufactured-housing loans are more likely to be HOEPA loans compared to traditional, site-built homes. In 2012, 0.2% of all home-purchase loans exceeded the HOEPA APR threshold, with nearly 17% for manufactured homes. This estimate may not include all high-cost triggers, potentially understating or overstating the true share of HOEPA loans. The CFPB's data show that a larger share of manufactured-housing loans are likely to be affected by high-cost mortgage requirements compared to site-built loans. Manufactured-housing loans are more likely to be high-cost due to their smaller loan amounts. The CFPB's report found that manufactured-housing loans are more likely to have higher APR and points and fees ratios compared to site-built home loans due to their smaller loan amounts. This is because smaller loans are more likely to breach thresholds, leading to higher interest rates and a higher likelihood of violating the APR threshold. Supporters of H.R. 650 argue that the current high-cost thresholds for manufactured-housing loans are poorly targeted, as the fixed costs and higher rates associated with smaller loans make it more likely to exceed the thresholds. They claim that the existing adjustments for small-dollar loans are insufficient, leading to restricted credit availability. Critics of the current threshold argue that some lenders may be less inclined to originate high-cost manufactured-housing loans, impacting borrowers who want to purchase a manufactured home. Opponents believe that the APR and points and fees thresholds are already adjusted for loan size and do not need further modification. The Obama Administration has stated that they would recommend a veto for H.R. 650, as it would weaken consumer protections for economically vulnerable borrowers. The bill would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 and modify the definition of points and fees for certain fees paid to affiliates of the lender. The bill would modify the definition of points and fees for certain fees paid to affiliates of the lender, excluding insurance held in escrow. Section 107 of S. 1484 would require a study on the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on affiliated lenders' ability to provide mortgage credit and other related issues. Points and fees refer to costs paid by the borrower for lender compensation and other mortgage origination expenses, affecting credit availability and consumer protection. The Ability-to-Repay Rule under Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act requires lenders to ensure borrowers can repay loans. Failure to comply could lead to legal consequences for lenders. The ATR rule requires lenders to comply to avoid legal risk. Lenders can comply by originating a QM mortgage, which provides legal protections. Some worry that most mortgages will meet QM standards to minimize legal risk. The QM rule provides legal protections for lenders, with points and fees thresholds determining QM status. Smaller loans have higher thresholds due to fixed costs. This influences loan extension decisions. The QM rule sets points and fees thresholds for loan qualification. Thresholds vary based on loan amount, with higher thresholds for smaller loans. Points are upfront lender compensation, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. Fees are categorized costs associated with originating the mortgage. A loan exceeding the points and fees cap cannot be a QM. H.R. 685 and H.R. 5983 propose changes to exclude certain fees paid to third parties affiliated with the lender from the definition of points and fees. S. 1484 and S. 1910 do not exclude these fees but call for a study on the issue, with a focus on title insurance fees. Title insurance is a significant fee in mortgages affected by proposed changes in H.R. 685 and H.R. 5983. It involves verifying property ownership and checking for liens, providing protection in case of title defects. Currently, fees for independent title insurance may be excluded from points and fees, while fees for affiliated title insurance must be included. The proposed bills would treat fees for affiliated title insurance the same as independent, excluding both from points and fees. The cap on points and fees in mortgages is meant to protect consumers from predatory loans by limiting fees that can be placed on a Qualified Mortgage (QM) and aligning lender and borrower incentives. Lenders can be compensated through upfront points or interest payments over the loan's life, which may affect their incentive to evaluate the borrower's ability to repay. This provision may encourage lenders to underwrite loans more carefully. Supporters of H.R. 685 and H.R. 5983 argue that expanding the definition of points and fees is crucial for ensuring credit availability. They believe that including affiliated loans in the QM category would prevent higher rates and allow for more consumer choice. Equalizing fees for title insurers would also promote competition in the industry. Title insurance is regulated by states with policies in place to determine pricing, reducing concerns about excessive fees. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act allows affiliated business arrangements with consumer protections. Opponents of H.R. 685 and H.R. 5983 argue that excluding affiliated providers from the definition of points and fees could increase loan costs and weaken consumer protections. The Obama Administration would recommend vetoing H.R. 685. Critics argue that excluding affiliated title insurers from the points and fees definition could lead to higher prices for consumers. H.R. 685, H.R. 5983, S. 1484, and S. 1910 aim to exclude insurance held in escrow from the definition of points and fees, clarifying that it should not be included. Supporters believe this clarification is necessary to prevent inflated costs for consumers. The CBO estimates that H.R. 685 would have insignificant effects on direct spending, revenues, or discretionary spending. The Helping Expand Lending Practices in Rural Communities Act (H.R. 1259) establishes a temporary program for individuals to petition the CFPB for rural designation for certain counties. Section 103 of S. 1484 (Section 904 of S. 1910) proposes a petition process similar to H.R. 1259 but without a sunset clause. This could increase credit access in rural areas but may reduce consumer protections. The CFPB designates rural counties for exemptions from certain regulations to help borrowers in these areas access credit easier. The ATR rule provides compliance options for small lenders in rural areas to offer balloon mortgages, with the definition of rural left to the CFPB's discretion. Lenders in non-rural areas may not qualify for this option, potentially impacting consumer protections. The CFPB issued a rule in September 2015 to expand the definition of rural areas to facilitate access to credit. The new definition includes two prongs: an area can be deemed rural based on the Urban Influence Codes or qualify under an alternative method. The CFPB's rule in September 2015 expanded the definition of rural areas for credit access. The rule includes two prongs: one based on Urban Influence Codes and another on Census Bureau data. The CFPB estimates an increase in rural small creditors. However, the analysis did not find specific evidence that the provisions would increase credit access due to data limitations. The CFPB's expanded definition of rural areas for credit access may be challenging to estimate due to existing lender coverage. Critics argue that the use of census blocks is insufficient, as they are only updated every 10 years. Supporters believe the proposals aim to make the government more accessible and responsive to local communities. The Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act of 2015 (H.R. 1529) aims to reduce burdens on small lenders and servicers by making modifications to CFPB mortgage rules. H.R. 1529 would exempt certain lenders and servicers from escrow and servicing requirements, benefiting those with assets of $10 billion or less and those servicing 20,000 mortgages or fewer annually. This bill, along with H.R. 5983, is supported for its potential to ease regulatory compliance for small financial institutions. The Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act of 2015 (H.R. 1529) aims to reduce burdens on small lenders and servicers by exempting them from certain CFPB mortgage rules. This would provide added flexibility to consumers while opponents argue it may roll back consumer protections. Escrow accounts are set up by mortgage lenders to pay property-related expenses like taxes and insurance, with the additional monthly amount placed in the account for annual or semiannual payments. Maintaining escrow accounts is an added cost for banks. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the time for maintaining escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans from one year to five years. Escrow accounts are an additional cost for banks, especially smaller firms. Higher-priced mortgage loans have APRs exceeding the average prime offer rate by a certain percentage points. Jumbo mortgages are considered higher-priced if their APR is 2.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the time for maintaining escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans from one year to five years. The CFPB's escrow rule included exemptions for lenders operating predominantly in rural areas and meeting certain conditions. H.R. 1529 would expand the exemption to also exempt lenders from maintaining an escrow account. H.R. 1529 proposes expanding the escrow exemption for lenders with $10 billion or less in assets who hold mortgages in their portfolio for three or more years. This would benefit an additional 5,087 lenders who collectively originated 91,142 first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in 2011. Supporters argue that this expansion is crucial for reducing regulatory burden. Supporters of H.R. 1529 and H.R. 5983 argue that expanding the escrow exemption for small banks is necessary to reduce regulatory burden. They believe that small banks already have the incentive to ensure borrowers pay taxes and insurance without the escrow account, as the lender carries some risk by holding the mortgage. Opponents, however, argue that the escrow requirement is crucial for consumer protection, especially for higher-priced mortgage loans. Critics argue that the higher interest rates on loans for riskier subprime borrowers reflect their higher default risk. Opponents of H.R. 1529 believe the escrow requirement is essential to prevent these borrowers from facing unexpected costs. The exemption for smaller entities is seen as striking a balance between reducing regulatory burden and protecting consumers. Mortgage servicers have faced increased scrutiny after the housing bubble burst, leading to additional requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act to protect borrowers. The CFPB issued rules to protect borrowers through amendments to TILA and RESPA, including disclosure requirements, payment crediting rules, error resolution obligations, foreclosure guidelines, and borrower contact continuity. Small servicers with 5,000 mortgages or fewer are exempt from some TILA and RESPA requirements. H.R. 1529 and H.R. 5983 seek to adjust RESPA servicing provisions for servicers with 20,000 mortgages or fewer to reduce regulatory burdens. The RESPA servicing provisions affected by H.R. 1529 aim to reduce regulatory burdens for servicers with 20,000 mortgages or fewer. This includes administration of escrow accounts, disclosure about loan servicing transfers, borrower notifications of loan transfers, fee prohibitions, and consumer protections. The CFPB notes that servicers with few loans have incentives to service well, as they choose not to profit from volume. The CFPB found that an exemption may be appropriate for servicers with a small number of loans, set at 5,000 loans, to encourage high levels of customer contact and information. The Bureau estimates that over 98% of insured depositories and credit unions with under $2 billion in assets fall beneath this threshold. The CFPB found that setting the threshold at 5,000 loans may be appropriate for an exemption to encourage customer contact. Over 98% of insured depositories and credit unions with under $2 billion in assets fall beneath this threshold. In contrast, institutions with over $2 billion and $10 billion in assets have lower percentages falling beneath the threshold. The Bureau estimates about 60 million closed-end mortgage loans overall, with 5.7 million serviced by institutions qualifying for the exemption. If the threshold were set at 10,000 loans, over 99.5% of smaller institutions would fall beneath it. Supporters of H.R. 1529 and H.R. 5983 argue that raising the threshold from 5,000 loans to 20,000 loans would better differentiate small servicers from large servicers, giving the CFPB discretion to provide exemptions or adjustments to balance consumer protections. This would provide relief to near-small institutions similar to small institutions, determined by the CFPB. Opponents of H.R. 1529 and H.R. 5983 argue that expanding exemptions for small lenders could weaken consumer protections. They are concerned that by raising the threshold and removing ownership requirements for mortgage servicers, there would be less accountability in case of default and foreclosure. Critics believe that mortgage servicers, who performed poorly during the foreclosure crisis, should not receive additional exemptions from CFPB regulations. CBO estimates that H.R. 1529 would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 for CFPB expenses. The Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act (H.R. 1210) would establish a new qualified mortgage category for mortgages held in a lender's portfolio. Similar language is found in Section 1116 of H.R. 5983. S. 1484/S. 1910 would also establish a portfolio QM category with stricter criteria than H.R. 1210 and H.R. 5983. These proposals aim to increase credit availability and reduce regulatory burden on lenders, but critics argue they may weaken consumer protections. The proposals aim to establish a new qualified mortgage category for mortgages held in a lender's portfolio, potentially reducing consumer protections and allowing legal protections for risky mortgage products under the Ability-to-Repay Rule. Lenders must verify the borrower's ability to repay based on documented information, with non-compliance leading to legal liability. The Ability-to-Repay Rule (ATR) allows lenders to originate mortgages under the General ATR Option or the more stringent Qualified Mortgage (QM) option. QM mortgages must meet specific underwriting and product feature requirements to ensure minimum standards are met. Different categories of QM exist for different lenders, each with its own set of requirements such as restrictions on fees and loan terms. Receiving QM status ensures minimum standards for borrower protection, while the General ATR Option allows for more flexibility with balloon payments and longer terms if the lender verifies the borrower's ability to repay. Originating a QM mortgage provides legal protections and compliance with the ATR rule, reducing legal liability. However, choosing the General ATR Option means foregoing these protections. The definition of a QM is crucial for lenders looking to minimize legal risks. In the short term, few mortgages may not meet QM standards due to legal protections, but there are other compliance options. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM option allows for QM status if specific criteria are met, including holding the loan for three years, being a small lender, and meeting underwriting requirements. This option is less prescriptive than the Standard QM. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM has less prescriptive underwriting requirements compared to the Standard QM. While the Standard QM requires a DTI ratio below 43%, the Small Creditor Portfolio QM does not have a specific threshold. The CFPB relaxed underwriting standards for portfolio loans by small creditors, believing they are likely to be made responsibly and affordable for consumers. By keeping the loan in portfolio, small creditors have added incentive to assess the borrower's ability to repay. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM aims to align consumers' and creditors' interests in loan repayment by keeping the mortgage in portfolio. This encourages small creditors to scrutinize borrowers' ability to repay. Some in Congress suggest a broader portfolio QM option with relaxed criteria to increase credit availability. Supporters argue that extending QM status to portfolio loans, regardless of lender size, will incentivize proper underwriting and expand credit access for homebuyers. Critics question whether holding a mortgage in portfolio alone justifies granting QM status. The CFPB limited the Small Creditor Portfolio QM to small lenders due to their \"relationship-based\" business model, which allows for better borrower evaluation. Small lenders' ties to communities provide added incentive for thorough underwriting. Debate surrounds the level at which a lender loses community influence. The CBO estimates that H.R. 1210 could affect direct spending insignificantly, with no impact on revenues. The bill's relaxed QM definition may lead to higher losses for financial institutions, increasing the risk of failure. However, CBO states that the probability of additional costs to the government is small. The Homebuyers Assistance Act (H.R. 3192) passed by the House would delay TILA and RESPA integrated disclosure requirements until February 1, 2016, and prevent lawsuits against lenders during that period if made in good faith. The CFPB issued the TILA-RESPA Final Rule requiring mortgage lenders to use more easily understood integrated disclosure forms. Section 117 of S. 1484/S. 1910 provides a safe harbor for lenders who make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements, protecting them from civil, criminal, or administrative actions or penalties. The safe harbor remains until the CFPB director certifies the new disclosures' accuracy and compliance with all State laws. Additionally, the bill eliminates the three-day mortgage closing delay if a lower APR is offered to the borrower. The TILA-RESPA Final Rule requires mortgage lenders to use simplified disclosure forms to help consumers compare mortgage terms. Dodd-Frank Act mandated the CFPB to develop integrated disclosures to reduce regulatory costs and consumer confusion. The TILA-RESPA Final Rule mandates the use of simplified disclosure forms for mortgage lenders to aid consumers in comparing mortgage terms. This rule, a result of extensive study and testing, combines TILA and RESPA disclosures into a single form. The industry has until August 1, 2015, to comply with the new regulations, which will have a significant impact on consumers, lenders, and the mortgage market. The TILA-RESPA Final Rule requires mortgage lenders to use simplified disclosure forms by August 1, 2015. Despite concerns from mortgage bankers about meeting the deadline, the CFPB initially denied requests for an extension. However, due to an administrative error, the effective date was extended to October 3, 2015, to comply with the Congressional Review Act. The CFPB has extended the effective date of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule from August 1 to October 3, 2015. They have also announced a restrained enforcement period and will evaluate institutions' compliance efforts during initial examinations. Examiners will expect supervised entities to make good faith efforts to comply with the rule's requirements. Supporters of H.R. 3192 and S. 1484 / S. 1910 argue that lenders need more time to comply with the TILA-RESPA Final Rule. They suggest a grace period for testing out new systems to avoid potential lawsuits from borrowers. Supporters of delaying the implementation of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule argue that it would protect lenders from private litigation risks and potential conflicts with state law. Critics, however, believe that the actions already taken by the CFPB are sufficient to protect lenders and that the extended timeframe allows for the necessary system adoption. Critics argue that delaying the TRID disclosures is unnecessary as private litigation risks are overstated, and homeowners would have no remedy for false disclosures. CBO estimated minimal impact on spending for H.R. 3192. The Eliminate Privacy Notice Confusion Act (H.R. 601) was passed by the House and included in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. It reduces scenarios where financial firms must send privacy notices, allowing firms to skip annual notices if policies haven't changed. Regulatory relief bill amending privacy notice requirements. The Eliminate Privacy Notice Confusion Act (H.R. 601) amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to reduce the burden on financial firms by allowing them to skip annual privacy notices if policies remain unchanged. Financial firms argue that the current privacy notice requirement is burdensome and of little value to customers, while defenders of the law argue it provides consumer protection and safeguards privacy. The CFPB issued a rule in 2014 to modify Regulation P in an effort to reduce the burden on financial firms. The 2014 CFPB rule modified Regulation P to allow firms to post privacy notices online instead of mailing hard copies, reducing compliance burden. Firms must still send printed notices for policy changes or sharing information with third parties. H.R. 601 would increase direct spending insignificantly and repeal the Durbin Amendment. The Durbin Amendment, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, caps interchange fees for debit card transactions over $10 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve regulates interchange fees to ensure they are reasonable and proportional to issuer costs, including authorization and settlement expenses. The Durbin Amendment allows for adjustments to interchange fees based on costs incurred by debit card issuers. The Durbin Amendment regulates interchange fees for debit card transactions, allowing adjustments for issuer costs to prevent fraud. Smaller financial institutions are exempt from the regulation, potentially receiving higher interchange fees. The Federal Reserve implemented a cap on interchange fees for large issuers, effective from October 1, 2011. The Durbin Amendment regulates interchange fees for debit card transactions, with supporters arguing it benefits businesses and consumers by capping fees for large issuers. Critics claim it is government price fixing that hinders industry innovation and may lead to increased costs for consumers. Regulators have the power to examine and instruct banks to modify their behavior, impose reporting requirements, and enforce compliance with rules. They can confirm if banks meet set targets and thresholds, or interpret if actions satisfy regulations. Enforcement includes legal actions like fines for non-compliance. Some believe regulators are overly restrictive, while others see their actions as necessary for well-managed institutions. On-site examinations are part of the supervisory process stemming from regulators' visitorial powers. Regulators have the power to examine banks, inspect their books, regulate activities, and enforce compliance with laws. Proposed legislation would raise size thresholds for banks subject to an 18-month exam cycle, based on their exam ratings. For banks with good ratings, regulators could raise the threshold from $100 million to $1 billion in assets. H.R. 1553, passed by the House on October 6, 2015, raised size thresholds for banks subject to an 18-month exam cycle. The provision increased thresholds from $500 million to $1 billion for banks with outstanding exam ratings and from $100 million to $200 million for banks with good ratings. Regulators have discretion to raise the threshold up to $1 billion if consistent with safety and soundness. CBO estimates the bill's budgetary effects as insignificant. Regulators changed the frequency of bank examinations in 2007 from once every 12 months to once every 18 months for banks with less than $500 million in total assets and high supervisory ratings. Large and complex banks have full-time on-site examiners. The Fed introduced a new examination program in 2014 to reduce regulatory burden, linking examination intensity to individual bank risk profiles. H.R. 1553 would reduce exam frequency for 500 to 600 institutions. The new program aims to reduce regulatory burden by having examiners focus less on low-risk compliance issues at community banks. Governor Tarullo mentioned increasing off-site supervisory activities to alleviate the burden on community banks. The OCC proposed raising the threshold for the 18-month exam cycle to banks with $750 million in assets. Inspectors general conducted studies on the regulatory burden on small banks from compliance with supervisory exams. The length of OCC and FDIC community bank exams varied based on bank size and supervisory rating from 2007 to 2011. Exams for banks with poor ratings became shorter over time, while those with good ratings took longer. FDIC spent 24 to 57 days on-site for risk management exams in 2011, while Fed exams averaged 63 to 79 days between 2007 and 2011. The FDIC inspector general's study from 2007 to 2011 showed that compliance costs for bank exams varied based on bank size, with larger banks requiring more hours for exams. H.R. 1941 was ordered to be reported by the House Financial Services Committee on July 29, 2015. The bill H.R. 1941, reported by the House Financial Services Committee on July 29, 2015, aims to improve the bank examination process by setting deadlines for exam reports, establishing detailed standards for commercial loans, harmonizing non-accrual loan standards, and creating an ombudsman office to investigate complaints from banks about supervisory exams. The bill H.R. 1941 aims to improve the bank examination process by establishing an ombudsman office within FFIEC to investigate complaints from banks about supervisory exams. It would give banks the right to appeal exam results to the ombudsman or an administrative law judge, and add the CFPB to the appeals process. CBO estimates that H.R. 1941 would increase budget deficits by $232 million between 2016 and 2026. The bill H.R. 1941 aims to improve the bank examination process by adding the CFPB to the appeals process and establishing an ombudsman office within FFIEC to investigate complaints from banks about supervisory exams. The ombudsman would serve as a facilitator and mediator for the timely resolution of complaints, and the bill would prohibit specific actions by supervisors in retaliation for appealing exam results. The bill H.R. 1491 proposes adding the CFPB to the appeals process and establishing an ombudsman office within FFIEC to investigate complaints from banks about supervisory exams. The ombudsman would serve as a facilitator for resolving complaints independently. Critics question the need for an additional ombudsman, while supporters argue for more independence in the appeals process. Critics of H.R. 1941 argue that shifting the appeals process to a new ombudsman could increase the risk of supervisory decisions being overturned, as the ombudsman may lack insider knowledge of the process. Proponents believe the current process, where the supervisor acts as prosecutor, judge, and jury, is flawed and rarely results in reversals. There are concerns about examiner retribution for appealing decisions. The frequency of appeals might indicate bank displeasure with the examination process, with concerns about examiner retribution for appealing decisions. The appeals process may lead examiners to be more cautious in adhering to guidelines or less willing to make adverse decisions to avoid the hassle of appeals. The fairness of exams and appeals is difficult to evaluate due to confidential supervisory information, leading to disputes between banks and regulators. Regulatory burden studies found that banks formally appealed 22 OCC exam results and informally appealed 24 more, along with 23 FDIC exams. The banking regulators require banks to submit quarterly Reports of Condition and Income, known as call reports. Legislation mandates the development of shorter call reports for highly rated and well-capitalized institutions. Banks only appealed a small number of exam results between 2007 and 2011, with many disputes resolved informally before exams are completed. Bank supervision is an ongoing process that includes monitoring data collected from banks through call reports. These reports are standardized for comparison across institutions and are reviewed every five years to eliminate unnecessary information. The next review is due by October 13, 2016. The FFIEC is accelerating the review of call reports, aiming for changes in December 2015 or March 2016. A proposed rule in September 2015 suggests deleting items from current reports, exempting banks with under $1 billion in assets from four items, and evaluating the usefulness and regulatory burden of each item. Regulators are considering creating a streamlined version of the quarterly Call Report for community institutions. The call report process was required to be modernized in 1994 and 2000, with a focus on eliminating unnecessary items for safety and soundness. The FDIC argues that call reports are crucial for monitoring risk in institutions, while proponents of legislation believe they are overly complex for community banks. The call report is tiered based on size and complexity, with smaller banks having fewer required data items. The regulatory burden associated with call reports has increased over time, with the number of required items growing from 309 in 1980 to 1,955 in 2012. Even small community banks only report data on a fraction of the items, showing the complexity and burden of the process. The survey found that the number of hours and costs for call report preparation have increased over the last ten years. Costs were higher for banks with more than $500 million in assets compared to smaller banks. The survey did not include evidence for call report compliance costs for the largest banks. Regulators argue that call reports are already tailored to reduce burden on small banks. S. 1484 leaves it to regulators to shorten the call report, which is currently under review to eliminate unnecessary items. The bill would increase the threshold for CFPB supervision from $10 billion to $50 billion in total assets, indexed to GDP. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred certain consumer compliance powers over banks and credit unions to the CFPB, based on their asset size. Institutions with more than $10 billion in assets are primarily regulated by the CFPB for consumer compliance. The CFPB, with over $10 billion in assets, is the main regulator for consumer compliance, while safety and soundness regulation is handled by prudential regulators. The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement powers over larger institutions, issuing rules, conducting examinations, and imposing fines for non-compliance. Smaller institutions, with assets of $10 billion or less, are subject to rulemaking by both the CFPB and prudential regulators for consumer protection. The CFPB has limited supervisory authority over smaller institutions, participating in examinations on a sampling basis. It does not have enforcement powers over small entities but can refer potential enforcement actions to prudential regulators. Increasing the threshold to $50 billion would remove about 80 institutions from CFPB supervision. Supporters of raising the CFPB threshold argue that larger institutions hold the majority of industry assets and face burdensome examinations. They believe that by raising the threshold, these institutions would still be examined by their primary regulators for consumer compliance without the additional CFPB exam. Critics of the proposal have noted concerns. Critics oppose raising the CFPB threshold for consumer compliance examinations, arguing that some banks in the affected asset range were major violators of consumer protections during the housing bubble. They fear that raising the threshold could result in less-intensive supervision for these entities. Operation Choke Point (OCP) is a DOJ initiative targeting Internet fraudsters working with third-party payment processors, subject to legislative scrutiny. Operation Choke Point is the focus of legislative bills to prohibit banking regulators from pressuring banks to close customer accounts without a valid reason. This includes threats to national security as a material reason for account closure. The bill aims to address Operation Choke Point (OCP) by requiring depository institutions to justify account terminations related to national security threats, terrorism financing, or business with sanctioned countries. Regulators must report annually to Congress on terminated accounts. Other legislative proposals, such as H.R. 2578 and S.Con.Res. 11, also target OCP by prohibiting funds for it and creating a deficit-neutral reserve fund to end it. The DOJ's Operation Choke Point aimed to combat fraud by restricting fraudsters' access to the banking system. It held banks and payment processors accountable for processing fraudulent transactions, which could lead to unauthorized debits from consumers' accounts. The DOJ's Operation Choke Point aimed to combat fraud by restricting fraudsters' access to the banking system. It held banks and payment processors accountable for processing fraudulent transactions, resulting in civil monetary penalties for financial institutions. The policy discussion revolved around the labeling of certain businesses as high-risk, including credit repair companies, online gambling operations, and pharmaceutical sales, posing reputational risks to banks. The DOJ's Operation Choke Point aimed to combat fraud by restricting fraudsters' access to the banking system, holding banks accountable for processing fraudulent transactions. Federal banking regulators supported these efforts, recommending heightened scrutiny of certain accounts. Critics argue that OCP primarily targeted the payday lending industry and pressured banks to shut down accounts without proof of wrongdoing. DOJ has penalized banks for not complying, based on a staff report and congressional letter. The DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility reviewed Operation Choke Point and found that Department of Justice attorneys did not improperly target lawful participants in the Internet payday lending industry. The focus was on a small number of lenders suspected of fraudulent practices, with some evidence of negative views towards payday lending. No evidence of improper pressure on lawful businesses was found. The review of Operation Choke Point found no evidence of improper pressure on lawful businesses. The FDIC's involvement was deemed inconsequential, and new guidance was issued to address concerns raised by Congress and the financial services industry. The Office of the Ombudsman provides a toll-free number for institutions to address concerns about OCP. CBO's cost estimates for H.R. 766 show no impact on the federal budget. Banks must adhere to regulations when raising capital from investors, which can affect costs for institutions and customers. Regulatory requirements aim to protect investors from fraud. Five bills in Congress aim to raise the exemption threshold on the SEC's registration for thrift holding companies to match that of bank holding companies. This proposal is part of various acts, including H.R. 1334, H.R. 37, and S. 1484. These changes were enacted in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. Regulatory requirements serve as safeguards to protect investors from fraud when banks raise capital. The JOBS Act raised the SEC shareholder registration threshold for banks and BHCs from 500 to 2,000 shareholders and increased the upper limit for deregistration from 300 to 1,200 shareholders. This made it easier for banks to have more shareholders while remaining unregistered private banks. The JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012, raised the SEC shareholder registration threshold for banks and BHCs to 2,000 shareholders and increased the upper limit for deregistration to 1,200 shareholders. This provision did not apply to savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs). The Holding Company Registration Threshold Equalization provisions extended the higher registration and deregistration shareholder thresholds in the JOBS Act to SLHCs, requiring an SLHC to register with the SEC if its assets exceed $10 million and it has 2,000 shareholders of record. The SEC registration threshold for SLHCs has been raised to 2,000 shareholders of record with assets exceeding $10 million. Deregistration would require no more than 1,200 shareholders of record. The central benefit of SEC registration is to enhance investor protection by providing access to financial and nonfinancial data, but it also comes with regulatory burdens that may increase the cost of capital for firms. Policymakers aim to balance the costs and benefits of SEC registration by exempting smaller firms. The JOBS Act raised the threshold for banks, allowing some to deregister from the SEC and raise capital without registration. A study found that the act was generally financially beneficial to banks, resulting in higher net income and lower expenses for every $1.00 of bank assets. The study found that the JOBS Act led to lower pretax expenses for banks and increased assets per bank employee. It raises questions about the exemption threshold for SEC registration for thrift holding companies and the balance of costs and benefits for small banks compared to thrifts. Section 113 of S. 1484 addresses how dividends are allocated among shareholders of mutual holding companies. The text discusses the issue of how dividends are allocated among shareholders of mutual holding companies. It would authorize all MHCs to waive the receipt of dividends declared on common stock without having to comply with Federal Reserve regulations. Mutual Holding Companies (MHCs) were established under the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987, allowing for the formation of savings and loan holding companies in mutual form. A mutual savings bank can reorganize into a mutual holding company (MHC) by transferring assets to a newly formed stock institution. The majority shares are owned by the MHC, with minority shares sold to equity investors. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred authority over savings and loan holding companies to the Federal Reserve. MHCs have the right to waive receipt of dividends declared by a subsidiary, which are distributions of earnings to shareholders. The Federal Reserve's Regulation MM allows mutual holding companies (MHCs) to waive the right to receive dividends declared by a subsidiary under certain conditions, such as no insider holding shares in the class of stock or providing written notice to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve's Regulation MM allows mutual holding companies (MHCs) to waive dividends with approval from the Federal Reserve Board. The waiver notice must include documentation showing consistency with fiduciary duties. Certain \"grandfathered MHCs\" have a streamlined approval process for dividend waivers if deemed consistent with fiduciary duties. The Federal Reserve's Regulation MM allows mutual holding companies (MHCs) to waive dividends with approval from the Federal Reserve Board. For MHCs that do not meet grandfathering criteria, conditions for a waiver of dividends include a member vote, safe operation of the mutual savings bank, and ability to meet loan obligations. Retaining dividends allows MHCs to support their subsidiary banks by transferring excess capital. The Federal Reserve's Regulation MM allows mutual holding companies (MHCs) to waive dividends with approval from the Federal Reserve Board. If there is no requirement for a mandatory vote of MHC shareholders, the waiver would rest exclusively with the MHC's board, who may have a financial interest in the waiver as minority shareholders in the bank. In issuing the regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank dividend waiver provisions, the Federal Reserve also noted that dividend waiver by the MHC without corresponding waiver by the minority shareholders poses an \"inherent conflict of interest\" because it might result in unequal distribution of equity between mutual owners of the MHC and minority shareholders. Supporters of S. 1484 cite similar reasons as those that opposed the implementation of Regulation MM's dividend waiver requirements in 2011. Supporters of S. 1484 argue that the Federal Reserve's potential blocking of waivers under Regulation MM could harm mutual holding companies (MHCs) and hinder capital formation. They believe that waiving dividends for majority shareholders while retaining them for minority shareholders is necessary to ensure a fair market rate of return. Additionally, they point out that when MHCs receive dividends from subsidiaries, they must pay taxes on them, reducing overall franchise value. The supporters also argue against the distinction between grandfathered MHCs and other MHCs, stating that it creates different classes of MHCs. The cost of obtaining the vote of members could be prohibitive, leading to unnecessary administrative and financial costs. Banking regulators have allowed waivers of dividends by mutual holding companies (MHCs) in similar circumstances, with specific accounting procedures to allocate the value of those dividends. Certain provisions of S. 1484 / S. 1910 are indexed based on GDP growth. Indexing provisions in S. 1484 / S. 1910, as calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, adjust exemptions over time based on inflation rates. Section 110 of the bill indexes exemptions for banks, while Section 108 indexes thresholds for manufactured housing. These adjustments aim to account for nominal and real price increases. The bills propose indexing thresholds for exemptions from points and fees for manufactured housing based on inflation, rather than GDP. There is a debate on whether to use nominal or real GDP growth rates, with implications for the financial system's total assets. Using GDP growth instead of inflation for indexing could result in fewer firms being exempt from the thresholds over time. The report covers provisions in various financial regulatory acts, including the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act, the Financial CHOICE Act, and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. It lists the corresponding sections in each act and related House and Senate bills. Table D-1 lists provisions of Division G covered in the report, along with corresponding sections in S. 1484 and related House bills."
