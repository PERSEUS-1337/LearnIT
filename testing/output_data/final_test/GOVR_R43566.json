They design, develop, and build weapon systems, provide services like intelligence analysis and logistics. DOD and Congress aim to improve cost, schedule, and performance of acquisitions through reforms. This report highlights issues for Congress to consider in acquisition reform efforts. The Department of Defense relies on contractors for military support and acquisitions. Congress aims to improve cost, schedule, and performance through reform efforts. Various reports reflect on past defense acquisition reform efforts, including the Fitzhugh and Packard Reports, the Perry Report, and the Nunn-McCurdy Act. In FY2013, DOD obligated $310 billion on federal contracts\u2014more than half of total DOD direct obligations. Contract obligations increased from $175 billion to $308 billion from FY1999 to FY2013. Acquisition of services represented 52% of total DOD contract obligations in FY2013. Efforts to reform defense acquisitions have focused on services, with over half of contract obligations dedicated to services in the last two decades. Despite past reform efforts mainly targeting goods, wasteful spending, cost overruns, and performance shortfalls have led to numerous studies and reform initiatives since World War II. Major weapon system programs in the early 1980s experienced significant cost overruns, prompting ongoing efforts to improve the acquisition process. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan established the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management to address dramatic cost overruns in defense acquisitions. The Commission, chaired by David Packard, issued the Packard Commission Report with recommendations for reforms. Secretary of Defense William Perry also released a blueprint for reform efforts in 1994. Congress has legislated changes through the National Defense Authorization Acts and stand-alone legislation like the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act. The Defense Department has undergone significant procurement reforms through legislation like the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act of 1990, Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. These efforts have led to the creation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the establishment of the Defense Acquisition University, a streamlined management chain, a milestone decision process, and the requirement for independent cost estimates. Since the 1970s, acquisition programs have faced cost increases despite various reforms. Development contracts have seen a median of 32% cost growth since 1993, with 31% of Major Defense Acquisition Programs experiencing at least 15% cost growth since 1997. Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) have experienced significant cost growth, with the Army terminating 22 programs between 1990-2010. The procurement costs for the aircraft carrier CVN-78 have increased by over 20% since FY2008, leading the Navy to allocate an additional $1.3 billion for FY2014 and FY2015. Some analysts argue that acquisition reform may not address the fundamental issues in DOD acquisitions, as past efforts have been deemed ineffective. Many past reform efforts in defense acquisitions have been recycled and criticized for making the process less efficient. Analysts argue that additional staff and processes have been counterproductive. Some reforms have had modest success, but overall, the system remains flawed. Some analysts believe past reform efforts in defense acquisitions have had modest success, such as the consolidation of acquisition rules into the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Recent legislation like the Weapon Systems Reform Act of 2009 has also been seen as contributing to improvements in defense acquisitions. Learning from past reform efforts is considered crucial for successful acquisition reform. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act focused on improving early stages of weapon system development by appointing key directors, assessing technological maturity of programs, and giving combatant commanders more influence in requirements generation. The full impact of the act may not be fully realized until the next generation. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act is believed to have a positive effect by empowering key offices within the department to impact weapon system acquisitions. These offices now have access to senior leaders, opportunities to provide input, and resources to carry out their responsibilities. The act's focus on using data to inform decisions complements current DOD initiatives to improve acquisitions. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act reinforces current DOD initiatives to improve acquisitions, but concerns have been raised about funding and manpower for the offices created. Congressional efforts have significantly improved DOD's use of operational contract support, leading to the recognition of the importance of contractors within DOD. The development of a body of work informed DOD and Congress on the importance of contractors. Congressional actions, such as legislation establishing key offices and oversight hearings, have improved operational contract support. The defense acquisition system was organized during the Cold War, but recent changes have led to concerns about its effectiveness. The defense acquisition system has faced significant changes, with analysts noting that it is not adapting well to the evolving industrial landscape. Over the past 25 years, the defense industrial base has consolidated, reducing the number of major defense contractors. This consolidation, influenced by decreased defense procurement post-Cold War, has both benefits and drawbacks for competition and innovation. Additionally, DOD's influence as a buyer is decreasing, with fewer U.S. industries reliant on defense spending. By 2012, government purchases accounted for less than 2% of the semiconductor market, down from over 75% in 1965. As defense spending decreases, companies are diversifying revenue sources. Defense companies received 28% of revenue from contracts in 2012, down from 38% in 2007. Some companies avoid defense contracts due to regulations, costs, and funding instability. Analysts suggest the acquisition system struggles with rapidly changing technologies in weapon systems. The increasing complexity of systems in programs relying on rapidly changing technologies poses challenges to acquisitions. U.S. military spending constraints and declining budgets limit funding for acquisitions, leading to reductions in force structure. As U.S. military spending decreases, other countries are investing more in their militaries, affecting defense production economies of scale and specialized capabilities acquisitions. Other countries are increasing military investments as U.S. military spending declines. In FY2012, DOD spent more on contracts ($360 billion) than the combined total defense budgets of the top five non-U.S. countries ($335 billion). Analysts suggest that the U.S. may not continue to dominate defense spending, pointing to countries like Russia and China. China has been steadily increasing military spending for two decades, with an average annual increase of 9.7% from 2003 to 2012. DOD's focus on research and development is decreasing, with a smaller share of contracting dollars allocated to R&D contracts. In FY1998, 18% of DOD contract obligations were for R&D contracts, compared to 10% in FY2013. The military funds leading-edge technologies, but commercial demand surpasses military requirements. Technologies are often adapted from the commercial market for military use. Analysts believe the acquisition system needs fundamental reforms to adapt to a changing landscape. In 2009, Norman Augustine, Gary Hart, and Warren Rudman highlighted the slow and costly defense acquisition system, calling for necessary reforms to ensure American war fighters have the means for national security. Budgetary restraints historically drive acquisition reform, as seen in the 1980s with the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act in the 1980s and subsequent Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 led to significant changes in defense acquisitions. With the current Budget Control Act of 2011 causing declines in defense spending, analysts believe there is potential for further reform in defense acquisitions. A culture shift is happening in the department towards better defense acquisitions, with increased focus on fiscal discipline and commitment from senior leadership, uniform personnel, and civilian personnel. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have emphasized the importance of acquisitions, leading to internal efforts to improve oversight and performance. The importance of acquisitions to senior leaders has led to internal efforts to examine contractor support, such as the Gansler report. Constrained budgets are fostering a culture of better decision making, with a focus on prioritizing programs and controlling costs. Advances in information technology are improving data tracking and analysis within the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is enhancing its information technology and business systems to gather and analyze data for policy decisions. Efforts like the Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 require root-cause analysis of Major Defense Acquisition Programs with cost growth exceeding thresholds. Despite progress, there are gaps in data reliability. Analysts see a unique opportunity due to constrained budgets, changing landscapes, and increased data availability. The Department of Defense has made efforts to improve defense acquisitions by implementing steps to rein in cost and schedule growth in weapon system acquisitions. This includes cancelling programs that exceed budget, do not meet military needs, or lack mature technology. Programs like the VH-71 presidential helicopter and ground components of the Future Combat System have been cancelled due to cost growth and technology maturity issues. Secretary Gates cancelled several programs like the Future Combat System and missile defense's Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV), as well as the F-22 and Air Force Combat Search and Rescue X (CSAR-X). He also acknowledged the need to improve the use of contractors during military operations, highlighting the lack of supervision and coherent strategy in their deployment. The Department of Defense has since taken steps to enhance the utilization of contractors, including establishing a Functional Capabilities Integration Board. The Functional Capabilities Integration Board, co-chaired by senior leaders, addresses operational contract support issues. DOD has expanded regulations, policies, and training related to operational contract support, including directives in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. DOD has updated its joint planning policy to include operational contract support in various functional areas. This includes developing standards for private security contractors and conducting joint exercises. Efforts are focused on rewriting rules for a more efficient acquisition process, improving workforce professionalism, and enhancing overall system performance. The Better Buying Power initiative was launched to improve efficiency in defense spending by making affordability a requirement, increasing competition, and reducing acquisition time. Better Buying Power 2.0, launched in 2012, aimed to enhance productivity in the Department of Defense and the industrial base supporting warfighters through 34 initiatives. Better Buying Power 3.0 is in development with 34 initiatives to improve defense acquisitions, including reducing senior-level reviews and enhancing market research. DOD has also revamped regulatory structures governing acquisitions with updated instructions and directives issued in 2012 and 2013. Secretary Kendall announced the establishment of a team to develop a legislative proposal simplifying existing laws for defense acquisitions. The new DOD Instruction 5000.02 emphasizes tailoring acquisition programs to product characteristics and circumstances, outlining four models for acquisitions. The text outlines different models for acquisitions based on the type of program pursued, emphasizing the importance of good decision-making in acquisition processes. This theme is reiterated in various documents and speeches, including the Better Buying Power (BBP) initiative, which encourages the acquisition workforce to think critically and not default to traditional solutions. The joint statement by Under Secretaries of Defense Robert Hale and Kendall highlights the risks of funding threats leading to poor business decisions. There is a shift towards data-driven decision-making in defense acquisitions, as seen in Secretary Kendall's emphasis on data and the release of the first annual report on the Performance of the Defense Acquisitions System. The annual report on defense acquisitions is a comprehensive data-driven analysis by DOD. Despite efforts to improve, the acquisition system's fundamental incentives remain unchanged, leading to prioritizing spending based on arbitrary deadlines rather than sound business decisions. Reforms will have limited impact until incentives align better. Reform efforts in defense acquisitions are hindered by incentives that do not align with desired outcomes. Analysts argue that constrained budgets are key to fostering better decision-making, leading to prioritization of programs and increased focus on costs. Collaboration between DOD, Congress, and industry is necessary for substantial reform. Efforts to streamline defense acquisitions require collaboration between DOD, Congress, and industry. Congressional action has been crucial in past reforms, and DOD needs help from Congress for more extensive changes. Congress plays a crucial role in setting expectations and driving change in defense acquisitions. The key to improving acquisitions lies in having a good workforce with the necessary resources, incentives, and authority. This was highlighted in various reports dating back to 1992, emphasizing the importance of collective action between acquisition participants, including Congress and the Department of Defense. The key to improving defense acquisitions lies in reducing management layers, staff, and regulations by adhering to basic principles. Analysts argue that acquisition reforms have had limited results due to poor workforce management and unchanged incentives. Recommendations also target budgeting, requirements development, and cost estimation for improvement. Analysts emphasize the importance of a culture that promotes good acquisition decisions, extending beyond the acquisition workforce to include those involved in requirements and budgets. Incentives for change must be present at all levels, from top leaders to field commanders and managers, to achieve efficiencies and substantial savings. The FY2008 NDAA mandated the establishment of the Department of Defense Acquisition Workforce Fund to improve the size and quality of the acquisition workforce. $2.3 billion was obligated from FY2008 through FY2012 to hire 8,300 people in various fields. Additional support and focus are needed to further enhance the acquisition workforce. Effective acquisition reform depends on the right incentive structure in place, as argued by analysts. Incentives in the acquisition process can lead to poor decisions, such as obligating funds before the fiscal year ends and underestimating program acquisition costs. Incentives to underestimate program acquisition costs have been a longstanding issue in the defense acquisition process. Contractors and program representatives use low cost estimates to win contracts and argue for system approval, respectively. This practice has been criticized by high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense, who have noted that optimistic estimates hinder realistic decision-making by Congress and impede the development of well-conceived acquisition plans. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review highlighted the need for budget stability in the Pentagon's acquisition plan. Authority and accountability are crucial for an effective workforce, but the management structure is criticized as bureaucratic, with unclear lines of authority. This lack of practical authority hinders program management effectiveness. The Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel identified fragmentation of authority and accountability as the main reason for underperformance in acquisition activities. Congress could consider workforce management as an area for reform, focusing on rules and regulations that hinder DOD's ability to hire and retain capable personnel and promote accountability. Key personnel should be given appropriate authority and resources to effectively manage programs. Efforts to reform defense acquisitions include streamlining laws and regulations, focusing on contract logistics, and addressing unintended cost burdens to industry. Repealing or amending regulations that no longer provide substantial benefits could generate cost savings and operational benefits. Efforts to reform defense acquisitions by repealing or amending regulations that no longer provide substantial benefits could simplify the acquisition process, remove unnecessary burdens on industry, and encourage more companies to compete for government contracts. Congress could amend statutes and regulations to alleviate regulatory or financial burdens while preserving the intent of the regulation. Efforts to streamline defense acquisitions have been spearheaded by Congress in the past. For instance, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 was a result of a review initiated by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition. Cost savings in logistics have been identified as a priority, with reports highlighting instances of wasteful spending by contractors like Boeing and Sikorsky. The Army was overcharged by Sikorsky and Boeing for parts on support contracts, totaling $12 million and $13.7 million respectively. Additionally, military forces in Afghanistan couldn't account for $230 million worth of spare parts and ordered $138 million more without proper oversight. This highlights the need for increased congressional oversight in logistics and supply chain management. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 was enacted to simplify the complex and unwieldy defense acquisitions process, which was governed by numerous regulations. Despite efforts to overhaul the process, contracting with the federal government remains highly regulated. The acquisition system is complex due to past reform efforts, technology advancements, and public policy goals. Regulations include buying from domestic suppliers, supporting campaign objectives, combating trafficking, promoting small businesses, and adhering to International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Conflicts may arise in compliance with rules such as combatting trafficking in persons and maintaining a drug-free workplace. Some analysts debate the value of regulations requiring defense items to be manufactured domestically, arguing they unnecessarily increase costs and could be implemented more efficiently. The complexity of regulations can make it difficult for companies to enter government contracting. Many believe defense acquisition rules need to be streamlined to reduce burden on private industry and control cost increases. Some analysts argue that the complexity of defense acquisition rules discourages companies from seeking government contracts. Changes to the acquisition system can increase costs and make it harder to assess their impact. Legislative changes, primarily through the National Defense Authorization Act, drive reforms in defense acquisitions. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been a key driver of defense acquisitions, with Title VIII focusing on Acquisition Policy, Acquisition Management, and Related Matters. Over a six-year period, more than 275 sections in the NDAA addressed acquisitions. Legislation affecting defense acquisitions can also be found in other titles within the NDAA or in standalone bills like the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. Regulatory Changes in defense acquisitions are governed by federal government regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. DOD procurement actions must adhere to these regulations, which can change rapidly. For example, the DOD Directive 5000 series was established in 1971 to regulate defense acquisitions. The DOD Directive 5000 series, established in 1971, regulates the acquisition of major weapon systems. The process has been revised over 40 years, with changes approximately every three years. The regulatory changes have varied in length and complexity, affecting the number of milestones and documentation required for approval. The CRS Seminars Defense Acquisitions program examines past reform efforts to identify successful strategies. The program analyzes past reform attempts to identify what has worked, what has not worked, and lessons that can be learned from these efforts. It includes readings such as Defense Acquisition Reform 1960-2009 and reports from the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel and President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management.
