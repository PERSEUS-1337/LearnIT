    "content": "There is no universally agreed-upon definition of \"Internet governance.\" It encompasses the management of technical aspects like domain names and protocols, as well as policy issues such as intellectual property and cybersecurity. Definitions from the World Summit on the Information Society and the Internet Governance Project highlight the shared principles and decision-making processes involved in shaping the Internet. The Internet Governance Project (IGP) outlines three key aspects of Internet governance: technical standardization, resource allocation and assignment, and human conduct online. It involves collective decision-making by stakeholders to establish policies and rules regarding technical standards, resource allocations, and user behavior in global internetworking activities. The Internet's decentralized nature makes governing it complex. National governments can't fully control it due to its international scope. Private sector stakeholders worldwide, including server operators, domain registrars, and Internet users, play crucial roles in its functioning. Various organizations and entities are involved in Internet governance to ensure cooperation among stakeholders. Key private sector organizations involved in Internet governance include ICANN, which manages critical technical aspects like the domain name system and IP addressing through contracts with registries. ICANN manages the master database of domain names and works with accredited registrars. Policies are developed through a consensus-based process. Internet standards organizations like the IETF play a key role in developing technical standards for the Internet. The Internet governance involves organizations like IETF, IAB, ISOC, and W3C, as well as governmental entities such as the GAC within ICANN's multistakeholder process. GAC provides advice on public policy matters related to national laws and international agreements. Membership is open to all national governments, with 171 members and 35 observers currently. The GAC Chair is held by Switzerland, with Vice Chairs held by Egypt, Peru, France, the United Kingdom, and China. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was established in 2006 by the United Nations' World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) to provide a multistakeholder forum for open discussions on Internet-related public policies. The IGF does not have negotiated outcomes or make formal recommendations to the U.N. In December 2010, the U.N. General Assembly renewed the IGF through 2015 and tasked the U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) to develop a report on improvements. The United Nations formed a Working Group on Improvements to the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) with 22 governments, including the United States. The IGF was renewed through 2025 in December 2015. Other international organizations like the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also address Internet policy issues. National governments address various Internet policy issues within their borders, such as cybersecurity, cybercrime, Internet gambling, privacy, and intellectual property protection. They have established internal coordinating bodies for Internet policy, but do not have direct control over ICANN or the domain name system. The U.S. government initially funded and operated key components of the network architecture that enabled the domain name system to function. In the late 1990s, ICANN was created, and the NTIA of the Department of Commerce assumed the lead role in overseeing domain names. A 1998 Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and the DOC initiated a process to transition technical DNS coordination and management functions to the private sector. The U.S. government, through the Department of Commerce, retained a role in overseeing the DNS via contractual agreements with ICANN and VeriSign. This legacy authority allowed the government to exert influence over ICANN and the DNS. The U.S. government had significant influence over ICANN and the DNS, with various federal agencies maintaining specific interests related to domain name issues. Despite this, none of these agencies had legal authority over ICANN. NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role over key domain name functions to the global community in 2014. NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role over key domain name functions to the global Internet multistakeholder community. NTIA stated that it would let its IANA functions contract with ICANN expire if a satisfactory transition could be achieved. ICANN convened a process through which the multistakeholder community would develop a proposal to achieve the transition, following four key principles outlined by NTIA. The ICANN process led to the acceptance of the IANA Stewardship Transition and Enhancing ICANN Accountability proposals. A new entity, Post-Transition IANA (PTI), will handle IANA functions under ICANN oversight. The proposal aims to enhance ICANN's accountability. The proposal aims to enhance ICANN's accountability by creating the \"Empowered Community\" as a new entity with powers to enforce decisions when consensus cannot be reached. This entity, under California law, would act as the Sole Designator of ICANN Board Directors and have the authority to reject budgets, approve bylaw changes, and remove Board members. The NTIA issued its IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal Assessment Report on June 9, 2016, confirming the transition proposal's compliance. The NTIA's report confirmed that the transition proposal for U.S. government stewardship over IANA met the criteria. ICANN implemented the transition by adopting revised bylaws, and the contract with ICANN expired on September 30, 2016. NTIA modified its agreement with Verisign, removing its role in authorizing changes to the root zone file. The Affirmation of Commitments was integrated into ICANN's new bylaws. The U.S. government can now participate in ICANN policymaking through the Governmental Advisory Committee. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) provides formal advice to the ICANN Board, which must be reached by full consensus. If mutual agreement cannot be reached, the Board can choose not to follow the advice with a 60% vote. The GAC participates in the Empowered Community, except in cases challenging board actions based on GAC advice. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to limit or delay the U.S. government's proposal to relinquish authority over ICANN. The DOTCOM Act of 2015 would have prohibited NTIA from relinquishing responsibility over the Internet domain name system. The DOTCOM Act of 2015 aimed to delay the U.S. government's proposal to relinquish authority over ICANN. H.R. 805, passed by the House, prevents NTIA's authority over the IANA function from ceasing until a report on the final transition proposal is submitted to Congress. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, represented by H.R. 805, requires NTIA certification that the transition proposal supports the multistakeholder model of Internet governance, maintains Internet security, and meets global expectations. S. 1551, the Senate version, mirrors H.R. 805 and was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The House passed H.R. 2578, the FY2016 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act, which allocated funds for DOC and NTIA. Section 536 of the bill prohibited the use of funds to relinquish NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to provide quarterly reports on the transition process. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) prohibits NTIA from relinquishing its control over IANA in FY2016. The committee supports the continued US stewardship over the domain name system for security and freedom of speech internationally. NTIA must inform the Committee and Senate 45 days before any decision on a successor contract. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the proposed IANA transition and directed NTIA to provide quarterly reports on the transition process. The House Appropriations Committee approved the FY2017 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The House Appropriations Committee approved the FY2017 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations act (H.R. 5393) on May 24, 2016, seeking to prohibit NTIA from relinquishing authority over IANA in FY2017. Section 534 of the act stated that funds cannot be used for this purpose, expressing concerns about the transition process to the global multistakeholder community for Internet domain name functions. The FY2017 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations act sought to prohibit NTIA from relinquishing authority over IANA. Section 534 expressed concerns about the transition process to the global multistakeholder community for Internet domain name functions. Senator Cruz introduced the Protecting Internet Freedom Act to prevent NTIA from giving up its authority without congressional approval. The U.S. government has secured sole ownership of the .gov and .mil domains, with exclusive control ensured through a contract with ICANN. Legislation such as the Protecting Internet Freedom Act and other bills aim to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its authority over the IANA functions. H.R. 5329 introduced by Representative Mike Kelly in 2016 aims to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its responsibilities over domain name functions unless specific criteria are met. S.Res. 71 designates a week for Internet Governance Awareness to increase public education on NTIA's proposed transition. S.Res. 71 passed by the Senate on February 5, 2015, aims to increase public awareness about NTIA's proposed transition and the importance of accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. Hearings were held in the 114th Congress to discuss the IANA transition and ICANN's management of the domain name system. The House and Senate Committees held hearings on various aspects of Internet governance, including the IANA transition and ICANN's management of the domain name system. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary discussed the multistakeholder model for governing the Internet and the implications of ending U.S. oversight. Debates revolve around whether national governments should have a greater role in governance, particularly in relation to ICANN and the domain name system. The debate over the governance of the domain name system has focused on ICANN's influence on various aspects of Internet policy, including intellectual property, privacy, and cybersecurity. Criticisms of ICANN stem from concerns about national governments lacking influence over its decisions and the perception of undue legacy influence from the U.S. government. The debate over ICANN's influence on Internet policy has sparked concerns about U.S. government control. The multistakeholder model of Internet governance is supported by international organizations like the OECD and G8. The Communiqu\u00e9 on Principles for Internet Policy-Making emphasizes multistakeholderism in Internet governance, highlighting the importance of various stakeholders playing a role in managing critical Internet resources. The G8 Summit of Deauville in 2011 also expressed support for a multistakeholder model with a significant government role in Internet governance. The role of governments in Internet governance was emphasized, with a call for enhanced cooperation among stakeholders in international fora. While the WSIS in 2005 considered intergovernmental models, it ultimately decided against it. However, some nations like India, Brazil, and South Africa have advocated for an intergovernmental approach. Africa (IBSA) proposed the creation of a U.N. body to coordinate global Internet policies. India suggested establishing the United Nations Committee for Internet-Related Policies (CIRP) with 50 member states for oversight. CIRP would receive input from the Internet Governance Forum and advisory stakeholder groups, reporting directly to the General Assembly. A group of nations proposed an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" to the U.N. General Assembly, promoting a multilateral, transparent, and democratic international management system for the Internet. The revised Code emphasizes equal responsibility for all States in governing the Internet's security and stability. The governance of the Internet is a key issue, with different nations supporting either a multistakeholder or intergovernmental model. The debate revolves around promoting equitable distribution of resources, access for all, and ensuring stable and secure functioning. Multistakeholder processes are seen as encouraging broader problem-solving and faster decision-making in a rapidly changing market and technological landscape. Some nations prefer an Internet controlled by nation-states, challenging the multistakeholder model. The U.S. will participate in a treaty negotiation in December 2012 to review International Telecommunication Regulations. Some states may push for heavy-handed governmental control of the Internet, including cybersecurity provisions. The international community debated the governance of the Internet and the domain name system, suggesting a higher intergovernmental body should oversee it. The United Nations studied how to increase international involvement in Internet governance, leading to the release of a report by the Working Group on Internet Governance in 2005. The U.N.'s Working Group on Internet Governance released a report in 2005 proposing further internationalization of Internet governance. It suggested creating a new global forum for Internet stakeholders and presented four possible models, including ones involving new Internet governance bodies linked to the U.N. The report's conclusions were to be discussed during the second phase of the WSIS in Tunis. U.S. officials opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body. The 109th Congress supported maintaining U.S. control over ICANN and the DNS. The EU initially backed the U.S. position but later shifted towards favoring enhanced international governance of the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit was avoided with an agreement in November 2005, where ICANN and the U.S. retained their roles. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was established under the U.N. to provide a platform for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai in December 2012 by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs) governing international telecommunications traffic. The key policy question was how to address Internet traffic and governance in the updated ITRs. The U.S. advocated for the new ITRs to focus on traditional telecommunications traffic. The 112th Congress expressed concerns about the WCIT potentially increasing intergovernmental control over the Internet. A hearing was held on \"International Proposals to Regulate the Internet,\" and H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to preserve the multistakeholder governance model. The 112th Congress expressed concerns about the WCIT potentially increasing intergovernmental control over the Internet. H.Con.Res. 127, passed unanimously by the House, emphasized the need to promote a global Internet free from government control and preserve the multistakeholder model. A similar resolution, S.Con.Res. 50, was introduced in the Senate. S.Con.Res. 50 was passed by the Senate and the House unanimously on December 5, 2012, to promote a global Internet free from government control. During the WCIT, a proposal to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was supported by certain countries but later withdrawn. The ITU adopted a nonbinding resolution titled \"To Foster an enabling environment for the greater growth of the Internet\" after a proposal to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was withdrawn. The resolution included language on international Internet governance and cybersecurity, leading the United States to decline signing the treaty. The United States opposes an ITU treaty that goes against a multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance. They believe internet policy should be driven by citizens, communities, and society, not member states. The ITU conference has addressed issues like spam and internet governance, but the US insists on a multi-stakeholder approach. The WCIT in Dubai concluded with 89 nations signing the treaty, while 55 nations, including the United States, chose not to sign or remain undecided. The international debate over Internet governance is expected to continue in future meetings. The U.S. Congress supported efforts to resist international control over Internet governance, holding hearings on the matter. On April 16, 2013, H.R. 1580 was introduced by Representative Walden, affirming the US policy on Internet governance. The bill passed unanimously in the House of Representatives on May 14, 2013. In October 2013, ICANN's President and other global Internet organizations called for strengthening multistakeholder cooperation. The Montevideo Statement emphasized the importance of globally coherent Internet operations and warned against national Internet fragmentation. It expressed concern over trust erosion due to surveillance, highlighted the need for ongoing Internet Governance efforts, and called for the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The President of ICANN met with the President of Brazil to discuss plans for an international Internet governance summit in April 2014. NETmundial, a global multistakeholder meeting on Internet governance, took place in April 2014 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It aimed to establish Internet governance principles and a roadmap for its evolution. The outcome was a nonbinding statement endorsing the multistakeholder model and the transition of IANA functions from the U.S. government. The U.S. government endorsed the transition of IANA functions to the global multistakeholder community and emphasized the importance of strengthening the Internet Governance Forum's mandate and human rights in implementing a free and open Internet. The NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders to apply NETmundial Principles for effective Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, Republic of Korea, concluded on November 7, 2014. The conference sets general policies, adopts strategic and financial plans, and elects officials every four years. The U.S. delegation had concerns about expanding ITU's role in Internet governance, but the conference decided not to do so. The United Nations General Assembly held a meeting in New York on December 15-16, 2015, to review the implementation of outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society. The WSIS+10 outcome document supported greater participation in Internet governance discussions involving various stakeholders, including governments, private sector, civil society, and international organizations. The role of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was also supported, with its mandate extended for another 10 years. The U.S. government endorsed the outcome, emphasizing multi-stakeholder collaboration for the next decade. The United States expressed concerns about greater governmental control over Internet governance, fearing it could lead to censorship and content controls. There are debates on whether Internet governance mechanisms could be used to combat terrorist use of the Internet, with nation-states having the authority to monitor and shut down websites within their borders. International governance of Internet content and use is also a topic of discussion. Governance of the Internet on an international level is problematic due to its decentralized nature. There is no international entity with authority to remove global Internet content promoting terrorism. Proposals for United Nations authority over the Internet have been opposed by the US and Western nations, fearing it could lead to censorship. The question arises if ICANN could be used to restrict or limit Internet use. ICANN administers the Internet infrastructure but does not regulate content. Congress oversees ICANN's management of the domain name system through committees like the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. There is concern about using ICANN to restrict Internet use by terrorist groups. Since 1997, congressional committees like the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have held over 40 hearings on the DNS and ICANN. The 114th Congress closely examined NTIA's proposal to transition ICANN to a multistakeholder-driven entity. Congress may continue assessing NTIA's effectiveness in advancing U.S. government positions within the Governmental Advisory Committee and monitoring intergovernmental telecommunications conferences for potential threats to the multistakeholder system of Internet governance. The ongoing debate over Internet governance will impact various aspects of the Internet, including intellectual property, privacy, law enforcement, free speech, and cybersecurity. The institutional nature of Internet governance could influence important policy decisions shaping the future evolution of the Internet. ICANN, a nonprofit corporation based in Los Angeles, is subject to legal oversight by the California attorney general and has tax-exempt status granted by the federal government. ICANN, a nonprofit corporation based in Los Angeles, has tax-exempt status granted by the federal government and the state of California. Its organizational structure includes a Board of Directors advised by various supporting organizations and advisory committees representing Internet constituencies. The Board of Directors, composed of 16 international members, is responsible for making final policy and operational decisions. The explosive growth of the Internet and domain name registration has led to marked growth of the ICANN budget, from revenues of about $6 million in 2000 to $162.9 million in 2016. ICANN is funded primarily through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. Registrars are companies where consumers register domain names, while registry operators manage the master database of domain names in each top-level domain. ICANN collects revenue from fees paid by registrars and registry operators, as well as from new gTLD application fees, estimated at $49.5 million in 2016."
