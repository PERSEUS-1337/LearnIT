    "content": "The EPA was established in 1970 to consolidate federal pollution control responsibilities. Its responsibilities include regulating air and water quality, pesticides, toxic substances, waste management, and environmental cleanup. The agency also awards grants to assist states and local governments in pollution control. The EPA's funding for FY2011 was $1.61 billion less than the previous year, with a total of $8.68 billion allocated. This amount was lower than both the FY2010 appropriation and the President's FY2011 budget request. Funding for EPA and other federal agencies in FY2011 was provided through a series of interim CRs due to Congress not completing action on regular appropriations bills. The EPA's funding for FY2011 was lower than the previous year, with funding provided through a series of interim CRs. The House passed H.R. 1, which included adjusted funding levels for EPA and other agencies for FY2011. The House-passed H.R. 1 included provisions restricting EPA regulatory activities, but the Senate did not pass it. Another bill provided $2.0 million in supplemental funding for EPA research. The rescinded funds from EPA under Title VII of Division A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 were outlined in Sections 311-313 of P.L. 111-226. Congress has funded EPA programs within the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill since FY2006. The annual congressional budget resolution outlines funding for federal land management agencies and EPA within the Natural Resources and Environment Function (Budget Function 300). The budget resolution sets spending levels for federal land management agencies and EPA for upcoming fiscal years, but funding for individual agencies is determined through the appropriations process. EPA's funding has generally increased over time to meet its statutory responsibilities for protecting human health and the environment. The EPA's appropriations have increased over time, reaching a peak of $14.86 billion in FY2009. This funding included regular appropriations and emergency supplemental appropriations. The term appropriations in this report refers to total discretionary funds available to the EPA for obligation. The EPA's funding primarily consists of discretionary appropriations, with a small portion being permanent or mandatory appropriations. Since FY1996, EPA's appropriations have been requested by the Administration and appropriated by Congress within eight statutory accounts. FY2011 enacted appropriations reflect a 0.2% rescission, while the President's FY2011 budget request amounts are based on EPA's Annual Performance Plan. The FY2011 budget request details are based on EPA's Annual Performance Plan and the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2011. Funding changes are compared between enacted FY2011 appropriations, FY2010 appropriations, and the President's FY2011 funding levels. The report provides information on funding levels enacted for FY2009 for certain EPA programs, including regular fiscal year appropriations and emergency supplemental appropriations. Comparisons with proposed funding levels in House-passed H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149 are not included in this report. Historical funding in prior fiscal years has not been adjusted for inflation, and small increases above prior-year funding levels may reflect a decrease in real dollar values when adjusted. The FY2011 appropriations overview and examination of funding levels for selected EPA programs are complex and not fully summarized in this report. OMB's budget documentation and EPA's budget justification are extensive, with over 1,000 pages presenting funding, programmatic, and legislative proposals. Appropriations bills and committee reports detail funding levels for various programs beyond the scope of this report, providing specific direction on fund allocation. The FY2011 appropriations overview and examination of funding levels for selected EPA programs are complex and not fully summarized in this report. Table 1 compares EPA's FY2011 enacted appropriations in P.L. 112-10 with the President's budget request and FY2010 enacted amounts. The FY2011 enacted amounts reflect a 0.2% rescission, while FY2010 levels include $2.0 million in supplemental appropriations under P.L. 111-212. P.L. 112-10 did not include earmarked funding for individual projects, locations, or institutions. In FY2010, Congress designated earmarked funding for EPA, providing $179.4 million, while in FY2009, $167.9 million was allocated. Both the House and Senate adopted definitions for earmarks, with a moratorium on earmarks during the 112th Congress. In FY2010, Congress allocated $179.4 million in designated funding for EPA, and $167.9 million in FY2009. EPA's FY2011 appropriations focused on federal financial assistance for infrastructure projects, environmental cleanup, air pollution control, climate change research, and geographic-specific initiatives like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and Chesapeake Bay restoration. Regulatory actions and provisions in House-passed H.R. 1 were also key areas of attention. House-passed H.R. 1 included provisions restricting EPA's regulatory activities across various environmental programs. Senate substitute amendment S.Amdt. 149 omitted these provisions and proposed different FY2011 funding levels for EPA. Key funding issues of debate were discussed. The FY2011 decrease in EPA appropriations was mainly due to a reduction in State and Tribal Assistance Grants for Clean Water and Drinking Water projects. The total funding for these projects in FY2011 was $2.49 billion, compared to $3.49 billion in FY2010 and the President's request of $3.29 billion. These grants support local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. In FY2011, appropriations for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects were provided to comply with the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The funding included $1.52 billion for Clean Water SRF grants and $963.1 million for Drinking Water SRF grants, which were lower than FY2010 appropriations. Some Members objected to the reductions, while others argued they were offset by unspent FY2009 funding from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. The FY2011 grants were larger than regular FY2009 appropriations but smaller than total FY2009 appropriations. The federal assistance for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) has been a contentious issue due to high capital needs for water infrastructure projects. Prior to FY2010, Congress had allocated more funding than requested by the Administration for the Clean Water SRF. The adequacy of federal funding levels for both SRFs remains a point of disagreement. There has been disagreement between Congress and the Administration regarding funding levels for the Drinking Water SRF. Some Members advocated for increases to help communities comply with new water quality requirements, while others argued for reductions to address federal deficit concerns. Congress also provided funding through special project grants in the STAG account. The FY2010 appropriations included $156.8 million for 317 special project grants distributed to communities. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for these grants. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for congressionally directed special projects, consistent with past administrations. Funding for water infrastructure grants in specific areas was included: $9.98 million for Alaska Native Villages and $9.98 million for wastewater projects along the U.S./Mexico border. The Hazardous Substance Superfund account supports cleanup of contaminated sites under EPA's Superfund. The FY2011 appropriation for the Superfund account was $1.28 billion, slightly lower than the previous year. Despite concerns about budget constraints, funding for cleanup activities remained stable. The FY2011 appropriation for the Superfund account was $1.28 billion, slightly lower than the previous year. Funding for physical site cleanup activities was similar to the President's request, with reductions mainly in enforcement and supporting activities. CERCLA established EPA's Superfund program to clean up threatening sites and enforce liability of responsible parties. The Hazardous Substance Superfund account funds cleanup, including orphan sites, with cost-share agreements with states. The Superfund account receives funding for cleanup of sites on the National Priorities List, enforcement actions, research on cleanup methods, operational expenses, and support activities. Funding is also allocated for research activities related to cleanup, independent auditing, investigation, and evaluation of the Superfund program, and homeland security activities. Comparisons are made between FY2011 enacted amounts, the President's FY2011 request, and appropriations enacted. The Superfund program's funding levels have been a topic of debate, with concerns about the pace and adequacy of cleanup at NPL sites. The measure of \"construction completion\" is used to track progress, which has been declining over the years. This trend raises questions about whether funding has been sufficient to maintain consistent cleanup progress for human health and environmental protection. Interest in greater resources to enhance cleanup progress has raised the issue of reinstating industry taxes that once funded the Superfund program. Excise taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks, as well as a special environmental tax on corporate income, historically provided funding for the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund. The authority to collect these taxes expired on December 31. The Superfund program's funding from industry taxes expired in 1995, leading to a debate on whether to reinstate the taxes to ensure polluters pay for cleanup costs. The President's FY2011 budget proposed reinstating Superfund taxes through FY2020, but legislation to reauthorize the taxes was not enacted. The Superfund program's funding from industry taxes expired in 1995. Legislation to reauthorize the taxes was introduced but not enacted in the 111th Congress. Three bills have been introduced in the 112th Congress to date. The EPA administers a Brownfields program to provide financial assistance for the cleanup of less hazardous sites not addressed under the Superfund program. The program is intended to assist with \"orphan\" sites not listed on the NPL. The EPA's Brownfields program received $172.9 million in funding under P.L. 112-10, which is close to the FY2010 appropriation. However, this amount is $42.2 million less than the President's FY2011 request of $215.1 million. The FY2011 appropriations act also approved a transfer of $112.9 million from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund to EPA. The LUST Trust Fund, supported by a motor fuels tax, had a balance of $3.2 billion at the beginning of FY2011. EPA and states use these funds for overseeing and enforcing cleanup activities, emergency actions, abandoned tank sites cleanup, and cost recovery. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded leak prevention provisions in the UST regulatory program and broadened the authorized uses of the LUST Trust Fund to support state implementation of requirements. Congress now appropriates funds from the trust fund for both cleanup and leak prevention programs. Emerging issues include the impact of alternative fuels on storage tank infrastructure and the need for future cleanup funds. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded leak prevention provisions in the UST regulatory program and broadened the authorized uses of the LUST Trust Fund. The Act of 2007 presents new technical issues for USTs and fuel storage infrastructure due to higher ethanol blends. EPA estimates that half of the tanks in the ground are 20 years old and have never been tested for compatibility with higher ethanol blends, raising concerns about potential leaks contaminating groundwater. EPA is currently assessing UST compatibility with alternative fuels and evaluating the characteristics of ethanol and biodiesel blends. Congressional interest lies in EPA's implementation of Clean Air Act provisions and proposed changes to the law. The Clean Air Act provisions and proposed changes were a major concern during FY2011 funding debates for EPA's air quality programs. Most funding is allocated to grants for states and tribes in various accounts, supporting regulatory programs, research, and monitoring activities. Additional funding in the Superfund account is for EPA technical assistance on radiation risks at Superfund sites. P.L. 112-10 specified no funding for certain programs, aligning with House, Senate, and President's proposals. The FY2011 funding debates for EPA's air quality programs focused on Clean Air Act provisions and proposed changes. Funding was allocated to grants for states and tribes, regulatory programs, research, and monitoring activities. P.L. 112-10 specified funding amounts for various programs, aligning with House, Senate, and President's proposals. The STAG account received $49.9 million for the Diesel Emission Reduction Grants Program, a reduction from previous years. House-passed H.R. 1 included provisions restricting funds for specific EPA actions under the CAA, which were not included in the final legislation. The Clean Air Act authorizes federal grants to states for air pollution control programs, but grant amounts have stagnated. In FY2011, $236.1 million was allocated for state grants, an increase from FY2010 but below the President's request. State revenues have declined, putting pressure on air programs. In FY2011, EPA allocated $236.1 million for state grants, an increase from FY2010 but below the President's request. EPA is reviewing air quality standards and diesel emission reduction grants program received attention during FY2011 appropriations debate. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized $200.0 million annually for grants to reduce emissions from diesel-powered vehicles. EPA awarded $360.0 million in FY2009, with major recipients being port authorities and school districts. Every dollar spent on diesel emission reductions generates up to $13.00 in health benefits. A key issue of debate is EPA's response to the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which found greenhouse gases to be \"air pollutants.\" In response to the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, EPA found greenhouse gases to endanger public health and welfare, leading to emission standards for motor vehicles in 2010. This triggered control requirements for new major stationary sources of GHGs in 2011. The motor vehicle standards have not been controversial. The emission standards for motor vehicles set in May 2010 were not controversial, as they were negotiated with stakeholders. However, concerns have been raised about the implementation of standards for stationary sources, leading to efforts in Congress to prevent EPA action through various legislative measures. The path to enacting such legislation is challenging. The Obama Administration aims to reduce GHG emissions, but legislation restricting EPA's authority may face a presidential veto. EPA requested funds for regulatory efforts on climate change and emission standards for mobile sources. Congressional efforts to prevent EPA action on stationary sources are challenging. During the debate of the FY2011 appropriations, amendments were considered regarding EPA's GHG emission standards for stationary sources. Congress has allocated funding for climate change activities across federal agencies, focusing on energy technology development and Earth observations. The $20.5 million appropriated for climate change research in FY2011 was less than the previous year. In FY2011, $20.5 million was allocated for climate change research, which was less than the previous year's appropriation. The funding was intended for investigating health and ecosystem impacts of climate change, exploring adaptation options, and assessing potential modifications to pollution control programs. Additionally, $16.8 million was provided for advanced vehicle technologies under the Climate Protection Program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve energy in the transportation sector. In FY2011, funding was allocated for climate change research, including investigating health and ecosystem impacts, exploring adaptation options, and assessing pollution control programs. Additionally, $16.8 million was provided for advanced vehicle technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. The overall role of EPA in providing climate services and regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act has been a key issue. The FY2011 enacted appropriations for the Climate Protection Program activity under the Clean Air Act were $107.5 million, lower than the previous year's funding. $20.8 million was allocated for the Mandatory Reporting of GHG Rule, an increase from the FY2010 enacted appropriation. Reliable greenhouse gas data is crucial for developing effective policies, as demonstrated by the European Union's experience with inadequate emissions data. The FY2011 enacted appropriations for climate change protection activities were comparable to FY2010 levels. The President's FY2011 request included increased funding for voluntary climate protection programs like Energy Star and Methane-to-Markets. Comparable FY2011 enacted amounts for these programs are not readily available. For FY2011, Congress did not specify funding for international climate change efforts. EPA has historically worked on building expertise for GHG monitoring in other countries. U.S. policy emphasizes major emitters' responsibility to reduce emissions. EPA may assist in establishing peer-to-peer networks for climate change cooperation. The Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account includes funding for geographic-specific/ecosystem programs to address environmental and human health risks in the United States. Collaboration among EPA, state and local governments, communities, and nonprofit organizations is common in these programs. President Bush established a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force in 2004 to guide federal Great Lakes protection and restoration efforts. The FY2010 budget requested coordination efforts for Great Lakes protection. The FY2010 budget requested a Great Lakes Restoration Initiative involving EPA and other federal agencies to address ecosystem problems like invasive species, pollution, and contaminated sediment. The initiative consolidates funding for existing Great Lakes programs and continues in FY2011 with an appropriation of $299.4 million within EPA's EPM account. The EPA's EPM account for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative received funding below the FY2010 enacted appropriations but similar to the President's FY2011 request. Concerns were raised about the reduced funding level for FY2011, despite significant investments totaling nearly $775.0 million over two years. President Obama's Executive Order 13508 in May 2009 aimed to restore the Chesapeake Bay. Despite past restoration efforts, the Bay's overall health remains degraded. The FY2011 appropriation for EPA to accelerate pollution reduction and habitat restoration in the Chesapeake Bay was $54.4 million, below the President's budget request of $63.0 million. The budget included funds for addressing pollution runoff from farms in the Mississippi River Basin to reduce nutrient introduction into the Gulf of Mexico. Congress did not provide funding for this in FY2011. The Nixon Administration established EPA in 1970 to address environmental pollution concerns. Congress has enacted numerous environmental laws over time. EPA's funding has been allocated under eight statutory accounts since FY1996. The Mississippi River Basin Initiative did not receive FY2011 appropriations from Congress. The EPA, established in 1970, receives annual appropriations from Congress to carry out its responsibilities under environmental laws. This includes regulating air and water quality, managing hazardous wastes, and awarding grants to assist state and local governments in controlling pollution. Table B-1 shows FY2007-FY2011 appropriations for EPA, while Figure B-1 displays the agency's budget authority from FY1976 to FY2010. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides historical funding trends for the EPA in the President's Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2011. EPA's budget authority levels are adjusted for inflation to reflect real dollar values over time. The agency's funding has grown over the years in response to environmental issues, representing a small portion of the total discretionary federal budget. EPA's funding has grown from $1.0 billion in FY1970 to a peak of $14.86 billion in FY2009, adjusted for inflation. This peak includes regular appropriations of $7.64 billion in P.L. 111-8 and emergency supplemental appropriations of $7.22 billion in P.L. 111-5. EPA's funding in FY1978 was slightly higher than in FY2009 in real dollar values."
