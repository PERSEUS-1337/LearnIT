    "content": "The \"Health Care Consumer Protection Act of 1995\" requires insurers to notify consumers of coverage provided. Insurers must annually notify current enrollees of health plan coverage details, including covered services, costs, enrollee rights, and utilization review requirements. Insurers must provide notice to potential enrollees about the coverage details of the health plan, including reimbursement percentages for healthcare and administration costs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish regulations for failure to provide this notification. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish regulations for insurers to notify current and potential enrollees about health insurance coverage under a health plan. SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. Under a health plan, only a licensed health care practitioner directly involved in a patient's care can determine medically necessary treatment. Insurers must cover services deemed medically necessary. Regulations will prevent insurers from offering incentives to practitioners. The regulations prevent the continued participation of a licensed health care practitioner in a plan if they limit appropriate medical tests, services, or treatments. The Act enforces penalties for health plans violating its provisions, with civil money penalties determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Insurers are prohibited from including hold harmless provisions in health plans, and states cannot establish weaker standards for insurers than those set by the Act. The Act defines key terms such as insurer, health care practitioner, health insurance coverage, and health plan. It includes entities licensed to provide insurance and health maintenance organizations. The Act defines key terms related to insurance and healthcare, including entities in District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam. The provisions of this Act apply to all health plans offered, sold, issued, or renewed after the enactment date."
