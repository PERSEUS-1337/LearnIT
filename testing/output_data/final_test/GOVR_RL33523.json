    "content": "On May 25, 2006, the House passed H.R. 5429 to open ANWR to development. The Senate passed the FY2007 budget resolution directing the reduction of budget authority by predicted revenues from ANWR development. The House budget resolution did not include ANWR language. The Senate version could facilitate ANWR development in a reconciliation bill, but agreement is uncertain. The House is proceeding on appropriations bills without a final agreement. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in northeast Alaska, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, is a promising onshore oil and gas prospect. The mean estimate of technically recoverable oil on federally-owned land in the Refuge is 7.7 billion barrels, with a small chance of over 11.8 billion barrels. Economically recoverable oil on federal lands is estimated at 7.14 billion barrels, with a small chance of over 10.7 billion barrels. This amount could rival the Prudhoe Bay field discovered in 1967. The Prudhoe Bay field, discovered in 1967, holds almost 14 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil. Opening federal lands in ANWR to development would also open Native lands, potentially increasing economically recoverable oil estimates to 9.7 billion bbl. State lands along the coast may also become more attractive for industry. The mean estimates suggest a total of over 14.6 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil across federal, state, and Native lands in the region. The Refuge, including the coastal plain, is home to a variety of plants and animals, earning it the nickname \"America's Serengeti.\" Some propose making it an international park. The conflict arises between the high oil potential and the pristine nature of the area, leading to a dilemma of whether to open it for energy development or protect its ecosystem. The debate surrounds whether to open the area for energy development or protect its ecosystem. Factors determining the decision include potential damages, special management legislation by Congress, and federal agency management. Basic information on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge can be found in CRS Report RL31278. Legal background is covered in CRS Report RL31115. State lands on the coastal plain can be viewed at the provided link. The controversy over energy and biological resources in northern Alaska has been ongoing for decades, with debates on opening the area for development or protecting its ecosystem. Various groups present arguments for and against development, with key information available on different websites. The history of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge dates back to the 1950s, with efforts to create a protected area. In 1971, the Secretary of the Interior reserved the Arctic National Wildlife Range for protection, while also allowing for potential oil and gas leasing. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act resolved Native land claims, with the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation receiving rights to land in the ANWR area. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 renamed the Arctic National Wildlife Range as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, expanding it by 9.2 million acres. Congress postponed decisions on development or protection of the coastal plain, directing a study of its resources known as the 1002 report. ANILCA defined the \"coastal plain\" as specified lands, excluding many Native lands. Section 1003 prohibited oil and gas development in the entire Refuge without Congressional authorization. The ANWR debate in the 109th Congress took two routes. The ANWR debate in the 109th Congress has taken two routes: reconciliation bills under the budget process and other bills that can be filibustered. The Senate budget resolution included instructions to reduce outlays by opening ANWR to development, with leasing expected to generate $2.5 billion in revenues over five years. The House FY2006 budget resolution did not include assumptions about ANWR revenues. The conference agreement approved reductions in spending targets of $2.4 billion over FY2006 to FY2010, contingent on passing ANWR development legislation. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee recommended ANWR legislation to meet budget targets, which was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The House also included ANWR legislation in an omnibus reconciliation bill, but faced opposition from some Republicans. Opposition to the ANWR provision grew among Republicans, leading to its removal before floor consideration. The House passed S. 1932 without the ANWR provision, and the conference report omitted ANWR development. The President signed the measure on February 8, 2006. Senator Stevens added an ANWR development title to the FY2006 Defense appropriations bill during conference, forcing senators to choose between filibuster or support. Senators opposing ANWR faced a filibuster or opening the Refuge. A cloture motion failed, and relevant divisions were removed through S.Con.Res. 74. The House passed H.R. 6 with ANWR provisions, while the Senate's version had none. The final bill did not include the ANWR title. The Senate bill did not include ANWR provisions, and the final measure omitted the ANWR title. The House passed a bill to open ANWR to development, similar to the House version of H.R. 6. The Senate passed a budget resolution directing the reduction of budget authority from ANWR development revenues. Some Senators hoped for a reconciliation bill specifically for ANWR in FY2007. The FY2007 budget resolution did not include instructions for a reconciliation bill on ANWR. There is bipartisan support for a single-purpose reconciliation bill in the House. The developed parts of Alaska's North Slope show promise for ANWR's prospects due to oil-bearing strata extending into the area. Oil estimates for ANWR's potential are positive. Recent interest has focused on parts of ANWR's 1002 area west and north of the Marsh Creek anticline, with estimates suggesting at least 11.6 billion bbl of oil present on federal lands. The economic recoverability of this oil depends on the price of oil, which has increased substantially in recent years. USGS estimated that, at $55/bbl in 2003 dollars, there is potential for oil extraction in the area. In June 2006, USGS estimated a 95% chance of economically recovering 3.9 billion bbl or more at $55/bbl in 2003 dollars on federal lands. There is also a 5% chance of 10.7 billion bbl or more. Additionally, about one-third more oil may be under adjacent state waters and Native lands. If onshore development occurs, state waters could benefit from onshore transportation systems and supply bases, making them more attractive to industry. The lifting of the statutory prohibition on oil and gas development in the Refuge could make smaller fields on Native lands more attractive, with production estimated to peak 15-20 years after development begins. Peak production could reach 750,000 bbl per day, roughly 4% of current U.S. petroleum consumption. The lifting of the statutory prohibition on oil and gas development in the Refuge could make smaller fields on Native lands more attractive, with production estimated to peak 15-20 years after development begins. Peak production could reach 750,000 bbl per day, roughly 4% of current U.S. petroleum consumption. Large quantities of natural gas are also estimated to be in the 1002 area, enhancing development prospects for the North Slope. However, there is currently no way to deliver the gas to market. The 108th Congress acted to facilitate a pipeline for natural gas transportation through loan guarantees. Operators in the Prudhoe Bay oil field have developed less environmentally intrusive ways to extract arctic oil through technological innovations like new drilling bits and fluids, as well as advanced drilling techniques. These advancements allow drilling to reach far distances laterally, with a record of seven miles in China. The goal is to reduce the environmental footprint of development, with improved ice-based transportation infrastructure being used in remote areas for exploratory drilling. However, in more hilly terrain, gravel structures are preferred over ice structures for safety reasons. Gravel structures are being used for exploration in areas south of Prudhoe Bay due to their traction advantages over ice structures. Industry is also experimenting with modified offshore platforms to access areas unsuitable for ice technology. Warming trends in the Arctic have reduced winter access across the tundra by 50% in the last 30 years, leading to potential shifts away from ice technology towards gravel structures. This shift could make some marginal fields economically unfeasible for exploration and development. The Alpine field, located along the border of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, is expanding with the approval of five additional pads, adding gravel roads and disturbed soils. The field is run by ConocoPhillips and was considered innovative for its short road connecting two initial pads. If fully developed, approximately 150 miles of roads would be constructed. The potential development of ANWR raises concerns about the impact of road and gravel construction on the environment. Proponents argue that new technologies can mitigate the effects, while opponents believe any facilities would still change the character of the area. The FLEIS report highlights the biological importance of the 1002 area in the Arctic Refuge. The 1002 area in the Arctic Refuge is highly biologically productive, especially during the short arctic summer. Various species, including caribou, polar bears, musk oxen, and migratory birds, rely on this richness. An updated assessment by the USGS in 2002 analyzed the biological resources in the coastal plain, focusing on caribou, musk oxen, snow geese, and other species. The report analyzed new information about caribou, musk oxen, snow geese, and other species in the Arctic Refuge, concluding that development impacts would be significant. A follow-up memo on caribou clarified that restricting development to the western portion of the refuge would not affect the Porcupine Caribou Herd during the early calving period. The National Academy of Sciences report highlighted harmful environmental impacts of existing development at Prudhoe Bay on arctic ecosystems. The National Academy of Sciences report noted the economic and social effects of oil development in northern Alaska, including impacts on caribou distribution and reproduction, predators, and scavengers. The report also mentioned the ongoing review by the Fish and Wildlife Service to determine if polar bears should be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, considering the effects of climate change, threats to denning habitat, and oil and gas development. The potential listing of polar bears could significantly impact energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The debate on energy development in ANWR revolves around whether the 1002 area should be preserved as an intact ecosystem or opened up for development. Supporters of wilderness designation argue that the area is one of the few remaining pristine places on Earth and any intrusion would damage its integrity. The mere existence of such a pristine place is important to those who value its untouched beauty. The current ANWR debate includes key issues such as development restrictions, physical size of development, regulation on Native lands, revenue disposition, labor concerns, oil export restrictions, compliance with environmental laws, and other related matters. The analysis covers specific legislative provisions and administrative details. The ANWR leasing process lacks detail in \u00a74001, leaving many aspects to administrative decisions with potential limitations on public participation and judicial review. Congress could set higher or lower environmental standards for development in the 1002 area, depending on factors like the national wildlife refuge status or the fragile arctic environment. The choice of administering agency and level of discretion granted could impact environmental protection approaches, such as designating FWS or BLM as the lead agency. Provisions could include requirements for using the best available technology. H.R. 5429 proposes naming BLM as the lead agency for the ANWR leasing program, with provisions requiring the use of the best commercially available technology to minimize adverse effects on the environment and ensure fair market value for mineral resources. The relationship between environmental protection and economic viability is unclear. The proposed legislation requires lessees to be responsible for land reclamation in the Coastal Plain, with provisions for environmental protection and mitigation measures. New technologies allow for more consolidated leasing operations, reducing the size of footprints. Technologies allow for more consolidated leasing operations, reducing the size of footprints in energy development. Debate in Congress focuses on defining footprints and whether exploratory structures or structures on Native lands would be included in footprint restrictions. The new map includes Native lands in the Coastal Plain leasing area, but the application of federal leasing programs to those lands is unclear. Development advocates emphasize limiting surface disturbance, while opponents raise concerns. Advocates stress limiting surface disturbance in the 1002 area, while opponents argue for widespread dispersal of energy facilities due to drilling limitations. A single 2,000-acre facility would only access a small percentage of the Coastal Plain, even with extended reach drilling technology. H.R. 5429 (\u00c2\u00a77(d)(9)) aims to consolidate leasing operations to reduce environmental impacts of development on the 2,000-acre Coastal Plain. The bill also requires the Secretary to ensure that the maximum surface acreage covered by production and support facilities does not exceed 2,000 acres, but the specific structures included in this restriction are not defined. The provision in H.R. 5429 aims to consolidate leasing operations on the 2,000-acre Coastal Plain to reduce environmental impacts. It is unclear if roads, gravel mines, causeways, and water treatment plants would be included in this provision. Additionally, there is uncertainty if the provision applies to structures built during the exploratory phase. Native Lands in Alaska have differing views on ANWR development, with Alaska Natives supporting it and Gwich'in Natives opposing it. ANCSA resolved aboriginal claims by creating Village and Regional Corporations to select surface and subsurface rights. Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation selected surface lands on the coastal plain of ANWR. The Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation (KIC) lands, totaling approximately 92,000 acres, are within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and subject to its regulations. The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) obtained subsurface rights beneath the KIC lands through a 1983 land exchange agreement. If oil and gas development is authorized in the federal lands of the Refuge, development could also occur on nearly 100,000 acres of Native lands, potentially free of acreage limitations. The Native lands within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) could potentially be developed without acreage limitations, depending on legislation framing. The regulation of these lands to protect the environment is uncertain due to allotments and language in the 1983 Agreement with ASRC. Current bills do not address development on Native lands in ANWR. The House and Senate have created new maps of the Coastal Plain for leasing, as defined in ANILCA, but the original 1980 map is missing. The 1980 map is missing, making it impossible to evaluate if the administrative description properly excluded Native lands. Questions also surround the legal description completed in 1983, which excluded three Native townships from the Coastal Plain. Some bills have referred to the 1980 map and administrative description to exclude these Native lands. S. 1932 provided a new map in 2005 that included all Native lands in the Coastal Plain for leasing provisions. The bill text did not address Native lands or the extent of federal control over them, raising questions about revenue sharing and potential Native claims for compensation. The Defense bill relied on a USGS map from 2005, but it is unclear if this map aligns with the Senate bill. H.R. 5429 did not mention a map but defined the Coastal Plain for leasing provisions. The House bill, H.R. 5429, defines the Coastal Plain for leasing provisions without referring to a map. It raises the possibility of expanding or reducing the defined area through rule-making procedures. There is also a question of whether Congress can provide for revenue disposition other than the 90% state - 10% federal split mentioned in the Alaska Statehood Act. The House bill, H.R. 5429, establishes a leasing program for ANWR with a 50/50 revenue-sharing provision between the federal government and Alaska. This differs from the usual 90%-10% split under the Mineral Leasing Act, raising questions about its legality under the Alaska Statehood Act. If challenged in court, the revenue-sharing provision could be struck down. If a court struck down the revenue-sharing provision in H.R. 5429, it would need to determine if it was severable. The bill lacks a \"severability\" provision, so if the provision is found to be severable, Alaska could receive 90% of ANWR revenues. S. 1932 also did not specify leasing under the MLA and set different requirements. Receipts from leasing and operations would be divided equally between Alaska and the federal government. The bill's change in the Senate definition of Coastal Plain could include revenues from Native lands. The Defense bill included provisions for a 50/50 revenue split and had a severability clause. If the revenue split was deemed unconstitutional, Alaska could receive 90% of ANWR revenues. This could impact federal funding for programs reliant on the 50% federal share. The Defense bill included provisions for a 50/50 revenue split and had a severability clause. If the revenue split was deemed unconstitutional, Alaska could receive 90% of ANWR revenues, impacting federal funding for programs reliant on the federal share. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) are a recurring issue in federal projects, with proponents arguing for efficient labor sources and cost control, while opponents believe they inflate costs and restrict access. H.R. 5429 (\u00c2\u00a76(b)) would direct the Secretary to require lessees in the 1002 area to... H.R. 5429 (\u00c2\u00a76(b)) and H.R. 2863 contained provisions for project labor agreements in the 1002 area, recognizing the government's interest in labor stability. Export restrictions for North Slope oil, including ANWR oil, have been a longstanding issue, with regulations in place since the Trans Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act. Congress amended the MLA to allow oil exports through the pipeline unless the President determines it's not in the national interest. North Slope exports peaked in 1999 but ceased in 2000. Proposed bans on ANWR oil exports are not linked to TAPS shipments. H.R. 5429 would prohibit export of oil from the 1002 area. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires an environmental impact statement (EIS) for major federal actions with significant environmental effects. A new EIS may be needed for ANWR development. Development supporters want to see a range of alternatives analyzed, including a \"no action\" alternative. Development supporters want to see a range of alternatives analyzed for ANWR development, including a \"no action\" alternative. Some supporters advocate for a truncated process to hasten production, while opponents argue for a thorough update due to changed circumstances since the last analysis in 1987. H.R. 5429 and H.R. 2863 propose limitations on alternative choices and requirements for environmental impact analysis. The proposed leasing legislation for ANWR includes provisions that deem energy leasing activities in the coastal plain compatible with the refuge's purposes, eliminating the usual compatibility determination processes. The extent of leasing activities considered compatible is debatable. Leasing proponents argue for expediting judicial review of ANWR leasing programs by reducing time limits for filing complaints and limiting the scope of review. H.R. 5429 requires complaints to be filed within 90 days and limits review to the Court of Appeals in Washington, DC. H.R. 5429 would limit the scope of review for ANWR leasing programs, stating that review would be based on whether the Secretary complied with the terms of the ANWR subtitle. The Secretary's analysis of environmental effects is presumed correct unless proven otherwise by clear and convincing evidence. Some advocate for protecting certain areas in the Coastal Plain for their ecological or cultural values. The FLEIS identified four special areas totaling over 52,000 acres for potential restriction of development. H.R. 5429 allows the Secretary to set aside up to 45,000 acres, with one specific area forbidding surface occupancy. The Secretary must select among significant areas for set-asides. Section 3(f) designates the Secretary as the sole authority for closures in ANWR, potentially limiting actions under the Endangered Species Act. Several options are available to Congress regarding the development of the 1002 area in ANWR, including allowing exploration only, designating the area as wilderness, or taking no action. Some argue for exploration first to determine energy resources before deciding on leasing. Wilderness designation would prohibit energy development in the area. Wilderness designation in the 1002 area of ANWR would preserve recreational opportunities, jobs, and subsistence resources like the Porcupine Caribou Herd. H.R. 567 and S. 261 aim to designate the area as part of the National Wilderness System, preventing energy development unless Congress allows it. The no action option also prohibits energy development on federal and Native lands. Those advocating for delay cite uncertainties about the probability of discoveries and environmental impacts. Title XXII of P.L. 109-58 (H.R. 6, Barton) opened the ANWR coastal plain to energy development. The bill was introduced on April 18, 2005, and passed the House on April 21, 2005. The Markey/Johnson amendment to strike the ANWR title was rejected. The Senate passed the bill on June 28, 2005, without the ANWR development provision. The conference agreement omitted the ANWR title, and the bill was signed by the President on August 8, 2005. P.L. 109-148 (H.R. 2863) provided for Defense appropriations, including provisions for ANWR development and revenue. The ANWR development provision was included in P.L. 109-171 (S. 1932) Omnibus budget reconciliation bill, but Title IV, which would have provided for ANWR development, was dropped in conference. The bill was signed by the President on December 30, 2005. The FY2006 budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 95, was approved by the Senate and House in 2005 and signed by the President in 2006. The FY2007 budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 376, was introduced in 2006 and passed by the House. H.R. 4241 (Nussle) FY2006 budget reconciliation passed the House on May 18, 2006. H.R. 5429 (Pombo) aimed to create a leasing program to open ANWR to energy development, passed the House on May 25, 2006. S.Con.Res. 18 (Gregg) FY2006 budget resolution included spending targets for the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Cantwell amendment (S.Amdt. 168) relating to ANWR was defeated on March 16, 2005, and the Senate passed the measure on March 17, 2005. The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 83 (Gregg) FY2007 budget resolution on March 16, 2006. The resolution includes cuts in mandatory spending targets for the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Various reports and studies on the environmental impacts of oil and gas activities in Alaska's North Slope are referenced. Petroleum Resource Update in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska. Includes reports on oil and gas potential, wildlife research summaries, and development scenarios evaluation.
