    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Post-Abortion Depression Research and Care Act\". The Congress finds that approximately 1,186,000 unplanned pregnancies in the US end in elective abortion each year. Abortion can have severe and long-term effects on women's mental and emotional well-being, leading to symptoms such as post-abortion depression, guilt, eating disorders, and suicidal urges. Abortion can lead to various mental health issues such as substance abuse, intrusive thoughts, decision-making difficulties, and lack of social support, resulting in emotional distress over time. Women who have had an abortion are more likely to report substance abuse and experience negative emotional effects compared to those who have suffered a natural pregnancy loss or carried to term. Post-abortion depression can be exacerbated by lack of social support and societal understanding. Social pressure to have an abortion can lead to immediate regret and long-term mental distress. Prompt diagnosis and personalized care, including therapy and medication, can help treat post-abortion depression. The emotional aftermath of abortion lacks research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Research on post-abortion depression and psychosis is being expanded and intensified by the National Institute of Mental Health. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the National Institute of Mental Health, is expanding research on post-abortion depression and psychosis. Coordination with other national research institutes is required, and programs for post-abortion conditions will be conducted or supported. The Director of the Institute will conduct or support research on post-abortion conditions, including basic research, epidemiological studies, diagnostic techniques development, clinical research for new treatments, and information/education programs. Additionally, a longitudinal study will be conducted. The Director of the Institute will conduct a national longitudinal study to determine the incidence and prevalence of post-abortion conditions, symptoms, severity, and duration. Reports on the findings will be submitted to Congress periodically. $3,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006 for this purpose.
