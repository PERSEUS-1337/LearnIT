    "content": "The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. A medical device is defined as an instrument intended for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or animals. Medical devices, as defined by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, can range from simple tools like tongue depressors to complex devices like pacemakers. The medical device industry is smaller and more fragmented than the drug industry, with the FDA's Center for ensuring their safety and effectiveness. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates some devices related to blood collection, processing, and cellular therapies. CDRH categorizes medical devices into Class I, II, and III based on risk, with regulatory controls increasing from Class I to Class III. Most Class I devices are exempt from Premarket Notification (510(k)), while most Class II devices require a 510(k). Most Class III devices require Premarket Approval (PMA) from the FDA. Clinical trials are often required for PMAs and some 510(k)s, conducted with FDA permission via an investigational device exemption (IDE). CBER reviews devices under a biological license application (BLA). FDA may require different types of submissions to supplement a PMA, such as Panel Track Supplements for significant changes in device design or performance. The FDA requires different types of submissions to supplement a PMA, such as Panel Track Supplements for significant changes in device design or performance. Real Time Supplements are for minor changes, and 30-Day Notices are for modifications to manufacturing processes. A Product Development Protocol (PDP) can be used as an alternative to a PMA. The FDA requires various types of submissions for device development, including a Product Development Protocol (PDP) for early consultation to minimize risks. A 513(g) request allows for obtaining regulatory status information. PMAs are the most rigorous application process, while 510(k) clearances are more common for medical devices. Prior to MDUFMA's enactment, FDA's resources for device and radiological health programs had not kept pace with the industry's growth and technological advancements. Adequate funding for the program was deemed essential to ensure prompt approval and clearance of safe medical devices. Device manufacturers must be registered with FDA, file annual reports, and have their establishments inspected. The FDA inspects establishments to ensure compliance with quality system requirements for medical devices. Inspections focus on manufacturing controls, processes, and records to maintain safety and effectiveness. Concerns have been raised about reprocessing and re-use of single-use devices. Prior to the enactment of MDUFMA in 2002, FDA officials met with industry leaders to agree upon acceptable fee types, amounts, exceptions, and performance goals. MDUFMA was enacted to provide FDA with resources to better review medical devices. MDUFMA was enacted in 2002 to provide the FDA with resources for better reviewing medical devices, establishing user fees for premarket reviews, allowing third-party inspections, and implementing new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. The authority for collecting user fees will expire in 2007 unless reauthorized by Congress. MDUFMA was enacted in 2002 to provide resources for FDA to review medical devices and establish user fees. In preparation for reauthorization in 2007, FDA and industry representatives reached a proposed agreement on terms. The terms were incorporated into the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act and the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. Attendees expressed satisfaction with the terms at a public meeting held by FDA. The MDUFA 2007 provisions, similar to MDUFMA, address user fee authorities and third-party inspection. Proposed user fee provisions would sunset in 2012. MDUFMA and MDUFA 2007 relate to user fees, including triggers linking FDA's authority to collect fees to Congressional appropriations levels, fee reductions/exemptions, performance goals, and allowable fee uses. The MDUFSA legislation in 2005 adjusted the triggers for FDA's salaries and expenses related to devices and radiological health, ensuring that Congressional appropriations meet certain thresholds. This adjustment was necessary due to lower appropriations in previous fiscal years. The minimum requirement for FDA's budget in FY2007 was set at $229,334,000. MDUFA 2007 proposes to maintain these triggers through FY2012. The MDUFMA legislation has increased FDA's device review budget through user fees, with fees comprising over 16% of the budget in FY2008. MDUFMA fees would translate into 200 FTEs in FY2008, increasing each year until FY2012. Total fee revenues in FY2008 would increase by approximately 31% over FY2007, generating $287 million over five years. MDUFMA legislation increased FDA's device review budget through user fees, generating $287 million over five years. FDA collects user fees from manufacturers for medical device applications. MDUFA 2007 introduced new stable fees to address revenue fluctuations, including an annual establishment registration fee, an annual periodic reports fee, and a 30-Day Notice fee. The FDA Agreement introduced new fees to reduce existing application fees under MDUFA 2007. Fees would increase by 8.5% annually to cover program costs and provide industry stability. A newly created establishment fee could be increased by an additional 8.5% in FY2010 if needed. Fees are set as a percentage of the full fee for a PMA, the most involved type of application for device manufacturers. The base fee for device manufacturers' applications to the FDA increased annually from $154,000 in FY2003 to $281,600 in FY2007. MDUFA 2007 maintained the concept of assigning percentages of the base fee to different types of submissions. H.R. 2900 would retain a provision related to adjusting premarket notification fees annually. FDA is required to reduce fees in following years if collections exceed a certain amount. MDUFMA requires FDA to reduce fees in a subsequent year if collections exceed the authorized amount, without a provision to increase fees if collections fall short. MDUFA 2007 allows FDA to aggregate fees collected from FY2008 to FY2011 and make reductions only if the total exceeds the authorized amount. Certain devices, sponsors, and activities qualify for fee exceptions, with small businesses charged a reduced rate. These fee adjustments aim to provide financial stability for the FDA. Exemptions and refunds under MDUFMA and MDUFA 2007 are explained. MDUFA 2007 expands small business fee reduction and allows partial refunds for withdrawal of a specific type of PMA. Humanitarian Use Devices (HUDs) are exempt from MDUFMA fees, intended for diseases affecting fewer than 4,000 individuals in the US annually to incentivize device development. Devices for treatment or diagnosis of diseases in specific populations can be exempt from fees under certain conditions. Pediatric devices are exempt from fees, and applications from government entities may also be exempt. H.R. 2900 would extend exemptions to Indian tribes. S. 1082 does not include Indian tribes in the definition of government entities for fee exemptions. Further manufacturing use products are exempt from fees to avoid multiple charges for single devices with multiple components. FDA has accredited third parties to review 510(k) submissions for efficiency, with no FDA fee assessed for reviews by accredited third parties. Small businesses with annual gross sales of $30 million or less qualify for fee waivers or lower rates for medical device applications. In 2006, 95% of companies that paid MDUFMA fees were small businesses with revenues at or below $30 million. In 2006, 95% of companies paying MDUFMA fees had revenues at or below $30 million. MDUFA 2007 would no longer consider assets of partners and parent firms in small business qualification, reducing application fees for small businesses. Under MDUFA 2007, companies would pay reduced fees for submitting 510(k) and PMA applications to the FDA. Small businesses would receive fee waivers for their first PMA submission, and foreign businesses could qualify for small business fees. Modular PMA refunds would be available if a manufacturer chooses to withdraw their application before FDA takes action. The Secretary would have sole authority over refund decisions. Under MDUFA 2007, FDA fees are used for specific purposes to expedite medical device reviews. The payment of fees does not influence FDA's final decisions. User fee revenues may support reviewer training, with FDA providing annual summaries. MDUFMA set performance goals for FDA, which included fee collection and training support. MDUFMA set performance goals for FDA, summarized in the FDA Commitment Letter and included in the FFDCA. FDA is on track to meet most MDUFMA goals by October 1, 2007. For MDUFA 2007, FDA proposes more rigorous goals building on previous progress, considering efficiencies gained through training, staff expertise, outside experts, and IT improvements. The MDUFMA and MDUFA legislation set performance goals for FDA to track and manage device review processes. FDA consults with various groups, publishes recommendations, allows for public comments, and revises recommendations based on feedback. The goals aim to complete specific activities within set timeframes, with flexibility for different types of applications. S. 1082 requires revisions to recommendations based on public comments, transmittal of recommendations to Congress, and inclusion of consultation requirements in the FFDCA. FDA will report quarterly on progress towards meeting goals and track total time for all submission types. Annual de-identified review performance data will be provided for branches with shortest and longest review times for different types of submissions. Accredited third-party inspections were introduced in MDUFMA. Accredited third-party inspections were introduced in MDUFMA to reduce the burden on FDA inspectors. FDA is required to inspect certain domestic establishments where medical devices are manufactured at least once every two years, but GAO reports that this requirement is not being met. As of October 31, 2006, 16 organizations had received FDA accreditation to conduct third-party inspections, with two organizations already conducting independent inspections. Between March 11, 2004, and October 31, 2006, accredited organizations conducted a small percentage of inspections alongside FDA officials as part of training. Factors influencing manufacturers' interest in requesting inspections include incentives to reduce the number of inspections. The FDA Agreement aims to change the third-party accredited person inspection program to provide incentives for manufacturers to participate, such as reducing the number of inspections and controlling scheduling. However, potential disincentives include bearing the cost of inspections and uncertainty about the consequences. Some manufacturers may defer participation until specific accredited organizations are cleared by the FDA to conduct independent inspections. The proposed changes are intended to increase the quantity of useful compliance information about medical devices. The FDA Agreement aims to streamline the third-party accredited person inspection program to increase compliance information about medical devices. Changes include reducing administrative burdens and expanding participation by allowing firms to use third parties for an unlimited number of inspections.

Changes include reducing administrative burdens and expanding participation by allowing firms to use third parties for an unlimited number of inspections. Device companies can voluntarily submit reports by third parties assessing conformance with international quality standards, influencing FDA inspection priorities. Reprocessed SUDs vary in complexity, from simple external use items to invasive devices like cardiac catheters. Before MDUFMA, some single-use devices were reprocessed in-house by hospitals or specialized companies, raising concerns about infection risks and device malfunction. FDA regulations varied based on device class, with Class I and II reprocessors needing a 510(k) and Class III reprocessors requiring premarket approval. MDUFMA eliminated exemptions for certain devices previously not subject to regulation. MDUFMA required reprocessors to submit 510(k)s with validation data for previously exempt devices. Reprocessors of Class III devices needed to submit a premarket report to FDA. MDUFSA added requirements for single-use devices to be labeled with manufacturer information. MDUFA 2007 focused on establishment fees for SUD reprocessors and required annual reports. MDUFA 2007 and H.R. 2900 require annual reports and postmarket surveillance funding. MDUFMA mandates progress reports on fee-related goals and fee collection. S. 1082 continues these requirements but focuses on previous cohorts. S. 1082 would require the inclusion of information on previous cohorts without complete responses on device premarket applications. It also mandates public availability of performance goal and implementation reports. Unlike MDUFMA, S. 1082 writes report requirements into the FFDCA. MDUFMA had provisions for postmarket reviews, including additional appropriations for surveillance, which were not funded. MDUFMA focused on premarket review activities, limiting the use of funds to this area. Questions arose about the impact on postmarket and enforcement activities. Measuring this impact is complex. A decline in warning letters coincided with MDUFMA, but causation is not proven. The recent decline in warning letters is attributed to a policy change related to the Mammography Quality Standards Act. H.R. 2900 introduces new requirements for postmarket safety and authorizes additional appropriations for collecting and evaluating postmarket safety information on medical devices. It also defines nosocomial infection and mandates a study on infections related to medical devices. S. 1082 does not have similar provisions. MDUFMA contained provisions not raised in MDUFA 2007 proposals, including coordination of review for combination products, electronic labeling for prescription devices in healthcare facilities, revocation of sunset provision for intended use based on labeling, modular review of PMAs, new provisions for pediatric devices, reports on breast implants by GAO and NIH, identification of device manufacturer on the device, and other topics not covered in the FDA Agreement. The FDA Agreement proposes an interactive review process to facilitate timely completion of reviews by preventing delays, avoiding surprises, minimizing review cycles, and ensuring timely responses from sponsors. FDA will continue to develop guidance documents. The FDA Agreement proposes developing guidance documents for efficient regulation of diagnostic imaging devices used with diagnostic drug products. This includes ensuring timely and effective review and consistent postmarket regulation. FDA proposes to publish draft guidance by the end of FY2008 for diagnostic imaging devices used with approved imaging contrast agents and/or radiopharmaceuticals. A 90-day public comment period will be allowed, with a final guidance issued within one year. The FDA Agreement also includes exploring ways to clarify regulatory requirements and reduce regulatory burden for IVD devices. Additionally, the FDA proposes drafting or revising guidance on various clinical trial and testing issues. The FDA is considering a program to streamline the review processes for 510(k) and CLIA waiver applications, involving voluntary industry participants. They will track and report FDA performance on CLIA waiver applications and evaluate whether user fees and performance goals for CLIA waivers should be considered for MDUFA 2007I. Additionally, they will review a list of low-risk IVD devices to determine if any could be exempted from premarket requirements.
