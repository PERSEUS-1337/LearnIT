The Domestic Pet Turtle Market Access Act of 2007 cites findings related to the ban on pet turtles smaller than 10.2 centimeters in diameter since 1975 due to health concerns. The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale of other reptiles carrying salmonella bacteria, and advancements in technology allow for treatments to nearly eradicate salmonella from turtles. University research has shown that turtles can be treated to prevent salmonella, allowing for safe raising, shipping, and distribution. Pet owners can also follow a treatment regimen to keep turtles safe from salmonella. The FDA should permit the sale of turtles under 10.2 centimeters as pets if sellers use proven methods to treat for salmonella. The FDA should permit the sale of baby turtles under 10.2 centimeters as pets if sellers use proven methods to treat for salmonella. The FDA will not restrict the sale of turtles under 10.2 centimeters if raised, shipped, and sold using salmonella safety standards comparable to other animals, with an approved compliance plan, and a disclosure to the buyer. The sale of turtles requires disclosure to the buyer about dangers, proper handling, and treatment to prevent illness, especially for at-risk individuals like children and pregnant women susceptible to salmonella bacteria. Proper hygiene practices, such as handwashing after handling a turtle, are essential. The buyer must be informed about how to keep the turtle safe from salmonella, including proper treatment methods and where to purchase necessary items. Additionally, buyers should not abandon turtles but return them to a pet seller or organization. The Food and Drug Administration requires turtle farmers or sellers to submit a plan detailing how they will ensure compliance with regulations, including the use of non-antibiotic compounds to suppress salmonella in turtle hatchlings. The FDA must accept or reject the plan within 30 days, providing clear reasons for any rejections. The FDA may reject a plan if it doesn't meet salmonella safety standards for turtles compared to other animals or food products. This section does not allow the FDA to impose stricter standards on selling small turtles as pets."
