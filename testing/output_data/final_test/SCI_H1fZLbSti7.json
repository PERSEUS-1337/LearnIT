    "content": "We propose a software framework based on the Learning-Compression algorithm for compressing neural networks using various mechanisms like pruning and quantization. The framework separates the learning of the neural net from the compression of its parameters, allowing for easy extension to different combinations. It offers advantages such as integration with deep learning frameworks, efficient training, competitive performance, and convergence guarantees. The toolkit, written in Python and Pytorch, will be available for community contributions. Research in neural network compression techniques has emerged due to the success of neural networks in various fields. Many ad-hoc solutions have been proposed for compression, such as binarization, quantization, pruning, and low-rank tensor factorization. However, the challenge lies in determining the best type of compression for a given network. The ongoing efforts focus on building a software implementation based on the LC algorithm for easy and effective model compression. The framework, written in Python and Pytorch, handles various forms of compression and deep net models. It will be made available online as open source for researchers and developers to contribute. Model compression is defined as finding a low-dimensional parameterization of a previously trained model with the goal of achieving optimal loss. Compression and decompression are viewed as mathematical mappings in parameter space, with the aim of mapping a low-dimensional parameterization to an uncompressed model. The compression mapping \u03a0(w) finds the best lossy compression of the uncompressed model in the \u2113 2 sense, independent of the loss, training set, and task. The LC algorithm defines a continuous path that converges to a stationary point of the constrained problem as the penalty parameter \u00b5 increases. The LC algorithm defines a path that converges to a stationary point of the constrained problem as the penalty parameter \u00b5 increases. The L step can be solved by stochastic gradient descent, with compression mappings assuming specific structures like low-rank compression or pruning. The LC algorithm defines a path that converges to a stationary point of the constrained problem as the penalty parameter \u00b5 increases. A compression view data structure is defined for specific structures like low-rank compression or pruning. An implementation of L-step in Python function minimizes L(w) with penalty terms, independent of compression, and can be re-used for other compression tasks."
