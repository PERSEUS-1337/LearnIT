    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 69432.7 of the Education Code defines key terms related to academic years, access costs, award years, college grade point averages, and the Student Aid Commission. The Student Aid Commission defines key terms such as enrollment status, expected family contribution, and part- or full-time status for Cal Grant eligibility. The Student Aid Commission defines terms like high school grade point average and instructional program requirements for Cal Grant eligibility. High school GPA is calculated based on academic coursework from sophomore year to summer following junior year, excluding certain courses. Instructional program must result in degree or certificate with at least 24 semester units or eligibility for transfer to a baccalaureate program. The \"Instructional program of not less than two academic years\" must result in an associate or baccalaureate degree requiring at least 48 semester units or eligibility for transfer to a baccalaureate degree program. \"Maximum household income and asset levels\" are defined for participants in the Cal Grant Program based on income and asset ceiling amounts. The Cal Grant Program sets income and asset ceilings based on family size for Cal Grant A, C, and T, as well as Cal Grant B. Independent students with dependents have different income limits. For example, a family size of two has an income ceiling of $57,600 for Cal Grant A, C, and T, and $26,900 for Cal Grant B. Independent students without dependents have lower income limits. Independent students with dependents other than a spouse have an income ceiling of $49,600 for Cal Grant programs. The commission adjusts maximum household income and asset levels annually based on the cost of living. Renewing recipients have their levels adjusted or kept at initial award levels. Applicants qualifying for the simplified needs test under federal law are considered. Before disbursing Cal Grant funds, qualifying institutions must resolve any data conflicts related to individual students. Students meeting the simplified needs test for federal student assistance are presumed to meet the asset level test. A \"qualifying institution\" is a California private postsecondary educational institution that participates in the Pell Grant Program and at least two other federal student aid programs. A nonprofit institution in California must allocate 10% of its budget for student financial aid grants, be accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and meet state criteria to be eligible for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program. California public postsecondary educational institutions also qualify. California public postsecondary educational institutions must provide information on where to access California license examination passage rates for recent graduates of undergraduate programs leading to licensure-required employment. This information should be available on the institution's website or other relevant platforms for prospective students. The institution must certify compliance with requirements to the commission. The commission will certify the institution's latest three-year cohort default rate and graduation rate by November 1 each year. Graduation rate is the percentage of full-time, first-time degree-seeking students who graduate within 150% of the expected time. For the 2011-12 academic year, institutions with a cohort default rate of 24.6% or higher are ineligible for Cal Grant awards. For the 2012-13 academic year and beyond, institutions with a cohort default rate of 15.5% or higher are also ineligible. However, institutions can regain eligibility by meeting specified requirements. If the US Department of Education corrects an institution's default rate or graduation rate, and it now meets requirements, the institution regains eligibility for Cal Grant. Institutions without reported rates are provisionally eligible until reported. For the 2012-13 academic year and beyond, institutions with a graduation rate of 30% or less are ineligible for Cal Grant awards, except under certain conditions. This rule does not apply to institutions where 40% or less of undergraduate students borrow federal student loans. Notwithstanding certain conditions, qualifying institutions with a low cohort default rate and high graduation rate may be eligible for Cal Grant awards through 2016-17. The commission will notify students attending ineligible institutions about their Cal Grant eligibility. The institution must notify renewal Cal Grant recipients attending ineligible institutions about potential award reductions. They must also provide a list of eligible institutions for Cal Grant awards and establish an appeal process for qualifying institutions that fail to meet certain requirements. The commission may grant an appeal for an academic year if the institution has a cohort size of 20 individuals or less and the cohort is not representative of the overall institutional performance. \"Satisfactory academic progress\" is defined by criteria required by federal standards, and the commission may adopt regulations consistent with those standards."
