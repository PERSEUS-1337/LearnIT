    "content": "Learning to learn is a powerful paradigm for enabling models to learn from data more effectively and efficiently. This paper explores meta-learning from the perspective of universality, comparing recurrent models to newer approaches that embed gradient descent into the meta-learner. The study aims to determine if deep representation combined with standard gradient descent can approximate any learning algorithm. In experiments, gradient-based meta-learning outperforms recurrent models in generalization. Meta-learning optimizes for a learning algorithm that acquires effective representations, going beyond neural networks optimizing for representations. Common approaches involve training a recurrent model to output learner model parameters or predictions for test examples. Recent work has proposed model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) which optimizes for the initial parameters of the learner model using gradient descent. This approach incorporates prior knowledge about gradient-based learning and has shown to outperform recurrent models in generalization. Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) improves statistical efficiency by optimizing initial parameters through gradient descent. However, a question arises about the loss of representational power compared to learning the update rule. This paper aims to determine if learning initial parameters alone is as effective as more expressive meta-learners that directly use training data at meta-test time. The study compares the representational capacity of MAML and recurrent meta-learners, finding that both have similar theoretical power when using deep learning models. This suggests that there is no disadvantage in using MAML over a black-box meta-learner like a recurrent network. The study compares the benefits of using MAML over other approaches by analyzing the effect of continuing optimization on MAML performance. It shows that MAML's initializations are resilient to overfitting on small datasets and are better suited for extrapolation beyond tasks seen during meta-training. The universal function approximation theorem states that a neural network with one hidden layer of finite width can approximate any continuous function on compact subsets of R n up to arbitrary precision. This theorem holds for a range of activation functions, including the sigmoid and ReLU functions. A universal function approximator (UFA) is a neural network with a single hidden layer that can approximate any function and its derivatives. Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) aims to learn initial parameters for effective generalization on tasks with minimal data. Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) enables effective generalization on various tasks by meta-training on a wide range of tasks and quickly adapting to new tasks through gradient descent. It is compatible with different neural network architectures and loss functions, with some architectural choices improving its performance. A modification introduced by Finn et al. (2017b) involves concatenating a vector of parameters, \u03b8 b, to the input, known as a bias transformation. This enhances the error gradient's expressive power without altering the model's expressivity. RNN-based meta-learning methods can be classified into two categories, with a meta-learner model g with parameters \u03c6 in the first approach. The meta-learner g processes dataset D and new input x to estimate output \u0177. It can be a recurrent model that is maximally expressive. Another approach involves a meta-learner g that updates learner model parameters \u03b8 based on dataset D and current weights \u03b8. The learner model then predicts output \u0177 for test input x. The meta-learning process involves a meta-learner that operates on order-invariant features to produce permutation-invariant functions of the dataset. In model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), standard gradient descent is used to update the learner's weights for predicting output \u0177. The meta-learning process in MAML involves using standard gradient descent to update the learner's weights for predicting output \u0177. RNN approaches can approximate any update rule, making them as expressive as gradient descent. It is unclear if the MAML update imposes constraints on learning procedures that can be acquired. The study defines a universal learning procedure approximator as a learner that can approximate any function of training datapoints and test points. The UFA theorem shows how f MAML can approximate any function on test points, but it is uncertain if it can represent any function of input-output pairs in the training dataset. The paper aims to demonstrate that f MAML is a universal function approximator in one-shot and K-shot learning scenarios, invariant to permutation of datapoints. It discusses meta supervised learning with discrete and continuous labels, exploring the universality of gradient-based meta-learning for one training point. The paper demonstrates that a neural network function can approximate any target function with arbitrary precision using a meta-learning algorithm. The proof holds for a multi-layer ReLU network with sufficient depth, using standard loss functions like cross-entropy and mean-squared error. The function f is constructed to control information flow from input and output, making it a universal function approximator. The paper shows that a deep ReLU network can approximate any function with precision using a meta-learning algorithm. By sequencing multiple weight matrices, a rank-N update to the linear function can be achieved. Deep ReLU networks behave like deep linear networks under certain conditions. The paper demonstrates that a deep ReLU network can approximate any function precisely through a meta-learning algorithm. By incorporating linear layers with non-negative input and pre-synaptic activations, the model simplifies the analysis. The model consists of an input feature extractor, linear weight matrices, and an output function, all represented by fully connected neural networks. The paper shows that a deep ReLU network can approximate any function precisely using a meta-learning algorithm. Linear layers with non-negative input and activations simplify the model analysis. The model includes an input feature extractor, linear weight matrices, and an output function represented by fully connected neural networks. The post-update prediction and error gradient are derived, with a focus on the gradient with respect to each weight matrix. The goal is to demonstrate that the model can approximate any function of (x, y, x) with the right settings. The paper demonstrates that a deep ReLU network can approximate any function using a meta-learning algorithm. It focuses on controlling information flow from x, y, and x by decomposing weight matrices and error gradients into three parts. The model aims to approximate any function of (x, y, x) with the right settings. The paper shows that weight matrices can be simplified to achieve a specific form for z. The weight matrices are defined to ensure non-negative activations in a deep network with ReLU nonlinearities. The function f out is defined to propagate information about the label y during training and a different function is defined for test inputs. The paper discusses the simplification of weight matrices to achieve a specific form for z in a neural network. It focuses on the function f out to propagate label information during training and a different function for test inputs. The goal is to show that the function f (x ; \u03b8 ) is a universal learning algorithm approximator. The paper discusses simplifying weight matrices for z in a neural network, focusing on functions for training and testing. It introduces DISPLAYFORM11 as a kernel with RKHS defined by B i\u03c6 (x; \u03b8 ft , \u03b8 b ). Lemma 4.1 states that \u03b8 ft , \u03b8 h , {A i ; i > 1}, {B i ; i < N } can approximate any continuous function of (x, y, x ) on compact subsets of R dim(y) using Equation 7. The paper introduces a neural network structure using indicator functions and bias transformation variables to represent any function of (x, y, x). The neural network structure decouples forward and backward information flow, allowing for the imposition of any desired post-update function. The neural network structure introduced in the paper decouples forward and backward information flow, allowing for the imposition of any desired post-update function, even in the face of adversarial training datasets and loss functions. A simpler architecture may suffice if the inner loss function and training dataset are not chosen adversarially and the error gradient points in the direction of improvement. This implies that a deep representation combined with a single gradient step can approximate any one-shot learning algorithm. In the K-shot setting, MAML can approximate any permutation invariant function of a dataset and test datapoint for K > 1 by updating parameters according to a specific rule. The post-update function can be manipulated to approximate any function that is invariant to the ordering of training datapoints. In the K-shot setting, MAML can approximate any permutation invariant function of a dataset and test datapoint for K > 1 by updating parameters according to a specific rule. The post-update function can be manipulated to approximate any function that is invariant to the ordering of training datapoints. It is possible to select settings for variables such as \u03c6, A, and B to discretize x and obtain frequency counts of the data points. The vector z can fully describe the data without loss of information, allowing for approximation of any continuous function. The equation resembles a kernel-based function approximator, and a more efficient universality proof can be derived from this premise. A deep representation combined with gradient descent can approximate any learning algorithm, with specific requirements for the loss function to ensure the results hold. The main requirement for the label to be recoverable from the loss gradient is outlined in the current section. The pre-update function is defined by back-propagating information about the label(s) to the learner. The error gradient with respect to z must be able to represent any linear function of the label y. To achieve this, a loss function is needed where the gradient is a linear function of y, making y recoverable from the loss function's gradient. The standard mean-squared error and softmax cross entropy losses allow for the universality of gradient-based meta-learning by ensuring the recoverability of y from the loss function's gradient. Other popular loss functions like the 1 and hinge losses are not universally applicable due to their piecewise constant gradients, which do not allow for the recovery of the label. Recurrent meta-learners like BID0 may lose information when using gradient as input. The study aims to compare the inductive bias of gradient-based and recurrent meta-learners, and investigate the role of model depth in gradient-based meta-learning for increased expressive power. The study compares gradient-based and recurrent metalearners to explore their differences in few-shot learning performance. It aims to determine if a learner trained with MAML can improve from additional gradient steps at test time without overfitting, and if gradient descent enables better performance on tasks outside the training distribution. The comparison shows that MAML achieves good test accuracy without overfitting, unlike networks trained from scratch. In the study, two simple few-shot learning domains are considered: 5-shot regression on sine curves and 1-shot character classification using the Omniglot dataset. State-of-the-art meta-learning models SNAIL and metanetworks are compared, along with a task-conditioned model. The task-conditioned model can be fine-tuned on new data using gradient descent, similar to MAML. The model can be fine-tuned on new data using gradient descent, but is not trained for few-shot adaptation. Experimental details are included in Appendix G. Results show that a MAML-learned initialization trained for fast adaption in 5 steps can further improve beyond 5 gradient steps, especially on out-of-distribution tasks. A task-conditioned model trained without MAML can easily overfit to out-of-distribution tasks. With the Omniglot dataset, a MAML model trained with 5 inner gradient steps can be fine-tuned for 100 gradient steps without drop in test accuracy. A randomly initialized model trained from scratch quickly reaches perfect training accuracy but overfits massively to the 20 examples. In comparing MAML with state-of-the-art recurrent meta-learners, all three methods performed similarly within the distribution of training tasks for 5-way 1-shot Omniglot classification and 5-shot sinusoid regression. MAML showed better generalization in distinguishing digits with varying shearing or scaling amounts and in extrapolated sinusoid amplitudes and phases. Results suggest that deep gradient-based meta-learners are as powerful as recurrent meta-learners in learning strategies. The text discusses how deep gradient-based meta-learners are as powerful as recurrent meta-learners in learning strategies, especially in scenarios with domain shift between meta-training and meta-testing tasks. Theoretical proofs suggest that deeper representations in gradient descent lead to more expressive learning procedures. The empirical exploration aims to determine if model-agnostic meta-learning requires deeper representations for good performance compared to the depth needed to solve the underlying tasks. Figure 5 shows the comparison of depth in models with a fixed number of parameters. Task-conditioned models benefit from one hidden layer, while meta-learning with MAML benefits from additional depth. The study involves a regression problem with polynomial functions and varying network depths from 1 to 5 hidden layers. The study involved comparing the depth of models with a fixed number of parameters. Task-conditioned models benefit from one hidden layer, while meta-learning with MAML benefits from additional depth, as shown in Figure 5. The study shows that MAML performs better with increased depth despite having a fixed model capacity. Deep neural networks with initial weights and gradient descent can approximate any learning algorithm. MAML's learning strategies are more successful for out-of-domain tasks compared to recurrent learners, and its representations are resistant to overfitting. Gradient-based meta-learning offers practical benefits without theoretical drawbacks. The study highlights the practical benefits of gradient-based meta-learning without theoretical downsides. It formalizes the ability of a meta-learner to approximate any learning algorithm in terms of representing functions of the dataset and test inputs. This perspective on the learning-to-learn problem aims to stimulate further research and discussion. The lemma states that the function DISPLAYFORM0 can approximate any continuous function on compact subsets of R dim(y). By choosing specific parameters, the function can approximate any function of x, x, and y. Re-indexing using variables j and l, a form of k jl is defined in Equation 8. The function k jl is defined in Equation 8, and in the next section, we show how to acquire this form. By choosing specific parameters, we can define \u03b8 ft and B jl such that the function contains complete information about (x, x , y). The post-update function is then determined as described in DISPLAYFORM3. The post-update function is determined by choosing specific parameters \u03b8 ft and B jl to contain complete information about (x, x , y). This function is a universal function approximator with respect to its inputs (x, x , y) and can be decoded from the vector \u2212\u03b1v(x, x , y). The proof of Lemma A.1 involves choosing \u03b8 ft and B jl such that certain conditions are met. The post-update function is a universal function approximator with parameters \u03b8 ft and B jl chosen to contain complete information about (x, x , y). The lemma proof involves selecting \u03b8 b = 0 and defining \u03c6 and B jl accordingly. This allows for simplification of the form of z in Equation 1. The post-update function is a universal function approximator with parameters \u03b8 ft and B jl chosen to contain complete information about (x, x , y). The lemma proof involves selecting \u03b8 b = 0 and defining \u03c6 and B jl accordingly. This allows for simplification of the form of z in Equation 1. The top components, W i and \u03c6, have equal dimensions, as do the middle components, W i and 0, with the bottom components being scalars. z is made up of three components denoted as z, z, and \u017e, where z = N i=1W i\u03c6 (x; \u03b8 ft ), z = 0, and \u017e = 0. The error gradient components can be set as any linear function of y. By controlling the backward and forward information flow independently, simplification of the form is achieved. In this appendix, a full proof is provided for the universality of gradient-based meta-learning in the general case with K > 1 datapoints. The aim is to show that a deep representation combined with one step of gradient descent can approximate any permutation invariant function of a dataset and test datapoint for K > 1. The proof involves constructing a neural network function that approximates the target function up to arbitrary precision. The loss function used is the standard cross-entropy and mean-squared error. The proof presented in this appendix demonstrates the universality of gradient-based meta-learning with K > 1 datapoints. It shows that a deep representation combined with one gradient step can approximate any permutation invariant function of a dataset and test datapoint. The constructed neural network function utilizes standard cross-entropy and mean-squared error loss functions for optimization. The extractor and readout function can be represented by fully connected neural networks with hidden layers, which act like linear networks under certain conditions. The post-update prediction function is derived, and the gradient with respect to the loss is denoted. The post-update value is calculated for a single datapoint, disregarding the last term. The post-update value of z when x is provided as input into f(\u00b7; \u03b8) is calculated, disregarding higher order terms for simplicity. The goal is to show that f(x, \u03b8) can approximate any function of {(x, y)k}, x by controlling information flow from {xk}, {yk}, and x through multiplexing. The text discusses decomposing W i, \u03c6, and the error gradient into three parts, constructing components z k, e(y k), and \u011b(y k), simplifying the form of f(x, \u03b8), and the connection to kernels for notation convenience. This is done to show how f(x, \u03b8) can approximate any function of {(x, y)k}, x by controlling information flow through multiplexing. The text discusses constructing a neural network structure that can approximate any continuous function of {(x, y)k}, x on compact subsets of R dim(y) by introducing bias transformation variables and asymmetry in the function representation. It shows that the post-update function f(x; \u03b8) can take a specific form to approximate any function of {(x, y)k; k \u2208 1...K} and x. The text discusses constructing a neural network structure that can approximate any continuous function of {(x, y)k}, x on compact subsets of R dim(y) by introducing bias transformation variables and asymmetry in the function representation. It shows that the post-update function f(x; \u03b8) can take a specific form to approximate any function of {(x, y)k; k \u2208 1...K} and x. The proof involves re-indexing the summation and defining indicator functions to choose \u03b8 and B variables accordingly. The text discusses constructing a neural network structure that can approximate any continuous function of {(x, y)k}, x on compact subsets of R dim(y) by introducing bias transformation variables and asymmetry in the function representation. It shows that the post-update function f(x; \u03b8) can take a specific form to approximate any function of {(x, y)k; k \u2208 1...K} and x. The proof involves re-indexing the summation and defining indicator functions to choose \u03b8 and B variables accordingly. The one-hot discretization of input and linear function for stacked copies of y k are defined using matrices A jl and e(y k ). The post-update function is derived for discrete one-shot labels y k and continuous labels. The text discusses constructing a neural network structure that can approximate any continuous function of {(x, y)k}, x on compact subsets of R dim(y) by introducing bias transformation variables and asymmetry in the function representation. It shows that the post-update function f(x; \u03b8) can take a specific form to approximate any function of {(x, y)k; k \u2208 1...K} and x. The proof involves re-indexing the summation and defining indicator functions to choose \u03b8 and B variables accordingly. The one-hot discretization of input and linear function for stacked copies of y k are defined using matrices A jl and e(y k ). The post-update function is derived for discrete one-shot labels y k and continuous labels. In the setting with continuous labels, frequency counts of the triplets (x k , x , y k ) cannot be attained, as there is no access to a discretized version of the label. The assumption is made that no two datapoints share the same input value x k, allowing the summation over v to contain the output values y k at the index corresponding to the value of (x k , x ). The network architecture with linear layers analyzed in Sections 4 and 5 can be represented by a deep network with ReLU nonlinearities. The deep network with ReLU nonlinearities analyzed in Sections 4 and 5 can be represented by showing that the input and activations within the linear layers are all non-negative. The input consists of three terms, with the top term being a non-negative discretization. The weight matrices need to show that the products are positive semi-definite. Each B i = M i+1 is defined to be positive definite. The weight matrices in the deep network are defined to be positive definite, ensuring non-negative gradients for input \u03b8 b. The gradient of the standard mean-squared error objective is a linear, invertible function of y, enabling better generalization through gradient descent. The gradient descent enables better generalization on out-of-distribution tasks compared to recurrent meta-learners like SNAIL. A MAML-learned initialization shows resilience to overfitting, even after 100 gradient steps. Theorem 6.2 states that the gradient of the softmax cross entropy loss with respect to pre-softmax logits is a linear, invertible function of y. The gradient of the softmax cross-entropy loss function with one-hot labels is a linear, invertible function of y. This allows for the universality of gradient-based meta-learning, as demonstrated through comparisons on out-of-distribution tasks and additional gradient steps. Experimental details for Omniglot meta-learning methods are also provided. The model architectures and hyperparameters were consistent across all methods, with 4 convolutional layers, 64 filters, batch normalization, and ReLU nonlinearities. Specific hyperparameter choices varied by algorithm. For MAML in the sinusoid domain, a fully-connected network with two hidden layers was used, trained for 70,000 meta-iterations. For SNAIL in the sinusoid domain, the model consisted of 2 blocks with 4 dilated convolutions. The model architectures and hyperparameters were consistent across all methods, with 4 convolutional layers, 64 filters, batch normalization, and ReLU nonlinearities. The final layer is a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution to the output. The models were trained to convergence for 70,000 iterations using Adam with default hyperparameters. Evaluation was done for 1200 trials for MAML and SNAIL models, and 600 trials for MetaNet model, reporting mean and 95% confidence intervals. The Omniglot images were downsampled to 28 \u00d7 28 as per prior work. The models were trained for 70,000 iterations with varying numbers of hidden units per layer. Using more than 20,000 hidden units in a single layer resulted in poor performance, so a model with 1 hidden layer and 250 units was used instead. Each model was trained three times, and the results were reported as the mean and standard deviation of the three runs."
