    "content": "The term wildfire is defined as an unplanned, unwanted wildland fire, including lightning-caused fires, unauthorized human-caused fires, and escaped prescribed fire projects. States are responsible for responding to wildfires that begin on nonfederal lands, while the federal government is responsible for responding to wildfires that begin on federal lands. The Forest Service manages wildfire response across the National Forest System, and the Department of the Interior manages wildfire response for national parks, wildlife refuges, Indian reservations, and other public lands. Wildfire suppression involves extinguishing or confining wildfires, with federal policy generally aiming to suppress wildfires. The federal government's primary responsibility for wildfire suppression is to protect lives, property, and resources on federal lands. They also have responsibilities for preventing future catastrophic fires by reducing hazardous fuels and providing assistance to states, local governments, and communities to protect nonfederal lands. FEMA may provide disaster relief to state and local governments and individuals if a major disaster declaration is issued. Since 2001, an average of 72,112 wildfires have burned 6.7 million acres annually, almost double the late 1990s average. In 2015, over 68,000 wildfires burned 10.1 million acres, with more than half in Alaska. In 2015, more than half of the acres burned were in Alaska, exceeding the total acreage burned in the state over the previous five years. In 2016, 1,251 wildfires were classified as \"large or significant\" and 19 wildfires exceeded 40,000 acres in size. 54% of the nationwide acreage burned by wildfires in 2016 was on federal lands. Fires on federal land are larger but fewer in number compared to nonfederal land, especially in the West. In 2016, less than one-third of fires burned 60% of federal acreage. In the East, most fires and acreage burned occurred on nonfederal lands. Acreage burned is not a sole indicator of wildfire severity or ecosystem damage. Other factors like intensity and severity of wildfires are also considered. The National Fire Preparedness Levels (PLs) indicate the level of nationwide resource mobilization for wildfires. Over the past 10 years, PL5 was reached for an average of nine days annually. In 2016, 14 days were spent at PL4 and zero at PL5. The wildland-urban interface (WUI) is where structures are near vegetated wildlands, posing a risk for wildfires. Over one-third of US housing developments are now in the WUI. In the United States, all housing developments are now within the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), with nearly 900,000 homes in the West at high risk of wildfire damage. There are differing opinions on how much the federal government should pay to protect these resources. Federal wildland fire guidance prioritizes firefighter safety and protecting values at risk, without requiring economic efficiency. Some see this policy as allowing flexibility for a high-quality emergency response, while others have concerns. Federal wildfire suppression spending is influenced by factors like fire size, intensity, and proximity to valuable resources, increasing costs and risks for firefighters. Concerns arose in the 2000s about the federal government bearing too much of the wildfire cost, leading to a lack of incentive for state, local, and private landowners to mitigate fire risk. The federal government modified cost-share agreements with states to address fire risk and suppression costs. Initiatives were launched to enhance community preparedness and homeowner protections. Recent debates focus on fiscal concerns rather than federal share of suppression costs. Federal assistance is provided for wildfires on nonfederal lands in various forms. The federal government provides assistance for wildfires on nonfederal lands through technical and financial programs, as well as direct response services under cooperative agreements. These agreements allow for resource sharing between federal and state partners during wildfire seasons, with costs reimbursed based on specified methods in the master agreement. The National Interagency Coordination Center at the National Interagency Fire Center coordinates and allocates resources for a coordinated interagency response. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) coordinates and allocates resources at a national level, while Geographic Area Coordination Centers do so at regional levels. Federal land management agencies provide fire protection and assistance programs, with FEMA also offering aid during wildfires. FEMA considers wildfires as eligible events under the Stafford Act, with 27 major disaster declarations related to wildfires from 1953-2014. Wildfires on federal lands are ineligible for Stafford Act assistance until they affect state, local, and private lands. Declarations can provide assistance when fires threaten state and private lands. A major disaster can be declared if a wildfire starts on state lands and poses various threats. The most common authority for fighting wildfires under the Stafford Act is Section 420 for \"Fire Management Assistance.\" Section 420 of the Stafford Act allows the President to declare a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) for financial aid to states when a fire is out of control. Governors can request an FMAG verbally at any time for assistance with equipment, personnel, and grants to manage fires on public or private land. Grants can cover up to 75% of suppression costs for eligible fires. The number of Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) declarations has increased in recent years, reaching a high of 114 in 2011, surpassing the previous high of 86 in 2006. FMAGs are designed to prevent fires from becoming major disasters and may save federal dollars by reducing the need for major disaster declarations. The first FMAG was declared in 1970, with an average of about three per year in the 1970s and 1980s, increasing to about 22 per year in the 1990s. During the 1990s, there were about 22 FMAG declarations per year, increasing to an average of 55 declarations annually from 2000 to 2015. Texas has received the most FMAGs (236), followed by California (153), Oklahoma (87), and Washington (85). The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is used to pay for recovery projects, meet emergency requirements, and serve as a reserve for future incidents. Congress replenishes the DRF through annual and supplemental appropriations when the balance is low. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is funded through annual and supplemental appropriations to replenish the account for major disasters, emergency declarations, and FMAGs. The President's request for base/non-major disasters is based on a 10-year average for non-catastrophic events, while funding for federal wildfire management is provided to both the Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior (DOI). DOI allocates funding to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies. Both DOI and FS receive annual discretionary appropriations. The DOI and FS receive annual discretionary appropriations for wildfire management through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Each agency has a Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account and a Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act (FLAME) account. The FLAME account is a reserve fund for wildfire suppression with specific conditions for fund transfers. The WFM appropriation is divided into fire operations and other fire operations subaccounts, with funds allocated to preparedness and suppression programs. Preparedness funds support fire prevention, detection, equipment, training, and personnel, while suppression funds are used for wildfire response. Appropriations for wildfire management have significantly increased over the past two decades, with annual appropriations averaging $1.6 billion from FY1994 to FY2000 and $3.7 billion since FY2001. Total annual wildfire appropriations have ranged from $2.8 billion in FY2012 to $5.0 billion in FY2008. The FY2016 appropriation of $4.9 billion was the second-largest to date. The rising cost of wildfire management, combined with annual spending fluctuations, makes budgeting for future wildfire spending difficult. Analyzing wildfire funding trends over time is challenging due to changes in account structures and the creation of additional accounts and programs. Suppression appropriations are used to fund the control of wildland fires on federal land. Suppression operations fund the control of wildland fires on federal and nonfederal lands, covering firefighter salaries, aviation operations, incident support, and post-wildfire response. Funding comes from two accounts within the WFM and FLAME reserve accounts, with the option to transfer funds if resources are depleted. Congress can also provide emergency or supplemental appropriations for wildfire suppression activities. Suppression activities for wildland fires are funded through various sources including the WFM suppression account, the FLAME account, and supplemental appropriations. Over the past 10 years, FS suppression appropriations averaged $1.40 billion per fiscal year, while DOI suppression appropriations averaged $401 million. These activities have accounted for over half of FS's overall wildfire appropriation and more than a quarter of the agency's total appropriation. Since the establishment of the FLAME account in FY2010, it has provided reserve funds for large or complex fires when suppression accounts are depleted. Structural changes in wildfire accounts within the past five years include the FLAME account and FS reallocating aviation and personnel costs between Suppression and Preparedness programs. Since FY2010, the FLAME accounts have received annual average funding of $394.1 million for FS and $95.2 million for DOI. This accounts for 34% of combined suppression appropriations for FS and 24% for DOI. Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior can transfer funds from FLAME to WFM accounts for suppression activities upon declaration. Criteria for declaration include fire size, threat to lives, property, or resources. Remaining FLAME funds can be transferred to WFM for wildfire response, regardless of fire size or complexity. The FLAME Act allows for funds to be transferred from FLAME accounts to WFM accounts for wildfire suppression activities. Both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture declared FLAME funds available for all fires in 2015 due to exhaustion of their agencies' WFM accounts. The FLAME Act prohibits fire borrowing unless the FLAME account is exhausted. The FS and DOI have both exhausted their FLAME accounts in certain years and transferred funds from other accounts to cover suppression obligations. During active wildfire seasons, agencies may deplete suppression accounts quickly and need to access additional funds. Congress grants FS and DOI the authority to transfer funds from other accounts for federal emergency response activities, known as fire transfers or fire borrowing. This authority is granted annually in appropriations acts, allowing transfers for WFM-related activities since FY1980. The authority for transferring funds for firefighting and emergency rehabilitation was expanded in the FY1989 Interior appropriations law. Funds can be transferred from various accounts when suppression funds are nearly depleted. Both DOI and FS have borrowed from other accounts in the past, typically developing a fire borrowing plan before the wildfire season. Prior to the wildfire season, agencies develop plans to identify accounts and programs that may be targeted for transfers based on unobligated balances. They target programs with large unobligated balances that can be transferred with minimal immediate impact, with the possibility of requesting additional funding from Congress to replenish accounts. Congress often provides supplemental appropriations to repay transferred funds, such as the $700.0 million appropriated to FS in FY2016. The authority to transfer funds for suppression operations is controversial, with $424 million in transferred funds remaining unpaid since FY2002. This flexibility allows for quick response in emergencies but hinders non-fire operations and statutory missions. Efforts to insulate agency appropriations from emergency fire suppression funding intensified in the 110th Congress, leading to the passage of the FLAME Act in the 111th Congress. The intent was to fully fund wildfire suppression needs and prevent borrowing from non-fire programs, but challenges remain. Efforts to prevent borrowing from non-fire programs for wildfire suppression funding have been ongoing since the passage of the FLAME Act in the 111th Congress. Despite this intent, agencies have had to borrow funds from non-fire programs multiple times. Recent legislative proposals aim to address this issue, with Congress facing the decision of reimbursing the accounts from which funding was transferred when wildfire suppression funding is exhausted. Reimbursement may occur through emergency appropriations bills or other legislative vehicles to replenish the suppression or FLAME accounts. Since the FLAME Act in the 111th Congress, efforts to prevent borrowing from non-fire programs for wildfire suppression funding have been ongoing. Congress has provided over $8 billion for emergency wildfire activities for FS and DOI combined in 12 of the 16 fiscal years since FY2001. Supplemental appropriations have been designated to avoid certain budget enforcement limits, with amounts provided in FY2013, FY2014, and FY2016. Since the FLAME Act, efforts to prevent borrowing for wildfire suppression funding have been ongoing. Congress has provided over $8 billion for emergency wildfire activities for FS and DOI in 12 of the 16 fiscal years since FY2001. Supplemental appropriations in FY2013 and FY2014 were subject to budget enforcement. FS and DOI estimate future suppression spending years in advance and formulate budget requests using a rolling average of previous years' suppression spending. The agencies' suppression activity requests and FLAME account requests equaled their rolling 10-year suppression obligation averages from FY2010 to FY2014. The Obama Administration proposed a new funding mechanism for suppression operations from FY2015 to FY2017, which included eliminating the FLAME reserve fund and requesting 70% of the rolling 10-year suppression obligation average for WFM suppression activity. The suppression budget request for a given year is based on the rolling 10-year suppression obligation average calculated two fiscal years previously. The rolling 10-year suppression obligation average may not accurately predict future suppression spending needs during the budget formulation process. It has underestimated suppression spending for both FS and DOI in most of the past 10 fiscal years. GAO noted insufficient forecasting methods when wildfire spending began to increase in the 2000s. In the 2000s, GAO found agencies' forecasting methods inadequate for annual and in-season budgeting. FS and DOI still use a 10-year suppression obligation average for budget requests, despite spending exceeding estimates. Proposed FLAME Act suggested a rolling 5-year average for more accurate predictions, but it was not included in the enacted version. The FLAME Act requires agencies to develop estimates based on the best available science for wildfire suppression spending. FS and DOI use regression models incorporating weather and climate data to forecast spending, published four times per year. The forecasts predict a range of spending within a 90% confidence interval. The estimate for the upper 90% CI ranged from $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion in the March 2014 to May 2014 forecasts for FS. Suppression obligations exceeded the FLAME median forecast five times for FS and four times for DOI in FY2011-FY2016. FLAME forecasts are not used for funding requests, but the Obama Administration's budget requests for suppression have included access to additional funds above the 10-year obligation average. The agencies use out-year and current-year forecasts to inform Congress about potential spending levels for wildfire suppression. Congress last made changes to wildfire spending mechanisms in the 110th Congress with the FLAME Act. The 114th Congress explored funding issues for federal wildland fire management, including wildfire suppression operations. Suppression costs are unpredictable and can vary widely from year to year. The FLAME Act in the 110th Congress aimed to address funding issues for federal wildland fire management, including wildfire suppression operations. Obligations for suppression spending have shown significant fluctuations over the years, making it challenging for Congress to appropriate funds accurately. Despite the creation of FLAME accounts to serve as a reserve fund, agencies have still needed to borrow funds and Congress has provided supplemental appropriations in several instances. The FLAME Act established separate accounts for wildfire suppression funding, based on a 10-year average. However, it did not provide additional funds, creating hurdles for agencies to access funds they previously could. The FLAME Act established separate accounts for wildfire suppression funding based on a 10-year average, but did not provide additional funds, creating hurdles for agencies to access funds they previously could. Suppression costs are not always fully funded in advance, leading to reactive rather than proactive funding. Improved suppression spending forecasts could help alleviate the need for supplemental funds. Federal spending on wildland fire management has increased significantly, with suppression costs rising even during mild wildfire seasons. In 2015, FS and DOI spent $2.1 billion on wildfire suppression, and in 2016, spending increased to $2.2 billion. Congress may consider directing agencies to use different budget formulation methodologies to address the growing costs. In 2016, Congress appropriated more funds for wildfire management, with FS receiving $1.6 billion for suppression activities, an increase of over $600 million from the previous year. DOI received $468.7 million in FY2016, $85 million more than in FY2015. Rising costs of wildfire management and suppression operations are a concern, potentially impacting funding for other agency programs. The increasing costs of wildfire management are affecting funding for other agency programs, potentially reducing future suppression spending. Wildfire funding has grown to 61% of FS's budget in FY2016, up from 47% in FY2007. This shift has led to a decrease in the proportion of funds allocated to managing the National Forest System and construction and maintenance programs. Congress may need to consider maintaining consistent funding levels for other agency programs, even though it could impact other agencies or programs. Increasing wildfire management costs are impacting funding for other agency programs, potentially reducing future suppression spending. Congress may need to discuss ways to reduce overall suppression spending costs, such as increasing investments in hazardous fuel reduction projects or prioritizing cost containment efforts. Another option is addressing the proportion of wildfire suppression costs borne by the federal government by developing a consistent federal cost apportionment method. Currently, discretionary spending, including wildfire appropriations, is subject to budgetary controls. Congress has not waived these controls in recent years, prompting exploration of ways to provide wildfire spending outside of these constraints. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposes statutory limits on discretionary spending for fiscal years FY2012 to FY2021, with separate limits for defense and nondefense categories. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposes limits on discretionary spending for defense and nondefense categories. If spending exceeds these limits, sequestration enforces automatic budget cuts. Certain spending is exempt from these limits, adjusted upward to accommodate emergency and disaster-related expenses. The emergency designation of budget authority is used for unpredictable disaster assistance, while the disaster relief designation is limited to costs of major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. Wildfire suppression is allowed under emergency designation but not under disaster relief. Congress designated four out of six supplemental appropriations for wildfire suppression as emergency spending from FY2007 to FY2016. The budget authority for emergency requirements is not limited, but for disaster relief, it is based on a formula using the average funding for disaster relief over the last 10 years. Any difference between the actual appropriation and the formula amount is carried over to the next fiscal year. For example, if $6 billion is appropriated instead of the formula's $10 billion, the next year's allowable disaster designation would be $14 billion. The total amount for the fiscal year includes the formula amount plus any carryover from the previous year, known as the disaster cap. Different types of discretionary spending for natural disasters have been provided since FY2012, including spending subject to limits, disaster relief designated spending, and emergency requirements designated spending. This funding is allocated through various appropriations accounts for disaster events like wildfires. Spending for response and recovery work for presidentially declared events, excluding wildfires, is typically appropriated through the regular process. Most of this funding goes to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for major disasters, but additional funding may also be allocated for unmet needs through programs like the Community Development Block Grant and the Army Corps of Engineers. Emergency spending supplements disaster-designated funds and is used to address events like wildfires. The Budget Control Act (BCA) led to a new approach for accounting for disaster-related activities according to FEMA. The development of a new two-part approach to accounting for disaster-related activity includes funding for major disasters and all other DRF activities. Funding for major disasters falls under disaster relief cap adjustment, while funding for base/non-major disasters includes various activities such as Emergencies, Pre-disaster Surge Support, and Fire Management Assistance Grants. Congress addressed wildfire suppression spending issues. In the 114th Congress, proposals were considered to address wildfire funding issues, including levels of appropriation, quick provision of funds, funding sources, and budget controls. Four proposals - S. 235, H.R. 167, S. 508, H.R. 2647 - aimed to address concerns of inadequate funding for wildfire suppression activities. Three of the bills would have allowed certain wildfire suppression funds to be exempt from discretionary limits. Several proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to address wildfire funding issues, including H.R. 2647, which provided a discretionary spending option for wildfire suppression operations funding. Two versions of the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act were introduced with minor differences from previous versions. S. 235 and H.R. 167 in the 114th Congress proposed amending the BBEDCA to add a new adjustment for \"wildfire suppression operations,\" requiring 70% of the 10-year average funding level to be appropriated before accessing the adjustment for emergency firefighting activities. The wildfire adjustment in H.R. 167 and S. 235 proposed caps on funding each fiscal year, with different maximum amounts. These proposals would have impacted the calculation of the existing disaster relief adjustment, as the disaster cap formula would have included budget authority from previous fiscal years with the wildfire designation. The wildfire adjustment in S. 235 and H.R. 167 aimed to incorporate previous fiscal year amounts into disaster relief calculations and reduce the disaster cap by the prior year's wildfire adjustment. These bills would also remove budget process barriers for additional wildfire suppression funds. If Congress had elected to appropriate over 70% for wildfire suppression, it would have been outside of the budget controls set by the BCA. For example, in FY2016, Congress could have allocated $1.057 billion for suppression operations, with an additional $2.689 billion under H.R. 167 or $1.410 billion under S. 235. This would have allowed for a total appropriation of up to $3.746 billion in H.R. 167 or $2.467 billion in S. 235, with only $1.057 billion subject to discretionary limits. However, actual funding decisions were left to future Congresses. The bills specified that at least 70% of the budget request would have to have been appropriated for suppression operations but did not specify whether the appropriations had to be in the agencies' respective WFM or FLAME accounts. The FLAME accounts will expire if funds are not appropriated to (or withdrawn from) them for three consecutive years. S. 235 and H.R. 167 also were silent as to fire borrowing. If either of these proposals were enacted, it was unclear if fire borrowing authorities would have continued to be provided in appropriations laws. Both S. 235 and H.R. 167 would have required the USDA and DOI Secretaries to. The bills S. 235 and H.R. 167 would have required USDA and DOI Secretaries to use a rolling 10-year average for suppression budget requests. They would also need to promptly submit requests for supplemental wildfire funding to Congress and provide a plan on how the funds would be used within 30 days. This proposal aimed to give Congress advance notice and more information on supplemental appropriations for wildfire suppression operations, aiding in decision-making and oversight. The proposed wildfire adjustment in appropriations decision-making and oversight could have impacted the disaster cap in the future. However, the exact effect is uncertain due to the sensitivity of future appropriations decisions by Congress and the President. If implemented in FY2016, the disaster formula would have been based on 10 fiscal years of disaster relief funding, but fewer than 10 fiscal years of the wildfire adjustment would have been available for incorporation. The wildfire adjustment in appropriations decision-making could impact the disaster cap in the future. The availability of wildfire-designated spending for incorporation into the formula may affect the amount of the disaster cap. The full amount of the disaster cap has not been appropriated since FY2013, leading to lower calculations for future fiscal years. Appropriating the full wildfire adjustment each fiscal year could potentially increase the disaster cap amount. The Obama Administration's FY2016 and FY2017 wildfire management budget requests proposed changing how suppression operations were funded, similar to H.R. 167 and S. 235. The proposed maximum cap adjustment would have been based on the difference between the upper 90% confidence interval FLAME forecast and the rolling 10-year suppression obligation average. The FY2016 budget resolution included procedural provisions related to wildfire suppression operations funding. The Senate Budget Committee's version of the budget resolution included provisions for wildfire suppression operations funding. It included a spending-neutral reserve fund to improve forest health and allowed for revisions to budget allocations for measures related to budgeting for wildfire suppression operations. Additionally, an amendment was adopted during Senate floor consideration that would adjust budget enforcement limits if a law was passed amending discretionary spending limits for wildfire suppression funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a proposal for wildfire suppression operations funding in the FY2017 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Title V of the bill aimed to create a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations and change the calculation for the disaster cap based on the amount of wildfire adjustment appropriations provided. Key differences between the Interior bill and H.R. 167 / S. 235 included the requirement that 100% of the 10-year average for wildfire suppression operations be appropriated subject to spending limits. The FLAME Act Amendments bill, S. 508, introduced in the 114th Congress, aimed to amend the BBEDCA by adding a new adjustment for wildfire spending. The bill required FS and DOI to submit a report analyzing fire management decisions and activities. The wildfire adjustment range started at $1.410 billion for FY2017 and increased to $2.690 billion for FY2026. S. 508 also addressed national forest management issues and stewardship contracting. S. 508 proposed adding a new adjustment for \"wildfire suppression operations\" spending under the BBEDCA. It required a minimum amount to be appropriated to DOI and FS Wildland Fire Management accounts based on past costs or estimated future costs. Additionally, funds were to be allocated for forest management activities to mitigate fire risk. S. 508 proposed a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations spending under the BBEDCA, requiring a minimum amount to be appropriated to DOI and FS Wildland Fire Management accounts. It also allocated funds for forest management activities to mitigate fire risk. The proposal included conditions for hazardous fuels reduction projects, forest restoration activities, and timber sales on National Forest System lands. Additionally, it allowed for up to $1 billion in additional new budget authority for wildfire suppression operations in each fiscal year from 2016 to 2022. The proposal in S. 508 included provisions for a wildfire adjustment in disaster relief spending, with a formula involving a 10-year rolling average minus high and low fiscal years, plus carryover, and subtracting the previous year's wildfire adjustment. It aimed to remove budget process barriers for additional wildfire suppression funds, allowing for up to an additional $1 billion in each fiscal year. The proposal under S. 508 aimed to streamline wildfire suppression funding by allowing up to an additional $1 billion annually. It required a minimum appropriation based on a rolling five-year suppression obligation average or the upper bound of the FLAME forecast. Half of the appropriation would be allocated to forest management activities like hazardous fuels reduction, significantly increasing investment in this area. The proposal under S. 508 aimed to streamline wildfire suppression funding by allowing up to an additional $1 billion annually. It required a minimum appropriation based on a rolling five-year suppression obligation average or the upper bound of the FLAME forecast. This would substantially increase investment in hazardous fuels reduction activities within the agencies' respective WFM other operations accounts. The additional funding could potentially mitigate future fire risk, but there were concerns that it might come at the expense of other agency programs. The requirement to deplete the FLAME reserve funds before authorizing additional wildfire suppression funds could impact the timing of appropriations for wildfire adjustments. The S. 508 proposal aimed to streamline wildfire suppression funding by allowing up to an additional $1 billion annually. It required a minimum appropriation based on a rolling five-year suppression obligation average or the upper bound of the FLAME forecast. This could impact the timing of appropriations for wildfire adjustments and had potential implications for the disaster cap in future fiscal years. The S. 508 proposal aimed to streamline wildfire suppression funding by allowing up to an additional $1 billion annually. It could impact the disaster cap in future fiscal years, depending on appropriations decisions by Congress and the President. The amendment would have changed the criteria for accessing FLAME funds to a minimum fire size of 1,000 acres. S. 508 proposed changes to wildfire suppression funding, allowing up to an additional $1 billion annually. It aimed to adjust criteria for accessing FLAME funds to a minimum fire size of 1,000 acres and required reporting of suppression obligations and forecasts in annual budget requests. However, S. 508 did not receive any congressional action before the end of the 114th Congress. The Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015 (H.R. 2647) aimed to broaden the purposes for major disasters under the Stafford Act to include wildfires on federal lands and create a budgetary mechanism for funding wildfire response. The bill passed the House but did not receive Senate action. The Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015 proposed a budgetary mechanism to fund wildfire response on federal lands declared as major disasters. The affected federal land management agency could request a presidential declaration if certain requirements were met, including a minimum level of wildfire suppression appropriations. The Secretary certified the amount available for wildfire suppression operations within 30 days of notification. Title IX of H.R. 2647 proposed establishing a specific account for transferring funds to conduct wildfire suppression operations after a major disaster declaration. This account would only fund assistance for wildfires on federal and nonfederal lands under fire protection agreements. The bill proposed establishing a specific account for transferring funds for wildfire suppression operations after a major disaster declaration. Reimbursement procedures would be established for funds used for wildfires on nonfederal lands under a fire protection agreement. Reports detailing wildland fire management decisions and cost expenditures would be required within 90 days after a major disaster for wildfire on federal lands. Section 903 of H.R. 2647 aimed to prevent agencies from transferring funds for wildfire suppression, potentially eliminating fire borrowing. The proposal could have provided additional discretionary spending for wildfire suppression operations related to disaster relief. This would amend the Stafford Act to include wildfires on federal land as a major disaster incident. The Stafford Act was amended to include wildfires on federal land as a major disaster incident, allowing for appropriations under certain conditions. Funds for wildfire suppression operations could only be accessed after a major disaster declaration by the President. The changes proposed by H.R. 2647 to the Stafford Act would have impacted the disaster designation for wildfire suppression funding, gradually incorporating appropriations over 10 fiscal years. The bill proposed changes to the Stafford Act for wildfire suppression funding over 10 fiscal years, potentially affecting future disaster cap calculations. It aimed to prohibit fire borrowing, but the impact on disaster cap calculations was uncertain due to future appropriations decisions. H.R. 2647 aimed to address wildfire suppression funding by prohibiting fire borrowing and requiring agencies to provide reports on cost expenditures and management decisions. The bill passed the House in 2015 and was referred to the Senate Committee. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress, such as S. 3085 and S. 2012, aimed to address wildfire funding similar to H.R. 2647. S. 2012 was in conference to resolve differences between House and Senate versions when the Congress adjourned."
