    "content": "Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is amended to include new procedural requirements for civilian agencies regarding products of Federal Prison Industries. Before purchasing products from the Federal Prison Industries catalog, executive agencies must conduct market research to compare prices, quality, and delivery time with private sector products. If the Federal Prison Industries product does not meet the agency's needs in terms of price, quality, or delivery time, competitive procedures must be used for procurement or an individual purchase under a multiple award contract. The agency head must consider offers from Federal Prison Industries when conducting a competition or making a purchase. The head of an executive agency must ensure that products or services from Federal Prison Industries are comparable to those from the private sector in terms of price, quality, and delivery time. Federal Prison Industries must fulfill its contractual obligations like any other contractor for the agency. The contracting officer's determination on the comparability of products or services offered by Federal Prison Industries to those from the private sector is not subject to review. Contractors of an executive agency cannot be compelled to use Federal Prison Industries as a subcontractor or supplier. Federal Prison Industries may be required to be used in contracts through specific products or services, including subcontractors. Inmates are restricted from accessing classified or sensitive information in contracts with Federal Prison Industries. The section prohibits the disclosure of geographic data on infrastructure and personal or financial information without consent. Definitions for \"competitive procedures\" and \"market research\" are provided. The term 'market research' involves obtaining specific information about products in the private sector through various means such as contacting knowledgeable individuals, interactive communication, and meetings with potential offerors."
