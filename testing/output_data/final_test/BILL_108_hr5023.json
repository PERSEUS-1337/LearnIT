    "content": "The Act titled \"G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act\" aims to address the decline in science and technology dominance in the United States by creating a doctoral study program in math, science, engineering, and technology for veterans. This decline is seen as a threat to jobs, industry, and national security. The G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act introduces stipends for veterans pursuing doctoral degrees in science or technology under a new subchapter in Chapter 30 of title 38, United States Code. The G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act establishes stipends for eligible doctoral candidates pursuing full-time doctoral degrees in science, engineering, mathematics, or technology disciplines. Eligible candidates must meet specific requirements outlined in the subchapter. The G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act provides stipends for eligible doctoral candidates pursuing full-time doctoral degrees in science, engineering, mathematics, or technology disciplines. Payments are in addition to other educational assistance programs and can be made for up to 60 months. The G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act provides stipends for eligible doctoral candidates pursuing full-time doctoral degrees in science, engineering, mathematics, or technology disciplines at a monthly rate of $1,200. The Secretary adjusts the rate for inflation annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Institutions of higher learning cannot consider the stipend amount when determining assistance. Under the G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act, eligible doctoral candidates can receive stipends of $1,200 per month for full-time doctoral studies in science, engineering, mathematics, or technology fields. Institutions of higher learning are prohibited from factoring in these stipend payments when calculating financial assistance for the candidates. To receive stipends, candidates must be accepted into an accredited doctoral program, provide annual proof of full-time enrollment, and maintain good academic standing. The Secretary can only make stipend payments within a specified time frame. The Secretary can make stipend payments to eligible doctoral candidates for full-time doctoral studies in science, engineering, mathematics, or technology fields within a 10-year period. An annual authorization of $14,900,000 is allocated for this purpose starting from fiscal year 2005. Amendments are made to ensure consistency in referring to the educational assistance provided under this subchapter. Amendments are made to sections in Title 38, United States Code to ensure consistency in referring to educational assistance as \"educational assistance under this subchapter.\" Additionally, a new subchapter is added for stipends for veterans pursuing doctoral degrees in science or technology fields.
