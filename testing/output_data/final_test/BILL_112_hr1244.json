    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2011\". It includes findings related to private employee ownership. Congress finds that employees were first allowed to be owners of subchapter S corporations in 1998, leading to incentives for businesses to become ESOP-owned S corporations. Since then, thousands of companies have become ESOP-owned S corporations, providing ownership interests to millions of Americans across various industries in every state. Recent studies have shown that employees of ESOP-owned S corporations enjoy greater job stability and have amassed meaningful retirement savings through their ESOP accounts, providing them with the means to retire with dignity. The Small Business Administration denies small business status to a business after an ESOP acquires more than 49 percent, even if all other eligibility criteria remain the same. Congress aims to support employee ownership of S corporations through ESOPs. SEC. 3 amends the definition of qualified securities for employee stock ownership plans sponsored by S corporations. SEC. 4 introduces a deduction for interest on loans to finance the purchase of employer securities by ESOPs sponsored by S corporations. SEC. 200 introduces interest deductions on loans for purchasing employer securities by ESOPs sponsored by S corporations. The deduction allows 50 percent of interest received by a bank on a qualified securities acquisition loan for ESOPs sponsored by S corporations. The deduction allows 50 percent of interest received by a bank on a qualified securities acquisition loan for ESOPs sponsored by S corporations. The term 'employer securities' has the meaning given by section 409(l). A qualified securities acquisition loan must have repayment terms similar to the loan to the S corporation. Refinanced loans are included in the definition of a qualified securities acquisition loan. The ESOP must hold more than 50 percent of stock after the acquisition. The employee stock ownership plan must own more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock of the S corporation immediately after an acquisition for a loan to be considered a qualified securities acquisition loan. The employee stock ownership plan must acquire stock meeting specific requirements within a certain timeframe to avoid a failure in ownership. The Secretary may classify various interests as stock for compliance purposes. The term 'employee stock ownership plan' is defined in section 4975(e)(7) for compliance purposes. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the tax code. Sec. 200 amends interest on loans for the purchase of employer securities by an employee stock ownership plan sponsored by an S corporation. The effective date applies to interest accrued on loans made after the enactment of this Act. Additionally, Section 5 establishes a Department of Treasury Technical Assistance Office. Before the end of the 90-day period, the Secretary of Treasury must establish the S Corporation Employee Ownership Assistance Office to promote employee ownership of S corporations. The office will provide education, outreach, and technical assistance for S corporations to sponsor employee stock ownership plans. Additionally, the Small Business Act is amended to include provisions for employee stock ownership. \"SEC. 45. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS.\" The section defines ESOP as an employee stock ownership plan and ESOP business concern as a small business concern where more than 49 percent is acquired by an ESOP. ESOP participants are treated as directly owning their share of stock in the ESOP business concern for eligibility purposes. The amendments made by this section will take effect on January 1 of the first calendar year after the enactment of this Act, relating to the proportionate share of stock in the ESOP business concern owned by the ESOP."
