    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teacher Health and Wellness Act\". Congress finds that high levels of stress among teachers are negatively impacting their health and effectiveness in raising student achievement. Stress also contributes to a less conducive learning environment, high turnover rates among teachers, and increased costs for school districts. Main sources of teacher stress include school organization, low job autonomy, and a lack of access to leadership opportunities. Failure to manage stress levels leads to lower teacher performance. According to a 2014 Gallup survey, 46 percent of teachers experience high daily stress during the school year, which is tied for the highest rate among occupations. This stress negatively affects teacher health and well-being, with high levels of daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality reported. These health issues compromise teaching performance and overall quality of life. A study will be conducted to reduce teacher stress, improve retention, and enhance well-being. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will conduct a five-year study on reducing teacher stress and increasing retention and well-being through various programs like workplace wellness, social emotional learning, teacher stress management, mentoring, and organizational interventions. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will conduct a study on reducing teacher stress and increasing retention and well-being through programs like professional learning communities, teacher leadership, mental health support, mindfulness meditation, school reorganization, and innovative evidence-based approaches. The Director will submit a report to Congress with the study results and recommendations for reducing teacher stress, increasing retention, and lowering health care costs. The report will be made publicly available. Definitions include \"complementary health approach.\" In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"complementary health approach,\" \"Director,\" \"institution of higher education,\" and \"State educational agency.\" No additional funds are authorized for carrying out the requirements of this Act."
