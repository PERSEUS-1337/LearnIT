    "content": "Research on former foster youth is limited due to methodological challenges such as brief follow-up periods, low response rates, non-representative samples, and small sample sizes. Few studies include comparison groups to assess how well these youth are transitioning to adulthood compared to their peers in the foster care or general population. Two studies have tracked outcomes across various domains for former foster youth and compared them to other groups. The 1999 law authorized the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program to develop outcome measures for assessing the performance of states in operating independent living programs for current and former foster youth. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program authorized the development of outcome measures to assess state performance in independent living programs for foster youth. In response, the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was created by HHS to track data on children receiving independent living services and state performance. States report data twice a year on eligible youth receiving services, regardless of their foster care status. Independent living services are provided to youth transitioning to adulthood, including academic and career support. States track foster youth at ages 17, 19, and 21, regardless of whether they receive these services. This tracking includes baseline youth at 17 and follow-up youth at 19 and 21, also known as tracked youth. States may sample youth to reduce data collection burden. The data collection for foster youth transitioning to adulthood includes tracking at ages 17, 19, and 21. Independent living services are provided to help with academic and career support. The youth receiving these services are predominantly female, white, black, or Hispanic, with most being in foster care. Many have less than a 12th-grade education, some receive special education, and a significant portion have been adjudicated delinquent. Among the 19-year-old follow-up youth in FY2013, nearly one out of five had been adjudicated delinquent. The most frequently received services included academic support, career preparation, and independent living needs assessment. About 60% of youth received three or more independent living services. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics and outcomes of these youth. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics and outcomes of 19-year-old follow-up youth in FY2013, who were initially surveyed at age 17. The data includes information for the entire group of 19-year-olds and sub-categories based on foster care status and receipt of independent living services. Most youth in foster care also received independent living services. A total of 7,536 youth participated in the survey at age 19. At age 19, youth in foster care and those no longer in foster care were surveyed on various outcomes. More than half were male, with the majority being white, followed by black and Hispanic youth. They were asked about financial self-sufficiency, education, positive adult connections, homelessness, high-risk behaviors, and health insurance access. Around one-third were working, with foster care youth more likely to work part-time. About 30% had completed apprenticeships or internships. Approximately 30% of 19-year-old youth had completed on-the-job training in the past year. They were equally likely to receive Social Security benefits, regardless of foster care status. Youth not receiving independent living services were slightly less likely to receive ongoing financial support. Foster care youth at age 19 did not qualify for public supports like financial assistance and food assistance. Overall, 54% of 19-year-old youth were enrolled in school, with varying educational outcomes depending on their foster care status and receipt of independent living services. Youth in foster care or receiving independent living services were slightly more likely to have a high school diploma or equivalent compared to those not in care. At age 19, 54% of youth were enrolled in school, with higher rates among those in foster care. Almost all youth had a positive connection to an adult mentor. Most had not experienced homelessness. At age 19, youth in foster care were less likely to report homelessness or incarceration compared to other groups. They were also slightly less likely to have given birth or fathered children. Nearly 9 out of 10 youth had health insurance coverage at age 19. Youth in care or receiving independent living services were more likely to have health insurance coverage, with most receiving Medicaid. Regardless of foster care status, a similar percentage had other health insurance. Those receiving independent living services were slightly more likely to have insurance for prescription drugs compared to those in foster care."
