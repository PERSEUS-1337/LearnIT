    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Carbon Monoxide Treated Meat, Poultry, and Seafood Safe Handling, Labeling, and Consumer Protection Act\". Congress acknowledges the reliance of consumers on color to assess the freshness of meat, poultry, and seafood. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has approved the use of carbon monoxide in packaging for beef, pork, poultry, ground poultry, and raw tuna to maintain color, taste, aroma, and texture. Carbon monoxide reacts with myoglobin in fresh meat, poultry, and seafood to form carboxymyoglobin, which maintains color associated with freshness and safety. The color persists regardless of age, microbial count, or temperature abuse. Congressional investigators found that a significant portion of imported seafood in San Francisco has been treated with carbon monoxide to enhance color. The use of carbon monoxide to enhance the color of meat, poultry, and seafood products can mask decomposition, leading to microbial stability issues due to temperature abuse. Consumers are not informed about this practice, making it difficult to judge the freshness and safety of the products based on color. The amendments made by this Act aim to prevent consumer deception and health risks from foodborne illness caused by spoiled or unfit meat, poultry, or seafood products packaged with carbon monoxide, where color is not a reliable indicator of freshness and safety. Date labeling is insufficient once products have been exposed to temperature abuse or defrosted. The amendments aim to ensure food safety, especially for vulnerable populations who may not rely on odor to detect spoilage in meat, poultry, or seafood products. Labeling requirements for meat, poultry products, and seafood containing carbon monoxide. Labeling requirements for meat, poultry products, and seafood containing carbon monoxide include adding carbon monoxide to the definition of color additive for fresh meat, poultry, and seafood intended for human consumption. The labeling requirements for fresh meat, poultry products, or seafood include a safety notice about the use of carbon monoxide to preserve color. Consumers are advised not to rely solely on color or expiration dates to judge freshness or safety. Products with unpleasant odor, slime, or bulging packaging should be discarded. The effective date for this amendment is 30 days after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has discretionary authority to establish alternative labeling requirements for carbon monoxide use in meat, poultry, and seafood if scientific evidence shows the current labeling is no longer necessary to prevent consumer deception or harm."
