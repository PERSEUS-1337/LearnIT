    "content": "Federal law governing the hiring and employment of foreign workers in the United States focuses on preventing workforce undermining and protecting foreign workers from exploitation. Three main sources of labor protections for foreign workers include conditions imposed on employers, federal labor laws, and private causes of action under state and local laws. This report aims to clarify the framework for foreign workers' protections under federal laws, covering immigration-related labor conditions and federal labor laws. This report examines protections for foreign workers under federal laws, including immigration-related labor conditions and federal labor laws. It also discusses private causes of action under state and local laws, as well as legislative proposals pending before Congress. Protections are strongest for nonimmigrant workers in lower-skilled occupations, such as H-2A agricultural workers and H-2B forestry/logging workers. Foreign workers may face deportation in case of job loss. Foreign workers admitted into the United States as immigrants or lawful permanent residents are protected from losing their immigration status in case of job termination. Employers hiring foreign workers must first obtain labor certification from the DOL and then petition the DHS for nonimmigrant workers. This process ensures that there are not enough qualified U.S. workers available for the job. Employers hiring foreign workers must demonstrate a lack of qualified U.S. workers and ensure that the employment of foreign workers does not harm U.S. workers' working conditions. The process involves obtaining labor certification from the DOL and petitioning the DHS, with specific requirements varying based on visa category. Labor conditions are set by the INA and DOL regulations, with temporary agricultural guest workers receiving strong protections. The DOL and DHS oversee labor certification and visa petition, respectively. The DHS and DOL have authority to penalize employers who violate labor conditions for foreign workers. Debarment may be imposed on employers who substantially violate program obligations, preventing them from submitting labor certification applications or visa petitions. Individual workers cannot sue employers under federal immigration laws for labor condition violations. The Department of Labor (DOL) administers labor certification programs for various visas, with authority over non-compliance. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) processes applications and audits certifications, with enforcement actions based on investigations by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The WHD ensures compliance with wage and working condition laws. The Department of Labor (DOL) oversees labor certification programs for visas, ensuring compliance with wage and working condition laws. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigates fraud in DOL programs, with potential involvement in labor certification violations. Allegations of fraud may be referred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or OIG for investigation. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) adjudicates visa petitions, while U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enforces immigration laws within DHS. ICE, under DHS, enforces non-compliance with conditions of temporary work visas and investigates violations of immigration laws, including unlawful employment of aliens. The Supreme Court protects undocumented workers' rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining. The Supreme Court's decision in Sure-Tan, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board extended the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to apply to undocumented workers, based on broad definitions of \"employee\" in the NLRA and FLSA. In Sure-Tan, undocumented workers were terminated after voting in a union election opposed by their employer, leading to an investigation by the INS. The Supreme Court found that the NLRA applies to undocumented workers, supporting their protection in the collective bargaining process. Five Sure-Tan employees accepted voluntary departure after an INS investigation. The NLRB alleged unfair labor practices by Sure-Tan for terminating workers who voted in a union election. The Supreme Court supported the protection of undocumented workers in the collective bargaining process to prevent the creation of a subclass that could hinder effective collective bargaining. The Court found that the company violated the NLRA but reversed a backpay order for not being tailored to the workers' actual injuries. The Supreme Court ruled that undocumented workers should be protected in the collective bargaining process to avoid hindering effective collective bargaining. The Court found that backpay awards should reflect actual economic losses and legal availability for work, as seen in Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board. The Court held that federal immigration policy, as expressed in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, prohibits awarding backpay to undocumented workers. The Supreme Court ruled in Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board that backpay awards to undocumented workers are prohibited by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Court emphasized that awarding backpay would undermine immigration laws and encourage future violations, stating that other sanctions like cease and desist orders are sufficient to address unfair labor practices. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in Patel v. Quality Inn South that undocumented workers are protected by the FLSA, as it broadly defines \"employee\" to include any individual employed by an employer, without specific exceptions for undocumented workers. This decision emphasizes that remedies under the FLSA are effective in enforcing national labor policy, regardless of backpay. The Eleventh Circuit's ruling in Patel v. Quality Inn South affirmed that undocumented workers are covered by the FLSA, with a broad definition of \"employee\" that includes all workers. The court emphasized that FLSA remedies should be available regardless of immigration status, distinguishing Patel from previous cases like Sure-Tan. Patel sought unpaid wages for work already done, not back pay for being unlawfully deprived of a job. The Eleventh Circuit's ruling in Patel v. Quality Inn South affirmed that undocumented workers are covered by the FLSA, with a broad definition of \"employee\" that includes all workers. The court emphasized that FLSA remedies should be available regardless of immigration status, distinguishing Patel from previous cases like Sure-Tan. In Lucas v. Jerusalem Cafe, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit also found that allowing undocumented workers to recover damages for work actually performed is consistent with the IRCA. The WHD of the DOL enforces the FLSA regardless of immigration status, discouraging employment of unauthorized workers. Claims under the FLSA seek backpay for actual work hours, different from NLRA concerns. Private remedies exist under the FLSA and some state laws, with MSAWPA excluding H-2A agricultural workers but not other nonimmigrant workers. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is restricted by federal laws from providing legal representation to nonimmigrant workers, except for H-2A nonimmigrant agricultural workers. H-2B forestry workers have used the MSAWPA private cause of action, while foreign guest workers have filed lawsuits against employers for violations of state laws on tort, breach of contract, and labor laws. Some breach of contract claims are based on violations of federal immigration laws related to worker conditions in job contracts/offers. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is limited in providing legal representation to nonimmigrant workers, except for H-2A agricultural workers. Proposed rulemaking aims to extend services to H-2B forestry workers. Legislation in the 113th Congress seeks to reform foreign guest worker visa categories for worker protections and employer flexibility. S. 744 would reverse Hoffman's effect, create new worker categories, establish whistleblower protections, and expand MSAWPA coverage. H.R. 2131, the SKILLS Visa Act, aims to provide employment protections and increase H-1B numerical limits for high-skilled visa categories. H.R. 1773 proposes a new H-2C agricultural worker visa category, excluded from MSAWPA coverage."
