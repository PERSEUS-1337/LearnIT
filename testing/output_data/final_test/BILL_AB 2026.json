    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Environmental Quality Act aims to maintain a quality environment by identifying significant effects of proposed projects, considering alternatives, and implementing mitigation measures. It promotes transparency in decision-making and allows the public to challenge projects for non-compliance. Litigation under the act is increasingly used for competitive purposes. Despite the focus on transparency in decision-making, shadow groups funded by unknown backers often bring litigation challenging projects without disclosing their funders or financial interests. Project opponents strategically use litigation to delay projects past economic viability, stopping projects that couldn't be halted during the decision-making process. California Rules of Court require disclosure of entities funding amicus briefs. The state and public have a compelling interest in disclosing the identities of entities funding litigation under the act to understand organizations involved in decision-making, prevent misuse of lawsuits for nonenvironmental purposes, and conserve judicial resources. Courts also have a compelling interest in disclosure to determine the motives behind environmental or nonenvironmental actions filed under the act. The Legislature aims to require disclosure of contributors funding legal actions under the act, including their financial interests related to the project. Plaintiffs must identify individuals or entities who contributed $1,000 or more for petition preparation in actions against public agencies for noncompliance with environmental regulations. The plaintiff or petitioner must disclose any person or entity contributing $1,000 or more towards the legal action and their financial interests in the project. They can request to keep a contributor's identity confidential, but the court can compel compliance, including dismissing the action if necessary. An individual funding a legal action has the right to limit disclosure of personal information for court review. The disclosed information helps determine if attorneys' fees should be awarded for enforcing the division. The state policy requires public projects to undergo the same level of review as private projects approved by public agencies."
