The Act is titled the \"National Policies Toward Gambling Review Act of 1995.\" Congress found that in 1976, casino gambling was legal in only one state, Indian tribal gambling did not exist, and state lotteries were limited. The industry has since grown significantly, with casino gambling legal in over 20 states. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 led to a rapid expansion of casino gambling in the United States, with Indian tribal casinos accounting for a significant portion of industry revenues. State lotteries are prevalent in 36 states, and gambling in some form exists in almost all states except for two. The impact of the gambling industry is a major public policy concern. The impact of the gambling industry raises concerns about addiction, crime, cross addictions, decreased worker productivity, and adverse effects on small businesses in communities where gambling is legalized. The gambling industry has led to a competitive atmosphere between states, Indian tribes, and bordering countries like Canada to attract gambling revenue. There are conflicts in regulatory structures between Federal oversight and State laws. There is a lack of national-level knowledge on the impact of gambling proliferation in the United States. Most economic impact studies on casino gambling are sponsored by the industry, with little funding for research on gambling addiction at the State or Federal level. Policymakers at all levels require data on the social and economic effects of gambling proliferation in the US. A commission called the \"Commission on the Review of National Policies Toward Gambling\" is established to review national policies on gambling. The commission's duties are outlined in the Act. The Commission on the Review of National Policies Toward Gambling will conduct a study on gambling activities in the US, their social and economic impact, and existing policies. The study will include an examination of the impact on small businesses and jobs. The Commission on the Review of National Policies Toward Gambling will study the impact of gambling addiction on businesses, jobs, and society. It will also review the effectiveness of current law enforcement practices and propose alternatives. Additionally, the study will analyze existing statutes at the federal, state, and local levels regarding the prohibition and taxation of gambling activities. The Commission will prepare proposals for codification, revision, or repeal of statutes to implement policy changes deemed necessary or desirable. SEC. 4. MEMBERSHIP.
