    "content": "One-time distribution from retirement plans for health savings accounts. One-time distribution from retirement plans for health savings accounts allows eligible individuals to exclude qualified HSA funding distributions from gross income for the taxable year. The 60th day after receiving the distribution, the employee can exclude a limited amount from gross income for qualified HSA funding contributions. The employee can exclude a limited amount from gross income for qualified HSA funding contributions, based on specific criteria outlined in section 223(b)(2)(A). The qualified HSA funding distribution is contributed to the employee's health savings account, limited by specific amounts specified in section 223(b)(2)(B). The election for a one-time transfer under paragraph (1) is irrevocable and applies to the taxable year it is made and subsequent years. Distributions from an eligible retirement plan must be includible in gross income to be treated as a distribution for purposes of paragraph (1). Distributions from eligible retirement plans in a taxable year are included in gross income if they do not exceed the total amount that would have been included if all distributions were treated as one contract. Adjustments are made for other distributions in the same and subsequent taxable years. The term 'retirement plan' includes eligible deferred compensation plans maintained by eligible employers. Special rules apply, such as treating all eligible retirement plans of an employer as a single plan. Surviving spouses, dependents, and alternate payees are also covered under eligible retirement plans. Eligible individuals are defined in section 223(c)(1). The surviving spouse, dependents, or alternate payee of a former employee are treated the same as the former employee in eligible retirement plans. Contributions to health savings accounts are coordinated with other contributions, with limits on deductions. A 10-percent penalty on early distributions does not apply.
