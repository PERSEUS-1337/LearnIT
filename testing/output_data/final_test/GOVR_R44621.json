    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2017, comparing enacted FY2016 appropriations, budget requests from the Obama and Trump administrations, and appropriations measures. It also provides additional informational resources, reports, and a list of CRS policy experts for inquiries. The CRS reports focus on legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, with a focus on discretionary funding amounts. The homeland security appropriations bill includes various budgetary concepts such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, offsetting collections, allocations, and adjustments to discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act. Additional information on appropriations process can be found in CRS Report R42388 and the Government Accountability Office's A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process. The homeland security appropriations bill allocates resources to every departmental component of DHS, with discretionary appropriations providing the majority of funding. Budget amounts in CRS reports are rounded to the nearest million, but precise calculations use unrounded data. Data for FY2016 and FY2017 are sourced from a single reliable source. Due to the implementation of the Common Appropriations Structure for DHS, this report relies on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and the accompanying explanatory statement. The Obama Administration requested $40.62 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2017. The Obama Administration requested $66.2 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2017, which was a $332 million decrease from the previous year. Additionally, they requested $6.7 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding and a transfer of $163 million in OCO designated funding to the U.S. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 3001 with $41.2 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2017, slightly above the Administration's request. The House Committee on Appropriations reported out H.R. 5634 with $41.04 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2017. The House Appropriations Committee reported a bill with $426 million above the Administration's request for FY2017 budget authority. President Obama signed a continuing resolution funding the government through December 9, 2016, at the same rate as FY2016. Section 130 of the Administration's request allowed DHS to obligate funds in the CAS account structure as outlined in a report submitted prior to FY2017. Section 131 permitted resources under the CR to maintain staffing levels for TSA screeners and CBP personnel from FY2016. The Obama Administration requested anomalies in the CR for TSA funding repurposing. The CR required an anomaly for TSA funding repurposing to hire additional screeners. A second continuing resolution extended special procurement authorities for DHS research and development activities. The government was funded through April 28, 2017, at the same rate of operations as FY2016. The Obama Administration requested flexibility in maintaining staffing levels for CBP, ICE, TSA, and U.S. Secret Service to respond to unpredictable migration surges. Congress extended this flexibility to ensure border security, immigration enforcement, aviation security, and protection of the President-elect. A third short-term continuing resolution (P.L. 115-30) was signed into law on April 28, 2017, extending funding. The continuing resolution (P.L. 115-30) signed into law on April 28, 2017, extended funding through May 5, 2017, and provided temporary health benefits for miners. The Trump Administration requested $3 billion in additional funding for DHS in an amendment to the FY2017 budget request. This request was addressed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), which included annual and supplemental appropriations for DHS. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 provided annual appropriations for DHS in response to the Obama Administration's request. It included $41.3 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $6.7 billion for major disasters, and $163 million for overseas operations. Additionally, $3 billion in additional funding for DHS was included in response to the Trump Administration's request, with over $1.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for specific agencies. The Trump Administration requested $7.85 billion in supplemental funding for FY2017, including $7.4 billion for the DRF. The House and Senate passed relief packages with additional funding for disaster relief, a short-term increase to the debt limit, and a continuing resolution to fund government operations into FY2018. The House passed a Senate-amended bill on September 8, 2017, which became P.L. 115-56. When DHS was established in 2003, components of other agencies were brought together over a few months. Congress and the Administration continued to provide resources through existing account structures for the department. In H.Rept. 113-481, the House Appropriations Committee recommended implementing a common appropriation for DHS. The Committee directed DHS to implement a common appropriation structure to improve transparency and streamline spending decisions. This new structure was authorized in the FY2016 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act and was to be implemented in FY2017. The FY2017 DHS appropriations request implemented a new structure with four categories of appropriations, except for the Coast Guard which was transitioning to a new system. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not use the new structure, citing concerns about reduced controls and oversight. The Committee is willing to transition to a more common appropriations structure, maintaining controls and transparency, in line with guidance from fiscal year 2016. The House Appropriations Committee has already adopted the new structure. The Committee commended the significant time and effort put into implementing the new budget structure for fiscal year 2017. They believe that as the use of this new structure matures, it will allow for more effective oversight of DHS components, better tracking of acquisition program costs, and informed trade-offs among programs with limited resources. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 established a new budget structure for DHS funding, with detailed tables outlining Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPAs). The Administration requested FY2018 funding in the same structure, with potential small changes at the PPA level. This new structure allows for more effective oversight and tracking of costs within DHS components. The new budget structure for DHS funding includes detailed tables outlining Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPAs). A visual representation in Figure 1 shows the proportion of funding categories for each component and the department as a whole. Appropriations measures for DHS are typically organized into five titles, with the first four grouping components thematically and the fifth providing general direction. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 introduced a new budget structure with detailed tables outlining Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPAs). The appropriations act provided direction to the department and its components differently than in previous years, grouping provisions at the ends of titles as \"administrative provisions.\" This restructuring changed how budget priorities were directed and used by components. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 introduced a new budget structure with detailed tables outlining Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPAs). The act provided additional appropriations for several components in response to evolving situations and addressed a budget request amendment by the Trump Administration. Textual and tabular comparisons of FY2016 enacted and FY2017 requested and enacted appropriations are presented. The appropriations structure reflects the organization outlined in the explanatory statement accompanying the act. The appropriations for components in S. 3001 or H.R. 5634 were not released, making direct comparisons difficult. The tables summarize the appropriations provided for each component, including the FY2017 budget request and supplemental funding requests from the Obama and Trump administrations. Separate totals are provided for annual and supplemental appropriations. The tables provide a breakdown of appropriations for each component, including resources from various sources like fees, mandatory spending, and trust funds. Totals are given for each component, including funding through general provisions and supplemental appropriations. The Departmental Management section is also included in the summary. The Departmental Management and Operations section of the appropriations bill received $1.50 billion in FY2016 and $1.25 billion in FY2017, which was less than the requested amount by the Obama Administration. In FY2016, the Departmental Management and Operations section received $1.50 billion, which was reduced to $1.25 billion in FY2017, less than the Obama Administration's request. The Security, Enforcement, and Investigations components, including CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS, received $33.22 billion in FY2016, with a request for $32.26 billion in FY2017. The FY2017 net discretionary budget authority for components in this title was $40.04 billion, with a $957 million decrease from FY2016. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 provided $33.50 billion in net discretionary budget authority for the components. Additionally, $1.14 billion in additional budget authority was received in Title VI of the act, which was $1.76 billion less than requested by the Trump Administration. The second largest title in the FY2017 budget contains appropriations for the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In FY2016, these components received $6.38 billion in net discretionary budget authority and $6.71 billion in specially designated funding for disaster relief. The Obama Administration requested $5.71 billion in FY2017 net discretionary budget authority, which was $718 million less than FY2016. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 provided $6.67 billion in net discretionary budget authority for these components. The FY2017 budget included $6.67 billion in net discretionary budget authority, which was $957 million more than requested and $239 million more than FY2016. The act also included requested disaster relief funding and $7.4 billion in supplemental appropriations for FEMA. Title IV contains appropriations for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and Domestic. In FY2016, components like FLETC, S&T, and DNDO received $1.50 billion in budget authority. The FY2017 budget request was $1.63 billion, $134 million more than FY2016. The actual appropriation was $1.50 billion, $137 million less than requested and $3 million less than FY2016. The FY2016 budget included $1.51 billion in rescissions, while the FY2017 budget proposed $420 million in rescissions. Senate and House Appropriations Committees also included significant amounts in rescissions. The DHS budget competes for nondefense discretionary spending allocations under the Budget Control Act. The FY2017 budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security includes over $2.0 billion in defense discretionary spending, with $1.5 billion allocated for the National Protection and Programs Directorate. Concerns were raised by the minority party regarding underfunding for government-wide cybersecurity in the House version of the bill. Additional funding was requested to ensure timely upgrades to federal cyber networks. The Obama Administration proposed a 1.6% pay increase for federal employees in its FY2017 budget request. President Obama issued an Executive Order for a 2.1% pay adjustment for civilian federal employees, effective January 8, 2017. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017 also provided a 2.1% pay increase for Coast Guard military personnel. The FY2016 Homeland Security Appropriations Act included a provision prohibiting funds for structural pay reform affecting more than 100 employees. The FY2016 Homeland Security Appropriations Act included a provision prohibiting funds for structural pay reform affecting more than 100 employees. This prohibition would last until the Secretary notifies Congress about the details of the change. The Senate report highlighted hiring challenges within the department. The Senate report emphasized the need for monitoring hiring process steps for transparency and accountability of DHS officials. It praised Customs and Border Protection's approach to streamline hiring and directed DHS to develop consistent metrics. The House committee report instructed the Office of the Under Secretary for Management to provide updates on a corrective action plan for hiring. Most components are still struggling to meet hiring goals. The report highlighted challenges in meeting hiring goals at DHS due to high attrition levels and a lengthy hiring process. The committee directed actions to reform the process, including conducting polygraph examinations early and reevaluating disqualifiers. The Department of Homeland Security is directed to reevaluate fitness factors for security clearances and develop metrics to improve hiring processes and decrease time to hire new employees. The House committee report advised DHS to analyze skills and capabilities across the department to ensure adequate resources for budget and acquisition functions. It also emphasized the importance of partnering with the private sector to fill capability gaps. The Senate committee report required DHS to provide monthly data on the use of paid administrative leave and understand employee assignments to other departments and agencies. The Senate committee directed the department to provide data on long-term employee assignments to other departments, agencies, and entities, including grade levels and authority. The information must be submitted within 120 days. DHS was also directed to include a statement in advertisements indicating they are taxpayer-funded, except in cases of safety or security concerns. The House committee report indicated specific limitations on funding for reception and representation expenses for various DHS components, with reductions made in certain areas. The Senate Appropriations Committee report highlighted limitations on reception and representation expenses for the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management due to DHS's failure to fill the Assistant Secretary for Policy position and the uncertainty of new TSA fees totaling $880 million. The report also emphasized the need for quarterly reports on expenses and prohibited the use of funds for unnecessary collectibles or memorabilia. The fiscal year 2017 budget request included fee revenue that artificially reduced the amount of net discretionary appropriations needed for the Transportation Security Administration. DHS may face further reductions in ORR funds and headquarters activities in the future. For more information on FY2017 DHS appropriations, refer to various CRS reports. The federal government spending process involves budget authority enacted by Congress, funds obligated by federal agencies, and payments made to liquidate those obligations. Budget authority is determined through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, and agencies are prohibited from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Contact CRS analysts for more information on DHS appropriations. Budget authority enacted by Congress limits federal agencies from obligating more funds than authorized. It can be one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Obligations are incurred when agencies use funds for personnel, contracts, and services in a fiscal year, while outlays are the actual funds spent. Multiyear and no-year budget authorities allow for spending over a specified or indefinite period. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It includes discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress. Gross budget authority is the total funds available for spending, composed of discretionary and mandatory spending. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds collected by the federal government are not considered federal revenue but as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is the total funds available for spending. The DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset spending. Some collections offset discretionary budget authority, while others offset mandatory spending, such as entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Secret Service retirement pay is funded by permanent appropriations, not annually appropriated. The DHS budget includes permanent appropriations for Secret Service retirement pay, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the budget contains Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the gross budget authority calculation. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process involving 302(a) allocations. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary totals available to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees then allocate these funds among their subcommittees for each bill, known as the 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments can be made during the year, and no subcommittee allocations are developed for conference reports or enacted appropriations. The 302(b) allocations for FY2016 and FY2017 are compared in Table A-1, based on the Budget Control Act's discretionary spending caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended these caps, affecting the budget for the Department of Homeland Security. The Budget Control Act allows adjustments to nondefense spending for DHS, including funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud control. Three justifications for adjusting discretionary budget caps have influenced DHS's appropriations process, with disaster relief being limited. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief is determined by OMB using a specific formula. The relief cap adjustment for the fiscal year is calculated based on a rolling average of disaster relief spending over the last ten years, excluding the highest and lowest years, plus any unused amount from the previous year. In FY2017, the allowable adjustment was $8.129 billion, used for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and HUD's Community Development Fund. After exhausting the adjustment, emergency funding was provided for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations."
