    "content": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates, including Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Fujayrah, Umm al-Qaywayn, and Ras al-Khaymah. The federation was formed in 1971, with Ras al-Khaymah joining in 1972. After the death of the first UAE president, Shaykh Zayid bin Sultan Al Nuhayyan, his son, Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayid al-Nuhayyan, became the ruler of Abu Dhabi and subsequently the UAE president. After the death of the first UAE president, Shaykh Zayid bin Sultan Al Nuhayyan, his son, Khalifa, was selected as UAE president by the leaders of all seven emirates. The ruler of Dubai, Shaykh Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktum, serves as Vice President and Prime Minister. The Federal Supreme Council meets four times per year to establish policy guidelines. UAE leadership posts change only in the event of death of an incumbent. Shaykh Khalifa's stroke in 2014 put the leadership into doubt, with no formal succession likely to avoid turmoil. Shaykh Khalifa's younger brother, Crown Prince Shaykh Mohammad bin Zayid al-Nuhayyan, is expected to succeed him in all posts. Shaykh Mohammad has been the de facto leader and key strategist of UAE foreign and defense policy. Several senior UAE officials are also brothers of Shaykh Mohammad, including Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayid and National Security Advisor Shaykh Tahnoun bin Zayid. The UAE's social tolerance and distribution of wealth have kept the population satisfied with the political system. Emiratis can voice concerns through traditional consultative mechanisms like open majlis councils. UAE leaders oppose Western-style political parties and elections, fearing they could divide tribes, radicalize Islamist factions, and open politics to regional influences. UAE officials oppose the formation of political parties, citing cultural and historical reasons. The country has a 40-seat Federal National Council (FNC) for formal popular representation, with sessions open to the public. The FNC can review and recommend legislation, question ministers, but not enact or veto laws. Seat distribution is weighted in favor of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The UAE has a 40-seat Federal National Council (FNC) with seat distribution favoring Abu Dhabi and Dubai. In 2006, a limited election process was introduced for half of the FNC seats, with 20 remaining appointed. Out of 452 candidates, only one woman was elected. In the 2011 FNC election, out of 468 candidates, only one woman was elected while seven were appointed. The expanded electorate of 129,000 had nearly half female voters, but turnout was low at 25%. The winners were mostly elected along tribal lines, with only one female winner. In 2015, the electorate grew to 225,000 voters, and the process included early and out-of-country voting. In the 2015 FNC election, there were 330 candidates, including 74 women. Turnout was 35%, with one woman elected. Eight women were appointed out of 20 seats. The next FNC elections are scheduled for fall 2019. UAE officials plan to eventually have all 40 seats elected, with half of the members being women starting from the 2019 election. The UAE government has been reviewing procedures for the upcoming election, with some individuals pushing for more political space. In 2011, there were attempts to organize protests using social media, leading to the trial of the \"UAE-5\" activists. The government has targeted Islamists associated with the Muslim Brotherhood, labeling them as a terrorist organization. The UAE government cracked down on Islah, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, accusing it of being funded by the main Brotherhood chapter in Egypt. Several senior Islah members were arrested and had their citizenship revoked. In 2013, 69 UAE nationals were convicted for trying to overthrow the government, and in 2014, 30 individuals, including 20 Egyptians, were convicted for connections to the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2011, the UAE government invested $1.5 billion in utilities infrastructure and implemented reforms to address domestic opposition. Cabinet reshuffles in 2016 and 2017 added young ministers and established new minister of state positions. Other reforms included the formation of an Emirates Foundation for Schools. The UAE government invested in infrastructure and implemented reforms in 2011. In 2016 and 2017, cabinet reshuffles added young ministers and new minister of state positions. Other reforms included the creation of an Emirates Foundation for Schools. The US-UAE strategic alliance has led to downplaying of human rights criticism. US officials promote democracy in the UAE through programs like MEPI, but some democracy promotion efforts have been expelled by the UAE government. The UAE government has closed offices of foreign organizations deemed intrusive into politics. Recent reports highlight human rights issues such as torture, restrictions on freedom of speech, and lack of judicial independence. UAE organizations monitor human rights but their independence is uncertain. UAE officials mentioned reforms in a U.N. Human Rights Council review in January 2018. In a U.N. Human Rights Council review, UAE officials highlighted the formation of a new human rights commission under international standards. The UAE has a significant number of stateless persons known as \"Bidoon\" who lack citizenship due to tribal affiliation issues. The government has increased restrictions on media, especially social media, since the 2011 Arab uprisings. The UAE has established laws to prosecute and jail individuals using information technology to promote dissent, with penalties including imprisonment and life sentences for advocating government overthrow. The Anti-Discrimination Law criminalizes provocative political or religious material, leading to the imprisonment of activists like Ahmed Mansoor. The National Media Council oversees media content, with unclear government standards for licensing. Free Zones in the UAE are exempt from these restrictions. The UAE government imposes restrictions on media, banning journalists and prohibiting distribution of materials on human rights abuses. Research institutes face stricter criteria for license renewal, leading some to leave the country. The UAE has expelled the Rand Corporation and denied entry to critics of its human rights record. Despite this, new UAE-run think tanks have emerged, such as the Emirates Policy Center and the TRENDS Institute. The UAE constitution allows for an independent judiciary, but court decisions can be reviewed and overruled by political leaders. Judicial institutions in the UAE include Sharia courts for criminal and family law matters, and civil courts based on French and Egyptian legal systems. The Federal Supreme Court, established in 1973, resolves disputes between emirates, interprets the constitution, and questions officials for misconduct. The UAE constitution allows for an independent judiciary, with the Federal Supreme Court established in 1973 to resolve disputes between emirates and interpret the constitution. However, a 2012 amendment raised concerns about political influence over the judiciary. Foreign nationals in the judiciary can face deportation threats for judgments against Emiratis. The justice system has faced criticism for cases involving expatriates, including arrests of Western expatriates for beach activities and threats to prosecute a French expatriate for homosexuality after being raped by UAE men. In the UAE, a British academic was detained on spying charges but later pardoned after international outrage. Women's political rights have expanded, allowing them to pass on citizenship to their children. However, they still face legal disadvantages compared to men in divorce and family law cases.

The UAE government has shown religious tolerance by allowing the presence of 40 churches and donating land for more churches, Hindu and Sikh temples. Pope Francis visited in 2019 to advocate for the creation of more churches to accommodate the 1 million Christians in the country. Shia Muslims, making up 15% of the citizen population, are free to worship but face restrictions and government actions due to perceived support for Iran. The UAE has deported foreign Shias and has inconsistent enforcement of laws prohibiting compulsory labor. Foreign laborers have conducted strikes to protest poor working conditions and nonpayment of wages. There are allegations of abuses such as cramped living conditions, passport confiscation, late or denied wages, long working hours, and deportation for complaints. In 2014, foreign laborers striking at a construction site for NYU's branch in Abu Dhabi were arrested, leading to an apology from NYU and compensation for some workers. The UAE has implemented a \"Wages Protection System\" to ensure timely payment of wages to workers. The government penalizes employers who do not comply and requires salaries to be deposited directly in banks. Reforms in 2011 allowed migrant workers to switch employers more easily, leading to higher earnings. The UAE is rated as \"Tier 2\" in the Trafficking in Persons report for 2018, with concerns about human trafficking. The UAE is rated as \"Tier 2\" in the 2018 State Department report for its efforts to combat human trafficking, including implementing reforms to reduce forced labor, increasing prosecutions for labor trafficking, and funding a national action plan. Authorities continue to prosecute sex trafficking offenders and have improved victim protection measures since 2015. The government has also provided assistance to human trafficking victims through shelters in various emirates. The UAE government opened its first shelter for male sexual trafficking victims in 2013 and assists victims through a human rights office at Dubai International Airport. The country has been influenced by its security partnership with the United States, which has provided training, arms, and advice. The UAE is part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and has close defense ties with the United States. The UAE and Saudi Arabia, part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), have a close defense alliance with the United States. The alliance was formed in response to the Iran-Iraq war in 1981. The two countries are aligned in their views on Islamist movements, with UAE leaders supporting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud. This alliance has led to a rift within the GCC, particularly with the isolation of Qatar in 2017. The rift within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has defied mediation efforts by U.S. officials and caused delays in a U.S.-GCC summit aimed at unveiling a \"Middle East Strategic Alliance\" (MESA) to counter Iran. Saudi Arabia and the UAE announced the formation of a \"joint cooperation committee\" as a subgroup of the GCC, while Egypt's refusal to join MESA may be linked to the Administration's support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The rift within the GCC has scuttled plans for a joint military command and naval force. Saudi Arabia invited Qatar to a summit, but Qatar did not attend. Despite the rift, UAE and Saudi Arabia have allowed Qatari commanders in joint security meetings to avoid harming U.S. security interests. Previous rifts were resolved in 2014 with an agreement not to undermine each other's interests. The UAE has had border disputes with Saudi Arabia despite their strategic alliance. A 1974 treaty formalized Saudi access to the Persian Gulf through UAE in exchange for control of villages in the Buraymi oasis. UAE supported a Saudi-led military intervention in Bahrain in 2011. UAE leaders view Iran as a threat and backed the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015 while expressing reservations. The UAE strongly supports the US stance against Iran, including the withdrawal from the JCPOA and reimposition of sanctions. They are committed to ensuring a well-supplied global oil market and intervened in Yemen to counter Iran's regional ambitions. In solidarity with Saudi Arabia, the UAE withdrew its ambassador from Iran in 2016. In February 2016, the UAE took measures against Lebanon due to Hezbollah's ties with Iran, declaring Hezbollah a terrorist organization. UAE's policies in various regions are aimed at weakening Iran. Concerns exist about the large Iranian community in Dubai posing a threat to UAE stability. The UAE has limited transactions with Iran to comply with international sanctions. The UAE government tightened restrictions on transactions with Iran, impacting UAE-Iran trade and the trading community. A dispute over Persian Gulf islands, including the Greater and Lesser Tunb islands and Abu Musa, has led to tensions. The UAE seeks a peaceful resolution through negotiations or international arbitration, with US support. In 2008, the UAE protested Iran's establishment of offices on Abu Musa. Iran's dispute with the UAE over Abu Musa escalated in 2012 when Iranian officials visited the island, undermining diplomatic efforts. In 2014, discussions were held about a possible solution where Iran would cede control of the disputed islands in exchange for rights to the surrounding seabed. Iran reduced its presence on Abu Musa as a confidence-building measure, but no recent discussions have been reported. The UAE enhances its military capabilities through defense cooperation with the US and regional military facilities. It opposes the Muslim Brotherhood and supported the Egyptian military's ousting of President Morsi in 2013. The UAE has provided over $20 billion in assistance to Egypt since then. Intra-GCC differences and disagreements with US policy are evident in post-Qadhafi Libya. In post-Qadhafi Libya, the UAE and Qatar support rival groups. The UAE reportedly provides arms to Field Marshal Khalifa Hafter and his Libyan National Army, in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Hafter leads a coalition fighting Islamist groups and the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord. UAE-based entities have signed agreements with Hafter-aligned forces. In July 2018, UAE-based entities signed agreements with Hafter-aligned oil authorities in eastern Libya to export Libyan oil, violating U.N. Security Council resolutions. Russia and other outside actors have also supported Hafter's advance on Tripoli in April 2019 to unify Libya and counter Islamist militia groups. In August 2014, UAE and Egypt conducted an air strike in Libya against a Muslim Brotherhood-linked militia, criticized by the United States for destabilizing Libya. UAE is part of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS and conducted significant strikes in Syria during 2014-2015. The UAE, the only Arab state allowed by the US to conduct strikes in Syria, also hosted French and Australian forces. Initially supporting rebels to weaken Assad's ally Iran, the UAE accepted Assad's victory after Russia's intervention. UAE leader engaged with Russian leaders, leading to the reopening of the UAE embassy in Damascus after US troop withdrawal announcement. The UAE reopened its embassy in Damascus to reassert Arab influence in counter to Iran's presence in Syria. It is unclear if the UAE will invest in Syrian reconstruction. The UAE has provided aid to Syrian refugees and grants to Jordan for coping with the refugee influx. UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait contributed $2.5 billion to stabilize Jordan's finances in 2018. UAE forces have participated in military exercises in Jordan to protect it from Syria conflict spillover. The UAE's relationship with Iraq has seen ups and downs since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Despite initial support, tensions arose due to the marginalization of Sunnis by the Shia-dominated government. The UAE welcomed a change in leadership in 2014 but did not participate in anti-Islamic State operations, possibly due to Iraq's close ties with Tehran. Recently, the UAE has improved ties with Iraq's Shia leaders to counter Iranian influence and is involved in reconstruction efforts in liberated areas. The UAE has donated $50 million to a fund for stabilizing liberated areas in Iraq and has invested in housing projects.

The UAE has provided $4 billion in aid to Yemen, with $1.25 billion given in 2018. Some of the aid includes infrastructure investments. Congressional opposition to U.S. support for the Arab coalition has grown, leading to the end of refueling for coalition aircraft in November 2018. The killing of Kashoggi has further fueled efforts in Congress to cease U.S. support. The fallout from the Kashoggi killing led to increased congressional efforts to end U.S. support for the coalition in Yemen. The UAE collaborates with U.S. forces to combat Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen. In 2016, U.S. Special Operations Forces, alongside the UAE, defeated AQAP fighters in Mukalla. In 2017, a joint raid with UAE special forces targeted AQAP allies, resulting in the death of a U.S. soldier. In August 2017, UAE and U.S. forces advised Yemen government forces in an operation against AQAP in Shabwa Province. UAE is accused of promoting separatism in south Yemen and has significant control in areas where its forces operate. UAE-led operations, with U.S. assistance, have rescued hostages in Yemen. UAE uses financial and military assets to counter Iranian influence and establish military bases in East Africa. In mid-2015, a UAE-Djibouti dispute led UAE and Saudi forces to use facilities in Eritrea to train pro-government Yemeni forces, potentially violating a U.N. embargo. The UAE helped broker a rapprochement between Eritrea and Ethiopia, culminating in a trilateral summit in Abu Dhabi in July 2018. The UAE pledged $3 billion in investments to Ethiopia, but the Prime Minister of Ethiopia rejected a UAE offer to build an Islamic center. The UAE plans to invest in energy infrastructure linking the two countries. In 2015, the UAE expanded its partnership with Somalia by training special forces to counter terrorist groups. They established a base in Somaliland, leading to a rift with the government in Mogadishu. The UAE was accused of destabilizing Somalia by pressuring them to join the boycott of Qatar. Sudan's leaders were urged to align with GCC countries instead of Iran. Sudanese troops joined the Arab coalition in Yemen, and after Bashir's ousting in 2019, the UAE and Saudi Arabia pledged $3 billion in aid.

The UAE recognized the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan from 1996-2001, despite harboring Al Qaeda leaders. The UAE has informal alignment with Israel against Iran, with reports of diplomatic and security cooperation. Israeli diplomats have attended meetings in the UAE, such as the 2014 IRENA conference. In November 2015, the UAE allowed Israel to establish a diplomatic office in Abu Dhabi for participation in IRENA, indicating a shift from past tensions. Despite formal claims of enforcing the Arab League boycott, there are undisclosed levels of Israel-UAE trade. The UAE ended secondary and tertiary boycotts in 1994, and there are ties between Dubai Ports World and Israeli shipping company Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. Ports World, with ties to Israeli shipping company Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd., visited Israel. The UAE aligns with other Arab states on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, supporting the Palestinian Authority's statehood bid and opposing Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Despite animosity towards Hamas, the UAE supports the Fatah faction. The government may back a Trump peace plan less favorable to Palestinians. The UAE supports the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization and has donated millions of dollars for humanitarian projects in Palestinian territories.

The U.S. prefers to work with the GCC as a bloc for defense sales. The UAE seeks expedited U.S. consideration for arms purchases and may become a key defense partner. Some defense sales to the UAE could depend on their joining the Missile Technology Control Regime. Congressional opposition to U.S. support for UAE operations in Yemen may impact arms sales. The UAE purchased 80 F-16 aircraft in 2000 and an additional 30 in 2013, with associated air-to-ground munitions. The UAE seeks advanced U.S. aircraft like the F-35 to enhance interoperability with U.S. air operations. U.S. officials are considering arms sales to the UAE to signal resolve to Iran, but will not sell the aircraft before Israel receives it to maintain Israel's military edge. The Trump Administration agreed to preliminary talks with the UAE for future procurement of the F-35. The UAE has purchased precision-guided missiles and bombs from the United States, including JDAM kits and GBU bombs for use against the Islamic State and the Houthi rebellion.

The UAE's technology advancements since 2010 have led to concerns about illicit sales of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. Dubai has been identified as a key transfer point for these activities, with companies like SMB Computers and Gulf Technical Industries allegedly involved in transshipping components. Sanctions have been imposed on UAE firms for selling weapons-related technology to Iran under the Iran-Syria Non-Proliferation Act. In 2006, the Commerce Department imposed a licensing requirement on U.S. exports to UAE-based companies for allegedly transshipping devices used in making IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The UAE has spare oil production capacity and exports mainly to Japan and China. Despite plans to increase production, a drop in oil prices and OPEC agreement have likely halted any production increase. The UAE exports large amounts of crude oil, with the largest share going to Japan and China. It has vast natural gas reserves but consumes more than it produces. The UAE has a pipeline arrangement with neighboring countries to import natural gas from Qatar. Political differences with Qatar have led the UAE to explore renewable energy sources. The UAE is securing its oil export routes against potential threats from Iran. In 2012, the UAE completed the Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline, allowing for the transport of 1.5 million barrels per day to Fujairah. The UAE is planning a large refinery near a terminal that can transport 1.5 million barrels per day of crude oil. The government aims to reduce reliance on oil imports by using 21% renewable energy sources by 2021. U.S. trade with the UAE is significant, with over 1,000 U.S. companies and 60,000 Americans working there. U.S. exports to the UAE in 2017 totaled about $20 billion. In 2017, U.S. imports from the UAE were about $4.3 billion, 20% higher than in 2016. U.S. exports to the UAE remained around $20 billion, while imports increased to $5 billion. Goods sold to UAE include commercial aircraft, machinery, and high-value items. Negotiations for a free trade agreement began in 2004 but were later replaced by an Economic Policy Dialogue in 2011. In 2015, U.S. airlines accused UAE airlines of unfair competition due to alleged government subsidies. The UAE receives minimal U.S. foreign assistance, with aid totaling $840,000 in FY2015 and $1.15 million in FY2016. The U.S. airlines want to renegotiate the \"Open Skies Agreement\" with the UAE and Qatar to limit Gulf-based airlines' access to U.S. routes. They claim they are not subsidized and create jobs in the U.S. UAE officials refuse to renegotiate the agreement, and both the Obama Administration and President Trump have not indicated any changes to this stance."
