    "content": "The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, also known as the VPA, includes sections such as short title, findings and purpose, no preemption of State tort law, limitation on liability for volunteers, certification requirement, and definitions. The Congress finds that potential personal liability deters volunteers, leading to a decrease in volunteer participation in various organizations and programs, resulting in diminished community contributions and higher costs. The purpose of this Act is to promote the interests of social service program beneficiaries and taxpayers by encouraging reform of State laws to protect volunteers from personal financial liability when serving with nonprofit organizations and governmental entities. This is to sustain the availability of programs and organizations that rely on volunteer contributions. The Act aims to protect volunteers from personal financial liability while serving with nonprofit organizations and governmental entities, promoting the availability of programs that rely on volunteer contributions. It does not preempt state laws governing tort liability actions. Liability Protection for Volunteers: Volunteers of nonprofit organizations or governmental entities are not personally liable for tort claims unless there is willful misconduct. This does not affect civil actions by organizations against volunteers. Liability protection for volunteers is outlined, stating that volunteers are not personally liable for tort claims unless there is willful misconduct. Exceptions to this protection include adherence to risk management procedures and liability for acts or omissions of volunteers by the organization or entity. Liability protection for volunteers does not apply in certain situations, such as when the volunteer is operating a vehicle requiring insurance, in cases of legal enforcement by government officers, or if the claim is covered by insurance. The protection only applies if the organization provides a secure source of recovery for injured individuals due to volunteer actions. Liability protection for volunteers requires a financially secure source of recovery, such as insurance or alternative arrangements, to cover losses up to a specified amount for actions taken on behalf of the organization. Different standards may apply for various types of liability exposure. SEC. 5. Certification requirement and adjustment of social services block grant program allotments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will increase the fiscal year allotment by 1 percent for states that certify compliance with section 4(a) of the Act. This increase will continue annually if the state maintains compliance with the law. The Act defines key terms such as \"volunteer,\" \"nonprofit organization,\" \"damage or injury,\" and \"State.\" The term \"State\" in the Act includes various entities such as States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories or possessions of the United States."
