    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Health Care Quality Research Improvement Act\". Congress acknowledges the need for improved health care outcomes and cost effectiveness in the healthcare system, especially for children with acute and chronic conditions. There is a lack of quality measures for children's healthcare, despite the increasing number of children with special health care needs in the United States. Children in the healthcare marketplace have unique health attributes that require special attention. Children account for less than 15 percent of national health care spending and are mainly covered by the Federal government. Quality measures for children's health care are lacking compared to adults, necessitating the development of appropriate assessment tools. Delivery structures for children's care differ from those for adults, requiring specific quality measurement and improvement systems. Research on improving care for rare childhood health conditions must be conducted across multiple institutions and practice settings to ensure validity and generalizability of results. This research aims to assist health care providers in improving health outcomes and assist consumers in determining the value of health care products and services. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"high priority areas\" refer to research areas of significant scientific or public policy importance, including those identified by the Conference on Improving Quality of Health Care for Children. These areas must align with defined research areas in the Social Security Act and may focus on all children, specific subgroups, or other criteria as required by the Secretary. \"Local community\" is defined as city, county, and regional governments, and research institutes. Pediatric quality of care and outcomes research involves improving healthcare for children through health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation services. It includes developing better health measures and evaluating healthcare results in real-life settings. This research is conducted by city, county, and regional governments, as well as research institutes. Develop quality improvement tools and evaluate their implementation to establish benchmarks for care for specific childhood diseases, conditions, impairments, or population groups. Develop specific measures of care quality to ensure services are provided appropriately and effectively, responsive to patient needs, and evaluated based on clinical and functional status as well as patient satisfaction. Provider-based research networks are hospital-based, physician practice-based, or managed care-based networks that conduct research to improve the delivery of care for specific childhood diseases or population groups. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. A combination provider-based research network includes hospital-based, physician practice-based, and managed care-based networks conducting research to enhance care for childhood diseases or specific populations. SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF THE HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH WORKFORCE. The Secretary will award at least 10 grants annually to eligible entities across the US for child health services research training programs. Eligible entities must be public or nonprofit private entities. Grants will not exceed $500,000 each, with $5,000,000 authorized for fiscal years 1999 through 2003. Development of Child Health Improvement Research Centers and Provider-Based Research Networks. The Secretary will award grants for the establishment of national centers for excellence in child health improvement research and national child health provider quality improvement research networks at diverse locations in the United States. Entities eligible for grants must be public or nonprofit organizations. Entities eligible for grants must be public or nonprofit organizations with expertise in pediatric quality of care and outcomes research. They must prepare and submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under specific criteria. Entities eligible for grants must demonstrate conducting 2 or more pediatric quality of care and outcomes research projects in high priority areas, effective data collection infrastructure, and matching funds equal to the grant amount. Entities eligible for grants must demonstrate conducting pediatric quality of care and outcomes research projects, data collection infrastructure, and matching funds equal to the grant amount. Grants awarded have limitations on funding amounts and duration, with specific authorization of appropriations for each fiscal year. SEC. 6. RESEARCH IN SPECIFIC HIGH PRIORITY AREAS. The Secretary will provide additional funds for grants to entities with expertise in pediatric quality of care and outcomes research to improve children's health in high priority areas. An advisory committee will be established to evaluate progress and identify new high priority areas. The Secretary will establish an advisory committee with diverse membership, including health care consumers, providers, purchasers, health plans, and representatives from various Federal agencies. The Secretary will establish an advisory committee with diverse membership, including health care consumers, providers, purchasers, health plans, and representatives from various Federal agencies. The advisory committee will evaluate research in high priority areas using criteria such as the generation of research with short and long term studies, fostering public and private partnerships, and the likelihood of findings being rapidly implemented into practice. $12,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2003 for carrying out this section. Improving child health data and developing better data collection systems is the focus of Section 7. The Secretary will assist Federal agencies in conducting surveys to provide national estimates of health care expenditures, access, and satisfaction for children, including those who are uninsured, poor, or have special health care needs. This aims to enhance understanding of health outcomes and functional status among children with special needs. The Secretary will award grants to public and nonprofit entities to improve child health monitoring at the community level. Entities must meet eligibility criteria to receive these grants. Entities eligible for grants must be public or nonprofit and submit an application to the Secretary. $14,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 1999 through 2003, with specific allocations for different types of grants. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within a specified time frame on progress in pediatric quality of care and outcomes research, including ongoing research, programs, technical needs, and funding priorities."
