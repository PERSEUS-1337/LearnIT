    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 18120 of the Penal Code in California prohibits individuals under a gun violence restraining order from possessing firearms or ammunition. The court must order the restrained person to surrender all firearms and ammunition in their possession upon issuance of the restraining order. The surrender of firearms and ammunition under a gun violence restraining order in California must be done immediately upon request of a law enforcement officer or within 24 hours of being served with the order. This can be done by surrendering to the officer, local law enforcement agency, selling to a licensed firearms dealer, or transferring to a licensed firearms dealer. Section 29830 requires a receipt to be issued when surrendering firearms or ammunition under a gun violence restraining order in California. The person must surrender all firearms and ammunition within 48 hours of being served with the order. To comply with a gun violence restraining order in California, the individual must surrender all firearms and ammunition within 48 hours of being served with the order. They must file the original receipt showing surrender with the court and a copy with the law enforcement agency that served the order. Failure to do so constitutes a violation of the restraining order. Any firearms or ammunition surrendered to law enforcement under a gun violence restraining order must be retained until the order expires. Unclaimed firearms or ammunition are subject to specific requirements. A restrained person can sell or transfer firearms and ammunition to a licensed dealer if in custody of law enforcement. If someone else claims ownership of surrendered firearms, they can be returned if deemed the lawful owner. Any person prohibited from owning firearms can transfer them to a licensed dealer for storage during the prohibition period. The dealer may charge a reasonable fee for the storage. A firearms dealer storing firearms or ammunition must notify the Department of Justice. Any firearm returned to the owner must follow specific procedures. Cities, counties, state agencies can impose charges for firearm or ammunition seizure, storage, or release. The fee for firearm or ammunition storage and surrendering possession to a licensed dealer should not exceed actual costs. Administrative costs may be waived if the firearm was reported stolen. Charges for administrative costs must be paid by the person claiming title to the firearm. The charges for a hearing or appeal related to the removal, impound, storage, or release of a firearm or ammunition shall be imposed only upon the person requesting it. Costs for a hearing or appeal related to the release of a firearm or ammunition shall not be charged to the legal owner unless they voluntarily request it. A legal owner cannot be required to request a post-storage hearing for the release of the firearm or ammunition. No reimbursement is required for this act as local agencies or school districts can levy charges to cover the mandated program or service."
