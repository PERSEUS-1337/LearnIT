    "content": "Congress is focused on ensuring that young people are well-educated and prepared for the workforce, especially with the retirement of the Baby Boomer generation. Challenges exist for vulnerable youth populations, such as low-income families and high school dropouts, in completing school and finding employment. Employment levels for youth under 25 have declined since 2000, but workforce attachment has improved post-recession. Federal job training programs and policies aim to help vulnerable youth populations overcome barriers to education and employment. Programs like Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, and the Reentry Employment Opportunities (REO) program offer various services and support. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) replaced the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) in 2014, making significant amendments to youth programs. This report provides an overview of federal employment programs for vulnerable young people, starting from the 1930s to the present day. It discusses the four youth programs authorized under WIOA and the options available to young people after high school. Youth without a high school diploma face limited opportunities, such as not being able to enroll in a four-year college or enlist in the military. Dropping out of school leads to lower employment rates and earnings. Higher education levels result in lower unemployment rates and higher earnings. In 2015, workers with less than a high school degree had an 8.0% unemployment rate and $493 weekly earnings, compared to workers with a high school degree who had a 5.4% unemployment rate and $678 weekly earnings. Workers with a bachelor's degree had a 2.8% unemployment rate and $1,137 weekly earnings. Many new jobs in the knowledge-based economy require some college education or better. In the current economy, many new jobs will require some college education or better, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The costs of dropping out extend beyond individual job opportunities and lower wages, impacting society with lost tax revenue and increased welfare payments. Federal youth employment programs aim to provide job training and educational services to help at-risk youth become economically self-sufficient and achieve their goals. Federal youth employment programs aim to help at-risk youth become economically self-sufficient and achieve their career and academic goals, emphasizing leadership development and community service. The extent of support provided by state workforce and other dollars is unclear. The federal government has a history of assisting young people in securing employment and academic success, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged or face barriers to education. During the Great Depression, programs focused on employing idle young men in public works projects with an educational component to encourage high school diploma attainment. Starting in the 1960s, federal funding for youth employment programs increased. Federal government funding for youth programs, such as Job Corps, began in the 1960s to address the needs of low-income youth for job training, education, housing, and support services. Programs expanded in the 1970s and 1980s, with additional funding for in-school and out-of-school youth. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act continued to provide job training and education services for at-risk teenagers and young adults up to age 24. During the Great Depression, federal programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) were created to employ and educate young people at risk of dropping out of school due to financial difficulties. The CCC provided employment for unemployed males ages 18 to 25 in projects focused on infrastructure, transportation, and recreational services. Participants lived in camps and received allowances, food, medical care, and educational opportunities. During the Great Depression, federal programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) were created to employ and educate young people at risk of dropping out of school due to financial difficulties. The National Youth Administration, part of the Works Progress Administration, provided part-time employment for needy high school, college, and graduate students, as well as unemployed out-of-school youth aged 16-25, in various fields like construction and clerical work. These programs served hundreds of thousands of youth before ending in the early 1940s. In the 1960s, federal efforts aimed to assist poor and disadvantaged youth through job training programs. The Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 and subsequent amendments authorized funding for employment training, with a focus on helping youth successfully enter the labor force. President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty established new youth-targeted programs in job training. Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty created the Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) to provide job training and educational assistance to low-income youth. The NYC included work training programs, the Work Study program for high school and college students from low-income families, and Job Corps for disadvantaged youth. Job Corps continues to offer educational and job training opportunities today. The 1973 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA, P.L. 93-203) and subsequent laws focused on youth employment and training, including the Youth Employment and Demonstrations Project Act (YEDPA, P.L. 95-93) and the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA, P.L. 97-300). The School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994 (STWOA, P.L. 103-239) supported programs for students to gain occupational skills. These activities were administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Education (ED). CETA authorized various employment and training programs for adults and youth, including Job Corps and SPEDY for low-income youth aged 14-21. YEDPA amended CETA in 1977, increasing funding for Job Corps and SPEDY, and introducing three new programs for economically disadvantaged youth: YETP, YCCIP, and Youth Incentive. YEDPA introduced programs like YETP, YCCIP, and YIEPP to address youth unemployment disparities. These programs ran from 1977 to 1981 during the Carter Administration, serving 6.1 million youth. YETP focused on immediate employment needs with work experience and pre-employment skills, while YCCIP aimed to help out-of-school youth obtain a high school degree through work and school performance. The YIEPP program aimed to improve coordination between job training and education systems to address the dropout problem. YIEPP funded evaluations for demonstration programs along with more than 60 major demonstrations funded during the YEDPA years. JTPA, which replaced CETA in 1982, emphasized state and local responsibility for administering job training programs until FY1999, focusing on economically disadvantaged youth and adults. The JTPA programs, including the Summer Youth Employment and Training program, Youth Training Program, and Job Corps, aimed to assist economically disadvantaged youth and adults facing barriers to employment. The Summer Youth Employment program provided training and work opportunities for low-income youth aged 14-21, while the Youth Training Program targeted school dropouts and provided year-round services. The JTPA programs aimed to assist economically disadvantaged youth and adults facing barriers to employment. The program provided year-round services, including on-the-job training, tutoring, and job search assistance. Participants had to be economically disadvantaged youth ages 16 through 21, with 50% out of school and 65% hard to serve. In program year 1997, an estimated 107,000 youth participated. JTPA was replaced by WIA. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act (STWOA) program, funded from FY1994 through FY2000, supported work-based learning, school-based learning, and program coordination. STWOA grants were awarded to states, local partnerships, programs for Indian youth, and U.S. territories. Some programs continue to operate today. STWOA was replaced by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA). The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 replaced the School-to-Work Opportunities Act program, authorizing job training, adult education, employment services, and vocational rehabilitation. Funding was provided through FY2003, with subsequent appropriations. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) replaced WIA in 2014, signed into law by President Obama. WIOA includes similar titles for job training, adult education, employment services, and vocational rehabilitation. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) authorizes job training programs for youth and other workers, including the Youth Activities Program, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. Job Corps was established in 1964 and YouthBuild focuses on construction trades education. The YouthBuild program, originally authorized under the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1992, was later transferred to the Department of Labor in 2007. The program provides job training and other services for juvenile and adult offenders under the Reentry Employment Opportunities (REO) program, funded through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and the Second Chance Act. The program is administered by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA). The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) administers four programs that offer employment, job training, and educational services to vulnerable youth. The programs include Youth Activities, YouthBuild, Job Corps, and the Reentry Employment Opportunities program. Participants in YouthBuild and Job Corps must be low-income with specified barriers to employment, while the Youth Activities program serves out-of-school youth who do not have to be low-income. Job Corps is the only program that provides residential services, including onsite living, health care, child care, and other supports. The Reentry Employment Opportunities program serves youth involved in the justice system or at risk. Funding for youth programs varies, with DOL allocating funds based on a formula and Job Corps entering contracts with organizations. WIOA Youth program and other programs offer job training and employment opportunities for youth, with varying levels of formalization in different communities. The WIOA program encourages coordination among programs and includes representatives with expertise in addressing youth employment, training, and education needs. State workforce boards are responsible for implementing WIOA programs and allocating funds to local WDBs. States must submit a strategic vision for preparing a skilled workforce, including youth and individuals with barriers to employment. Local WDBs receiving funds for Youth Activities program must include these activities in their local plans. Local workforce boards receiving funds for the Youth Activities program must describe and assess youth workforce investment activities, including those for youth with disabilities. They are required to identify successful models and may establish a standing committee for planning services. Job Corps and YouthBuild are partners at one-stop centers operated by local WDBs. WIOA provides funding authorization for youth employment and job training programs from FY2015 through FY2019. Funds for youth programs under Title I of the act are available for obligation based on a program year starting in July and ending in June. Youth Activities funds may be available in April for the following program year. Job Corps funds are typically available for one program year, with certain exceptions. Youth Activities funds can be spent by states over the program year and the two following years. The funds for youth programs under Title I of the act are available for obligation based on a program year starting in July and ending in June. Job Corps funds are typically available for one program year. Local areas may expend funds received from the state during the program year and the succeeding program year. Congress appropriated a total of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion annually for youth job training and employment programs from FY2000 through FY2016. Job Corps has generally received the largest appropriation each year, followed by the Youth program, YouthBuild, and the youth component of the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders. In FY2016, funding for youth job training and employment programs totaled $2.7 billion, with increases for the Youth and YouthBuild programs but decreases for the Reentry Employment Opportunities and Job Corps programs. This funding was allocated through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113). In FY2014, funding for youth programs totaled $2.6 billion, with increases for the Youth, YouthBuild, and Reentry Employment Opportunities programs. Job Corps funding remained level. Appropriations for FY2014 were delayed, leading to a government shutdown. Temporary funding was provided through H.R. 2775 and P.L. 113-46, with further extensions through P.L. 113-73. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) was signed into law to fund appropriations through September 30, 2014. The Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) allocated $2.6 billion for youth job training and employment programs. The Youth Activities program, now under WIOA, is one of three formula grant programs targeting youth, adults, and dislocated workers. WIOA aims to provide coordinated employment and training services overseen by state workforce development boards. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) aims to provide assistance to youth in achieving academic and employment success through a unified state plan developed by the governor with input from the state workforce development board. This plan addresses employment and training needs, performance accountability, and activities for youth, adults, and dislocated workers every four years. It focuses on preparing an educated and skilled workforce, including youth with barriers to employment, and outlines criteria for awarding contracts for youth services. The local workforce development board oversees the criteria for awarding contracts for youth services, considering providers' ability to meet performance measures based on primary indicators. Membership includes representatives from various organizations with expertise in addressing the needs of eligible youth. The local workforce development board oversees the criteria for awarding contracts for youth services, considering providers' ability to meet performance measures based on primary indicators. Membership includes representatives from various organizations with expertise in addressing the needs of eligible youth. Local boards competitively award funds to local organizations to provide employment and job training services to youth, based on state plan criteria and performance accountability measures. Funding may be awarded on a sole-source basis if there are insufficient eligible providers, with the ability to terminate providers' eligibility \"for cause\". The curr_chunk discusses the one-stop delivery system in the local area under WIOA, emphasizing the importance of youth access to services. It highlights the role of the Youth Activities program as a partner in the one-stop system and the need for specialized centers to address youth needs. The local board is responsible for involving parents and stakeholders in program design and may establish a committee for assistance. The local board may establish a standing committee to assist with planning and operational issues related to providing services to youth, including selecting youth providers. The committee may recommend policy direction for program design, workforce development, resource leveraging, and coordination among organizations serving youth. Funding for the Youth Activities program is also discussed. Funding for the Youth Activities program under WIOA is allocated from DOL to states, including outlying areas. A portion is reserved for Native American youth programs, with the rest distributed to states based on a formula considering unemployment rates and disadvantaged youth population. Under WIOA, funding for the Youth Activities program is allocated to states based on specific criteria. States must use these funds for specified activities, with a maximum of 15% reserved for statewide activities. Monitoring and oversight activities are required, including reviews comparing program effectiveness. The Youth Activities program under WIOA allocates funding to states based on specific criteria, with a portion going to local workforce development areas. Local areas have minimum and maximum funding limits, with a cap on administrative costs. Job training and employment programs funded by WIOA must provide direct services to youth participants. The Youth Activities program under WIOA funds job training and employment programs for youth participants. Programs must assess skills, develop service strategies linked to employment goals, and provide specific services. Table 3 outlines the 14 required elements, including educational achievement, employment services, leadership development, and additional support. Local boards must offer a full array of services to each youth. Local boards must provide youth with information on available services, refer them to training programs, and allocate 20% of funds for work experiences. Individual youth do not need to participate in all program elements, and partner organizations can provide additional activities closely coordinated with the program. WIOA specifies that youth aged 14-24 are eligible for the Activities program, with a focus on serving out-of-school youth. Up to 5% of in-school youth may also be eligible for additional assistance. Local programs must coordinate with partners to ensure high-quality activities for youth participants. WIOA requires in-school and out-of-school youth to be low-income, with exceptions for up to 5% of out-of-school youth. Youth ages 18-21 can enroll in Youth Activities or Adult Activities programs. Six primary indicators of performance apply to all youth, regardless of age, starting PY2016. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) requires states to agree with the Department of Labor (DOL) on performance levels for various indicators, including earnings in unsubsidized employment, postsecondary credential attainment, and skill gains for program participants. These performance levels are based on specified factors and are compared with other states. The Job Corps program, operated by the Office of Job Corps within DOL, aims to provide disadvantaged youth with skills for successful careers in various sectors or the Armed Forces. Currently, there are 125 Job Corps centers nationwide. Job Corps centers, including Civilian Conservation Corps Centers, are located in every state and Puerto Rico. These centers focus on conserving natural resources and public recreational areas. They offer dormitories, classrooms, workshops, health centers, and career services buildings. Centers must adhere to detailed guidelines outlined in the Policy and Requirements Handbook. Job Corps centers, authorized under WIOA, can be operated by various entities. New centers are selected through a competitive process based on their ability to provide training reflecting local job opportunities and strong fiscal controls. Applicants must demonstrate coordination with the workforce system and relationships with stakeholders. The Job Corps centers, authorized under WIOA, are selected through a competitive process based on their ability to provide training reflecting local job opportunities and strong fiscal controls. Students at Job Corps centers receive education programs, work experience, and personal allowances. Transition allowances are incentive-based to reflect the graduate's completion of academic and career training. Students experience the program in four stages. Students at Job Corps centers go through four stages in the program. They start by learning about the program and center, then move on to career preparation activities. Next, they focus on career development, learning various skills and subjects related to specific trades. Finally, they participate in career transition services to help them secure full-time jobs related to their training. Job Corps provides placement services for graduates in full-time jobs related to their training or higher education programs. Graduates receive transition support and workplace counseling for one year after exiting the program. Some may continue in an advanced career training program for an additional year. DOL contracts with outreach and admissions contractors to recruit students to the program. Job Corps centers work closely with DOL-contracted career transition services providers to help graduates find placement in jobs related to their training. Each center director establishes relationships with employers, one-stop centers, local boards, apprenticeship programs, and youth programs. Workforce councils are formed with private sector employers, labor organizations, and other stakeholders to support youth employment opportunities. The Job Corps program involves youth, labor organizations, employees, and graduates. The program works with local workforce development boards to provide education and training recommendations. Contracts are awarded to operate centers based on ranked scores. Job Corps participants must be ages 16-24, low-income, and meet specific criteria. Funding for Civilian Conservation Centers is transferred to the USDA. Job Corps participants must meet specific criteria to be eligible, including being skills deficient, a school dropout, homeless, a runaway, a foster child, a parent, a victim of trafficking, or in need of additional education or vocational training. Veterans are also eligible if they meet the criteria, with exceptions for income earned in the military. Job Corps centers consider various factors when selecting participants, such as educational and vocational needs and ability to engage in group settings. The Job Corps program requires applicants to pass a background check and adhere to a zero-tolerance policy for violence, drug use, and other behaviors. Students must be assigned to a center that offers their chosen career and technical education. The Job Corps program requires applicants to pass a background check and adhere to a zero-tolerance policy for violence, drug use, and other behaviors. Enrollees are assigned to the nearest center offering their chosen career and technical education. Participants are limited to two years in the program, with exceptions for certain circumstances outlined in the WIOA. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) directs the Department of Labor (DOL) to establish performance levels for the Youth Workforce Activities program. These performance indicators include entry into education or employment, median earnings, obtaining credentials, program effectiveness in serving employers, and more. WIOA also specifies performance measures for recruiters and contractors. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) requires the Department of Labor (DOL) to report on the performance of Job Corps centers, including demographic information, outcomes of graduates, costs, facility conditions, and community service activities. High-performing centers are designated based on their performance indicators for youth, allowing them to compete for operating awards. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) mandates that Job Corps centers must meet performance levels or face a performance improvement plan (PIP) which includes actions like providing technical assistance, changing training programs, replacing staff, reducing capacity, relocating, or closing the center. DOL can establish additional PIPs for non-compliance, and may not renew agreements with underperforming operators. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) mandates that Job Corps centers must meet performance levels or face a performance improvement plan (PIP) which includes actions like providing technical assistance, changing training programs, replacing staff, reducing capacity, relocating, or closing the center. DOL may not renew agreements with underperforming operators if they rank in the lowest 10% for two consecutive years and fail to achieve 50% or higher in performance indicators for eligible youth. Renewals may be allowed under certain circumstances, with specified standards to be met, and DOL must inform Congress of such renewals. If a center fails to meet performance levels, DOL must select another entity to operate it. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) mandates that Job Corps centers must meet performance levels or face closure if performance does not improve after three years. DOL must announce closure plans publicly, allow for a 30-day comment period, and notify the relevant Member of Congress. Additionally, a third-party evaluation of the program is required every five years. The evaluation of the program under WIOA must assess its overall effectiveness, performance measures, service delivery structure, community impact, and meeting demographic needs. Reports to Congress must include financial oversight measures, budgetary information, and explanations for exceeding contract expenditures. Reports are required every six months for three years, then annually for two years. YouthBuild program under WIOA requires DOL to submit reports to Congress on effectiveness, budget, and addressing any shortfalls. YouthBuild was transferred to DOL in 2007 under the YouthBuild Transfer Act. The program aims to provide disadvantaged youth with education, employment skills, and leadership opportunities in low-income communities. The YouthBuild program under WIOA aims to support community development among youth in low-income areas, increase affordable housing for homeless individuals, and enhance energy efficiency in nonprofit facilities. DOL awards funds to eligible organizations to implement the program in collaboration with subgrantees or contractors. Eligible entities include public or private nonprofit agencies, community-based organizations, and faith-based organizations. The YouthBuild program under WIOA supports community development among youth in low-income areas by providing education and workforce investment activities, including instruction, skill building, mentoring, and housing rehabilitation. The program aims to increase affordable housing for homeless individuals and assist them in achieving independent living. The YouthBuild program under WIOA supports community development among youth in low-income areas by providing education and workforce investment activities. Participants must engage in work and skill development activities for at least 40% of the time, and education and related services for an additional 50% of the time. Training and supports may be provided in additional industry sectors if approved by the DOL Secretary. The YouthBuild program supports community development among youth in low-income areas by providing education and workforce investment activities. Eligible youth are ages 16-24 and come from low-income families, foster care, youth offenders, individuals with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. Up to 25% of participants are not required to meet income or dropout criteria if they are basic skills deficient or referred by a high school for diploma purposes. Grants are competitively awarded to organizations based on various factors. The YouthBuild program provides skills training, leadership development, and education to participants. Grantees must coordinate activities with stakeholders such as employers and one-stop partners. DOL awards grants for three years, with a requirement for matching funds. YouthBuild grantees must meet performance indicators for eligible youth, including entry into education or employment, median earnings, and obtaining credentials. Under the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, DOL has funded grants for education and employment activities for youth offenders since FY1999. The Second Chance Act authorizes DOL to provide mentoring, job training, job placement services, and transitional services to help eligible offenders ages 18 and older in obtaining and retaining employment. The Reentry Employment Opportunities program, funded under the authority of Section 169 of WIOA and the Second Chance Act, supports education and reentry initiatives for youth offenders and at-risk youth. It provides pre-release, mentoring, housing, case management, and employment services to help reduce violence in schools and offer alternative education for youth at risk of justice system involvement. The DOL initiatives for youth offenders, known as the Youth Offender Demonstration Project (YODP), funded projects to assist at-risk youth in finding long-term employment. These projects included education-related grants, apprenticeship programs, reentry initiatives, and grants focusing on beneficiary choice and high growth opportunities. The FY2016 appropriations support the Pathways to Justice Careers program, providing mentoring and career training for at-risk youth aged 16 to 21. Grantees include local and state governments, nonprofit organizations, school districts, and community colleges. The FY2016 appropriations fund career training using a pathways model for at-risk youth in school, aiming to help them graduate and pursue further education. A reentry program for young adults focuses on mentoring, apprenticeships, and occupational training. DOL plans to evaluate the program's effectiveness. The REO initiatives target at-risk youth aged 14 and older involved in gangs or the justice system. Grants are awarded competitively to organizations and agencies, with funding ranging from $1 million to $5 million. DOL has set performance measures for each initiative. The REO initiatives focus on at-risk youth aged 14 and older involved in gangs or the justice system. DOL has three performance measures for each initiative: degree or certificate attainment, literacy and numeracy, and placement in jobs or education for out-of-school participants aged 18 or older."
