    "content": "The \"Savings in Construction Act of 1996\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and Executive Order 12770 require Federal agencies to use the metric system in procurement and construction projects to align with the policy of converting to the metric system in the United States. Amendments are needed to ensure that using specific metric components in construction projects does not increase the cost of Federal buildings to taxpayers, despite the exemption provided by the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 4 of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205c) is amended to include definitions such as 'full and open competition', 'total installed price', and 'hard-metric'. The curr_chunk defines terms related to cost or pricing data, Federal facilities, and their locations. The curr_chunk specifies the types of federal facilities where certain construction projects are excluded, such as river, harbor, housing, military installations, Department of Veteran Affairs facilities, and Federal prisons. This exclusion does not apply to specific federal buildings or construction projects deemed necessary by the President in the public interest. The curr_chunk specifies that construction projects excluded from certain federal facilities must be justified in the public interest or owned by a State government, local government, Indian tribe, or private entity. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 is amended to include a new section on the implementation of metric units in the acquisition of construction services and materials for federal facilities. The procurement of construction services and materials for Federal facilities must adhere to specific policies and procedures outlined in various statutes. Design methods should be determined based on market research requirements. If conflicts arise, the provisions of relevant statutes take precedence. Federal agencies may require specifications for concrete masonry structures to be in metric units, but cannot mandate hard-metric versions unless specific criteria are met. Federal agencies can mandate hard-metric concrete masonry units if two criteria are met: they must fit into 100 millimeter building modules and have a total installed price equal to or less than non-hard-metric units. Price estimates should be based on actual offers for comparable projects, with an explanation of the factors used for the estimates. Federal agencies may require specifications for recessed lighting fixtures to be in the metric system, but not hard-metric versions unless industry standards or contract requirements dictate otherwise. The Savings in Construction Act of 1996 allows for the repair or replacement of parts of Federal facilities. Applications for hard-metric recessed lighting fixtures must coordinate dimensionally into 100 millimeter building modules and have a total installed price equal to or less than non-hard-metric fixtures. Total installed price estimates should be based on cost data or price analysis. The Savings in Construction Act of 1996 allows for the repair or replacement of parts of Federal facilities using hard-metric and non-hard-metric offers for comparable projects. The head of the agency must explain the factors used for price estimates. Federal contracts for construction products outside the US are exempt from certain provisions, and these provisions will expire 10 years after the Act's effective date. SEC. 5. OMBUDSMAN. Section 14 of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 is amended to include a subsection requiring executive agencies awarding construction contracts to designate a construction metrication ombudsman to address complaints related to the use of the metric system in Federal building projects. The construction metrication ombudsman, independent of the contracting officer, ensures practical implementation of the metric system in Federal building projects. They respond to complaints within 60 days and make recommendations for resolution. The ombudsman evaluates agency compliance with policies, ensures competition for hard-metric products, and considers total installed price to the Federal Government. After the agency head decides on recommendations, the ombudsman communicates the decision to relevant personnel, monitors implementation, and may make further recommendations. The ombudsman's recommendations and supporting documentation must be provided to affected parties and the public promptly. This section does not override the bid protest process in title 31 of the United States Code. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. This Act and its amendments will take effect 90 days after enactment. The Act will not apply to contracts awarded before the effective date unless a Federal agency head determines it is in the public interest to apply certain provisions."
