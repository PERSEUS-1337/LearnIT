    "content": "Mongolia, a mineral-rich nation between Russia and China, transitioned from Soviet satellite state to democracy in 1990. Congress has supported Mongolia through various programs and resolutions. Mongolia's parliament is partnered with the U.S. House Democracy Partnership. The U.S. House of Representatives supports the development of legislative institutions in Mongolia, emphasizing common values and interests in democracy and human rights. Mongolia, a former Communist nation, sees itself as a model for democratic transitions in Central Asia and beyond. President Obama praised Mongolia's democratic achievements and economic progress as a positive example of reform. Mongolia's economic liberalization and positive reforms make it a significant example for the world. With untapped mineral wealth worth $1.3 trillion, the United States aims to strengthen investment opportunities for U.S. businesses. Mongolia's contributions to international peacekeeping, support for U.S. positions, and stance on nuclear non-proliferation highlight its diplomatic importance. As a nation with relations with both North and South Korea, Mongolia actively promotes peace. Mongolia, with diplomatic relations with both North and South Korea, supports peace on the Korean Peninsula. It has a majority Tibetan Buddhist population and close ties to the Dalai Lama. Mongolia transitioned from one-party Communist rule to a multi-party parliamentary democracy in 1990. Mongolia transitioned to a multi-party parliamentary democracy in 1990, establishing a directly-elected presidency and a unicameral legislature. The country has held multiple free and fair elections, reaffirming its commitment to democracy and human rights. The State Department noted in 2013 that Mongolia generally respected freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. Mongolia's democratic development is a work in progress, with serious human rights issues such as police abuse, corruption, and lack of government transparency highlighted by the State Department in 2013. Corruption is seen as a significant obstacle to democratic and economic growth. Concerns exist about the need for a strong Mongolian democracy to maintain neutrality and sovereignty in the face of powerful neighbors like China and Russia. In a USAID-supported survey in May 2013, 69.1% of Mongolian business community encountered corruption in public sector tenders, with 62.4% believing government efforts to control corruption were ineffective. Transparency International ranked Mongolia 83rd out of 177 countries in corruption perceptions index. Other concerns include arbitrary arrests and poor governance. In April 2012, Mongolia's Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) arrested former President Nambaryn Enkhbayar on charges of corruption and fraud, making him the most high-profile figure in Mongolia to face such allegations. Former President Nambaryn Enkhbayar of Mongolia faced corruption charges, sparking debate on accountability for politically powerful figures. His arrest, denounced as politically motivated, occurred before parliamentary elections. Enkhbayar's son criticized the government's actions as a purge to sideline his father from politics. Enkhbayar leads the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, formed in 2011 after a name change from the original MPRP. Former President Nambaryn Enkhbayar of Mongolia was arrested before parliamentary elections, making him ineligible to run for office. He was convicted and sentenced to prison, with his supporters alleging official abuses. International figures, including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern about the government's treatment of him. Former President Nambaryn Enkhbayar of Mongolia was pardoned in 2013 due to ill health and released from prison. The pardon was seen as a strategic move to deflect accusations of partisanship in anti-corruption measures. Enkhbayar later traveled to South Korea for medical treatment and is reportedly planning a political comeback. Former President Nambaryn Enkhbayar of Mongolia, pardoned in 2013 due to ill health, is planning a political comeback. A new criminal fraud investigation was initiated against him in August 2014 related to a building purchase for his political party. Mongolia's presidential elections are held every four years, with the next one scheduled for 2017. The President serves as head of state, commander in chief of the armed forces, and head of the National Security Council. The State Great Hural in Mongolia has 76 members, with 48 elected by majority system and 28 nominated by parties based on votes. The speaker is chosen by members and serves as second in state hierarchy. The winning party nominates the Prime Minister, who then selects Cabinet members for parliament approval. The State Great Hural in Mongolia has 76 members, with 48 elected by majority system and 28 nominated by parties based on votes. The speaker is chosen by members and serves as second in state hierarchy. The winning party nominates the Prime Minister, who then selects Cabinet members for parliament approval. The Mongolian People's Party (MPP) has won three presidential elections since 1992 and the most seats in four parliamentary elections. The Democratic Party has controlled key positions since 2012, leading a coalition government in the most recent parliamentary election in June 2012. Mongolia's vast mineral wealth, estimated at $1.3 trillion, could lead to increased prosperity if managed well. However, the country is currently facing challenges such as declining foreign investment, weak mineral exports, high inflation, and non-performing loans in the banking sector. The World Bank has called for a structural shift in Mongolia's economic policy framework to address issues like non-performing loans in the banking sector, tighter monetary policy, better enforcement of lending regulations, and prudent resource revenue management. Mongolia faces challenges related to avoiding the natural resource curse, including currency pressures, government budget concerns, corruption, and environmental degradation. Economists believe Mongolia is experiencing some of these issues but not yet fully in the throes of the curse. Mongolia faces challenges in avoiding the natural resource curse, balancing legal guarantees for foreign investors with popular pressure, and overcoming constraints related to its land-locked status and limited transportation networks. Mongolia's main railway is a single-track, running 690 miles from the Russian border to the Chinese border. The government is constructing a new rail line to transport coal from the Gobi desert to China, aiming to reduce economic dependence on Russia and China. Trade between Mongolia and China is significantly higher than with Russia, with Chinese investment accounting for a third of total foreign direct investment in Mongolia. Mongolia's reliance on China for trade and investment leaves it vulnerable to slower growth in China, prompting efforts to attract foreign investment for mineral exploitation and economic diversification. Officials and Members of Parliament in Mongolia have expressed concerns about completed investments, including the terms of the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine project. The regulatory environment for foreign investment in Mongolia has been described as chaotic and unpredictable, with new laws sometimes seen as limiting foreign investors' rights. Investors in Mongolia are worried about policies that protect the country's interests but may not fully respect commitments. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) fell by 55% in 2013 due to uncertainties in the regulatory framework and slower growth in China. Concerns also arise from delays in the Oyu Tolgoi mine project. In response to investor concerns and pressure from the U.S. government, Mongolia passed a new investment law in October 2013 and signed a transparency agreement with the United States in September 2013. The 2013 Investment Law replaced previous laws and aimed to improve the country's investment climate. Under the new investment law in Mongolia, foreign private investment no longer requires approvals, and investments are allowed in most sectors except for prohibited ones like narcotics, gambling, and pornography. State-owned foreign companies must seek approval for investments over 33% in certain sectors. The law also offers legal guarantees for investments, including a stable tax environment for up to 18 years. The U.S. Embassy in Mongolia has noted investor complaints about regulatory obstacles for foreign investors, such as increased minimum capital requirements. Despite signing the \"Agreement on Transparency in Matters Related to International Trade and Investment\" with the United States in 2013, the Mongolian parliament has yet to ratify it, causing concern for restoring confidence in businesses. The transparency agreement between Mongolia and the United States aims to restore confidence in statutory and regulatory processes affecting commerce and trade. It includes commitments to publish proposed laws and regulations in English, allow public comment, provide advance notice for comments, combat bribery and corruption, and publish all adopted laws and regulations in English. This should make it easier for U.S. and other foreign enterprises to do business in Mongolia. The transparency agreement between Mongolia and the United States aims to facilitate business and investment by requiring English translations of laws and regulations. Some in Mongolia see the English language requirement as burdensome, while others view it as a step towards a potential free-trade agreement with the United States. Mongolia's first FTA is expected to be with Japan, with major mineral deposits like Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi attracting attention for their potential profits and foreign investment indicators. The U.S. government has a strong interest in Tavan Tolgoi due to involvement of U.S. company Peabody Energy. The Oyu Tolgoi project, known as \"OT,\" is the second-largest copper deposit globally. A multi-billion dollar agreement was signed in 2009 for joint development by Ivanhoe Mines (now Turquoise Hill Resources), Rio Tinto Group, and the Government of Mongolia. Construction started in 2010, with production commencing in June 2013. Disputes over financing Phase II have stalled progress, casting doubt on Mongolia's commitment to contracts. The U.S. Embassy sees Oyu Tolgoi as a key indicator of foreign investment in Mongolia. The Tavan Tolgoi deposit, known as \"TT,\" contains 6.4 billion metric tons of coal, including the world's largest untapped deposit of coking coal. In 2008, the Mongolian parliament authorized negotiations with investors for development rights. In 2011, six bidders were shortlisted for the West Tsankhi block, including Peabody Energy and other international firms. However, concerns over Mongolia's commitment to contracts have led to a drop in foreign direct investment since 2012. In 2013, Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi LLC decided to mine West Tsankhi by itself, but may still consider partnerships with international mining companies. Mongolia's foreign policy emphasizes non-participation in military alliances and has gained goodwill for its contributions to coalition operations and UN peacekeeping missions. Mongolia has been a key ally in coalition operations, deploying troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States values Mongolia's contributions and issued a joint vision statement for the U.S.-Mongolia security relationship in 2014. The United States commends Mongolia for its willingness to continue contributing personnel to coalition forces in Afghanistan after 2014. Mongolia and Alaska have a partnership under the State Partnership Program, with Alaskan National Guard soldiers serving as advisors for Mongolian troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mongolia has also been actively contributing military personnel to United Nations Peacekeeping Missions. Mongolia is the 27th largest contributor of military and police personnel to UN Peacekeeping Operations, with 10% of its armed forces serving overseas in peacekeeping missions. Past missions include Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Georgia. The US supports Mongolia's global peacekeeping efforts and joint military exercises are held annually. The US and Mongolia host joint peacekeeping exercises and disaster preparedness projects. Mongolia's foreign policy emphasizes balanced relations with neighbors and avoiding excessive reliance on any state. Mongolia's foreign policy aims to strengthen ties with Western and Eastern states, including the United States, Japan, the European Union, India, Republic of Korea, and Turkey, under its \"third neighbor\" policy. It also seeks to maintain friendly relations with Asian neighbors, participate in multilateral cooperation, and support strategic stability in East Asia, Northeast Asia, and Central Asia. Mongolia pledges to cooperate actively with the United Nations to increase its role and responsibilities globally. Mongolia aims to strengthen ties with Western and Eastern states under its \"third neighbor\" policy. It also seeks to maintain friendly relations with Asian neighbors, participate in multilateral cooperation, and support strategic stability in various regions. Mongolia supports the increase of the United Nations' role in world governance and actively participates in international organizations, often aligning with U.S. positions. At the fall 2013 session of the 68th U.N. General Assembly, Mongolia aligned with the United States 83.3% of the time on important votes. Mongolia has joined various international organizations since its 1990 democratic revolution, including the Asian Development Bank, World Trade Organization, and ASEAN Regional Forum. Mongolia is an observer in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization but has not pursued full membership. Mongolia has sought U.S. support for joining various international organizations, including APEC. Under President Elbegdorj, Mongolia has emphasized democracy in its international engagement. Mongolia held the rotating chairmanship of the Community of Democracies from 2011 to 2013 and began the process to join the Open Government Partnership in May 2013. Mongolia's priorities under the partnership include increasing public transparency, improving public services, and reducing corruption. In 2014, Mongolia took over the rotating chairmanship of the Freedom Online Coalition. The Freedom Online Coalition, an inter-governmental coalition committed to advancing Internet freedom worldwide, was founded in 2011 in The Hague, The Netherlands. Mongolia, one of the 15 founding members, is scheduled to host the 5th Freedom Online Conference in Ulaanbaatar in spring 2015. The coalition's member states work diplomatically to voice concern over measures restricting Internet freedom and support individuals whose online human rights are curtailed. Mongolia considers the United States its most important \"third neighbor\" for support of its independence and sovereignty. The United States established diplomatic relations with Mongolia in 1987, after the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union. The U.S. Embassy in Mongolia opened in 1988 to monitor Sino-Soviet relations and democratic changes in Mongolia. Today, the U.S. and Mongolia have a comprehensive partnership based on common values and shared interests. The U.S.-Mongolia Joint Statement in 2011 emphasized their shared commitment to promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights worldwide, as well as working together on economic, security, and development interests. The statement also highlighted U.S. gratitude for Mongolia's participation in international coalitions and UN Peacekeeping Operations, and Mongolia's appreciation for U.S. support under the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact. Both sides pledged to strengthen trade, investment, and people-to-people ties. The United States and Mongolia pledged to strengthen trade, investment, and people-to-people ties. Mongolia has hosted visits by senior U.S. officials since its democratic transition in 1990, including House Speaker Dennis Hastert in 2005 and House Minority Leader John Boehner in 2009. Bilateral agreements such as the Bilateral Investment Treaty in 1994 and Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in 2004 have enhanced economic relations between the two countries.

The United States has provided bilateral foreign assistance to Mongolia, with a requested increase for FY2015. USAID is transitioning to a \"legacy program\" in Mongolia focused on shared commercial interests and investment. The United States and Mongolia are negotiating an economic partnership to manage revenues from extractive industries. Defense cooperation includes Foreign Military Financing to support Mongolia's peacekeeping capacity. The FY2015 budget request for FMF is $2 million. The FY2015 budget request increases funding for International Military Education and Training (IMET) for Mongolia, supporting professional military education and technical training for Mongolia's forces. IMET graduates have led Mongolian units in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States' $284.9 million Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact with Mongolia expired in September 2013, including projects to build infrastructure and strengthen vocational education. The MCC Compact with Mongolia included projects to build infrastructure, strengthen vocational education, address environmental challenges, strengthen property rights, and support public health. It subsidized the purchase of over 103,000 energy-efficient cookstoves to reduce urban air pollution and fuel consumption. Mongolia sought but was not selected for a second MCC compact due to its classification as a \"Low Middle Income Country\" by the World Bank. The Peace Corps has been active in Mongolia for 25 years, focusing on capacity building for English teachers, social workers, and health care providers. The Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration organizes trade capacity building programs, and the Department of the Treasury's Office of Technical Assistance also provides support in Mongolia. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Technical Assistance has a resident advisor in Mongolia, assisting the Ministry of Finance with bond sales, cash forecasting, and sovereign wealth fund development. Mongolia's history includes being a satellite state of the Soviet Union, with one-party rule, state-owned industry, and suppression of Tibetan Buddhism. Russia's support helped Mongolia during World War II and contributed to its industrial base and educated elite. During its association with the Soviet Union, Mongolia developed a strong partnership with Russia, including the construction of a main rail line and the establishment of the Erdenet copper and molybdenum mine. Mongolian students also studied at universities in the Soviet bloc. Despite this close relationship, Mongolia maintained its independence as a state, joining the United Nations and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance with Soviet support. After the democratic revolution in 1990 and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia withdrew its aid and troops from Mongolia. In 1992, Mongolia began demanding repayment of aid from the Soviet Union given between 1946 and 1990. The debt caused friction until a final settlement in December 2010. Mongolia seeks closer ties with Russia to balance China's influence, declaring themselves \"strategic partners\" in 2009. Mongolia relies on Russia for energy products and access to markets. Russia holds stakes in Mongolia's railway and copper mine, with discussions on further cooperation. Military ties are also strengthening. In November 2008, Mongolia and Russia conducted joint military exercises for the first time since 1992. Russian President Putin has visited Mongolia multiple times. Mongolia maintains \"balanced\" relations with Russia and China, but China is its main economic partner, accounting for 90% of exports and foreign investment. The two countries established a \"good neighborly partnership\" in 2003 and upgraded to a \"strategic partnership\" in 2011. During then-Mongolian Prime Minister Sukhbaatar Batbold's visit to China, the two countries engaged in bilateral peacekeeping exercises, including the \"Peacekeeping Mission 2009.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mongolian President Elbegdorj signed agreements for infrastructure, energy, and financial cooperation during a visit in August 2014. This included a $30 billion coal gas project and support for Mongolia's bid to join APEC. Xi also allowed Mongolia to use Chinese ports for imports and exports. Mongolia and China pledged support for Mongolia's APEC bid and agreed to start bilateral free trade talks. However, Mongolia is concerned about economic dominance by China and has laws in place to restrict state-owned Chinese firms from acquiring Mongolian companies. Mongolia also worries about an influx of Chinese workers and immigrants, especially from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Mongolia has cultural tensions with China over traditional Mongolian culture being claimed as Chinese. China is wary of a potential \"pan-Mongol\" movement and Mongolia's ties to the Dalai Lama. Mongolia and Tibet share a history, with a Mongolian ruler originating the title of the Dalai Lama. The title \"Dalai\" meaning \"Oceanic\" in Mongolian was conferred by Khan on a Tibetan Buddhist leader, who became the 3rd Dalai Lama. The 4th Dalai Lama, the only Mongolian Dalai Lama in history, was identified as the reincarnation of the 3rd Dalai Lama. Tibetan Buddhism, particularly the Gelugpa order, was the main religion in Mongolia for centuries. Mongolia and Tibet signed a treaty in 1913, declaring independence from Manchu Chinese rule. Despite Soviet-era suppression, Tibetan Buddhism has revived in Mongolia in the democratic era. In the democratic era, Tibetan Buddhism has revived in Mongolia with 55.1% of the population being Buddhist. The 14th Dalai Lama has made several visits to Mongolia since 1991, despite objections from China. Mongolia's geographic dependence on China's goodwill was highlighted when China closed its side of the border in 2002 due to hosting the Dalai Lama. Many Mongolians are concerned about China's intentions to control the reincarnation process for the Dalai Lama. Mongolia's relationship with Japan has strengthened since establishing diplomatic relations in 1972. Japan is Mongolia's largest donor, providing $2.13 billion in bilateral assistance as of March 2013. Cultural ties have grown, especially through the success of Mongolian sumo wrestlers in Japan.

Mongolia has pledged support for Japan's campaign for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, despite opposition from China. The two countries have reached an agreement in principle on a free-trade agreement, aiming to eliminate tariffs on 96% of Japan's exports to Mongolia within 10 years. Japanese investors would also receive guarantees in Mongolian resource and energy markets. The agreement is expected to be signed before the end of 2014. Mongolians have historical ties with the Korean peninsula, with many Koreans believing their ancestors came from Mongolia. Mongolia has official relations with both North and South Korea. South Korea is seen as a model for economic development and a major trading partner for Mongolia. Many Mongolians live in South Korea, and the two countries have established diplomatic relations since 1990. Mongolia seeks closer ties with North Korea to reduce isolation and engage in multilateral security efforts. Mongolia is interested in accessing North Korea's port to reduce reliance on Chinese port. North Korea's response to Mongolia has been mixed, with high-level contacts resuming in 1998 but tensions arising due to Mongolia's support for South Korea's \"Sunshine\" policy. Mongolia's relationship with North Korea has been complex, with tensions arising over support for South Korea's \"Sunshine\" policy. North Korean workers are now employed on farms in Mongolia, with hopes that exposure to democracy will influence their mindset. Mongolia's role as a transit stop for North Korean refugees has also been a sensitive issue in their relations. Between 1999 and 2003, over 600 North Koreans who entered Mongolia from China were resettled in South Korea. However, China has tightened security along its border, reducing the flow of refugees. Mongolia currently hosts only nine refugees, four asylum seekers, and 16 stateless persons. Mongolian President Elbegdorj visited Pyongyang in 2013, delivering a speech at Kim Il Sung University emphasizing the desire for freedom and stating that tyranny does not last forever. In a note on his website, Elbegdorj stated that North Korea proposed a lecture topic but advised against using the words \"democracy\" and \"market economy.\" He met with Kim Yong Nam instead of Kim Jong Un during his trip. Mongolia declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 1992 and passed a law in 2000 prohibiting the development, possession, or use of nuclear weapons on its territory.

The declaration was influenced by Mongolia's experiences during the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. Mongolia declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 1992, influenced by the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. The Permanent Five members of the U.N. Security Council welcomed Mongolia's declaration in 2012, affirming their intent to respect Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status. Mongolia declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 1992 and has been supported by seven UN General Assembly resolutions since then. Appendix A. Select Legislation Related to Mongolia Appendix B.
