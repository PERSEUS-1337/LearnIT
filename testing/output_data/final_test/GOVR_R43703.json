These minors faced challenges transitioning into adulthood due to their lack of legal status in the United States. The SIJ provision was added to the INA in 1990 to address concerns about foreign children in the US who were homeless, orphans, or victims of abusive family situations. It allowed unauthorized alien children declared dependent on state juvenile courts to stay in the US legally and permanently. Eligibility required court declaration for long-term foster care and a determination that returning to their home country was not in their best interest. In 1997, Congress amended the INA to ensure that the Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) benefit was not sought primarily for obtaining permanent residency but for relief from abuse, neglect, or abandonment. The amendment specified that only juveniles eligible for long-term foster care based on abuse, neglect, or abandonment could qualify as SIJs. Additionally, the 1997 act required specific consent from the Department of Justice for a juvenile in federal custody to be under juvenile court jurisdiction. In 2008, Congress amended the SIJ provisions in the INA to broaden their applicability, removing the requirement for long-term foster care eligibility and replacing it with the need for the juvenile court to find reunification with parents not viable. USCIS legal guidance in 2009 defined an eligible SIJ as a child declared dependent by a juvenile court or placed under state custody. The TVPRA of 2008 expanded the eligibility for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status, allowing juveniles under the custody of a State or appointed individual by a juvenile court to apply. USCIS guidance now requires specific consent from the Department of Health and Human Services for juvenile court jurisdiction changes affecting custody status. The process of becoming an SIJ and ultimately an LPR includes multiple steps, as the child petitions for SIJ status after the juvenile court decision and then applies to adjust to LPR status. USCIS must adjudicate SIJ petitions within 180 days of filing, and a juvenile seeking SIJ status must demonstrate that it would not be in their best interest to be returned to their previous country of nationality. The USCIS field guidance emphasizes focusing on eligibility for adjustment of status for juveniles seeking SIJ status, avoiding questioning about abuse details. Juveniles cannot be required to contact abusers, and background checks are mandatory. SIJ status exempts juveniles from many INA inadmissibility grounds. Foreign nationals in the US without authorization, including unauthorized children, are generally ineligible for federal public assistance benefits. Exceptions include emergency medical services, disaster relief, and humanitarian cases. Unaccompanied alien children are placed under the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) cares for unaccompanied alien children who lack lawful immigration status in the US and are under 18 years old. They provide education, health services, and socialization. About 85% of these children are reunited with family after an average of 35 days in ORR care. The TVPRA of 2008 allows juveniles with SIJ status to be eligible for the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors' Program in ORR. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) cares for unaccompanied alien children under 18 years old. They provide education, health services, and socialization. The TVPRA of 2008 allows juveniles with Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status to be eligible for the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors' Program in ORR. ORR reimburses states for foster care expenditures for SIJ children. There has been a significant increase in the number of children filing I-360 petitions for SIJ status, with a tenfold increase from FY2005 to FY2013. The Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status is limited to 7% of 140,000 foreign nationals annually. The surge in unaccompanied alien children at the Southwest border has increased congressional interest in SIJ status. The increase in unaccompanied alien children since FY2008 is a growing concern. The surge in unaccompanied alien children at the Southwest border has raised concerns about an increase in Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) requests. A recent survey found that many children fled due to abuse in the home, with some potentially eligible for SIJ status. Advocates argue that the number of children receiving SIJ status is far below the actual number of eligible children. Many unaccompanied alien children arriving in the United States may be eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status. There are debates over whether these children should have easy access to the SIJ process, with concerns that the 2008 TVPRA amendments were not meant to grant SIJ status to unauthorized alien children reuniting with family in the U.S. Advocates suggest revising SIJ criteria to prevent reunification with parents from making children ineligible for long-term foster care and SIJ status."
