    "content": "The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) was established in 1984 by the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to provide funding for state victim compensation and assistance programs. VOCA has been amended multiple times to support various victim-related activities, including grants for private organizations, the Federal Victim Notification System, funding for victim assistance staff in the FBI and EOUSA, the Children's Justice Act Program, and assistance for victims of terrorism. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) was established in 1988 within the Department of Justice to administer the CVF and distribute funds through grants to various entities. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) administers the Crime Victims Fund (CVF) to support victim services and programs, including those for victims of terrorism. OVC's mission is to enhance the nation's capacity to assist crime victims and improve justice practices. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) supports programs for victims of terrorism both within and outside the United States. It is funded through various sources such as criminal fines and forfeited bail bonds. The CVF does not receive appropriated funding but rather relies on these sources for deposits. The report provides background information on VOCA programs and the CVF, explains the allocation process of CVF funds, and analyzes selected issues for Congress to consider regarding the CVF and the federal budget. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) is funded through sources like criminal fines and forfeited bail bonds, with the largest deposits coming from fines collected from federal court defendants. The amounts deposited into the CVF have fluctuated significantly since 2000, with notable increases and decreases in different fiscal years. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) has seen fluctuations in deposits over the years, with a 43.7% decrease in FY2016. Large criminal fines from financial fraud cases have contributed to the Fund's growth. The Department of Justice (DOJ) prioritizes prosecuting violent offenders, which may impact deposits from corporate violators. In the history of the CVF, two caps have affected the balance and distribution of the Fund: a cap on deposits and an obligation cap. Congress placed a cap on deposits from FY1985 to FY1992, ranging from $100 million to $150 million. In 1993, the cap was lifted, allowing all criminal fines and forfeited bail bonds to be deposited into the CVF. In 2000, an annual obligation cap was established to stabilize funds for crime victim services. Congress sets the CVF cap each year as part of DOJ appropriations. In FY2015, Congress set the CVF obligation cap at $2.361 billion, a 216.9% increase over the FY2014 cap. In FY2016, the cap was set at $3.042 billion, with $379 million transferred to OVW and $10 million designated for OIG. After deductions, the cap was $2.653 billion. In FY2017, the cap was set at $2.573 billion, with $326 million transferred to OVW. In FY2017, $326 million was transferred to OVW from the CVF, along with $10 million designated for the DOJ OIG. The Administration's FY2018 budget requested $610 million to be transferred from the CVF to OVW and other agencies for non-VOCA grant programs. Appropriations riders, including restrictions on certain funds like abortions, may or may not apply to CVF programs based on how they are framed. The CVF is funded through fines and penalties specified in VOCA, with funding for grants provided by previous year's deposits. After yearly allocations, remaining balance is retained for future expenditures. Any unobligated sums must remain in the fund as per VOCA law, with any excess scored as a reduction in discretionary spending. This offset affects spending totals in the Commerce, Justice, and Science appropriations bill. The VOCA law requires unobligated sums to remain in the CVF for future use. Excess funds are credited to the \"rainy day\" fund for future program benefits. For example, in FY2000, $485 million remained in the CVF for future use. The OVC awards CVF money through formula and discretionary grants to various entities. Grants are allocated according to statute established by the VOCA. The OVC and ACF manage the Children's Justice Act Program to improve handling of child abuse cases. Up to $20 million is distributed annually, with $17 million for states and $3 million for tribal populations. In FY2016, ACF received $17.36 million for the program. OVC also funds victim-witness coordinators in U.S. Attorney's Offices. The OVC provides funding for victim and witness assistance programs, including support for victim-witness coordinators in U.S. Attorney's Offices and FBI field offices. Funding is allocated annually to assist victims of federal crimes and provide support throughout criminal proceedings. The OVC provides annual funding for the Victim Notification System (VNS) from FY2012-FY2016, which notifies victims of major case events related to offenders. Funding is distributed to Victim Compensation Formula Grants, Victim Assistance Formula Grants, and OVC Discretionary Grants. Unused funds for state compensation grants are allocated to state victim assistance formula grants. The state victim assistance grant program receives 47.5% of the remaining balance plus any funds not needed to reimburse victim compensation programs. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico have victim compensation programs. States receive 60% of the total amount paid to victims in the prior fiscal year. States must meet certain requirements to be eligible for victim compensation formula grants. The victim assistance grant program ensures fair compensation for crime victims, including non-residents and victims of federal crimes. Funds can be used for expenses like medical and mental health counseling, lost wages, and funeral costs. Medical and dental services make up a significant portion of the compensation expenses. In FY2015, 45.2% of total payments were for medical and dental expenses, with assault victims representing the highest percentage of compensation recipients. Assault victims accounted for 39.3% of all claims filed, with nearly half related to domestic and family violence. CVF funding for OVC's Victim Compensation Program from FY2012 to FY2016 is detailed in Table 6. The remaining 47.5% of annual CVF money goes to the Victim Assistance Formula Grants Program, supporting state crime victim assistance programs for direct services to victims. The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) provides assistance grants to states for direct services to crime victims, prioritizing underserved populations and victims of violent crime, child abuse, sexual assault, and spousal abuse. States must use their annual award within a specified time frame and receive a base amount of $500,000 each year. Federal funds cannot replace state and local funds for victim assistance. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) provides funding through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) for victim assistance grants to states. States receive a base amount of $500,000 annually, with additional funds distributed based on population data. The OVC allocated funds for the Victim Assistance Grant Program from FY2012 to FY2016. Domestic violence victims make up the largest group receiving services, with 47.8% served in FY2015. Five percent of the funds are allocated for discretionary grants. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) provides discretionary grants for demonstration projects, program evaluation, compliance efforts, training, financial support for victims of federal crime, and nonprofit organizations to improve services for crime victims. The OVC awards these grants annually through a competitive process. Additionally, the Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve was established to aid victims of terrorism and mass violence through supplemental grants to states and direct compensation to victims. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) provides grants for victims of federal crime and nonprofit organizations. The Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve aids victims of terrorism through supplemental grants and direct compensation. The reserve fund supports various programs for victims of terrorism and mass violence. The OVC provides grants through the Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve to assist victims of terrorism and mass violence incidents in the United States. In January 2014, $8.4 million was awarded to assist victims, witnesses, and first responders of the Boston Marathon bombings. In 2013, AEAP funds were used to support victims of mass shootings in Newtown, CT; Oak Creek, WI; and Aurora, CO, as well as victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. OVC awarded $3.1 million in victim assistance funding and $13.5 million in victim compensation funding to New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania for emergency assistance, crisis counseling, medical and mental health services, funeral costs, and lost wages. Additionally, OVC provided other assistance and services to victims. The OVC provided various assistance and services to victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, including setting up a call center, establishing a Victim and Family Travel Assistance Center, and operating a special \"Hope and Remembrance\" website. Approximately 37,000 victims and family members received assistance through the call center, and 1,800 family members had their travel and lodging costs covered for funerals and memorial services. Congress may face various issues when considering the balance of the Crime Victims Fund (CVF), the annual cap on the CVF, and potential amendments to the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). These issues include using the CVF for unauthorized purposes, adjusting the CVF cap, amending VOCA for new programs, and determining the use of victim services funds. One key consideration is whether to use CVF receipts for grant programs not authorized by VOCA. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) has been used in the past for programs not authorized by the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). While historically limited to VOCA-authorized programs, recent appropriations acts have allowed CVF funds to be used for specified grant programs under the Violence Against Women Act. The Administration's FY2018 budget proposes using CVF funds for multiple DOJ accounts not authorized by VOCA. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) has been used for programs not authorized by VOCA, including domestic violence, sex offenders, trafficking victims, and child abuse. The CVF has a balance of over $9 billion, indicating excess receipts in certain years. Congress increased the cap in FY2015 and FY2016. Deposits into the Fund decreased by 44% from FY2015 to FY2016. The CVF could potentially fund DOJ grant programs, reducing discretionary appropriations. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) has a balance of over $9 billion, with excess receipts in certain years. Congress increased the cap in FY2015 and FY2016, but deposits into the Fund decreased by 44% from FY2015 to FY2016. There is no guarantee of consistent funding from year to year, and Congress may rescind funds from the CVF balance, as seen in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. This could impact the level of funding for non-VOCA programs in future budget cycles. If Congress eliminates the cap on the Crime Victims Fund, it could have significant consequences for the DOJ budget. The capped amount and remaining balance in the CVF impact the DOJ appropriation and overall budget score. Congress would need to make up the amount of the CVF through offsets if the cap is removed. Additionally, Congress may need to reassess VOCA programs' ability to use all money in the fund if the obligation cap is eliminated. Congress may consider reassessing the allocation formula of the Crime Victims Fund (CVF) or adding new programs to be supported through the fund. Fluctuations in annual obligations can impact fund availability for victim assistance grants. The addition of new programs and increased funding for other programs funded by the CVF can reduce funding for victim assistance grants. Congress may review the allocation formula to mitigate the impact of fluctuations on these grants and has amended the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) multiple times since 1984 to support additional victim-related activities. Currently, Congress may amend the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to support additional victim-related activities for specific groups like child abuse victims and victims of terrorist acts. There is a possibility of expanding support to victims of elder abuse and rural victims due to growing social concerns and unique barriers they face. VOCA may be used to address risks and needs of other populations in the future. The VOCA formula does not currently include American Indian tribal governments for its two largest programs. The VOCA formula does not include American Indian tribal governments for its two largest programs. The SURVIVE Act proposed setting aside 5% of the annual obligation capped amount for tribes to create a new grant program for tribal crime victims services and compensation. The Administration's FY2018 budget proposes setting aside 5% of the obligation cap for grants to improve services for American Indian tribes. Changes in mandatory spending can generate offsets for discretionary spending. The Fairness for Crime Victims Act of 2017 has been significant in generating offsets for discretionary spending. In the 115th Congress, the Fairness for Crime Victims Act of 2017 (H.R. 275) aims to adjust how CHIMPs affect the CVF and its use as an offset for discretionary spending. The bill also seeks to ensure that the CVF annual obligation cap is never less than the average deposits of the previous three fiscal years."
