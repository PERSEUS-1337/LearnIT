    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Social Security Number Protection Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that the sale or purchase of Social Security numbers contributes to illegal activities like fraud and identity theft, posing risks to privacy and safety. The use of Social Security numbers by various institutions can lead to criminal activities and privacy breaches. The Federal Government mandates the acquisition of Social Security numbers for tax purposes, Social Security benefits, and employment. The use of Social Security numbers for tax, benefits, and employment has inadvertently led to their misuse in facilitating crime and fraud. The Federal Government should take action to prevent abuse of this system as the numbers themselves do not convey any message or ideas. The sale and purchase of Social Security numbers should be restricted to protect individuals from potential harm and unlawful conduct. Congress should enact legislation to provide necessary protection in such circumstances. To prevent unlawful conduct and unfair practices, restrictions should be placed on the sale and purchase of Social Security numbers. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

The regulation under the Act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, with penalties and privileges as per the Federal Trade Commission Act. States can take civil actions if their residents are affected by violations of Commission regulations.
