    "content": "The \"Global Poverty Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that over one billion people worldwide live on less than $1 per day, and another 1.6 billion struggle on less than $2 per day. The United States committed to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to improve the lives of the world's poorest by 2015, including reducing poverty, hunger, child mortality, and improving access to water and sanitation. President George W. Bush emphasized the importance of fighting poverty as a response to terror, a fundamental right to human dignity, and a moral obligation. The 2002 National Security Strategy of the United States highlighted the injustice and instability of a world where some live in comfort while half of the human race lives on less than $2 per day. The importance of fighting poverty as a response to terror, a fundamental right to human dignity, and a moral obligation is emphasized by President George W. Bush. The 2006 National Security Strategy of the United States and the bipartisan Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States both stress the need to assist the world's poor and integrate them into the global economy through economic policies that encourage development and opportunities for improvement. At the G-8 summit in July 2005, leaders committed to doubling aid to Africa to $50 billion by 2010 and canceling debt for 18 of the world's poorest nations. The United States, along with 180 other governments, reaffirmed their commitment to achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The US recognized the need for increased assistance to countries burdened by extreme poverty. The United States has taken significant initiatives to address extreme poverty and enhance economic opportunities in developing countries. This includes acts like the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003, and trade preference programs like the African Growth and Opportunity Act. In 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice restructured the foreign assistance program, appointing a Director of Foreign Assistance to oversee funding and programs. In January 2007, the Department of State's Office of the Director of Foreign Assistance added poverty reduction as a central goal of USAID foreign assistance funding and programs. The official goal is to help build democratic, well-governed states that reduce poverty and act responsibly in the international system. The United States aims to reduce global poverty and achieve the UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of people living on less than $1 per day by 2015. This policy is supported by the requirement to develop a comprehensive strategy. The President, with the Secretary of State and other entities, will develop a strategy to reduce global poverty and achieve the UN goal of halving the number of people living on less than $1 per day by 2015. The strategy to reduce global poverty includes specific goals, efforts, benchmarks, and timetables. Components of the strategy involve continued investment in existing US initiatives for poverty reduction and improving the effectiveness of development assistance. The strategy to reduce global poverty includes enhancing debt relief, leveraging trade policy, coordinating efforts with various stakeholders, mobilizing participation of organizations, and aligning poverty reduction with other development goals like combating diseases and improving access to water and sanitation. The strategy to reduce global poverty includes improving access to water and sanitation, integrating sustainable development principles into policies, and submitting reports on progress to congressional committees. The strategy to reduce global poverty includes improving access to water and sanitation, integrating sustainable development principles into policies, and reporting progress to congressional committees. The implementation of the strategy, progress in achieving global poverty reduction objectives, and any changes to the strategy are also reviewed. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate. \"Extreme global poverty\" is defined as living on less than $1 per day, while \"global poverty\" is living on less than $2 per day, according to World Bank statistics. The House of Representatives passed the Act on September 25, 2007. Clerk: LORRAINE C. MILLER."
