    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student Loan Evaluation and Stabilization Act of 1995\". References in this Act are to the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Congress finds that the current public/private student loan partnership is fulfilling its mission, delivering loans reliably. The Administration's dismantling of the FFEL Program to replace it with a direct Government lending program needs to be stopped for a valid comparison of student loan programs. The Federal Direct Student Loan Program pilot is mentioned. The Federal Direct Student Loan Program pilot has started smoothly with 5% of new loan volume and should continue cautiously as volume increases to 40%. Reform of the FFEL Program should be a priority while the pilot program continues testing. SEC. 3. Participation of institutions and administration of direct loan programs. Limitation on Proportion of Loans Made Under Direct Loan Program: The Secretary shall enter into agreements with institutions for participation in the programs, with loans limited to 5 percent of new student loan volume for academic year 1994-1995, and thereafter limited to loans for students and parents attending eligible institutions. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Higher Education Act, including the elimination of conscription and control of administrative expenses. It mentions changes to sections regarding student participation in programs and loan limitations for academic years.

The Secretary of Education is authorized to use funds for administrative expenses under the Higher Education Act, with a limit of $1,750,000,000 from 1994 to 1998. Funds can be carried over to the next fiscal year. Congressional oversight is improved with funding triggers specified in the appropriations Act for the Department of Education. The Department of Education can use funds for administrative expenses under the Higher Education Act, with a limit of $1,750,000,000 from 1994 to 1998. Guaranty agencies must submit detailed proposals for expenditures and meet conditions to receive an administrative cost allowance. The allowance can be used for specific purposes outlined in the Act. Agencies must elect a payment rate for the allowance each fiscal year. The administrative cost allowance for guaranty agencies under the Higher Education Act is calculated based on the total principal amount of loans insured or guaranteed. If the total funds exceed $150,000,000, payments to agencies will be ratably reduced. The Secretary is required to provide a detailed quarterly report. The Secretary must submit a quarterly report detailing all expenditures under this section to the Senate and House committees. The report should identify contracts for services supporting loan programs and their costs. Additionally, the Act is amended to eliminate the transition to direct loans.

Amendment to Section 428(c)(9) of the Act regarding Guaranty Agency Reserve Levels, including changes to subparagraphs (E) and (F) related to the functions and assets of the agency under the loan insurance program. Amendment to Section 428(c)(9) of the Act allows the Secretary to require guaranty agencies to provide reserve fund details, with restrictions on accessing non-Federal portions. Section 422 of the Act is further amended to address the disposition of funds returned to the Secretary. The funds recovered by the Secretary will be returned to the Treasury to reduce the Federal debt and deposited into a special account under title 31, United States Code. SEC. 6. DEFAULT RATE LIMITATIONS ON DIRECT LENDING. Section 455 of the Act is amended to include a new subsection (k) regarding the termination of institutions with high default rates. The Secretary will develop a methodology for calculating institutional default rates, criteria for initiating termination proceedings based on these rates, and procedures for conducting such proceedings. The Secretary will strive for comparability to part b in developing these requirements. The Secretary will establish termination standards for institutions in loan programs, including appeal provisions for default rate calculations. SEC. 7. Amendment to application process for Part B loans under the Act to allow electronic form submission for borrower and institution convenience. SEC. 8. Credit reform measures will be implemented.
