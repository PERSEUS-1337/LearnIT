TANF was created by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program was created in 1996 and has been funded through various extensions since then. The main issues facing the 116th Congress revolve around whether current TANF policies allow states to address the original concerns of providing assistance to needy families, particularly single mothers, for basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provides assistance to families with minor children who are determined as \"needy\" by the state. Assistance can be in the form of cash, vouchers, or payments to third parties. The amount of assistance varies by state, ranging from $170 to $1,021 per month for a family of three. The program aims to help families meet basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. The report discusses the TANF program, its work participation requirements, the decline in caseload, and implications for child poverty. It also covers legislation in the 115th and 116th Congress related to TANF funding levels and distribution. Federal assistance to needy families with children dates back to the early 20th century. The Social Security Act of 1935 provided grants to states for the Aid to Dependent Children program, later renamed Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The goal was to help mothers stay at home and care for their children, but resistance from some states and localities arose. Over time, consensus on this policy eroded as more women, especially married white women, joined the labor force. Benefits varied by state, and African American families with absent fathers increasingly received assistance. The provision of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) varied by state, with income eligibility thresholds and benefit levels differing significantly. In 1969, the Nixon Administration proposed replacing AFDC with a negative income tax to incentivize work, but the proposal did not pass. Subsequent proposals in 1972 and 1981 to guarantee jobs or combine the negative income tax with public service jobs were also unsuccessful. In the 1980s, debates over assistance to needy families shifted to work requirements and devolution of responsibility to states. President Reagan proposed shifting AFDC responsibility to states and Medicaid responsibility to the federal government, but this was not enacted. Concerns arose about single parents becoming dependent on assistance, leading to the Family Support Act of 1988 establishing education and training programs for AFDC recipients. In the 1980s, debates shifted to work requirements for AFDC recipients. Experiments showed that mandatory participation in employment programs increased employment and reduced assistance receipt. The cash assistance caseload peaked in 1994, prompting Bill Clinton's pledge to reform welfare. The 1996 PRWORA legislation created TANF with new rules, including a five-year time limit. The 1996 PRWORA legislation created TANF with new rules, including a five-year time limit on federally funded benefits and a broad-purpose block grant giving states flexibility in fund usage. TANF funding is primarily in the form of a basic block grant, with a total amount of $16.5 billion per year. States must also meet a minimum expenditure requirement of $10.4 billion per year. Funding was frozen at both national and state levels through FY2002. TANF has not been comprehensively reauthorized but extended through short-term extensions. The TANF program, created in 1996, has not been reauthorized but extended through short-term extensions. Funding has been frozen at both national and state levels, with no adjustments made for changes like inflation or poverty population. States had flexibility in determining income eligibility levels and benefit amounts under the AFDC program, leading to wide variations in benefit amounts among states. The TANF program, established in 1996, has frozen funding levels without adjustments for inflation or changes in poverty population. Wide disparities in TANF funding persist among states, with Southeastern states receiving lower grants per child in poverty compared to Northeastern, West Coast, and Great Lakes states. Supplemental grants were provided to 17 states from FY1998 to FY2011 to address funding disparities, but had limited impact on total TANF grant per poor child. The TANF block grant has lost 36% of its value from FY1997 to FY2018 due to inflation. If funding remains at current levels through FY2029, the grant's value could decrease by half compared to FY1997. The supplemental grants provided from FY1998 to FY2011 had limited impact on total TANF grant per poor child. The contingency fund established with $2 billion was depleted in the last recession and now receives $608 million annually. It provides extra grants for states with high unemployment or increased SNAP caseloads. States can receive up to 20% of their block grant in contingency funds on a first-come-first-served basis. If funds are insufficient, they are prorated to qualifying states. The contingency fund, established with $2 billion, was depleted in the last recession and now receives $608 million annually. It provides extra grants for states with high unemployment or increased SNAP caseloads. States can receive up to 20% of their block grant in contingency funds on a first-come-first-served basis. Most states continue to meet the SNAP caseload trigger for contingency funds through FY2019 due to population growth and increased SNAP benefits. The fund generally spends all of its total each year, regardless of the economy's health, not serving its original counter-cyclical funding purpose. Proposed bills would maintain TANF funding levels and distribution among states, extending the funding freeze since FY1997. The Jobs and Opportunity with Benefits and Services for Success Act, in both its 115th and 116th Congress versions, would eliminate the TANF contingency fund to increase mandatory child care spending. The Promoting Employment and Economic Mobility Act in the 115th Congress aimed for a three-year reauthorization. H.R. 7010 would have indefinitely authorized TANF funding with initial and annual increases based on inflation and child population growth since 1997. H.R. 7010 would have redistributed funds based on child population growth, provided open-ended matching funds for subsidized employment and guaranteed child care, and increased TANF contingency funds. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant used by states for various benefits and services. States have broad discretion in using federal TANF grants for a wide range of benefits and services, with no specific requirements on how the funds should be spent. The statutory purposes of TANF include increasing state flexibility in providing assistance to needy families, promoting job preparation, work, and marriage, preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encouraging two-parent families. Current law lacks a clear definition of \"core activities\" for states to prioritize TANF spending. States determine what qualifies as \"needy\" for TANF activities. Federal TANF funds can also be used for reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies and promoting two-parent families. States can allocate up to 30% of the TANF block grant for transfers to other programs like Child Care and Development Block Grant and Social Services Block Grant. States have flexibility in how they spend TANF funds, including on activities like cash assistance, child care, education, job training, and administrative costs. They can also use federal funds for third-party in-kind donations that benefit TANF-eligible families. Expenditures on TANF assistance have decreased as a percentage of total TANF spending. Federal rules for state accountability mainly apply to assistance expenditures and families receiving assistance, with few rules for other expenditure categories like child care. Accountability for TANF spending is limited beyond assistance spending. Expenditures on TANF assistance have decreased as a percentage of total TANF spending, with states shifting spending towards areas like refundable tax credits, child welfare, and other services. There is considerable variation among states in the share of spending devoted to different categories, as shown in Figure 5 for FY2018. The FY2018 expenditure report shows a wide range of spending patterns among states, with assistance ranging from 2.5% to 65.8% of total expenditures. TANF funds were used innovatively for programs like nurse home visiting and subsidized jobs. The Jobs and Opportunity with Benefits and Services for Success Act, in both the 115th and 116th Congress, would require 25% of TANF expenditures to be spent on \"core\" activities, define these activities, transfer TANF dollars to CCDBG for child care, restrict TANF spending on child welfare services, and phase out counting donated services towards MOE spending requirement. The RISE Out of Poverty Act (H.R. 7010, 115th Congress) would limit TANF funds to families under 200% of the federal poverty level and prohibit direct spending on early childhood education. S. 3700 (115th Congress) would require additional reporting on TANF expenditures but not restrict fund usage. The 115th and 116th Congresses proposed legislation related to TANF funds usage, focusing on moving assistance recipients into employment. Demonstrations in the 1980s and 1990s showed that mandatory work participation requirements, along with funded employment services, could increase employment and earnings while reducing assistance expenditures. The TANF program implemented work requirements through a performance system at the state level, with mandatory participation requirements for individuals. States have flexibility in how they implement these requirements, with a minimum work participation rate (WPR) as a performance standard. Failure to comply with work requirements can result in sanctions affecting the family's benefits. The TANF program requires states to have a certain percentage of families with a \"work-eligible individual\" meeting participation standards in work or activities. Failure to meet these standards can result in penalties such as a reduction in the state's block grant. Federal rules specify the activities and minimum hours required for participation. States can meet the complex rules of the TANF program by providing assistance to needy parents already working, reducing caseloads, and exceeding required state spending. They can also receive credit for \"unsubsidized employment\" towards their minimum work participation rate. States adjusted their programs to allow families with working adults on TANF to continue receiving assistance at higher earnings levels, helping them meet the minimum work participation rate. Earnings supplements also helped raise incomes. States have implemented new programs to assist low-income working parents, such as Virginia providing $50 per month for up to one year to former TANF recipients who are now working. California also offers small TANF-funded supplements to working parents receiving SNAP benefits. These programs help states meet the minimum work participation rate requirements. Additionally, a \"caseload reduction credit\" can reduce the participation targets based on the decline in families receiving assistance. States have implemented new programs to assist low-income working parents, such as providing financial assistance to former TANF recipients who are now employed. A \"caseload reduction credit\" can lower participation targets based on the decrease in families receiving assistance. States may also receive extra credit for caseload reduction if they exceed the required spending under the TANF MOE. Effective standards for states often vary due to these credits, and some states have moved two-parent families out of TANF into solely state-funded programs to meet work participation rate requirements. In FY2018, 25 jurisdictions reported no two-parent families in their TANF assistance caseload, with most aiding two-parent families. Some states have excluded certain families from TANF, like Illinois assisting various categories in a state-funded program. All states, except Montana, met the minimum all-family work participation rate standard in FY2018. 18 states achieved this through caseload reduction, while 4 states and Puerto Rico used a combination of caseload reduction and exceeding required spending for credit. In FY2018, states met work participation standards without engaging all recipients in work activities. Unsubsidized employment was the most common activity, with 40.8% of TANF individuals participating. Job search had the highest rate of funded employment services participation at 6.5%. In FY2018, the highest rate of participation among work-eligible individuals was 6.5% in job search and readiness, while 3.0% participated in vocational educational training. Work requirements mandate participation in work or job activities, with non-compliance risking benefit reduction or termination. States have the discretion to determine the sanction for non-compliance with TANF work requirements, often resulting in the end of benefits for non-compliant families. States have the discretion to define \"good cause\" and exceptions for families not complying with work requirements, avoiding sanctions. Protections exist for certain recipients, such as single parents with young children and victims of domestic violence. Concerns arise over states not focusing on moving unemployed recipients into work, with data showing low engagement in work activities. The effectiveness of the minimum WPR standard has been questioned, with states engaging in various practices to meet the requirement. Despite low rates of participation in job preparation activities, most states have met their WPR. The Jobs and Opportunity with Benefits and Services for Success Act aims to replace the minimum WPR with a new performance system based on employment outcomes. The proposal aims to replace the minimum WPR with employment outcomes based on WIOA measures, requiring states to negotiate performance levels with HHS. Failure to meet these levels could result in penalties. H.R. 1753 / S. 802 in the 116th Congress would replace the WPR with a measure of employed individuals who have left TANF assistance after six months, with states at risk of penalties if they fall short of negotiated performance levels. The proposal aims to replace the WPR with employment outcomes based on WIOA measures, requiring states to negotiate performance levels with HHS. Failure to meet these levels could result in penalties. S. 3700 (115th Congress) would require data collection on WIOA-like performance measures and a study on the impact of moving to an outcome-based performance system. Outcome measures like job entry or leaving assistance with a job may better assess TANF's goal of ending dependence on government benefits through work, but they can also have unintended consequences on state program design. The unintended consequences of outcome-based performance measures on state programs include \"cream skimming\" and the challenge of capturing all relevant differences in caseload characteristics. Evaluating the effectiveness of a program should consider whether it resulted in more or speedier exits from the program and improved participants' employment and earnings. Research suggests that the long-term impacts of labor force participation should be evaluated to measure the success of a program. The current law requires assessing work readiness and skills of adults or minors not in high school for labor force programs. States can develop an Individual Responsibility Plan (IRP) based on the assessment within 90 days of eligibility. IRP must include skills assessment, work experience, and employability evaluation, along with services for obtaining and maintaining employment in the private sector. The George W. Bush Administration proposed a \"universal engagement\" requirement as part of the TANF reauthorization in 2002. The proposal required states to create individualized plans for each family, but it was never enacted. H.R. 5861 in the 115th Congress revived the idea of requiring a plan for each work-eligible individual within 60 days of eligibility, incorporating participation in activities that count towards work requirements. The revised version of H.R. 1753 / S. 802 in the 116th Congress mandates that work-eligible individuals, except single parents caring for infants, must engage in specified activities for a minimum number of hours based on family types. Sanctions for noncompliance are determined by a formula, and states failing to meet these requirements risk a reduction in their block grant. The revised version of H.R. 1753 / S. 802 in the 116th Congress mandates work-eligible individuals to engage in specified activities for a minimum number of hours based on family types. Sanctions for noncompliance are determined by a formula, and states at risk of being penalized through a reduction in their block grant. The requirement that all work-eligible individuals participate or be subject to sanction may raise issues regarding exemptions for certain groups like single parents with children under six, victims of domestic violence, ill, disabled, aged parents, or caretakers. Additionally, individuals with disabilities must be accommodated in the workplace, including potential accommodations like reduced hours. The bill specifies how noncompliance with work requirements would result in a reduction in benefits, but the effectiveness of this sanction compared to others is unclear. Previous research showed that sanctions were important for enforcing work requirements, leading to higher employment and lower assistance, but did not determine the most effective form of sanctioning. H.R. 7010 (115th Congress) included \"universal engagement\" provisions, focusing on requiring families to have a plan rather than enforcing work participation requirements. The bill in the 115th Congress focused on requiring families to have a plan rather than enforcing work participation requirements. States were required to notify noncompliant recipients, provide opportunities for meetings, and consider barriers to employment. The creation of TANF in 1996 aimed to assist needy families with children, shaped by limited funding and broad state authority. The TANF program has limited funding and broad state authority, allowing funds to be used for various activities. Mandatory work participation rates incentivize states to reduce cash assistance caseloads. Data shows fluctuations in the population eligible for assistance based on economic cycles, with fewer eligible people receiving cash assistance in recent years. The decline in TANF caseloads is mainly due to a decrease in the share of eligible individuals receiving benefits. In 1995, 81.6% of eligible individuals received benefits, compared to only 26.6% in 2016. This decline has impacted the child poverty rate, as shown in Figure 8, where both AFDC and TANF have reduced child poverty rates by less. In selected years, AFDC and TANF reduced child poverty rates by less than 1 percentage point. AFDC income decreased poverty rate by 0.9 percentage points in 1995, while TANF reduced it by 0.2 percentage points in 2016. AFDC reduced child deep poverty rate from 11.2% to 6.6% in 1995, while TANF decreased it from 7.7% to 7.1% in 2016. The decline in TANF caseloads is due to fewer eligible individuals receiving benefits, impacting child poverty rates. The poverty gap is the difference between a family's poverty threshold and total income. The aggregate poverty gap represents the depth of poverty for all families combined. If this gap were filled, poverty would be eliminated. Table 4 shows pre- and post-assistance poverty data. In 1995, AFDC reduced the poverty gap by over $24 billion, more than 27% of the pre-assistance poverty gap. After 1996, the poverty gap varied with the economic cycle. In 2016, TANF cash assistance reduced the poverty gap by approximately $4 billion, or 5.7%. The drop in the share of TANF-eligible individuals receiving benefits may raise questions about the goal of caseload reduction under TANF. Under TANF, states are incentivized to maintain or reduce the number of families receiving assistance due to limited TANF funds. States face financial risks if the number of families receiving assistance increases, as it would mean fewer funds for activities other than assistance. The RISE Out of Poverty Act would increase TANF funds for inflation and population growth. All bills discussed in the report would either eliminate or limit the caseload reduction credit against TANF work participation standards. The bills discussed in this report aim to address TANF spending on \"core\" activities and the impact of caseload reduction credits. While these bills do not directly tackle the issue of unserved populations, they would restrict how TANF funds are used. H.R. 7010 would have implemented procedures like pre-sanction reviews and prohibited full-family sanctions for non-compliance. The TANF legislation proposed in the 115th and 116th Congress aims to reduce child poverty and incentivize caseload reduction. H.R. 7010 would require states to determine family budgets to meet needs and ensure assistance meets those needs, a change from current law. The creation of TANF focused on providing assistance to needy families with children. Since the mid-1990s, states have shifted TANF spending from assistance to other benefits and services, leading to a decrease in the number of families receiving aid. Many eligible individuals, including children and parents, did not receive TANF assistance, resulting in a diminished impact on alleviating child poverty. In 2016, an estimated 12.4 million individuals were eligible but did not receive assistance, compared to 4.5 million who did. The impact of assistance on alleviating child poverty has decreased, with other programs like EITC, SNAP, and Medicaid growing in spending and recipients. These programs do not provide ongoing cash assistance to meet basic needs. Policymakers may need to consider changes to TANF or other alternatives for ongoing cash assistance. Bills aim to focus TANF dollars on assistance and work activities. The National Academy of Sciences proposed converting the child tax credit into a monthly child allowance to provide steady income for families with children, regardless of earnings. This proposal aims to address economic security issues for families with children beyond changes to TANF. The child allowance proposal aims to provide steady income for families with children, regardless of earnings, to counteract market income unpredictability. It would carry little stigma and promote social inclusion, unlike means-tested programs. Other proposals include guaranteeing or subsidizing jobs, such as the ELEVATE Act, which would provide matching grants to states for wage-paying jobs during recessions. These proposals echo past debates on guaranteed incomes and job programs. When considering proposals for guaranteed or expanded jobs programs, Congress may face recurring debates on whether benefits should be universal or targeted, the form of intervention (income, services, or employment), the inclusion of behavioral conditions, and the level at which policies should be determined."
