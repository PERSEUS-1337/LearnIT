    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Oil Shale and Tar Sands Leasing Act of 2008\" and it pertains to leasing of oil shale and tar sands. Section 369 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to extend the comment period for Governors of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming by 90 days after the public comment period on the final environmental impact statement. Section 369 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to extend the comment period for Governors of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming by 90 days after the public comment period on the final environmental impact statement. The proposed regulations under this paragraph shall be open to public comment for not less than 120 days. After amending Section 369 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to extend the comment period for Governors of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, must prepare and submit a report to Congress analyzing a commercial leasing program for oil shale and tar sands within 18 months of the Oil Shale and Tar Sands Leasing Act of 2008. The report under subsection (c) includes an analysis of technologies and programs for oil production from shale and tar sands, competitive leasing, lease terms, lease sizes, and bonus bid payments. The report under subsection (c) includes an analysis of technologies and programs for oil production from shale and tar sands, competitive leasing, lease terms, lease sizes, bonus bid payments, royalty rates, maximum leases and acreage per lessee, required infrastructure, and conditions to minimize impacts on air and water quality. The report under subsection (c) includes an analysis of technologies and programs for oil production from shale and tar sands, competitive leasing, lease terms, lease sizes, bonus bid payments, royalty rates, maximum leases and acreage per lessee, required infrastructure, and conditions to minimize impacts on air and water quality. It also addresses policies needed to mitigate adverse impacts on wildlife and environmental resources, as well as reclamation bonding requirements for disturbed areas. The report under subsection (c) includes an analysis of technologies and programs for oil production from shale and tar sands, competitive leasing, lease terms, lease sizes, bonus bid payments, royalty rates, maximum leases and acreage per lessee, required infrastructure, and conditions to minimize impacts on air and water quality. It also addresses policies needed to mitigate adverse impacts on wildlife and environmental resources, as well as reclamation bonding requirements for disturbed areas. Additionally, it identifies events that should precede commercial leasing, such as the development of viable technologies, completion of land use planning, and environmental reviews, along with an analysis of water demand and availability in collaboration with State water resources agencies. The report under subsection (c) analyzes technologies and programs for oil production from shale and tar sands, addressing competitive leasing, lease terms, infrastructure requirements, and environmental impacts. Public participation is required in the process, including input from local government, industry representatives, and other interested parties.

Public participation is required in the process, including input from local government, industry representatives, and other interested parties. The Secretary must provide timely notice to and solicit comments from the Governors of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, allowing them 90 days to provide feedback, and incorporate their responses into the report submitted to Congress. The Secretary must also refer to and use information and recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences in preparing the report. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other agencies, will arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on oil shale and tar sands development in the US, addressing energy needs, research status, and potential impacts. The study will assess the positive and negative impacts of oil shale and tar sands technologies on water resources, air quality, human health, local communities, wildlife habitat, and regional energy needs. It will also consider the timeframe for large-scale implementation. The study will evaluate the feasibility of commercial oil shale and tar sands production, including technology development, energy sources, greenhouse gas emissions, and social/environmental impacts such as water usage. The study will analyze workforce capacity requirements, terms for commercial oil shale leases on public land, viability of environmentally safe development, and recommendations for changes to Federal law to facilitate production while minimizing adverse impacts. The National Academy of Sciences will complete a study on tar sands resources within 18 months of the Oil Shale and Tar Sands Leasing Act of 2008. The results will be submitted to relevant authorities and made public. The Secretary of the Interior will report to Congress within 180 days of receiving the study results. The Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will report to Congress on the findings, recommendations, and implementation plan of the study on tar sands resources. The Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will report to Congress on the findings, recommendations, and implementation plan of the study on tar sands resources. Amendments are made to the regulations regarding lease sales based on support and interest in a State. Amendments are made to regulations regarding lease sales based on support and interest in a State, allowing Governors or local executives to submit recommendations on proposed lease sales and development plans. Amendments to regulations allow Governors or local executives to submit recommendations on proposed lease sales and development plans to the Secretary within 60 days. The Secretary will accept the Governor's recommendations and may consider those from local executives. The Secretary may determine a reasonable balance between national interest and the well-being of citizens of the affected State after consulting with the Governor. The Secretary will communicate in writing the reasons for accepting or rejecting the Governor's recommendations or implementing alternative means. The Secretary must consult with the Governor to determine a balance between national interest and the well-being of citizens of the affected State. An environmental impact statement is required before any lease sale or development activity on leased land. Subsection (i)(1)(B) is amended to refer to subsection (g) instead of subsection (e)."
