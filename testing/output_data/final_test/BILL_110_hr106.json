The Congress finds that the Rappahannocks had 3 encounters with Captain John Smith, determining he was not the \"great man\" who had caused harm to their people. In 1608, Smith mediated peace between the Rappahannock and Moraughtacund Indians after the latter stole 3 women. In 1645, Captain Claiborne unsuccessfully tried to establish treaty relations with the Rappahannocks. In April 1651, the Rappahannocks conveyed land to Colonel Morre Fauntleroy. In September 1653, Lancaster County signed a treaty with the Rappahannock Indians, giving them rights in the county court and making them more accountable to English law. The bounds of Indian settlements were also defined and marked by the county. In September 1656, (Old) Rappahannock County signed a treaty with Rappahannock Indians, rewarding them for returning English fugitives and encouraging their children to live among the English as servants. In 1658, the Virginia assembly revised an Act to ensure that Indians received 50 acres of land for each bowman before any English grants. In 1669, a census of Virginia Indians, including the majority of Rappahannocks, was conducted. In May 1677, the Treaty of Middle Plantation was signed with England, with the Pamunkey Queen Cockacoeske signing on behalf of the Rappahannocks. However, before ratification, the Queen complained about issues with the Rappahannocks and Chickahominies, who were supposed to be her tributaries. In November 1682, the Virginia Colonial Council established a 3,474-acre reservation for the Rappahannock Indians near their hunting village on the north side of the Mattaponi River. The acreage was based on the 1658 Indian land act, with a population of 70 bowmen or approximately 350 Rappahannocks. In 1683, due to raids by Iroquoian warriors, the Council ordered the Rappahannocks to leave their reservation and join the Nanzatico Indians at Nanzatico Indian Town 30 miles up the Rappahannock River. In 1706, Lieutenant Richard Covington escorted the Portobaccos and Rappahannocks out of Portobacco Indian Town in Essex County to settle in King and Queen County along the ridgeline between the Rappahannock and Mattaponi Rivers. During the 1760s, three Rappahannock girls were raised on Thomas Nelson's \"Bleak Hill\" Plantation in King William County. In the 19th century, the Saunders, Johnson, and Nelson families from Rappahannock County are core ancestors of the modern tribe. Tax records from 1819-1821 list Rappahannock ancestors in King and Queen County, providing significant documentation due to the loss of pre-1864 records. The Rappahannock presence in the area continued through the 1880s. The Upper Essex Baptist Church had a significant Rappahannock presence in its membership, with several Rappahannock surnames listed on membership rosters from pre-1863 to 1888. The decline in numbers was attributed to the establishment of St. Stephens Baptist Church by Methodist circuit rider Joseph Mastin in 1870. St. Stephens was the primary tribal church until the Rappahannock Indian Baptist Church was founded in 1964. Core Rappahannock family names like Bird, Clarke, Fortune, and Johnson were prominent in both churches. In the early 1900s, anthropologist James Mooney corresponded with the Rappahannocks, helping them formalize their tribal government. Speck assisted the tribe in fighting for their sovereign rights and in 1921, they were granted a charter from Virginia. Chief George Nelson requested support from Governor Westmoreland Davis. In 1922, the Rappahannocks established a formal school in Virginia, and Chief George Nelson testified before Congress about their civil and sovereign rights. He quoted Isaiah 40:31 in his testimony. In December 1923, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson appealed to Congress for $50,000 to establish an Indian school in Virginia. In 1930, the Rappahannocks disputed their classification in the 1930 Federal census with Virginia and the Census Bureau. Chief Otho S. Nelson requested the 218 enrolled Rappahannocks be listed as Indians, but faced challenges with classification. The Rappahannock Chief George Nelson faced challenges with the classification of his people as Indians in the 1930 Federal census. Enumerators did not ask about race during interviews and denied their request to be listed as Indians. The Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau ruled that people of Indian descent could only be classified as \"Indian\" if Indian \"blood\" predominated and \"Indian\" identity was accepted in the local community. In 1925, the Indian Rights Association assisted the Rappahannocks in fighting for recognition as an Indian Tribe. During World War II, the Rappahannocks, along with other tribes, challenged draft boards over their racial identity. The Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau insisted on classifying certain Indian draftees as Negro, leading to convictions and eventual conscientious objector status for some Rappahannocks who served in military hospitals. During World War II, the Rappahannocks, along with other tribes, challenged draft boards over their racial identity. The Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau insisted on classifying certain Indian draftees as Negro, leading to convictions and eventual conscientious objector status for some Rappahannocks who served in military hospitals. In 1943, Frank Speck noted approximately 25 Indian communities in the Eastern United States entitled to Indian classification, including the Rappahannocks. Leon Truesdell listed 118 members in the Rappahannock tribe in Virginia in the 1940s. The United States Department of the Interior included the Rappahannocks in their list of Tribes by State and Agency in 1940. In 1948, the Smithsonian Institution Annual Report featured an article by William Harlen Gilbert on the surviving Indian groups in the Eastern United States. The Rappahannock Tribe, included in the article \"Surviving Indian Groups of the Eastern United States\", operated a school in Indian Neck in the late 1940s and early 1950s. They later entered Marriott High School in 1965 and worked with the Coalition of Eastern Native Americans in 1972 for Federal recognition. In 1979, they established a pottery and artisans company with other Virginia tribes, and in 1980 received funding for an economic program through the Administration for Native Americans. In 1983, the Rappahannock Tribe received State recognition, acknowledging their perseverance in maintaining their community, tribal culture, and traditions. Thomasina E. Jordan is praised for her efforts in gaining federal recognition for Virginia Indians, laying the foundation for federal recognition. The Act defines key terms such as \"Tribe,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"member.\" The Act also addresses federal recognition. Federal recognition is granted to the Tribe, allowing them to access federal services and benefits provided to recognized Indian tribes. All applicable laws and regulations of the United States pertaining to Indians are extended to the Tribe and its members. The Tribe's service area for enrolled members includes King and Queen, Caroline, Essex, Spotsylvania, Stafford, and Richmond Counties in Virginia. SEC. 4. MEMBERSHIP; GOVERNING DOCUMENTS.\n\nThe Tribe's membership roll and governing documents will be the most recent ones submitted to the Secretary before the enactment of this Act. The governing body will remain the same as of the enactment date, or a new one chosen according to the Tribe's governing documents. Any land transfers within specific Virginia counties will be taken into trust for the Tribe's benefit by the Secretary. Additionally, a gaming prohibition is in place. SEC. 7 prohibits gaming on land taken into trust for the tribe. SEC. 8 ensures hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, and water rights of the Tribe and its members are not affected."
