    "content": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) was established on July 1, 2002, with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for serious international crimes. It has received referrals for war crimes in Uganda, Congo, and Central African Republic, as well as atrocities in Darfur, Sudan. The Chief Prosecutor has opened investigations into cases in Congo, Uganda, and Darfur, issuing five arrest warrants related to the situation in Northern. Five arrest warrants have been issued by the Court in connection to the situation in Northern Uganda. The United Nations, human rights organizations, and democratic nations support the ICC, while the Bush Administration opposes it and signed the American Servicemembers' Protection Act to restrict cooperation with the ICC. President Clinton signed the treaty in 2000, but the United States ultimately voted against the Statute. President Clinton signed the Rome Statute in 2000, but the United States ultimately voted against it. The Bush Administration also opposes the treaty and has notified the U.N. Secretary General of the U.S. intent not to ratify it. The primary objection is the ICC's potential jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers and policymakers, even without ratification. The United States threatened to veto a U.N. resolution on extending the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia due to concerns about ICC jurisdiction over U.S. personnel. A compromise was reached for the ICC to defer prosecution of non-ICC member nationals involved in U.N. peacekeeping for one year. This did not provide permanent immunity for U.S. soldiers and officials. The Security Council deferred potential prosecutions for U.S. soldiers and officials by invoking article 16 of the Rome Statute. The deferral was extended to July 1, 2004, but opposition led to dropping the pursuit of extending it through 2005. The United States seeks bilateral agreements to prevent extradition of its citizens to the ICC. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) was enacted to regulate U.S. cooperation with the ICC. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) regulates U.S. cooperation with the ICC. The primary objection by the United States is the ICC's potential jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers and officials for \"war crimes.\" The Administration seeks immunity from ICC jurisdiction for Americans. The threat of prosecution by the ICC could impede the United States in military operations and foreign policy, impacting sovereignty. Detractors see it as a reluctance to be held accountable for human rights violations. U.S. officials and critics object to the Rome Statute, while foreign allies supporting the ICC may have counterpositions. This section aims to outline key objections and issues in the current debate. The ICC's jurisdiction over non-party nations is a point of contention. Supporters argue it applies to individuals, not nations, while opponents highlight the potential impact on official policy. The Rome Statute does not bind non-party states, but they may choose to cooperate or defend their interests in related cases. The ICC's jurisdiction over non-party nations is debated, with supporters arguing it applies to individuals, not nations. Opponents raise concerns about the impact on official policy. Some argue that crimes covered by the Rome Statute are already prohibited under international law, allowing any nation to assert jurisdiction. ICC opponents dispute the concept of \"universal jurisdiction\" as not universally accepted. Some academics dispute the ICC's jurisdiction, arguing that state practice does not fully support it. However, ICC supporters note that the Rome Statute has pre-conditions for jurisdiction, including consent from the State where the crime occurred or the accused's State of nationality. The United States is already subject to ICC prohibitions due to existing treaties. Supporters argue that without jurisdiction over non-party States, rogue regimes could evade ICC reach. The majority of countries rejected the US proposal to give the UN Security Council a mandatory role in ICC jurisdiction decisions. Concerns were raised about potential misuse of the ICC to target American citizens. Supporters argue that the principle of \"complementarity\" will prevent ICC jurisdiction over American citizens unless the US fails to investigate the allegations. Some argue that the US is unlikely to be targeted for prosecution by the ICC, while others express concern about the ICC second-guessing US prosecutors. Unfriendly countries may use the ICC to label US foreign policy decisions as \"criminal,\" but supporters believe unfounded charges would be dismissed. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor has shown reluctance to investigate the United States. The Chief Prosecutor of the ICC has declined to investigate the United States based on allegations regarding its conduct in Iraq, citing the limitations of the Court's jurisdiction and the insufficient gravity of the allegations. The ICC Prosecutor's unchecked discretion could lead to politicized prosecutions, but there are restraints in place such as seeking permission for self-initiated cases and removal by the Assembly of States Parties. U.S. negotiators wanted the U.N. Security Council to oversee prosecutors to prevent politicization, but others feared it could lead to even more politicized prosecutions. The ICC Statute grants the ICC the authority to define and punish the crime of \"aggression,\" a prerogative of the UN Security Council. Supporters argue that States Parties will vote on a definition after seven years, preserving the UN's role. Opponents fear lack of agreement on the definition may lead to politicized prosecutions. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in 1974 addressing the definition of aggression, but it has only been invoked once by the Security Council. The ICC will not offer accused Americans the due process rights guaranteed them under the U.S. Constitution, such as the right to a jury trial. Some argue that the Rome Statute provides similar protections, noting that the U.S. Constitution does not always afford American citizens the same procedural rights. The U.S. policy on military tribunals in the war against terrorism raises concerns about double standards in war crimes trials. Congress has passed laws to prevent funding support for the International Criminal Court (ICC). The American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002 and other provisions restrict assistance to ICC member countries. The Economic Support Fund provides assistance to ICC member countries without \"Article 98\" agreements with the US. The Nethercutt Amendment was reauthorized by the 109th Congress in the FY2006 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act restricts US cooperation with the ICC. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) prohibits the United States from cooperating with the ICC in prosecuting individuals like Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden. It shields US Armed Forces and covered persons from ICC jurisdiction, prohibiting any government entity from assisting the ICC in various ways. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) prohibits U.S. cooperation with the ICC in prosecuting individuals like Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden. It restricts assistance to prevent ICC use and transfer of classified information, and limits U.S. participation in UN peacekeeping missions to avoid ICC prosecution risks. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) prohibits U.S. cooperation with the ICC to avoid prosecution risks. U.S. personnel are exempt from ICC prosecution, and agreements like Article 98 may provide some assurance but may not fully prevent surrender to the ICC. If a crime is committed in a state party to the Rome Statute, ICC jurisdiction may still apply despite such agreements. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) prohibits U.S. cooperation with the ICC to avoid prosecution risks. U.S. personnel are exempt from ICC prosecution, and agreements like Article 98 may provide some assurance but may not fully prevent surrender to the ICC. The country under a peacekeeping mission may consent to the ICC's jurisdiction over U.S. participants for alleged crimes committed on its territory. The President can waive restrictions on U.S. participation in peacekeeping missions if it serves the national interest. This could imply the President's authority to commit U.S. troops to U.N. missions without Congress approval. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) restricts military assistance to countries that are members of the ICC, with exceptions for NATO countries and major non-NATO allies. The President can waive this restriction if it serves the national interest. Military assistance includes foreign aid and defense articles financed by the government. The President can also commit U.S. troops to U.N. peacekeeping missions without Congress approval. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) restricts military assistance to ICC member countries, with exceptions for NATO and major non-NATO allies. The President can waive this restriction in the national interest. Countries can avoid the restriction by signing Article 98 agreements with the U.S. or if the President deems it justified. Around 100 countries have signed such agreements, but it's unclear if they are ratified. The President is authorized to use all means necessary to release covered U.S. and allied persons. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) allows the President to use necessary and appropriate means to release detained U.S. and allied persons from ICC custody. It authorizes legal representation, assistance, and defense before the ICC for these individuals. Presidential waivers are available for certain restrictions under the ASPA. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) allows the President to use necessary means to release detained U.S. and allied persons from ICC custody. Presidential waivers are available for certain restrictions under the ASPA, including waivers of sections 2005 and 2007 if the ICC agrees not to assert jurisdiction over covered individuals. The waivers can be extended if the ICC abides by the agreement, and specific waivers can be granted for peacekeeping missions or military assistance to specific countries. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) allows the President to provide military assistance to a country if it is in the national interest or if the country has an agreement with the United States under Article 98 of the Rome Statute. NATO and major non-NATO allies are exceptions. The President can waive prohibitions on cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC) if the ICC agrees to certain conditions and the President certifies to Congress that it is in the national interest. The President can waive prohibitions on cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC) under the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) if it is in the national interest. The waiver would involve preventing transfer of classified information to the ICC and its member countries unless assurances are given that the information will not be shared with the ICC. Section 2006 of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) allows for waivers regarding the President's requirement to implement rules, obtain assurances from recipients other than the ICC, or waive the rules themselves in specific cases. Section 2011 provides exceptions for certain presidential authorities, stating that restrictions on cooperation with the ICC and procedures to protect sensitive information do not apply to actions taken by the President on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of their authority. The section clarifies the President's notification requirements to Congress, prohibits delegation of certain authorities, and aims to prevent conflicts between the President and Congress over constitutional authority. Section 2011 clarifies the President's notification requirements to Congress and addresses potential conflicts over constitutional authority. It hinges on the interpretation of the President's executive powers under the Constitution, including his authority as Commander in Chief. The broad interpretation suggests the executive power includes executing any law, making certain sections and waiver provisions potentially unnecessary. Interpreted narrowly, executive authorities could refer to powers not shared with Congress, limiting its authority to regulate actions. Section 2015 clarifies assistance to international efforts, allowing the US to render aid in bringing individuals accused of crimes to justice. This language may limit the prohibitions in section 2004. The language in section 2015 clarifies assistance to international efforts in bringing individuals accused of crimes to justice, potentially limiting the prohibitions in section 2004 of the ASPA. The provision could impact participation in peacekeeping missions and military assistance, particularly in cases involving foreign nationals. The ASPA encourages the President to submit reports on military alliances' command arrangements and their potential impact on U.S. servicemembers under foreign control. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibits ESF assistance to ICC member countries without an Article 98 agreement with the U.S. The Nethercutt Amendment, part of the FY2006 Consolidated Appropriations Act, allows the President to waive restrictions on economic assistance for countries that enter into Article 98 agreements with the U.S. NATO members and major non-NATO allies can also be exempted without prior notice to Congress if deemed in the national security interest. The President can grant waivers for economic assistance restrictions to NATO or major non-NATO allies, as well as other countries if it serves the national interests of the United States. The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for FY2007 continues these prohibitions, while the Senate passed a measure to modify ASPA and end the ban on International Military Education and Training assistance to ICC member countries. The House version of the FY2007 Defense Authorization bill does not include a provision for International Military Education and Training (IMET) assistance to countries that are members of the ICC without Article 98 agreements. The House Armed Services Committee believes the President should have the authority to waive funding restrictions to prevent undue influence on U.S. partner nations by third-party governments. Some suggest passing legislation to close jurisdictional gaps in U.S. criminal law to avoid becoming a safe haven for those accused of genocide and war crimes. The War Crimes Act of 1996 and the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of 1987 establish U.S. federal jurisdiction to punish war crimes and genocide committed by or against U.S. nationals. Concerns have been raised about war criminals seeking refuge in the U.S., but the ASPA allows cooperation with the ICC for foreign nationals accused of war crimes. Some suggest broadening U.S. statutes to cover crimes under ICC jurisdiction to enhance complementarity. War crimes by U.S. persons are mostly covered by the War Crimes Act, but some acts under the Rome Treaty may not be explicitly prohibited. U.S. law does not codify crimes against humanity, but prohibits most crimes under the Rome Statute if committed within the U.S. or by military personnel. Acts that could be crimes against humanity by U.S. civilians overseas are not explicitly addressed. The United States may not be able to investigate and prosecute alleged crimes against humanity committed by U.S. civilians overseas, unless they involve torture or certain acts of international terrorism. The U.S. played a significant role in the drafting of rules for the International Criminal Court (ICC), but now the Assembly of States Parties oversees the implementation of the Rome Statute. The International Criminal Court (ICC) held its first conference in September 2002, adopting rules and electing officials. In February, 18 judges were elected, with Philippe Kirsch chosen as president. Luis Moreno Ocampo was elected as the ICC's first prosecutor in April 2003. The first Review Conference was scheduled for July 2009, allowing for amendments to the Statute. The United States, as a non-party, has observer status in both the Assembly and Review Conferences. The Assembly of States Parties adopted rules for observers at its first conference, allowing them to participate in deliberations but not suggest agenda items or make motions. The United States, as a non-party, can participate in debates and communicate with the Assembly using its position at the United Nations. The United States, as a non-party to the Rome Statute, is unable to vote in bodies related to the International Criminal Court. This includes not being able to nominate U.S. nationals as judges, vote on the ICC's budget, or participate in decisions regarding the crime of aggression. However, as a Permanent Member of the Security Council, it can influence referrals to the Prosecutor. The United States, as a non-party to the Rome Statute, has the option to cooperate with ICC investigations and prosecutions, but is not obligated to do so. It can also choose not to provide information that could harm its national security interests. Additionally, the U.S. is not required to contribute to the ICC's budget, except potentially indirectly through the U.N. General Assembly budget. The U.N. General Assembly budget may include support for the ICC. Perspectives vary on the ICC's impact on U.S. interests, with some viewing it as a threat to U.S. armed forces and policymakers, while others see it as a valuable tool for deterring crimes against humanity. Debate over the ICC has created tension between international legal justice and countries' perceived right to use force. The review of NATO bombing in Kosovo by the ICTY as a potential war crime has sparked outrage among ICC opponents. The ICC's decision not to investigate allegations related to NATO bombing in Kosovo has sparked debate. Opponents fear politically motivated cases against U.S. citizens, while supporters see it as a sign of the ICC's discretion. The U.S.'s lack of participation in the ICC could hinder its functioning, as the court relies on States Parties for support. Some view the ICC as a threat to U.S. foreign and defense policy. The ICC's decision not to investigate allegations related to NATO bombing in Kosovo has sparked debate. Opponents fear politically motivated cases against U.S. citizens, while supporters see it as a sign of the ICC's discretion. The U.S.'s lack of participation in the ICC could hinder its functioning, as the court relies on States Parties for support. Some view the ICC as a threat to U.S. foreign and defense policy, potentially impacting the country's moral high ground and global influence. The U.S.'s actions against the ICC may strain relationships with allies and be perceived as coercive. This could reinforce the perception of the U.S. as seeking immunity from international law, potentially undermining coalition-building efforts and international support for its actions. The perception of U.S. commitment to the rule of law may not deter human rights abuses by despots like Pol Pot or Saddam Hussein. The establishment of the ICC could embolden tyrants to hold onto power, fearing prosecution for their crimes. The costs to the United States of ratifying the Rome Statute may outweigh the benefits, as seen in ASPA \u00a7 2005 prohibiting U.S. participation in certain missions. The Bush Administration has worked to prevent American citizens from being prosecuted by the ICC, with some success but also resistance. A U.N. Security Council resolution requested a one-year deferral of ICC prosecutions for peacekeepers from non-Rome Statute states. Resolution 1422, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, requests a one-year deferral of ICC prosecutions for officials from non-Rome Statute states involved in UN operations. The resolution can be renewed annually for as long as necessary, with Member States required to comply and the Security Council remaining involved. The Security Council resolution, renewed under Resolution 1487 for another year, did not grant permanent immunity to U.S. troops from the ICC. Instead, a compromise was reached invoking article 16 of the Rome Statute for a 12-month deferral of investigations or prosecutions. Critics argued that the Security Council cannot alter international treaties. The Security Council resolution, renewed under Resolution 1487 for another year, invoked article 16 of the Rome Statute for a 12-month deferral of investigations or prosecutions. This did not grant permanent immunity to U.S. troops from the ICC. Resolutions 1422 and 1487 appear consistent with the Rome Statute, allowing the ICC to investigate and prosecute crimes occurring after the deferral period ended in July 2004. U.S. military personnel participated in UNMIL under the Security Council's authorization for a multinational force to enforce the cease-fire. Officials or personnel from a contributing State not party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court are under the exclusive jurisdiction of that State for acts related to the Multinational Force in Liberia. U.S. participants in the U.N. mission in Liberia have permanent immunity from the ICC. President Bush certified this under ASPA \u00a7 2005. Liberia ratified the Rome Statute in 2004. The United States also sent troops to Haiti for peacekeeping. In 2004, the United States sent troops to participate in the U.N. mission to establish peace in Haiti. President Bush certified U.S. servicemembers' participation due to Haiti signing an Article 98 agreement. In 2005, the U.N. Security Council referred reports about the situation in Darfur, Sudan to the ICC Prosecutor, the first such referral from the U.N. Security Council. Sudan, not a party to the ICC, had not consented to its jurisdiction, so the ICC's jurisdiction over the case was established through the U.N.S.C. referral. The ICC was authorized to take a case on the situation in Darfur, with the Resolution being binding on all U.N. member states. The United States abstained from voting on the Resolution due to its stance on the ICC's jurisdiction over non-member states. The U.S. supported an African tribunal for accountability in Darfur but ultimately agreed to abstain once sovereignty language was included in the Resolution. The United States abstained from voting on the Resolution regarding the ICC's jurisdiction over non-member states, showing support for a version of the Rome Statute that would allow the U.N. Security Council to refer cases involving non-States Parties to the ICC. This decision may be viewed as a compromise to address atrocities in Darfur while protecting U.S. nationals and troops. The United States is pursuing bilateral agreements to protect its troops from being surrendered to the ICC, even with non-ICC member states, using Article 98 of the Rome Statute. The United States is seeking agreements to shield its troops from ICC surrender using Article 98 of the Rome Statute, which aims to preserve diplomatic immunity and immunity for heads of state. The United States is seeking Article 98 agreements to protect its troops from ICC surrender, aiming to preserve diplomatic immunity and immunity for heads of state. The agreements involve countries hosting allied forces agreeing to limit jurisdiction over government officers. The State Department pushed for broader application of these agreements, leading to debates within the European Council and the EU. The EU issued guidelines for Article 98 agreements, limiting coverage to government representatives on official business. The US would pledge to prosecute any war crimes by Americans, without a reciprocal promise for European citizens. The European Council urged President Bush to use waiver authority, reiterating the EU stance on agreements. Critics view US pursuit of immunity as unnecessary or undermining the ICC, while supporters note similar immunity agreements for soldiers in foreign courts. The 19-member ISAF, authorized by the U.N. Security Council, had immunity clauses in its agreements with the interim government in Afghanistan. These agreements, based on Article 98 of the Rome Statute, do not provide absolute immunity from the ICC but only prevent the surrender of an accused to the ICC for prosecution. The Rome Statute allows States Parties discretion in honoring extradition requests from the ICC. While Article 98 agreements can provide immunity for foreign troops, the ICC's jurisdiction may not be affected. The Administration seeks more Article 98 agreements, and Congress could tie aid to countries agreeing to protect U.S. troops. The United States could potentially make aid contingent on protecting U.S. troops from surrender to the ICC or restrict the President's waiver discretion. If negotiations fail, policymakers may consider investigating and prosecuting crimes under ICC jurisdiction by U.S. persons to preempt the ICC. This, along with broadening federal court jurisdiction, could protect U.S. citizens from ICC reach and enhance the U.S.' reputation for fair trials. To enhance its reputation for conducting fair investigations and trials of suspected war criminals, the United States could cooperate with the ICC in prosecuting serious crimes. This could involve passive non-interference or active assistance, such as referring cases to the ICC through the U.N. Security Council. Such cooperation may help overcome doubts about the genuineness of U.S. investigations and promote human rights and the rule of law. Referring cases to the ICC through the Security Council could minimize problems with referrals by States Parties or the prosecutor. However, pursuing immunity for U.S. citizens while cooperating with the ICC for foreigners may be seen as a double standard."
