Private and public sectors rely on critical physical and information networks for defense and national security. A continuous national effort is needed to ensure reliable cyber and physical infrastructure services for defense, government continuity, economic prosperity, and quality of life in the United States. The national effort requires extensive modeling and analytic capabilities to ensure the stability of complex systems and make policy recommendations for protecting critical infrastructure. The policy of the United States aims to minimize disruptions to critical infrastructures, involve public-private partnerships, and ensure continuity of essential government functions. Additionally, a national competence for critical infrastructure protection is established. The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) supports the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection and Continuity Board by providing modeling, simulation, and analysis of critical infrastructures to enhance understanding and facilitate modifications. The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) supports the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection and Continuity Board by providing modeling, simulation, and analysis of critical infrastructures to enhance understanding and facilitate modifications, including acquisition of necessary data and education and training on potential disturbances. The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) supports the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection and Continuity Board by providing modeling, simulation, and analysis to enhance the stability and preservation of critical infrastructures. This includes responses to incidents or crises involving critical infrastructures and recommendations to policymakers and government agencies. The Board provides critical infrastructure requirements of Federal agencies to the Center for support. SEC. 5 defines \"critical infrastructure\" as vital systems and assets crucial to national security, economic security, public health, or safety. SEC. 6 authorizes $8,000,000 for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency for the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center in fiscal year 2002."
