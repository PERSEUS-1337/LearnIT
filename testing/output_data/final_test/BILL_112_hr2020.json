    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preservation of Access to Osteoporosis Testing for Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 2011\". Congress recognizes the importance of osteoporosis prevention and standardized coverage for bone mass measurement under Medicare since 1997. Despite federal initiatives, osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated, leading to a lack of early diagnosis for many patients. The cost of fractures is expected to rise from 2005 to 2025, with Caucasians being most at risk. Osteoporosis fractures are projected to increase significantly among Latino, Asian-American, and African-American populations from 2005 to 2025. African-American women have a higher risk of mortality following a hip fracture. Women make up the majority of fractures and associated costs, with osteoporosis-related fractures surpassing the combined annual incidence of heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer in women. The most accepted method for predicting bone mass is widely supported by medical experts. The most widely accepted method for predicting bone mass and fracture risk is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA testing is cost-effective and has proven results in reducing hip fractures. It is underutilized, with only one in four women enrolled in Medicare getting tested every two years. The underutilization of bone mass measurement, particularly DXA testing, is a concern for Medicare due to the high prevalence of osteoporosis and low bone mass in individuals aged 50 and older in the United States. The increasing number of osteoporosis fractures and the associated costs, especially among the population aged 65 and older, further highlight the need for more widespread testing to reduce the economic burden. The economic burden of osteoporosis fractures is projected to increase by nearly 50 percent from 2005 to 2025, reaching 25.3 million in 2025. Underutilization of bone mass measurement will strain the Medicaid budget, with reimbursement for DXA and VFA being significantly reduced, discouraging physicians from providing access to these tests. The decline in DXA testing for older women in 2009 is a concern as it may lead to limited access to bone mass measurement. This trend could worsen the underutilization of benefits if more physicians stop offering these tests in their offices. SEC. 3. Extending minimum payment for bone mass measurement. The Social Security Act is amended to extend payment provisions for bone mass measurements from 2010 through 2013. The Secretary is authorized to implement these changes. The Secretary is authorized to implement amendments through program instruction or other means."
