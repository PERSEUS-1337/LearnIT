Up to 25 qualified providers can participate, with a limit of 17 providers in urban areas. Providers under common ownership will be treated as a single entity. When selecting providers for medical adult day care services under the demonstration program, preference will be given to home health agencies under common ownership that serve multiple states. The Secretary will evaluate the program's clinical and cost effectiveness and submit a report to Congress within 3 years, analyzing patient outcomes and costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary will evaluate the program's clinical and cost effectiveness for Medicare beneficiaries receiving medical adult day care services compared to those receiving only home health services for the same health conditions. Recommendations on program extension, expansion, or termination will be made based on the evaluation. Data from the OASIS system will be used, and additional data may be collected from qualified providers participating in the demonstration program. Medical adult day care services are provided by public or private organizations that offer skilled nursing and therapeutic services. These facilities must meet quality standards set by the Secretary to ensure the health and safety of individuals receiving care. The text describes the requirements for a facility to provide medical adult day care services, including being licensed or certified by a State for at least 24 months. The term 'medical adult day care services' refers to items and services provided to a Medicare beneficiary by a qualified provider as part of a plan that includes home health services. The items and services provided in a medical adult day care setting include home health services, transportation to and from the facility, meals, and supervised activities. The Medicare beneficiary is entitled to supervised activities promoting physical and mental health in a group setting."
