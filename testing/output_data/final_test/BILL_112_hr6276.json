    "content": "The \"Commercial Fishing, Farm, and Ranch Risk Management Act\" establishes Commercial Fishing, Farm, and Ranch Risk Management Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In eligible farming businesses or commercial fishing, individuals can deduct cash payments made to a Commercial Fishing, Farm, and Ranch Risk Management Account (CFFR Account). The deduction is limited to 20 percent of taxable income attributable to the eligible business. Eligible farming business is defined as any farming business. The term 'farming business' refers to any farming business that is not a passive activity of the taxpayer. 'Commercial fishing' is defined as fishing that is not a passive activity of the taxpayer. The Commercial Fishing, Farm, and Ranch Risk Management Account (CFFR Account) is a trust created for the exclusive benefit of the taxpayer, with specific requirements for contributions. The requirements for contributions to the Commercial Fishing, Farm, and Ranch Risk Management Account include limits on deductions, trustee qualifications, asset composition, and restrictions on commingling assets. The CFFR Account of a taxpayer includes amounts distributed during the taxable year, along with deemed distributions under specific circumstances outlined in subsection (f). Exceptions apply to certain distributions. Exceptions to the distribution rules for CFFR Accounts include distributions not attributable to income, and limits on contributions exceeding certain thresholds. Special rules apply for nonqualified balances in CFFR Accounts after 10 years. If there is a nonqualified balance in a CFFR Account, it will be deemed distributed during the taxable year, and the taxpayer's tax will be increased by 10 percent of the distribution amount. This rule does not apply if the balance is distributed to the taxpayer before the tax return due date for that year. The CFFR Account has a nonqualified balance which will be subject to a 10 percent tax if not distributed before the tax return due date. Distributions from the account are made in the order of deposit, starting with the earliest deposits. If the taxpayer ceases to be engaged in an eligible farming business, certain rules apply. If a taxpayer is not engaged in farming or fishing for 3 consecutive years, the balance in their CFFR Account will be deemed distributed. Rules similar to those for treatment on death and loss of exemption apply. The section discusses rules related to CFFR Accounts, including prohibited transactions, pledging accounts as security, community property laws, and custodial accounts. It also specifies when payments are deemed made and clarifies that the term \"individual\" does not include estates or trusts. Additionally, it states that deductions are not allowed for self-employment tax. The deduction for self-employment tax is not allowed under subsection (a). The trustee of a CFFR Account must report contributions, distributions, and other matters to the Secretary and the account beneficiary. Additionally, there is a tax on excess contributions to certain tax-favored accounts under section 4973 of the Code. Section 4973 of the Code is amended to include a CFFR Account as a type of account subject to tax on excess contributions. Excess contributions to a CFFR Account are defined as the amount exceeding the allowable contribution limit for the year. The contribution distributed from the CFFR Account under section 468C(e)(2)(B) is treated as not contributed. The heading for section 4973 of the Code is amended. The heading for section 4973 of the Code is amended by striking the item relating to section 4973 and inserting a new item. Tax on Prohibited Transactions: A special rule for farm accounts exempts individuals with a CFFR Account from the tax on prohibited transactions if the account ceases to be a CFFR Account due to specific circumstances. The tax code is amended to include a CFFR Account in certain reporting requirements and a table of sections is updated accordingly. The tax code is amended to include Commercial Fishing, Farm, and Ranch Risk Management Accounts. The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act."
