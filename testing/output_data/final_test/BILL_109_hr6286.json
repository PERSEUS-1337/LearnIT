    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Department of Homeland Security Stabilization and Security Enhancement Act of 2006\". Congress transferred the Nebraska Avenue Complex (NAC) facilities to the Administrator of General Services for the Department's leadership under Public Law 108-268. The NAC was intended as a temporary station due to security concerns, and there is a dispute over whether Public Law 108-268 established an official Department headquarters. The NAC was chosen as the initial leadership station for the new Department due to preexisting infrastructure and security measures. Security concerns remain, with discussions to potentially move the Coast Guard headquarters to St. Elizabeth's Hospital in the future. St. Elizabeth's Hospital, founded in 1852, was considered as a potential headquarters location for components of the Department due to its secure campus in Washington, D.C. Despite being labeled as one of the \"11 Most Endangered Places\" in 2002, Congress has suspended the Coast Guard's plans to move there. Congress has suspended the Coast Guard's plans to relocate to St. Elizabeth's Hospital due to lack of planning and coordination with oversight committees. Waivers have been granted in the past for agencies with national security concerns to locate outside of the District of Columbia. The Department of Homeland Security, similar to other federal entities like the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency, needs to consolidate its operations into a single secure location to enhance its effectiveness and national security mission. It is crucial to provide the Department with the necessary space and resources for its critical mission. The Department of Homeland Security needs a permanent, secure headquarters to ensure the safety of its employees, improve integration among its agencies, and effectively carry out its national security mission. The headquarters should be a new 21st century complex tailored to the Department's specific needs. The Department of Homeland Security requires a modern, secure headquarters with communicative infrastructure conducive to high productivity, accessibility, modern technologies, and space for future expansion. SEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE LOCATION FOR HEADQUARTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. This section amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to address the headquarters location for the Department of Homeland Security. The purpose of this section is to establish a permanent headquarters for the Department of Homeland Security, with a comprehensive master plan to be submitted to relevant Senate and House committees within 360 days. The headquarters will be designed to be permanent. The House of Representatives requires a permanent master plan for the Department of Homeland Security's headquarters. The House of Representatives requires a permanent master plan for the Department of Homeland Security's headquarters, as stated in Sec. 104."
