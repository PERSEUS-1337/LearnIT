    "content": "The \"Cost of Production Safety Net Act of 1998\" defines loan commodities as wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and grain sorghums. The Secretary of Agriculture is referred to as the Secretary in this Act. Fair return commodity loans are provided for wheat and feed grains. The Cost of Production Safety Net Act of 1998 provides nonrecourse fair return commodity loans for wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and grain sorghums. Producers must forgo marketing assistance loans to be eligible for these loans. Loan rates for wheat and corn are determined by the Secretary to ensure a fair return in relation to production costs. The loan rates for wheat and corn are set at 75 percent of the average production costs in the US for the most recent 5 years. The rates for grain sorghum, barley, and oats are determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable. The fair return commodity loan terms include a 12-month term initially, with a possible 6-month extension if beneficial for producers. Repayment rates are determined by the Secretary for producers on a farm. The fair return commodity loan terms include repayment rates determined by the Secretary to minimize forfeitures, stock accumulation, storage costs, and promote competitive marketing domestically and internationally. The limitations outlined in Section 4 aim to regulate and control various aspects of the commodity loan program to prevent stock accumulation, minimize forfeitures, and promote competitive marketing. The maximum quantity of loan commodities eligible for fair return commodity loans under this Act during a crop year is specified for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, and oats. The total amount of loans a person can receive for one or more commodities in a crop year is capped at $100,000, with regulations defining the term \"person.\" Regulations will define the term \"person\" and establish rules to ensure fair application of the limitation on loans and payments. Producers must own the loan commodity to be eligible for fair return commodity loans under this Act. To be eligible for fair return commodity loans under this Act, individuals must own the loan commodity, provide labor and management for the farm, and invest capital in the operation or ownership of the farm.
