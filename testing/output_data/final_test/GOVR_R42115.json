    "content": "The central policy objective of a national infrastructure bank is to increase investment in infrastructure to boost productivity and public welfare. Empirical analysis shows mixed results on the productivity gains from infrastructure investment, with the type of infrastructure and investment being crucial factors. Proposals for a national infrastructure bank involve providing low-interest loans to stimulate investment by state, local governments, and private sources, complementing direct federal investment. Infrastructure is essential for delivering basic services and can be owned and operated by both public and private entities. Funding for infrastructure projects often comes from borrowing money on capital markets, government grants, loans, and private equity. Investors seek a rate of return on debt-financed assets, which can be repaid through taxes, user fees, or a combination of both. User fees are the main option for repaying debt on privately owned infrastructure projects. A national infrastructure bank is being proposed as a new way to fund infrastructure projects. Proponents argue that it could increase investment by leveraging state, local, and private resources, accelerate project construction, and distribute federal spending based on anticipated returns. An infrastructure bank is a government-established entity that provides credit assistance to sponsors of infrastructure projects. It can take various forms and is different from commercial banks or private-sector funds. An infrastructure bank, unlike a commercial bank, is government-established and provides credit assistance through loans, guarantees, and lines of credit for infrastructure projects. Borrowers are expected to repay with interest and fees. Examples include the European Investment Bank and state infrastructure banks in the US. The European Investment Bank (EIB) finances economic development projects through low-interest, long-term loans to public and private entities within the EU. It is capitalized by member countries and issues bonds, with additional funds available if needed. The EIB is overseen by a board of governors and directors, who review project appraisal reports before making financing decisions. The bank's AAA rating and government backing allow it to offer favorable loan terms. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a large nonprofit organization with a AAA rating, backed by member governments. It supports various projects in transportation, energy, telecommunications, health, education, and the environment, including private industry and research. In 2010, the EIB loaned \u20ac72 billion, with total assets of \u20ac420 billion. It financed 460 large projects in 72 countries. Many state governments have established infrastructure banks to support transportation projects. State governments have established infrastructure banks to support transportation projects, with most created in response to a federal state infrastructure bank program established in 1995. According to the Federal Highway Administration, 32 states and Puerto Rico had authorized SIBs by December 2008. Some states like Florida, Georgia, Kansas, and Ohio have SIBs unconnected to the federal program. SIBs can be capitalized using federal surface transportation funds, with requirements set by federal law but structure and administration determined at the state level. Most SIBs are within state departments of transportation, while some, like Missouri, are set up as nonprofit corporations. State governments have established infrastructure banks to support transportation projects, with most created in response to a federal state infrastructure bank program established in 1995. Some SIBs function as revolving loan funds, providing assistance to non-transportation projects. Leveraged SIBs like those in Florida and South Carolina use initial capital as security for issuing bonds to raise further capital. SIBs offer project sponsors credit assistance like letters of credit and loan guarantees. The Export-Import Bank uses direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance to assist overseas purchasers. The Export-Import Bank provides working capital guarantees, export credit insurance, and financing to support U.S. exports of goods and services, including infrastructure-related technologies. Congress may need to amend the bank's charter and expand its resources to support public and private entities investing in domestic infrastructure. Several infrastructure bank bills are pending before the 112th Congress. Several infrastructure bank bills are pending before the 112th Congress, including S. 652, S. 936, and H.R. 402. S. 652 and H.R. 402 would create a federal government corporation, while S. 936 would establish a \"fund\" within the Department of Transportation. Other similar bills are not separately addressed in this report. S. 1550 and H.R. 3259 would create the \"National Infrastructure Bank\" as an independent establishment. Each bill focuses on structure, eligible projects, and project selection criteria. The infrastructure bank bills pending before the 112th Congress include S. 652, S. 936, and H.R. 402. S. 652 would create the American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA), a government corporation with a seven-member board appointed by the President. This legislation may have influenced the infrastructure bank component of the \"American Jobs Act.\" The American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA) would be created as a government corporation with a board of directors appointed by the President. The board would appoint AIFA's chief executive officer and could not have more than four members from the same political party. AIFA would provide financing for infrastructure projects such as transportation, water, energy, or a combination of these, with project costs of at least $100 million or $25 million for rural projects. The American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA) would provide financing for infrastructure projects with costs of at least $100 million or $25 million for rural projects. The legislation outlines specific project categories and selection criteria, requiring projects to have a clear public benefit, not be used for refinancing existing projects, and meet infrastructure definitions. AIFA's chief executive officer must submit policies for the loan application and approval process, including eligibility criteria. The American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA) would provide loans and loan guarantees for infrastructure projects meeting specific criteria. The total loan and guarantee amounts would be capped at $10 billion annually for the first two years, $20 billion for years three through nine, and $50 billion thereafter. Repayment would come from tolls, user fees, or other dedicated revenue sources, with additional security measures required. Loan repayments must start within five years of project completion, and loan guarantee rates must align with direct loans under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). The American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA) would provide loans and loan guarantees for infrastructure projects. The interest rate on the loans would be based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities. A credit fee would be charged in addition to the base interest rate. The term of the loans cannot exceed 35 years. AIFA would be funded with a $10 billion startup appropriation from Congress. Administrative costs would be limited to $25 million in 2012 and 2013, and $50 million in 2014. The cost is the estimated long-term cost to the government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs. Introduced on May 10, 2011, S. 936 would create the American Infrastructure Investment Fund (AIIF) as part of the Department of Transportation, different from a typical infrastructure bank. The legislation aims to augment existing transportation financing programs rather than establish a stand-alone infrastructure bank. The American Infrastructure Investment Fund (AIIF) would invest in transportation infrastructure projects and fund projects that are difficult to finance due to their multijurisdictional nature. The fund would have an executive director appointed by the President and a board with seven members, including three permanent members from the Departments of Treasury, Commerce, and Energy. The American Infrastructure Investment Fund (AIIF) would have a board with seven members, including three permanent members from the Departments of Treasury, Commerce, and Energy, and four executives from the Department of Transportation appointed by the Secretary of Transportation. The President would establish a bipartisan \"Fund Advisory Committee\" (FAC) to advise on extending AIIF's activities to non-transportation infrastructure sectors. The FAC would serve three-year terms and be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The legislation for the American Infrastructure Investment Fund (AIIF) would provide funding for passenger and freight transportation projects, port infrastructure projects, and establish a National Infrastructure Investment Grant (NIIG) program for transportation-related projects. Eligible recipients include sub-national governmental entities and nongovernmental entities with a sub-federal governmental cosponsor. The NIIG program would offer loans, loan guarantees, and grants to leverage federal investment. The \"National Infrastructure Investment Grant (NIIG)\" program aims to leverage federal investment, encourage nonfederal contributions, improve mobility, incorporate new technologies, enhance energy efficiency, reduce pollution, decrease congestion, improve infrastructure condition and safety, demonstrate need for federal support, and boost economic development. The NIIG program aims to enhance economic development by providing grants for up to 80% of project costs. Sub-national governments and government-sponsored corporations are eligible. $600 million in appropriations for 2012 and 2013. Projects needing a loan or guarantee must be at least $50 million in total cost, or $10 million in rural areas. AIIF evaluates projects based on federal budget resources, grant percentage, project benefits uncertainty, and nonfederal funding. The AIIF program requires a qualification score based on the ratio of benefits to costs for project funding. Projects must adhere to the Davis-Bacon Act for prevailing local area wages. The DOT leads the environmental review process, and applicants must submit an investment plan outlining AIIF's financial commitment. AIIF assistance may include loan guarantees and direct loans if necessary. The AIIF program provides direct loans to alleviate credit market imperfections or achieve specified Federal objectives efficiently. Loans cannot be subordinated and must have rates based on Treasury securities. Appropriations of budget authority are required under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 to account for subsidy costs in the fiscal year of commitment. The AIIF program provides loans based on net present value, up to 70% of eligible costs, with repayment terms tied to cash flows. Loan guarantees are capped at 80% of potential losses, with lower percentages for less risky borrowers. The legislation also allows for the collection of fees and appropriates $5 billion for FY2012 and FY2013. Administrative expenses are limited to $50 million in 2012 and $51 million in 2013. H.R. 402 would establish a government corporation issuing public benefit bonds. The legislation proposes the creation of the National Infrastructure Development Bank (NIDB), a government corporation that would issue public benefit bonds (PBBs) to finance infrastructure projects. The PBBs would not be guaranteed by the U.S. government's full faith and credit but could be bought and sold by the Federal Reserve. The bank would have a board of five members appointed by the President, with two members required to have public sector experience and three with private sector experience. The National Infrastructure Development Bank (NIDB) would have a board of five members appointed by the President with experience in economic development and finance. It would issue public benefit bonds, make loan guarantees, borrow from global markets, and monitor infrastructure projects. The bank would also have an executive committee, risk management committee, and audit committee to oversee infrastructure financing. The National Infrastructure Development Bank (NIDB) would finance infrastructure projects, including energy, environmental, telecommunications, and transportation projects. Assistance would be provided to states and territories, with projects subject to Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements. The board would create project selection criteria prioritizing economic growth, job creation, and regional/national significance. The National Infrastructure Development Bank (NIDB) would finance infrastructure projects without a minimum size requirement. Criteria for project selection include financial terms, outside revenue sources, and prompt advancement. Specific infrastructure types like transportation should consider job growth, congestion reduction, poverty alleviation, and carbon emission reductions. The NIDB would be capitalized with $5 billion annually from FY2012 to FY2016. The NIDB would be capitalized with $5 billion annually from FY2012 to FY2016, totaling 10% of the bank's subscribed capital. The Treasury Secretary can call up to 90% of the subscribed capital, with loans not exceeding 250% of the capital. The bank will cease to exist 15 years after creation. Congress debates the scale, powers, and impact of the proposed infrastructure bank to encourage investment in large projects with regional or national benefits. An infrastructure bank could provide financing with long maturities and deferred repayment, potentially attracting private capital like pension funds and international investors. This could lead to increased investment in infrastructure, but may draw from existing sources of capital. The Congressional Budget Office has noted that an infrastructure bank may not be the most cost-effective way to increase infrastructure investment. The federal government already has programs like the state revolving loan fund and TIFIA that provide low-interest loans for infrastructure projects. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program offers low-interest loans for transportation projects, leading some to view it as an infrastructure bank. Proposals for a Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovations Authority (WIFIA) have also been suggested for water systems. Congress would need to decide the fate of existing programs like TIFIA if creating a national infrastructure bank. A national infrastructure bank could provide credit assistance for large infrastructure projects that may face funding and financing challenges. This bank would complement existing programs like the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) and the Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovations Authority (WIFIA). A national infrastructure bank could help accelerate projects by providing financial assistance, but it may take years to establish and start operations. For example, the TIFIA program took two years to publish regulations and start issuing loans after enactment in 1998. According to DOT, demand for TIFIA assistance exceeded its budgetary authority in FY2010. National infrastructure bank proposals aim to leverage federal budget authority to encourage significant nonfederal infrastructure investment. An appropriation of $10 billion could potentially stimulate $100 billion of infrastructure investment, but the estimated risk of each project is a critical factor. Current methods for budgeting federal credit programs may underestimate risk, impacting the federal commitment. Increasing the estimated subsidy cost could reduce the available investment amount. The budgetary implications of H.R. 402 differ from other infrastructure bank proposals. This bill suggests capitalizing the bank with $25 billion in appropriations and $225 billion in callable capital. The bank could issue bonds up to 250% of its total capital, supporting up to $625 billion in bonds backed by the U.S. Treasury. The callable funding of $225 billion would likely be scored as an appropriation. The infrastructure bank proposals aim to increase investment in infrastructure while maintaining financial self-sustainability. Traditional banks are self-sustaining by borrowing at low rates and lending at higher rates, while an infrastructure bank's sustainability relies on lending at a higher rate than its cost of capital. If the bank relies on private capital, it must provide investors with a comparable rate of return. The infrastructure bank proposals aim to increase investment in infrastructure while maintaining financial self-sustainability. If the federal government bears some of the risk, investors would not require as much compensation. However, federal budgeting rules would require the value of the risk shifted to be accounted for. The need to keep the nonfederal share of projects attractive to investors is another constraint on sustainability. Charging fees for loans and loan guarantees could move the bank closer to sustainability. Charging fees for loans and loan guarantees could make the infrastructure bank more sustainable, but it may also increase financing costs. Critics argue that current public infrastructure project selection is influenced by factors like geographic equity and political favoritism, rather than project merits. Proponents believe an infrastructure bank would prioritize projects based on economic analyses, leading to an unbiased list of the best projects. An infrastructure bank for project selection may prioritize financially viable projects over those with greater social benefits, favoring projects like urban water systems and toll roads. This approach could conflict with Congress's traditional funding goals and overlook projects with extensive spillover benefits like public transit and levees. Rigorous cost-benefit analysis is crucial for selecting the most attractive projects. Cost-benefit analysis may lead to infrastructure bank funding only certain types of projects, potentially excluding others despite local support. Large, expensive projects in major urban centers could be prioritized, leaving small urban and rural areas at a disadvantage. Different rules for rural projects and funding thresholds may be necessary to address this issue. A national infrastructure bank may shift decision-making from state and local to federal level, reducing flexibility and giving centralized authority. Various banking entities, like the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility, have been established by Congress for specific purposes. The National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility serves as a lender of last resort to credit unions in need of liquidity. Government-sponsored enterprises like Freddie Mac and Farmer Mac are privately held corporations with a public purpose. Entities like the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Farm Credit System are cooperatively owned by their borrowers. The Rural Telephone Bank, established in 1971, was a mixed-ownership corporation with federal government involvement. The bank liquidated itself in 2007 after selling different classes of stock to private investors. The mixed-ownership structure was previously used for the First Bank of the United States, chartered by Congress in 1791 to stabilize the currency. Congress has established lending institutions like the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to support U.S. investors in overseas markets through loans and risk insurance. OPIC, established in 1969, operates with a government-defined purpose and commercial activities. The three bills, S. 652, S. 936, and H.R. 402, propose establishing government-owned infrastructure banks with executive branch oversight through presidential appointments. The organizational structure of these banks would impact their accountability to Congress and the President. The organizational structure of government-owned infrastructure banks impacts their accountability to federal oversight, with a spectrum ranging from wholly governmental agencies to wholly private firms. This accountability can lead to sensitivity to competing stakeholder demands, potentially diverting resources from national objectives. The legislation discussed here proposes infrastructure banks closely tied to the federal government, with different funding sources and levels of financial independence. The President would appoint boards and CEOs, with some bills allowing for seeking funds from other sources. The banks are required to pursue financial self-sufficiency like private firms, with some bills establishing government corporations motivated by financial gain. The proposed infrastructure banks would be tied to the federal government, aiming for financial self-sufficiency like private firms. Unlike existing self-supporting federal entities, these banks would not operate as monopolists due to other funding sources available. The challenge lies in distinguishing the benefits of self-sufficiency from those of monopolistic operations. A national infrastructure bank or similar entity faces a policy tradeoff between equitable distribution of federal investment and efficient allocation of resources. Budget constraints and uncertain future productivity from infrastructure investment further complicate the decision-making process. The federal government, state, and local governments, along with the private sector, invest in infrastructure. Government focuses on transportation and water infrastructure, while the private sector invests in energy and telecommunications. State and local governments contribute a larger share of infrastructure investment compared to the federal government. The federal government assists in infrastructure investment through direct spending on certain projects. The federal government invests in infrastructure through direct spending on projects, grants to state and local governments, and credit assistance programs. In 2010, federal spending on non-defense physical capital was $48.1 billion, grants to state and local governments were $93.3 billion, and tax preferences amounted to $26.8 billion. Federal Credit Assistance Programs include the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA), Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF), Title XI Federal Ship Financing Program, and Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program. These programs offer loans, loan guarantees, and credit assistance for infrastructure projects. The Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program, established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, offers loan guarantees for energy projects using innovative technologies to reduce pollutants. Eligible projects include renewable energy systems like nuclear power stations. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program provides loans for improving telecommunications services in rural areas. The Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund Program grants funds to states for clean water projects. The Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund Program (P.L. 100-4) provides grants to states for low-interest loans to construct municipal wastewater treatment plants. The Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund Program (P.L. 104-182) supports water system infrastructure financing for public and private systems. Loan repayments are made to states to fund new projects. Tax-Favored Infrastructure Bonds are mostly tax-exempt state and local government bonds issued for infrastructure projects. They can be general obligation bonds backed by the government's credit or revenue bonds secured by future revenue streams. In 2010, around $433 billion in debt was issued by state and local governments, with two-thirds being \"new money.\" In 2010, state and local governments issued $433 billion in debt, with two-thirds being \"new money.\" The federal government subsidizes private debt for infrastructure through tax-exempt private activity bonds, repaid by user fees or specific taxes. An infrastructure bank would likely use these tax tools for subsidization. The federal government subsidizes private debt for infrastructure through tax-exempt bonds like GARVEE bonds and Build America Bonds (BABs). BABs, which expired in 2010, offered a credit equal to 35% of the interest payment to issuers. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are the primary way for the private sector to invest in public infrastructure. Private capital seeks assets with potential for stable long-term revenues. The BAB program, which expired in 2010, saved municipal issuers $12 billion in interest costs. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) involve private sector investment in public infrastructure to generate stable long-term revenues. Revenues come from user fees like tolls or water charges, or government availability payments based on facility performance. An example is the I-595 project in Florida, where a private company will design, build, finance, operate, and maintain the facility for 35 years with availability payments from the Florida Department of Transportation. Toll rates are set by the state, and revenue goes to the state. Financing includes a federal TIFIA loan and state funds. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) involve private sector participation in infrastructure projects, with various levels of involvement. Some believe the US environment for PPPs is less favorable compared to other countries. A national infrastructure bank has been proposed to facilitate PPP formation and attract private sector funds."
