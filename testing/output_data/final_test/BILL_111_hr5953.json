The Women Veterans Bill of Rights must be prominently displayed in all Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and distributed widely to women veterans. It outlines rights such as access to comprehensive women's health care and a primary care provider who can meet all their needs. The Women Veterans Bill of Rights ensures access to comprehensive women's health care, including gender-specific, acute and chronic illness, preventive, and mental health care. It also guarantees the right to be treated with dignity and respect at all VA facilities, receive care from clinicians with specific training in women's health, and expect gender equity in clinical services. Additionally, it promotes innovation in care delivery and enhanced capabilities of medical providers to meet the needs of women veterans. The Women Veterans Bill of Rights includes provisions for equal access to health care services, parity with male veterans in health care outcomes, being informed of benefits, and being featured proportionately in outreach materials. The Women Veterans Bill of Rights includes rights such as equal consideration in hiring, securing federal contracts, access to homeless programs, fair adjudication of claims, compensation for military sexual trauma, and fair treatment by veteran service officers. The Women Veterans Bill of Rights includes the right to specialized training for veteran service officers on military sexual trauma, availability of female personnel for disability claims, and female compensation examiners. The Women Veterans Bill of Rights includes the right to gender-specific data on disability ratings, tracking outcomes for claims involving personal assault trauma, evaluating women veterans' programs, and receiving burial benefits. SEC. 2. DISPLAY OF INJURED AND AMPUTEE VETERANS BILL OF RIGHTS. The Injured and Amputee Veterans Bill of Rights must be displayed prominently in each prosthetics and orthotics clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs. This bill outlines the rights of injured and amputee veterans, including access to high-quality prosthetic and orthotic care and continuity of care during the transition from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system. The Injured and Amputee Veterans Bill of Rights ensures veterans have the right to choose their prosthetic and orthotic practitioner, receive consistent and portable healthcare, and timely care across VA facilities nationwide. The Injured and Amputee Veterans Bill of Rights guarantees veterans the right to play a role in rehabilitation decisions, receive appropriate treatment, be treated with respect, transition to civilian life honorably, and have access to complaint resolution through the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs, through veteran liaisons at each medical center, collects information on alleged mistreatment of injured and amputee veterans. Quarterly reports are submitted to the Chief Consultant of Prosthetics and Sensory Aids for investigation and addressing of complaints. SEC. 3. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must ensure that all Department employees receive training on the Women Veterans Bill of Rights and employees at prosthetics and orthotics clinics receive training on the Injured and Amputee Veterans Bill of Rights. Additionally, outreach must be conducted to inform veterans about these Bills of Rights. The Department of Veterans Affairs must ensure that Bills of Rights are available on their website and conduct outreach to inform specific groups of veterans about these rights. SEC. 4. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN SERVICES. This Act does not establish a right to any service excluded under 38 CFR 17.38 as of the enactment date."
