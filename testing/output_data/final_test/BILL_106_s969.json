    "content": "The \"School Safety Act of 1999\" is the short title of this Act. Amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act are included in this legislation. The \"School Safety Act of 1999\" includes amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, specifically regarding placement in alternative educational settings and expulsion or suspension with respect to weapons for children with disabilities. Children with disabilities who carry or possess a weapon at a school or threaten to do so can be suspended or expelled in the same way as children without disabilities. The term \"weapon\" is defined by applicable State law. The term 'threatens to carry, possess, or use a weapon' includes verbal threats to kill another person. A child expelled or suspended under this provision is not entitled to educational services during that time. The local educational agency may choose to provide educational services to a child with a disability who is expelled or suspended, even if the state does not require it for children without disabilities. The local educational agency has the discretion to provide educational services to a disabled child who is expelled or suspended, without being required to offer a free appropriate public education or specific level of service. Additionally, the agency can choose the location for providing these services. The Disabilities Education Act is amended to include exceptions in certain sections. The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 is amended to include a special rule related to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act."
