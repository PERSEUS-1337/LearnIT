Congress finds the need for a long-term investment strategy to restore economic productivity and high employment growth, focusing on information and communication technology investments. The decline in these investments led to a recession before 9/11, and the US must stimulate resurgence in these areas for vibrant growth. (5) Productivity growth of 1.5% per year doubles the standard of living every 46 years, while 3% growth doubles it every 23 years due to compounding. A focus on structural productivity growth is crucial for long-term economic strategy in the US.\n(6) American workers produced 30 times more in 1999 than in 1899 with only 5 times as many workers, increasing the standard of living from $4,200 to $33,740. The United States saw a significant increase in productivity growth in the late 1990s, breaking a 25-year trend of sluggish growth. This growth led to higher wages, profits, and government tax receipts. The high cyclical productivity growth in 2001 and 2002 was mainly due to reduced employment and increased utilization of existing capacity. A strategy is needed to generate structural productivity growth for long-term economic success. The United States needs to address the retirement of the Baby Boom generation to avoid a significant shortfall in the Social Security Trust Fund by 2030. Restoring structural productivity and high employment growth is crucial to ensure the country can meet its obligations of approximately $7.4 trillion without accumulating national debt. High speed broadband Internet connections of 10 Mbps-100 Mbps can restore productivity and employment growth in the United States. These connections will revolutionize various aspects of life and transform sectors like healthcare, commerce, government, and education. The US, known for innovation, needs to catch up in broadband deployment to maintain its leadership position. The United States lags behind other countries in broadband deployment, projected to fall to ninth place by 2005. High-speed broadband Internet is essential for public health, education, and economic welfare, with applications in e-education, e-health, e-commerce, e-government, and e-entertainment. The benefits of a national high-speed broadband Internet strategy justify prioritizing its development. The Federal Government must decide whether to act cohesively or in fragments on key policy issues. Adopting a national strategy for broadband deployment aligns with past strategies for essential infrastructure like railroads, electric power, and telephone service. The United States should rely on markets and entrepreneurs for high-speed broadband Internet deployment, minimizing government intrusion. A comprehensive strategy with a range of policy options should be crafted, with the Administration providing leadership in prioritizing them. The national strategy for high-speed broadband internet deployment is outlined in Section 3. The President must submit a report to Congress within six months outlining a strategy for nationwide high-speed broadband internet deployment. This strategy includes goals for internet speeds to boost productivity and employment, policies to promote competition among broadband providers, and incentives to increase demand for high-speed internet services. Proposal for incentives to enhance demand and supply of high-speed broadband internet services for federal mission areas like homeland security, distance learning, health, scientific collaboration, and electronic commerce. Additionally, proposals for global electronic commerce enhancement, optimal allocation of federal resources for research and development, and spectrum allocation for high-speed broadband deployment. The curr_chunk discusses the assessment of limitations to high-speed broadband internet deployment, proposals to alleviate these limitations, and the impact on productivity and employment growth in the US. It also includes any other relevant proposals on the deployment of high-speed broadband internet services. The report shall include a draft proposal of legislation required to implement the goal described in subsection (b), along with proposals set forth in that subsection."
