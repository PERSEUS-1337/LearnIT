The Federal Farm Board's efforts to boost commodity prices had failed, leading to the incorporation of acreage and marketing controls in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. The AAA aimed to reduce production by paying producers to participate in acreage control programs funded by a tax on companies processing farm products. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was created in 1933 to carry out farm legislation, funded by a tax on companies processing farm products. It was authorized to buy and sell commodities, lend money, increase production, stabilize prices, and ensure adequate supplies. Initially capitalized with $3 million, it later increased to $100 million. In 1939, Executive Order 8219 transferred ownership rights of the CCC to the Secretary of Agriculture. The CCC provided nonrecourse loans to farmers to hold their products off the market until prices improved, setting a price floor for domestic commodities. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) provided nonrecourse loans to farmers to support domestic market prices. Funding came from a tax on commodity processing and CCC's capital account. Additional legislation in the 1930s and subsequent farm bills set policy goals for USDA activities. The Government Corporation Control Act of 1945 required government corporations to be reincorporated, leading to the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act of 1948. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was established in 1948 through the Charter Act to stabilize farm income and prices, maintain agricultural commodity supplies, and facilitate distribution. Its authorities include supporting commodity prices through various operations, providing materials for production and marketing, and procuring commodities for sale to government agencies and for relief efforts. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was established in 1948 through the Charter Act to stabilize farm income and prices, maintain agricultural commodity supplies, and facilitate distribution. Its authorities include supporting commodity prices through various operations, providing materials for production and marketing, and procuring commodities for sale to government agencies, foreign governments, and domestic, foreign, or international relief agencies. CCC is directed to increase domestic consumption of commodities, expand markets, develop new markets, export commodities, carry out conservation programs, and use trade and commerce channels. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) operates under the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture, with a board of directors appointed by the President. CCC officers and advisors, who are USDA officials, maintain liaisons with other trade operations. Administrative functions are carried out by USDA employees and facilities, primarily by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Other USDA agencies also administer CCC programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) operates under the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture and is a broadly empowered financial institution responsible for direct spending and credit guarantees in agricultural commodity price support activities. CCC's funding comes from its own funds, appropriations from Congress, and borrowings. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) submits an annual business-type budget statement to Congress in accordance with government accounting statutes. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administers CCC funds through an apportionment process, setting limits on available funds. CCC-funded programs are classified as mandatory spending and do not require annual appropriations, instead borrowing from the U.S. Treasury to finance its programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has the authority to borrow from the Treasury within limits set by Congress, currently at $30 billion since 1987. CCC's activities are measured by net expenditures and net realized losses, with expenditures exceeding recouped funds. CCC-funded programs do not require annual appropriations and borrow from the Treasury to finance operations. CCC outlays represent the total cash outlays of CCC-funded programs, offset by receipts. Net realized losses are nonrecoverable losses that CCC will never recover. These losses include costs of commodities, uncollectible loans, and operating expenses. The annual appropriation for CCC varies based on the net realized loss of the previous year. The FY2019 appropriation (P.L. 116-6) provides an indefinite appropriation covering the net realized loss for FY2018, which was $15.41 billion, 8% more than FY2017. Changes in farm program payments and CCC activities fluctuate based on economic circumstances and weather conditions. CCC's assets are not considered losses until disposed of, and some operations are financed through appropriated funds unrelated to borrowing authority. The CCC has a \"parent/child\" account relationship with USAID, allocating funds for various programs. New activities like conservation and bioenergy development have been added to its original mission, with suggestions to expand further generating concern. The expansion of CCC's activities has sparked both concern and support, with some questioning if it aligns with CCC's original purpose. Mandatory funding offers stability but requires offsets under current budget rules. Appropriators have noticed the increase in agricultural programs with mandatory funding, leading to reductions in spending known as CHIMPS to offset discretionary spending increases. The FY2018 omnibus appropriation removed limitations on USDA's use of CCC's authority for surplus removal and price support activities. However, USDA's administrative powers may be restricted by executive budgetary rules like administrative PAYGO. This could hinder certain CCC actions, although it has been waived or not raised as an issue in some cases. CCC operations are mainly guided by statutory authorities. The CCC's operations are primarily directed by statutory authorities, allowing USDA discretion to support U.S. agriculture in various ways. This discretion has been used for responses to natural disasters, economic conditions, and administrative priorities. In the decade before FY2018, USDA's use of CCC's authority totaled hundreds of millions of dollars, with restrictions partially lifted in summer 2018 to assist farmers. In 2018, USDA announced assistance for farmers affected by retaliatory tariffs, authorizing $12 billion in trade aid. In 2019, an additional $16 billion was authorized. Congressional support for CCC's discretionary use varies, with some questioning USDA's use but few advocating for restrictions. Some Members have called for CCC to assist industries in their states. CCC's authority has been used for natural disasters, economic conditions, and administrative priorities. The CCC, a government-owned financial institution, has broad powers granted by Congress to support U.S. agriculture. It operates through USDA agencies and can carry out various operations to support agriculture. These powers make CCC a focus of attention from interest groups and Congress. The CCC's mandatory funding nature attracts various interest groups and Congress. Recent congressional actions have restored CCC's authority for the Trump Administration to use CCC to mitigate commodity price declines from retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. The use of CCC's discretionary authority for trade aid packages in FY2018 and FY2019 is less controversial than the total amount authorized, which brings CCC close to its borrowing authority limit of $30 billion. The CCC's borrowing authority limit of $30 billion is close to being reached due to the use of discretionary authority for trade aid packages in FY2018 and FY2019. If the limit is reached before Congress appropriates net realized loss reimbursement, CCC's functions would be suspended, impacting operations authorized in the 2018 farm bill. The corporation's permanent funding authority allows for annual reimbursement of trade aid expenditures, increasing federal spending."
