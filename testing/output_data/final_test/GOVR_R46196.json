    "content": "Solar energy can be converted into electricity using solar photovoltaic cells or by concentrating solar energy to produce heat for electricity generation. The focus is on electricity generation applications, where sunlight interacts with materials like silicon to produce electricity through the photovoltaic effect. Research is exploring alternative materials and designs for more efficient or cost-effective options. PV cells are constructed by manufacturing PV material into ingots, which are then cut into wafers for electricity generation. Wafers are processed into cells, which are assembled into modules consisting of 60 to 72 cells mounted on a plastic backing within a frame. Modules are installed in arrays, with the number depending on available space and desired generation capacity. A PV system includes modules and balance of system (BOS) equipment, such as brackets for mounting the modules. Ground-mounted systems can have fixed brackets or tracking systems that rotate to face the sun for increased electricity generation. PV systems consist of modules mounted on tracking systems to optimize sunlight exposure, generating more electricity than fixed-mount systems. Key BOS equipment includes inverters, charge controllers, and energy storage systems. PV systems are categorized by capacity, with utility-scale systems ranging from a few megawatts to a few hundred MW and connected to the electricity transmission system. PV systems, whether commercial-scale or residential-scale, are typically connected to the electricity transmission system or distribution system. They range in capacity from a few kilowatts to a few hundred kilowatts and may be installed on rooftops or the ground. Ownership models vary, with utility-scale systems usually owned by utilities or independent power producers. Ownership models for PV systems vary, with utility-scale systems typically owned by utilities or independent power producers. Smaller systems may use different ownership models based on state laws. Customer-owned systems are directly owned by the electricity consumer, who may purchase or finance the system. Third-party ownership involves a company building and maintaining a solar system on a consumer's property, with the consumer using the electricity and paying back the cost through lease payments or a power purchase agreement. Community solar allows multiple consumers to purchase or lease shares of a solar system. Community solar systems allow multiple electricity consumers to purchase or lease shares of a solar system through a subscription. Subscribers benefit from receiving electricity, financial payments, or both. Concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies collect and concentrate energy from sunlight to produce electricity, with some plants designed with thermal energy storage systems. Solar energy generation has grown in recent years, accounting for 0.7% of total U.S. electricity generation. Solar energy, including both PV and CSP, accounted for 0.7% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2014 and 2.2% in 2018. Most generation (96% in 2018) comes from PV systems, with large-scale systems (greater than 1 MW) contributing 68% of solar energy generation in 2018. Costs for solar PV systems vary by size, with an estimate of average U.S. solar PV system costs per unit of capacity shown in Figure 3 based on NREL analysis. The cost of solar PV systems varies by size, with utility-scale systems having the lowest unit costs. Larger projects tend to be cheaper per unit, and costs for all sizes have decreased in recent years. Soft costs, such as permitting and grid interconnection, are higher for smaller-scale systems compared to utility-scale systems. PV system costs have declined overall. PV system costs have declined, with NREL reporting cost decreases in all components from 2010 to Q1 2018. However, PV module costs increased in 2018 due to tariffs, offsetting declines in other components. Solar system costs vary across the U.S. and are decreasing relative to other power sources. Solar systems are becoming a cost-effective option for generating electricity in some parts of the country, thanks to policies promoting solar energy. Tax incentives can reduce ownership costs for businesses and individuals purchasing solar systems, with some costs being transferred to taxpayers. Consumers' electricity costs can be measured by the electricity rate (cents/kWh) and the electricity bill (total monthly costs in dollars). Electricity bills reflect costs to produce and deliver electricity, along with additional fees. Solar energy can impact consumer electricity costs, influenced by various factors that vary by location and change over time. Comparing electricity costs involves estimating lifetime costs of energy systems, including construction, operation, maintenance, fuel, and other expenses. Total lifetime costs strongly influence electricity rates. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a key factor in comparing electricity generation technologies. In 2019, LCOE for new utility-scale solar systems ranged from $32/MWh to $42/MWh, while wind generation was $28/MWh-$54/MWh and natural gas combined cycle generation was $44/MWh-$68/MWh. The cost of electricity generation from solar, wind, and natural gas varies. Solar energy can displace electricity from existing sources, leading to stranded costs for power plant owners. These costs may be passed on to consumers through higher electric bills, especially if new transmission lines are needed for solar systems located in rural areas. Solar energy deployment can impact electricity costs for consumers. It can lead to lower costs by avoiding transmission system upgrades but may increase costs by necessitating local distribution system upgrades. In states with carbon pricing policies, increased solar energy deployment could reduce bill impacts. Solar energy has zero marginal cost and reduces the need for fuel-consuming electricity sources, driving down marginal costs. Solar energy deployment can drive down marginal costs for the regional electricity system overall. However, as the number of solar electricity generators increases in an area, the cost benefit diminishes. Consumers in regions with solar energy development may experience rate and bill impacts, with solar customers potentially receiving financial compensation for the electricity they generate. Net metering is a common policy for this compensation. Solar consumers participating in net metering or similar policies can reduce their electricity bills to zero based on their electricity demand and solar project size. However, a potential reliability concern for solar energy is its variable nature, dependent on sunlight availability. Solar PV systems cannot generate electricity at night, and output can fluctuate during the day due to weather conditions. To ensure reliability, other electricity generation sources are used when solar energy is unavailable. Expanding infrastructure like transmission lines or energy storage can help address this issue. Solar energy's reliability can be improved by expanding infrastructure like transmission lines or energy storage. Policies promoting load shifting could also help reduce the impact of solar energy variability. The mismatch between peak solar generation and peak electricity demand poses a reliability concern, leading to the need for other sources to quickly adjust output levels, known as the \"duck curve.\" The \"duck curve\" phenomenon arises from the mismatch between peak solar generation and peak electricity demand. Strategies like load shifting, operational changes, and deploying flexible resources can address this issue. Solar PV produces DC electricity, which needs to be converted to AC using an inverter for grid optimization. Inverter-based resources in grid-connected solar PV systems do not inherently provide essential reliability services like generators that produce AC. However, inverters can be designed to offer some of these services. The electric power industry has been studying ways to protect system reliability from the unique nature of inverter-based resources since 2008. Congress has also funded research programs related to electric power. Tax incentives for solar energy equipment have been in place since 1978, with current rates established in 2005. These incentives aim to reduce the after-tax cost of investing in solar property, encouraging more investments. The incentives are scheduled to phase down in the coming years from their 2019 rates. Tax incentives for solar energy equipment have been in place since 1978, with current rates established in 2005. Investments in renewable energy property, including solar, qualify for an investment tax credit (ITC) based on the taxpayer's basis in eligible property. The credit rate for solar was 30% through 2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021, with a permanent 10% ITC set to go into effect in 2022. Special provisions allow for accelerated depreciation of solar energy property. The depreciable basis of solar energy property is reduced by 50% of any ITC claimed. Accelerating depreciation reduces the after-tax cost of investing in solar energy property. Investments in solar energy property are eligible for 100% bonus depreciation through 2022, with the rate scheduled to decrease in subsequent years. Bonus depreciation can be claimed for new and used property. Individuals purchasing solar energy property may qualify for the residential energy-efficient property credit, with the tax credit rate decreasing from 30% in 2019 to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, expiring after that year. Unused tax credits can be carried forward. Bonus depreciation can be claimed for new and used property, but not by regulated public utilities or tax-exempt organizations like electric cooperatives. Tax expenditure estimates provide information on the \"cost\" of solar tax incentives. For FY2019, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated forgone revenue of $3.4 billion for the business ITC for solar and $2.0 billion for the residential energy-efficient property credit. The revenue loss for five-year MACRS for eligible energy property was less than $50 million in FY2018. Bonus depreciation is available for new and used property, excluding regulated public utilities and tax-exempt organizations. The total cost of solar electric property for which tax credits were claimed in 2017 was $5.5 billion, generating approximately $1.6 billion in individual income tax credits. States have jurisdiction over most aspects of electricity generation and distribution, leading to the implementation of many state policies that affect the development of solar energy. One common state policy discussed is a renewable portfolio standard. Renewable portfolio standards are state policies that require utilities to procure a minimum share of their electricity sales from specified renewable sources like solar. These standards have been a key factor in driving demand for renewable electricity generation. Twenty-nine states, three U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia have mandatory electricity portfolio standards, while eight states and one territory have voluntary standards. Nine jurisdictions have targets of 100% clean energy, with solar being eligible in all cases. Specific requirements and incentives for solar are included in 19 policies. The United States has imposed tariffs on solar energy equipment since 2012, with different types of equipment discussed in the section \"How Does Solar Energy Work?\" Tariffs on solar cells and modules have been imposed by both the Obama and Trump administrations, with exemptions included in the latter's tariff. The United States has imposed tariffs on photovoltaic solar cells and modules from most countries, with exemptions and a tariff-free quota for certain cases. The tariff, scheduled to expire in February 2022, may be extended for up to four additional years. It is assessed on top of existing tariffs on Chinese and Taiwanese producers, leading to high tariff rates on some PV products. Additionally, duties on steel and aluminum imported from most countries affect BOS equipment related to solar energy. The United States has imposed tariffs on various solar equipment, including PV brackets, module frames, cabling, and power electronics housing, adding 2% - 5% to PV system costs. Additional tariffs on Chinese products, like inverters, were initially at 10% in September 2018, then raised to 25% in May 2019. The impact of tariffs on the solar industry varies across manufacturing segments, with limited expansion of U.S. manufacturing in technologically advanced PV segments. However, U.S. production of solar modules increased in 2018, and some companies have opened module assembly plants in the country. The increased domestic production of solar modules in the United States draws on imported parts and components, reflecting the industry's global supply chain. U.S. solar tariffs have negatively affected the production of polysilicon, a key raw material for solar cells, leading to a 40% decrease in U.S. production between 2015 and 2018. China retaliated with double-digit tariffs on U.S. polysilicon exports, further impacting the industry. The U.S. share of global polysilicon production fell from 29% in 2010 to 11% in 2017. In 2017, global polysilicon production in the United States dropped to 11% from 29% in 2010. China dominates global wafer production, accounting for over 80% in 2017. Solar cell production is centralized in large plants due to economies of scale. U.S. PV cell production decreased to 124 MW in 2018, the lowest since 2010. Domestic PV module manufacturers import most solar cells, representing 27% of the cost. China produced over two-thirds of the world's solar cells in 2017. Solar cell prices in the U.S. decreased from 20 cents per watt to 10 cents in 2018. Solar cell prices in the United States dropped from 20 cents per watt to 10 cents per watt by the end of 2018, marking a 50% decrease in cost. Despite additional tariffs on solar cells and modules in 2018, U.S. imports of solar cells more than doubled in value from 2016 to 2018. The trend continued with a 32% increase in U.S. imports of solar cells during the first seven months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The rise in cell imports may be attributed to the Trump Administration's solar tariff allowing duty-free import of unassembled solar cells up to 2.5 GW annually. About 650 MW of the duty-free tariff rate quota was filled from February 2018 to the end of 2018. The low fill rate of the duty-free tariff rate quota in the first year may be due to insufficient module assembly capacity in the US and stockpiling of PV cells before the tariff. If the 2.5 GW quota is reached in any year, foreign-made cells will face US tariffs for the rest of that year, creating uncertainty that hinders expansion of solar cell production in the US. The Trump Administration's solar tariff is set to last four years, with the tariff rate decreasing annually. The possibility of tariff elimination in the near future may discourage new manufacturing investments. Panasonic is the main domestic producer of crystalline-silicon solar cells in the US. While several solar cell producers have closed plants since 2012, domestic module assembly is on the rise. In 2018, around 20 factories assembled PV modules in the US, with production increasing to 1.4 GW. Construction of new solar-module assembly facilities takes about six months, with 3.9 GW of new module manufacturing capacity under construction or recently online as of late 2018. Hanwha Q Cells and Jinko Solar have opened new module-assembly facilities in the US, along with Heliene reopening a solar module facility in Minnesota. NREL reports that more solar companies plan to add 4 GW of US module assembly capacity. China dominates global module production, posing a challenge for US producers due to smaller facilities. SolarWorld and Suniva, who pushed for tariffs on imported cells and modules, have ceased production. US tariffs are higher on imports from China and Taiwan. The U.S. tariffs on imports from China and Taiwan have led manufacturers to shift production to other Asian countries like Malaysia, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico, and Thailand. These countries accounted for 85% of PV module imports into the U.S. in 2018. Inverters from China now face a 25% tariff, prompting suppliers to consider moving production elsewhere. U.S. inverter production is declining, with two major facilities closing in 2016. The U.S. tariffs on solar energy components from China have led to a shift in production to other Asian countries. Module prices globally have decreased, but in the U.S. market, they remained 61% higher in 2018. U.S. purchasers prefer Tier 1 solar modules, which are more expensive but may be more reliable. Projects using Tier 1 modules are easier to finance. The federal government does not track employment in the solar energy sector. The solar energy industry provided 242,300 full-time equivalent jobs in 2018, with 85% involving non-manufacturing work like installation, project management, trade, and maintenance. Most employment (64%) is in solar system installation and project development. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks occupational data for solar PV installers, which may show lower employment than reported figures. The solar industry saw a decline in solar jobs in 2018, with installation positions being the most affected. The number of PV systems installed in the US also decreased. Despite this, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 63% increase in solar PV installer jobs by 2028, making it the fastest-growing occupation. PV installers earned a median pay of $42,680 per year in 2018. The solar industry saw a decline in solar jobs in 2018, with installation positions being the most affected. The number of reported jobs dropped by 4,400 from November 2016. Tariffs raised the cost of foreign inputs for solar systems in U.S. factories, impacting employment. Automation limits significant increase in U.S. solar manufacturing jobs. Module manufacturing jobs are projected to decrease by 2024. Less than 2,000 workers are involved in domestic polysilicon production. Limited employment in assembly of solar factory production equipment in the United States. The solar industry in the United States faces challenges with equipment sourcing and land use impacts for energy generation. There is a lack of standardized metrics for comparing land use across different energy technologies, with factors like location-dependent variables and upstream/downstream processes affecting the analysis. Estimates of power density for energy sources vary by methodology and technology type. Power density is a metric used in the energy sector to account for land use, expressed as watts per square meter. Renewable energy sources generally require more land to produce the same amount of electricity than nonrenewable sources. Technology innovation leads to increased energy efficiency, such as with solar energy. The review of 54 studies on power density in the United States compared solar energy to other sources, finding that solar has lower power density than natural gas, nuclear, oil, and coal, but higher than wind, hydro, biomass, and most geothermal. Solar systems range from 1.5 to 19.6 W e /m 2, with solar thermal and utility-scale PV requiring more land than residential PV and concentrated solar for the same electricity production. Solar energy systems have lower power density compared to natural gas, nuclear, oil, and coal, but higher than wind, hydro, biomass, and most geothermal sources. Solar technology for residential and utility-scale PV is similar, but factors like rooftop slope and panel spacing affect power densities. Location and technology-dependent parameters impact the variability of land use energy intensity in solar electricity generation. Land use and cover change, influenced by solar energy systems, vary in degree. Land use and cover change due to solar energy systems vary in degree. Factors such as co-location of activities and time-to-recovery play a role in determining the impact on land. Further research is needed to establish appropriate land-use metrics for comparisons. Agricultural land is increasingly used for utility-scale solar PV systems. The demand for large tracts of land for utility-scale solar PV systems is growing in the United States, with California leading in solar capacity. Private solar development companies are leasing land from farmers to site PV arrays, providing them with additional income. Private solar development companies are leasing land from farmers for utility-scale solar PV systems. Factors like terrain quality, weather, grid connections, and environmental impact influence lease negotiations. Farmers are concerned about the impact on their ability to farm, as contractors typically strip topsoil and mount PV modules on concrete footings. Solar farms can strip topsoil and mount PV modules on concrete footings, removing land from agricultural production during the lease period. Restoring the land after the lease ends can be expensive, potentially leading to permanent loss of agricultural land. Maximizing energy capacity on land may come at the expense of agricultural production, with highly compensated suitable land for solar generation. Marginally productive acreage with low yield potential and high environmental costs may be suitable for solar generation without significant threat to overall agricultural production. Solar energy development on agricultural land can be a significant threat to overall agricultural production. However, agrivoltaics, where solar modules are raised high enough to allow crops to grow around and beneath them, could be a solution. Research on the impact of solar development on agricultural yields is crucial for future investment in solar generation. Research on the impact of solar development on agricultural yields is crucial for future investment in solar generation. State and federal grants, like the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART), can help offset the additional costs of dual-use agrivoltaic systems. Regulations governing the use of agricultural lands for nonagricultural purposes vary by state/region, and local planning commissions may impose constraints and permit requirements that challenge the economic feasibility of solar development. Co-locating agricultural production with solar development could alleviate land use planning constraints on productive agricultural lands proposed for solar deployment."
