    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Article 60.6 (Section 20928) in the Public Contract Code authorizes alternative project delivery for surface storage projects, aiming to reduce costs, expedite project timelines, simplify controls, and achieve unique design features. Article 60.6 (Section 20928) in the Public Contract Code allows surface storage projects from the CALFED Bay-Delta Program to use alternative project delivery methods like Construction manager at-risk, Design-Build, and Design-build-operate. Contracts can be awarded based on best value or to the lowest responsible bidder. The procurement process for the project follows a specific progression. The procurement process for surface storage projects from the CALFED Bay-Delta Program involves preparing project documents with scope and estimated price, issuing a request for qualifications to prequalify entities, subcontractors, and suppliers for final selection. Performance specifications and plans must be prepared by a licensed design professional in California. The local agency outlines the scope, cost range, evaluation methodology, and selection procedure for the project or contract. Factors considered include technical expertise, safety records, and other non-price related factors. A standard template for statements of qualifications is required, consulting with industry stakeholders for input. The bidder must provide a list of shareholders, partners, or members involved in the project, evidence of past project experience and financial capacity, and necessary licenses and credentials for the project. The bidder must provide evidence of capacity for bonding and insurance, workers' compensation history, and a safety record certified under penalty of perjury. A contracting entity must commit to using a skilled and trained workforce for projects in apprenticeable occupations in the building and construction trades. This workforce must consist of skilled journeypersons or apprentices in approved apprenticeship programs. For work performed on or after January 1, 2017, at least 30 percent of skilled journeypersons on the contract must be apprenticeship program graduates approved by the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards or federal Secretary of Labor. For work performed on or after January 1, 2018, 40% of skilled journeypersons must be apprenticeship program graduates approved by the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards or federal Secretary of Labor. For work performed on or after January 1, 2019, 50% of skilled journeypersons must be apprenticeship program graduates approved by the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards or federal Secretary of Labor. For work performed on or after January 1, 2020, 60% of skilled journeypersons must be graduates of an approved apprenticeship program for the applicable occupation. Up to half of the graduation percentage requirements can be fulfilled by skilled journeypersons who started working in the occupation before an apprenticeship program was approved. (C) A \"skilled journeyperson\" is defined as a worker who has either graduated from an approved apprenticeship program or has equivalent on-the-job experience. The apprenticeship graduation percentage requirements can be met if a certain percentage of skilled journeypersons employed on a project meet the graduation requirement. The contractor or subcontractor must meet apprenticeship graduation requirements for skilled journeypersons working on the project, unless certain conditions are met. Subcontractors have additional criteria to exempt them from these requirements. The subcontract must not exceed 0.5% of the prime contract price. Contractors must commit to using a skilled and trained workforce, provide monthly compliance reports, and face payment withholding for non-compliance. The local agency will withhold payments if monthly reports show non-compliance with workforce requirements. Reports must be public records open to inspection. This does not apply if a project labor agreement is in place. The local agency must make the list of prequalified entities public and prepare a request for bids based on project details, cost estimates, evaluation methodology, and award criteria. The local agency must specify factors for bid evaluation, including cost and nonprice factors, assign weights to each factor, and may allow bid revisions and negotiations if using a best value selection method. For projects using low bid selection, awards go to the lowest responsible bidder. For best value selection, bids are evaluated based on specified criteria like price, technical expertise, and construction approach. The evaluation criteria for awarding a construction contract include proposed construction approach, compliance with performance specifications, milestone schedule adherence, quality requirements, risk allocation, safety record, warranty, and life-cycle costs. The local agency may hold discussions with responsive bidders and rank them based on value provided. The contract is awarded to the responsible bidder offering the best value to the public. Upon contract award, the local agency must publicly announce the recipient and basis of the award. The statement and contract file should satisfy external audits. The agency can specify subcontractors in proposals and must follow certain procedures for awarding construction subcontracts exceeding half a percent of the contract price. The local agency must provide public notice for subcontracted work, set qualification criteria, and award subcontracts based on best value or lowest bidder. Construction projects must adhere to Water Code regulations. SEC. 2. This act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
