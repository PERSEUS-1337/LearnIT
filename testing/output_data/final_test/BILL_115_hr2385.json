    "content": "The Act titled \"Tariff Inversion Jobs Act of 2017\" is about addressing tariff inversions, as per the Sense of Congress. The Sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of promoting economic production and jobs in the United States, discouraging incentives for companies to move production overseas, and addressing tariff inversions that may lead to companies relocating production outside the country. Specifically, a tariff inversion exists in the production of televisions in the United States. The final product, televisions assembled in Mexico and exported to the United States, enter duty free. Rectifying tariff inversions is within the prerogative of the United States. It should be the policy of the United States to eliminate tariff inversions that incentivize offshore production, including televisions. This policy would help keep jobs in the United States, ensure more citizens are employed, strengthen competitiveness, and build a stronger country. The United States International Trade Commission will report on tariff inversions that encourage companies to move production out of the country and provide recommendations to eliminate them. Additionally, there is a proposal to eliminate duties on panels and main boards for televisions. Elimination of duty on panels and main boards for televisions under Section 4, amending the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to include a new subheading for television receivers with a duty-free status. Amendment to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States includes redesignating subheadings and inserting new subheadings for panels in Chapter 90. Amendment to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States includes redesignating subheadings and inserting new subheadings for flat panel displays in Chapter 90, excluding certain types for use with television receivers. The amendments made by this section apply to articles entered on or after January 1, 2014, with retroactive application for certain liquidations and reliquidations of specific subheadings in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. Liquidation or reliquidation requests must be filed within 180 days of the enactment of the Act with sufficient information for Customs and Border Protection to locate or reconstruct the entry. Any amounts owed by the United States for the liquidation or reliquidation of an entry must be paid. The reliquidation of an entry must be paid within 90 days without interest. The term \"entry\" includes a withdrawal from warehouse for consumption."
