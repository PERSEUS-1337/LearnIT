    "content": "China's policy of intervention to limit the appreciation of its currency, the renminbi (RMB) against the dollar and other currencies has caused tension with trading partners, especially the United States. Analysts argue that China manipulates its currency for unfair trade advantages, leading to large U.S. trade deficits and job losses. President Obama has criticized China's undervalued currency, calling it a competitive disadvantage for U.S. firms and urging China to adopt a market-based system for their currency. Legislation addressing China's currency policy has been introduced in Congress since 2003, with bills passing in the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2011. Recent bills introduced in 2013 aim to address subsidies related to undervalued currencies. Congressional concerns have extended to other countries, with some proposing currency provisions in future trade agreements. China began reforming its currency policy in 2005. China began currency reform in 2005, leading to a 34% appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar by June 2013. Analysts debate whether the RMB is undervalued, with some calling for a market-based exchange rate. Congressional bills have addressed China's currency policy since 2003, with recent focus on subsidies related to undervalued currencies. While some debate the effects of an undervalued RMB on the United States, most agree that greater currency flexibility in China would help reduce global imbalances. China's government aims to make its currency policy more flexible, but fears rapid appreciation could lead to job losses in export sectors. Some economists question the benefits of RMB appreciation for the U.S. economy, as it could raise prices for Chinese products and impact American consumers and firms using Chinese components. An appreciating RMB could harm U.S. consumers and firms using Chinese components, potentially leading to higher interest rates. It may not necessarily shift manufacturing from China to the U.S., but rather to other low-cost Asian countries. While it could boost some U.S. exports to China, trade barriers may offset the benefits. Currency reform is seen as part of broader goals for U.S. trade policy. The report discusses the need for China to rebalance its economy towards consumer demand, reduce trade barriers, and protect intellectual property rights. It also examines the economic costs and benefits of China's currency policy for both China and the United States, as well as legislative proposals addressing the issue. China previously had a dual exchange rate system before 1994. China had a dual exchange rate system before 1994, with an official rate and a market-based rate in swap markets. The system was criticized for restricting foreign imports. In 1994, the Chinese government unified the two rates at 8.70 yuan to the dollar, eventually allowing it to rise to 8.28 by 1997. The RMB became largely convertible on a trade basis but not on a capital basis. China maintained a peg of 8.28 yuan to the U.S. dollar from 1994 to July 2005 to promote stability in foreign trade and investment. The central bank controlled the exchange rate by buying or selling dollar-denominated assets to balance demand for the yuan. This policy prevented significant fluctuations in the exchange rate despite changing economic conditions. The Chinese government modified its currency policy on July 21, 2005, allowing the RMB to appreciate based on market supply and demand. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB was adjusted from 8.28 yuan to 8.11, with a 2.1% appreciation. The RMB was permitted to fluctuate daily by up to 0.5% against a basket of currencies. From July 2005 to July 2008, the dollar-RMB exchange rate increased from 8.11 to 6.83, a total appreciation of 18.7% (or 20.8% including the initial 2.1% appreciation). China halted its currency appreciation policy in mid-July 2008 due to declining global demand for Chinese products caused by the global financial crisis. In 2009, Chinese exports fell by 15.9%, leading to the closure of export-oriented factories and job losses for over 20 million migrant workers. The government intervened to prevent further appreciation of the RMB to the dollar. China's central bank announced on June 19, 2010, that it would reform the RMB exchange rate regime to enhance flexibility, ruling out large one-time revaluations to prevent sharp fluctuations. This decision aimed to allow Chinese corporations to adjust more easily to currency appreciation. The timing of the announcement was seen as a strategy to avoid making China's currency policy a central focus at the G-20 summit in Toronto. The RMB's exchange rate with the dollar has fluctuated since the resumption of RMB appreciation. The RMB's exchange rate with the dollar has appreciated since RMB appreciation was resumed in June 2010. The yuan/dollar exchange rate went from 6.83 to 6.17, an appreciation of 10.7% by July 2013. Most of the appreciation occurred in 2010 and 2011, with a slight increase of 2.1% from 2012 to 2013. Economists suggest considering the real exchange rate to account for inflation differences between China and the United States. The RMB's exchange rate with the dollar has appreciated since June 2010, with a 10.7% increase by July 2013. Chinese inflation rates have been higher than the U.S., leading to a real appreciation of the RMB by 42% from June 2005 to June 2013. This is in contrast to a 34% nominal increase. The effective exchange rate, which considers inflation and trade with major partners, also shows the RMB's movement. China's real trade-weighted exchange rate appreciated by 8.2% from July 2008 to May 2010, and by 16.9% between June 2010 and May 2013. The RMB's exchange rate with the dollar has increased by 10.7% since June 2010. U.S. policymakers have accused China of currency manipulation. Labor representatives and critics accuse the Chinese government of manipulating its currency to keep it undervalued against the U.S. dollar, making Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. exports to China more expensive. They argue that this practice, which was acceptable in China's early economic stages, is no longer justified given the country's economic size and impact on the global economy. The undervalued currency is blamed for the growing U.S. trade deficit with China, which reached $315 billion in 2012 and is projected to hit $325 billion in 2013. China's currency manipulation is evidenced by its massive foreign exchange reserves and current account surpluses. China holds the world's largest reserves, growing from $212 billion in 2001 to $3.3 trillion in 2012. Analysts believe this reflects Chinese intervention to devalue the RMB, leading to large surpluses. Foreign exchange holdings grew significantly from 2004 to 2011, but slowed in 2012. China's foreign exchange reserves grew significantly from $363 billion in new reserves each year to $129 billion in 2012. The annual rate of increase in reserves dropped from 51.3% in 2004 to 4.1% in 2012. China's current account surplus peaked at $421 billion in 2008, then declined to $140 billion in 2011 before rising to $192 billion in 2012. The surplus as a percent of GDP dropped from 10.1% in 2007 to 1.9% in 2011, but increased to 2.3% in 2012. China's exports as a percent of GDP also declined from 38.3% in 2007 to 27.5% in 2012. The sharp drop in China's current account surpluses may be attributed to the global economic slowdown, which reduced global demand for Chinese products and foreign direct investment in China. The IMF warned that China's surpluses could return once stimulus measures wound down and the global economy recovered. However, the decline in the surplus led to rising internal imbalances according to the IMF in July 2012. The IMF assessed that external rebalancing led to rising internal imbalances due to high investment spending, which may be difficult to sustain. Concerns over China's currency policy impacting the U.S. economy, particularly employment, have intensified. Some argue that RMB appreciation could increase U.S. jobs, with a direct link between the U.S. trade deficit and job losses. A 2012 study by the Economic Policy Institute claims that the U.S. trade deficit with China, influenced by China's currency policy, resulted in the loss of 2.7 million jobs between 2001 and 2011. Claims about the negative effect of China's exchange rate on U.S. employment and trade are often juxtaposed with the observation that China's economy has grown rapidly. Some argue that China's exchange rate intervention represents a \"beggar thy neighbor\" policy. U.S. economist Paul Krugman in 2009 argued that the undervalued RMB could displace American workers. Some argue that China's undervalued currency has negatively impacted global economic recovery, with estimates suggesting a 1.4% decrease in global GDP. Various bills in Congress have aimed to address China's currency policy, such as imposing additional duties on imported Chinese products unless their currency appreciates. The House and Senate have proposed bills to address China's undervalued currency, potentially increasing duties on Chinese imports. There is debate over whether these measures would comply with WTO rules. Some recent currency bills aim to eliminate current provisions of U.S. trade laws regarding currency manipulation and propose new criteria for identifying countries with misaligned currencies, which could lead to trade remedy actions consistent with WTO rules. Critics argue that including currency undervaluation as a factor may be challenged by China and other WTO members as a violation of WTO rules. The U.S. government may take punitive actions against certain countries under currency legislation. Supporters hope it will prompt China to appreciate its currency, while opponents fear it could anger China and lead to retaliation against U.S. exports. H.R. 1276, introduced by Representative Sander Levin, aims to clarify U.S. countervailing duty laws related to foreign government export subsidies. The bill aims to clarify U.S. countervailing duty laws regarding foreign government export subsidies, including treating a fundamentally undervalued currency as an actionable subsidy. It directs the Commerce Department to use IMF data and methodologies to estimate real effective exchange rate undervaluation. The bill directs the Commerce Department to determine if a country's currency is fundamentally undervalued for U.S. countervailing duty laws based on factors like intervention in currency markets, real effective exchange rate undervaluation by at least 5%, and excessive foreign asset reserves. It defines the \"subsidy\" as the difference between a currency's real effective exchange rate and its equilibrium rate for imposing countervailing duties. The bill introduced by Senator Sherrod Brown aims to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies and take corrective action for certain countries. It requires the Commerce Department to use IMF methodologies or economic techniques to measure undervaluation. Additionally, the Treasury Department would issue semiannual reports to Congress on international monetary policy and currency exchange rates. The bill introduced by Senator Sherrod Brown requires the Treasury Department to issue semiannual reports to Congress on international monetary policy and currency exchange rates. This includes identifying fundamentally misaligned currencies, determining priority actions, and evaluating factors in currency markets. The bill introduced by Senator Sherrod Brown requires the Treasury Department to seek negotiations with countries designated for priority action based on factors like currency market interventions, foreign exchange reserves accumulation, and capital flow restrictions. If a country fails to address currency misalignment within 90 days, further actions may be taken. If a currency designated for priority action fails to address misalignment within 90 days, the Commerce Department would factor in currency undervaluation in antidumping duty investigations, potentially increasing duties. The President would prohibit federal procurement from the country unless it joins the GPA. OPIC would be prohibited from financing projects in the country. The provision would prohibit OPIC from providing any financial support to projects in a country if it fails to address currency misalignment within 360 days. The U.S. would also request special consultations with the IMF to address the issue, and the USTR would initiate a dispute settlement case in the WTO if necessary. The bill, S. 1114, aims to ensure the country's compliance with WTO obligations by requiring consultation with the Federal Reserve for currency intervention. It also prohibits increasing voting shares in international financial institutions for countries benefiting from it and amends countervailing duty law to investigate currency undervaluation as a subsidy. The bill, S. 1114, includes provisions to address currency manipulation and subsidies, with waiver provisions for priority countries and a process for Congress to disapprove waivers. It also amends U.S. antidumping law to consider currency manipulation when reviewing a country's designation as a market economy. S. 1114 directs Commerce to compare real exchange rates for misaligned currency in countervailing duty cases, using IMF or World Bank data. It also requires calculation of the benefit of misaligned currency in antidumping duty cases by comparing medium-term equilibrium exchange rates to official daily rates. S. 1114 would require the Department of Commerce to adjust export prices to reflect the misalignment of the exporting country's currency, as defined by significant and sustained undervaluation. President Obama highlighted China's undervalued currency as a competitive disadvantage for U.S. firms. President Obama urged China to adopt a market-based currency system, expressing frustration with the ongoing issue. The Administration welcomed congressional involvement on the matter as long as it aligns with U.S. WTO obligations and ongoing negotiations with China. Their stance on specific legislative proposals was not publicly disclosed. In October 2011, an Administration official expressed support for legislation addressing the undervaluation of China's currency to create a fairer playing field for American workers and companies. The Obama Administration has engaged China on the currency issue through various dialogues. Secretary Geithner emphasized the need for China to allow its exchange rate to appreciate. Discussions with Congress are ongoing to address concerns about consistency with international obligations regarding currency legislation. At the May 2012 S&ED talks, Geithner acknowledged China's progress towards a more flexible exchange rate system and liberalizing controls on currency and capital movements. China reiterated its commitment to a market-determined exchange rate at the July 2013 S&ED session. The Obama Administration has used multilateral channels to encourage international cooperation on exchange rate policies and pressure China to appreciate its currency. Secretary Geithner proposed at the G-20 meeting for countries to reduce external imbalances, refrain from manipulating exchange rates for competitive advantage, and for emerging markets to allow their currencies to adjust. Advanced economies should also work to prevent excessive volatility in exchange rates. The G-20 advanced economies aim to prevent excessive volatility in exchange rates and oppose the use of numerical targets. The G-7 reaffirmed their commitment to market-determined exchange rates and avoiding targeting exchange rates to meet domestic objectives. The section examines the effects of China's undervalued currency on the U.S. economy. U.S. policymakers question the RMB's exchange rate with the dollar if China allowed its currency to float freely. Studies have attempted to estimate the degree of the RMB's undervaluation against the dollar. The RMB was found to be undervalued against the dollar by rates of 12%, 25%, 40%, and 50% in studies from 2009. A 2006 Department of the Treasury report highlighted challenges in using economic models to predict exchange rates, noting the variability in conclusions and the importance of focusing on serious misalignments. The IMF uses various methodologies to assess currency misalignment, including the ERER, ES, and MB approaches. In 2011, the IMF stated that the renminbi was significantly undervalued, with estimates ranging from 3% to 23%. The IMF uses different methodologies to assess currency misalignment, with estimates ranging from 3% to 23%. However, assessments are subject to large margins of uncertainty due to various factors like macroeconomic links, measurement problems, and model fit. Emerging market economies may face more severe challenges in this regard. In July 2012, the IMF declared the renminbi to be moderately undervalued. The IMF assessed the renminbi to be moderately undervalued, with a range of 5%-10%. Studies on the RMB's market value against the dollar may not reflect fundamental economic changes. William R. Cline from the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates equilibrium exchange rates using the FEER method, taking into account current account imbalances. This method calculates how much the exchange rate needs to adjust to achieve a fundamental current account balance. To calculate misevaluation for a country using the FEER method, estimates of exchange rate equilibrium for each country must be made. Contention arises in determining the \"equilibrium\" current account balance. Cline sets current account targets for different countries, such as a 3% GDP surplus for China and deficit for the United States. The RMB's undervaluation estimates by Cline rely on actual and projected data. Cline's estimates of the RMB's undervaluation use actual and projected data from the IMF to calculate an equilibrium exchange rate. His study in May 2013 projected a 4.0% current account surplus for China in 2018 and estimated the RMB's needed appreciation against the dollar to reach a 3% GDP surplus goal. The amount of appreciation required for equilibrium has decreased from 40.7% in December 2009 to 6.0% in April 2013. Cline also made FEER estimates for multiple currencies, not just the RMB, including 33 countries and the euro area. The top 10 countries with the most undervalued currencies as of April 2013 are listed in Table 1 in ranking order, with Singapore, Taiwan, Sweden, Japan, and Switzerland leading the list. Determining a country's real market exchange rate is challenging due to continuously changing economic conditions and assumptions. Analysts question the usefulness of these equilibrium exchange rate estimates for U.S. policymakers in setting goals for currency appreciation or trade remedy legislation. Many policymakers believe that a significant appreciation of China's currency would lead to an increase in U.S. exports to China, a decrease in imports from China, and a reduction in the U.S. trade deficit. However, the effects of RMB appreciation on the U.S. economy are complex, as exchange rates are just one of many factors influencing trade flows. For example, the 21% RMB appreciation from 2005 to 2008 had mixed effects on U.S.-China trade. During the 2005-2008 period, despite the RMB's appreciation, U.S. imports from China increased by 39%, while U.S. exports to China grew slower at 71%. The U.S. trade deficit with China still rose by 30.1%, but the overall U.S. current account deficit declined by nearly 6%. China's trade surplus and foreign exchange reserves increased significantly during this time, showing little effect from the RMB's appreciation. An appreciated RMB could worsen the U.S. trade deficit in the short run if imports from China do not decline at the same rate as prices increase. It would take time for consumers to find lower-priced alternatives and reduce overall demand for Chinese imports. Additionally, there would be a lag in the effects of an appreciated RMB on prices of Chinese products. An appreciated RMB could worsen the U.S. trade deficit in the short run if imports from China do not decline at the same rate as prices increase. It would take time for consumers to find lower-priced alternatives and reduce overall demand for Chinese imports. Additionally, the effects of currency appreciation on trade flows may lead to a decrease in the bilateral trade imbalance over time. The distribution of price changes resulting from RMB appreciation could impact various stakeholders, with not all of the price increase being passed on to U.S. consumers. The price index for U.S. imports from China rose by 6.1% from 2003 to 2012, despite the RMB appreciating by 33.7% during the same period. This suggests that only a small portion of the price increase for Chinese products due to the currency appreciation was passed on to U.S. consumers. The issue of exchange rate effects is complex, especially considering China's role as a major assembly center for multinational corporations. The increase in U.S. imports from China is mainly due to production facilities moving from other Asian countries to China. Foreign-invested firms in China account for over half of China's trade flows. For example, Apple Inc.'s iPod is assembled in China with components from multinational corporations. The value added by Chinese workers in assembling the iPod in China is small compared to the total production cost. Analysts debate the impact of an appreciated RMB on Chinese exports and trade deficits. Foreign-invested firms may move production to other low-cost countries if costs increase in China. Overall trade deficit is linked to the gap between domestic saving and investment. China's high saving rate and trade surplus are influenced by an exchange rate peg and capital controls. A shift to a floating exchange rate may not significantly change the disparity in saving rates between the US and China. This could result in the US remaining a net debtor and China a net creditor, leading to potential trade imbalances with other countries. Some U.S. economists argue that China's undervalued currency negatively impacts the global economy. However, others believe that an appreciation of the RMB would not significantly benefit the U.S. economy. Derek Scissors from the Heritage Foundation states that an RMB appreciation would have minimal impact on U.S. employment, as China's industrial policies limit imports that compete with the state sector. The state sector in China remains unaffected by RMB appreciation, making state firms competitive as exporters. Imports from the U.S. face limitations due to state predominance, leaving American producers in a tough market battle. Michael Pettis argues that Chinese government policies keep real returns low to support state-owned firms. The government policies in China support state-owned firms, leading to over-investment and over-capacity, with excess capacity being exported. This results in a forced transfer of income from Chinese households to Chinese producers. Pettis warns that China's subsidization of production growth hinders domestic demand and reliance on exports. Despite record trade deficits with China, U.S. imports from China only account for a small percentage of GDP and personal consumption expenditures. The study found that goods and services originating in China accounted for only 2.7% of U.S. personal expenditures in 2010. For every dollar spent on a product labeled \"made in China,\" 55 cents go towards U.S. services. Importing intermediate inputs from China for goods labeled \"made in the USA\" would raise this to 1.9%. Some argue that U.S. imports from China do not displace U.S. workers and RMB appreciation would have little effect on the U.S. economy. Economists oppose policies that distort market forces and advocate for a more market-based currency. A shift to a market-based currency would benefit China, the United States, and the global economy by improving resource allocation. China's undervalued currency creates economic winners and losers, and adjusting this policy would create a new set of winners and losers. An appreciation of the RMB would impact the U.S. economy by making Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. exports to China more expensive, leading to a decrease in U.S. exports and production in the short run. This would increase the trade deficit and reduce aggregate demand temporarily. A market-based exchange rate could help boost U.S. exports and benefit firms competing with Chinese companies. An undervalued RMB benefits the U.S. by increasing consumption through improved terms-of-trade. It also makes U.S. firms more competitive internationally by lowering the price of imports from China. However, an appreciation of China's currency could lower economic welfare for U.S. consumers. An undervalued RMB benefits the U.S. by increasing consumption and making firms more competitive internationally. This leads to increased capital investment in plant and equipment, boosting aggregate spending in the short run and expanding the economy in the long run. The lower interest rates caused by capital inflow from China benefit private firms and household spending on consumer durables and housing. China holds a significant amount of U.S. Treasury securities, funding federal budget deficits. The U.S. federal budget deficit increased sharply in FY2008 and FY2009, leading to a rise in Treasury securities sales. The Obama Administration urged China to appreciate its currency while also encouraging them to buy U.S. securities. Analysts suggest that a stronger Chinese currency could reduce their need for U.S. securities, potentially raising U.S. interest rates. If China were to stop buying Treasury securities during a high U.S. deficit, it could impact private investors' confidence in fiscal policy. An undervalued RMB does not directly impact U.S. aggregate demand but causes a shift in U.S. composition. The U.S. trade deficit leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from Chinese capital flows, impacting employment and production unevenly across regions and sectors. The trade deficit does not have a medium- or long-run effect on aggregate U.S. employment or unemployment, as evidenced by historical trends. The U.S. trade deficit leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from Chinese capital flows, impacting employment and production unevenly across regions and sectors. While the compositional shift in output has no negative effect on aggregate U.S. output and employment in the long run, there may be adverse short-run consequences if U.S. output in the trade sector falls more quickly than the increases in output of U.S. recipients of Chinese capital. This could temporarily lead to a decline in U.S. spending and employment, especially if the economy is already sluggish. However, government macroeconomic policy adjustment and market forces can potentially compensate for any decline in the trade sector by expanding other elements of aggregate demand. The U.S. trade deficit with China has not hindered high rates of growth in the past. A study suggested that a 25% appreciation of the RMB would decrease U.S. imports from China, increase domestic production, and boost exports to China. However, this would also lower Chinese economic growth, leading to reduced demand for imports, including from the U.S. The RMB appreciation would raise U.S. costs for Chinese imports, decrease real wealth and wages, and raise short-term interest rates, resulting in a negative impact on U.S. aggregate demand and output. The IMF analysis suggests that a 20% RMB appreciation alone would have limited benefits for the global economy, including the U.S., unless accompanied by Chinese consumption and service sector expansion. It estimated that a 20% RMB appreciation could boost U.S. economic growth by 0.05% to 0.07%, while combining it with other reforms could increase growth by over 0.15%. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is not meant to favor exports over imports. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is aimed at fostering economic stability through currency stability, providing jobs to Chinese workers, and attracting FDI for technology access. They view currency reform as a long-term goal and condemn international pressure to appreciate the yuan, citing interference with China's domestic economic policies and development. Despite Chinese officials' pledges on currency reform, they have been cautious in implementing changes, prioritizing economic growth for political stability. They argue that promoting rapid domestic growth is crucial for global economic recovery, pointing to increased imports as a contribution. They reject the need for a sharp appreciation of the RMB and believe that their currency policy supports economic stability and job creation. China's export growth in 2012 and the first half of 2013 was below historic rates, with a decreasing merchandise trade surplus from 2009 to 2011. The yuan was claimed to be nearing equilibrium against the dollar in June 2013. An undervalued RMB makes Chinese exports to the US cheaper, boosting export industries. However, overdependence on exports and fixed investments, along with FDI inflows, made China vulnerable to the global economic slowdown. Inflows made China vulnerable to global economic slowdown. IMF analysis showed fixed investment and net exports accounted for over 60% of China's GDP growth from 2001 to 2008. Undervalued currency benefits Chinese exporting firms but hinders non-exporting firms and resource allocation. China's undervalued currency acts as an export subsidy, benefiting American consumers but raising prices for Chinese citizens. China's trade surplus forces it to invest in low-return U.S. debt securities due to its currency peg to the dollar, limiting its ability to control inflation through monetary policy. The Chinese government struggles to control inflation due to difficulties in blocking inflows of \"hot money\" seeking higher interest rates. This leads to easy credit policies, overcapacity in sectors like steel, and speculative asset bubbles in real estate. Administrative controls have been ineffective in limiting bank loans to sectors with overcapacity, as the pegged currency hinders efficient financial policies. The Chinese government's use of inefficient financial policies for credit allocation hinders the economy. Transitioning to a market-based system could lead to long-term benefits such as boosting trade terms, increasing economic efficiency, lowering prices for consumers, and improving competitiveness of domestic firms. The Chinese government aims to improve domestic firms' efficiency and competitiveness by lowering prices for imported inputs, expanding monetary policies to control inflation, addressing economic disparities between regions, and reducing tension with trading partners over currency valuation and subsidies. The Chinese government aims to promote economic development through reforms that may impact other countries. Chinese leaders face the challenge of generating new sources of growth to offset sectors affected by policy changes. Analysts suggest that political and economic reforms will be necessary for successful rebalancing, which could take several years to achieve. China's economy has consistently grown at near 10% annually, making adjustments easier. Allowing the RMB to float would boost U.S. exports and potentially reduce the bilateral trade deficit. This shift would also lead to higher interest rates in the United States as Chinese central bank stops purchasing U.S. assets. The fear of a sudden decline in Chinese demand for U.S. assets could lead to a rise in interest rates in the United States, reducing spending on interest-sensitive purchases and potentially destabilizing the U.S. economy. If the relative demand for Chinese goods and assets were to fall, the floating exchange rate would depreciate, reversing the effects. The Chinese government maintains capital controls to prevent a large private capital outflow, fearing a banking crisis if controls were removed. This could lead to a depreciating floating exchange rate, reducing U.S. exports and increasing the trade deficit. China could potentially float its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls to prevent a private capital outflow. This would shift the U.S. assets ownership from the Chinese central bank to private citizens. Another option is for China to maintain the current exchange rate, allowing the real rate to adjust over time as inflation rates diverge. The Chinese central bank currently acquires foreign reserves by printing yuan to finance its trade surplus. The Chinese central bank's exchange of newly printed yuan for U.S. assets would lead to rising prices in China and a decrease in the U.S. bilateral trade deficit. However, this real exchange rate adjustment would take time, and pressures on the U.S. trade sector would persist. The high saving rate in China and low saving rate in the United States contribute to their trade imbalances, which may continue as long as macroeconomic imbalances persist. China's currency policy has been a concern for Congress since 2003. The RMB has appreciated significantly against the dollar, but the trade deficit with the United States has not decreased. Despite the RMB's appreciation, China's exports to the US continue to grow due to low-cost labor and productivity gains. The IMF evaluated the RMB to be substantially undervalued in 2011, but China's current account surplus has declined in recent years. In recent years, China's currency policy has somewhat diminished in importance as a trade issue for some in Congress. China, along with Japan, has been accused of manipulating its currency. Additionally, Chinese economic policies such as cyber-enabled theft and infringement of U.S. intellectual property have posed significant threats to U.S. economic interests. The World Bank, IMF, and other global economic institutions have warned China about the losses incurred by U.S. intellectual property-intensive firms due to Chinese infringement of U.S. intellectual property rights. They have also highlighted China's use of industrial policies to subsidize domestic firms and impose trade barriers. The global economic slowdown has reduced demand for Chinese products, prompting calls for China to shift towards private consumption-led growth and eliminate policies hindering market efficiency. Chinese officials have acknowledged the need for economic reforms, including a market-determined exchange rate system and policies to boost private consumption. These reforms could lead to improved U.S.-China commercial relations. The Chinese government's acknowledgment of the need for economic reforms, including a market-determined exchange rate system, could significantly improve U.S.-China commercial relations. The issue of rebalancing economic growth has been a central focus of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue talks over the past two years. The United States and China have strengthened their economic cooperation through stimulus measures, leading to a positive global economic outlook. Both countries are committed to promoting sustainable and balanced growth. To address challenges and ensure a durable global recovery with steady job growth, they pledge to enhance macroeconomic cooperation. The global financial crisis has brought attention to \"global imbalances\" in savings and investment levels among countries, resulting in current account imbalances. Account imbalances arise when domestic savings exceed investment, leading to trade surpluses, or when domestic investment exceeds saving, resulting in current account deficits. Countries like China, the United States, Japan, Germany, and other East Asian nations exhibit these imbalances. The US and China, being the world's largest economies, face scrutiny due to the size of their imbalances. Some analysts argue that China's exchange rate policy hinders adjustment in other East Asian countries. These imbalances are believed to have been a significant factor in global economic issues. Many economists attribute global economic slowdown to imbalances in countries like China and the United States. High savers like China lent money to low savers, keeping U.S. interest rates low and contributing to the housing market bubble. Economic restructuring is needed in major economies to address these issues, but it may deepen the global output gap in the short run. The section discusses how high saving countries like China and the United States contribute to global imbalances by borrowing capital abroad to meet investment needs. It also examines the potential impact on worldwide demand and unemployment if high saving countries do not increase consumption. In 2012, the U.S. had a current account deficit of $475 billion, while China had a surplus of $192 billion. The U.S. had a savings to investment ratio of 77.3%, the lowest among major economies, while China's ratio was 105.7%. The U.S. deficit has decreased due to lower investment spending and higher savings, along with a reduction in the federal budget deficit. The U.S. federal budget deficit as a percent of GDP decreased from 10.1% in FY2009 to 7.0% in FY2012, projected to decline to 4.0% in FY2013. The IMF projects China's current account balance to increase to 4.3% in 2018, while the U.S. current account deficit is projected to grow to 3.5% in 2018. Despite some rebalancing, economists question the long-term sustainability of both countries' positions. China's current account surplus declined due to a faster drop in exports than imports during the global economic downturn. This trend may reverse as global growth recovers. The United States has one of the lowest gross saving rates among developed countries, leading to a growing net foreign debt. China has one of the world's highest national saving rates, with gross savings levels declining slightly from 1990 to 2012. In comparison, the U.S. has a lower gross saving rate, with an increase in 2012. China also has the highest gross investment as a percent of GDP among major economies, with a rise in investment levels by 2012. Additionally, China's private consumption as a percent of GDP is the lowest among major economies, decreasing from 1990 to 2009. Chinese private consumption as a percent of GDP was 35.7% in 2012, growing at an average annual rate of 8.4% from 2001 to 2012. Despite rising labor productivity, workers' wages in China have not kept pace with productivity gains, especially for migrant workers in labor-intensive industries. Chinese households face limited investment options due to tight controls on capital outflows by the government. Most choose to deposit savings in Chinese banks, but low interest rates set by the central government often result in negative real interest rates, causing savings deposits to lose value. This policy benefits Chinese firms by keeping credit costs low but negatively impacts households, forcing them to save more for expenses like healthcare and retirement. Chinese controls on bank interest rates have limited household spending, with personal disposable income as a percent of GDP declining from 56.5% in 2002 to 51.6% in 2012. Economists argue that rebalancing the economy towards personal consumption requires eliminating policies favoring firms over households, such as government control of the banking system. The Chinese government's control over the banking system has impacted the country's GDP growth. From 2006-2012, gross fixed investment was a major contributor to GDP growth, driven by a stimulus package and monetary easing policy. Changes in net exports had varying effects on the economy, with private consumption becoming the largest contributor to GDP growth in 2012. The quality of China's massive investment efforts has been questioned by economists, making the next few years critical for economic policymakers. The quality of China's massive investment efforts has been questioned by economists, impacting the ability of local governments to repay loans. The Chinese government aims to rebalance the economy, boost consumer demand, rural incomes, wages, services sector, and social welfare programs. These policies could boost consumer spending, but it may take several years for significant economic rebalancing to occur. Many economists are concerned that as China's major trading partners experience rapid economic growth, their demand for Chinese products will increase, potentially hindering the government's economic reforms needed for rebalancing the economy."
