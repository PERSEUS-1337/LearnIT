    "content": "In the mid-1990s, the Army introduced the M-4 carbine, a lighter version of the M-16 rifle. Both are 5.56 mm caliber weapons made by Colt Defense LLC. The Army considered replacing the M-16 with the XM-8 assault rifle under the OICW program, but conflicts led to the cancellation of the XM-8 in 2005. The Army continues to procure M-16s and M-4s. The Army canceled the XM-8 in October 2005 and plans to continue procuring M-16s and M-4s. Some in Congress are calling for an open competition to choose a successor to the M-16 and M-4 assault rifles. The M4 Carbine Improvement Program is evaluating potential upgrades such as a heavier barrel, piston gas system, improved trigger pull, strengthened rail system, ambidextrous controls, and a round-counter. The option of a heavier barrel is being considered to address concerns about barrel warping and erosion during high rates of fire. The Army is evaluating potential improvements for the M4 rifle, including a piston gas system for stability but with increased heat and carbon deposits. Strengthening the rail system with new materials could enhance stability without adding weight. A round counter is being considered for better weapon maintenance. An integrated team is assessing these options for a successor to the M4 in an open competition. The Army is planning an open competition for a successor to the M4 rifle, with submissions from the small arms industry expected by fall. The competition aims to evaluate a range of weapons, with results not expected before FY2013. Concerns have been raised by soldiers regarding the reliability and lethality of the M-4. The M-4 rifle's performance has been a topic of debate, with concerns raised about its stopping power. A study by USSOCOM in 2001 found flaws in the M-4A1 design, leading to failures in harsh conditions. While the M-4 met Army specifications, it did not meet SOF requirements due to identified shortfalls. The M-4 rifle's performance was favorably assessed by the Army during Iraqi Freedom, with soldiers preferring it over the M-16. However, the assessment lacked analytical data, raising questions about its validity. In 2006, a survey by the Center for Naval Analyses recommended replacing the M-16 with the M-4 based on feedback from soldiers who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army's Project Manager-Soldier Weapons evaluated the performance of M-4 rifles used by soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The study found that over 50% of soldiers using the M-4 reported no stoppages during combat or training. Different lubrication practices had little effect on stoppages, with dry lubricant decreasing reports for M-4 users. 89% of M-4 users were satisfied with their weapon, while 20% recommended a larger bullet for increased lethality. Soldiers and experts noted limitations in the M-16 and M-4 rifles. Many soldiers and experts commented on the limited ability of M-16s and M-4s to effectively stop targets, with some suggesting a larger bullet for increased lethality. The debate over the \"bigger bullet\" has been ongoing since the adoption of the 5.56 mm M-16. USSOCOM's 2001 study documented reliability problems with the M-4, citing its shortened barrel and gas tube design as flawed. The M-4 carbine was criticized for its flawed gas tube design, leading to failures in extracting spent cartridges during firing. Delta Force collaborated with Heckler & Koch to replace the gas system with a piston operating system, resulting in the adoption of the HK-416 in 2004. USSOCOM's interest in replacing the M-4 may also stem from its inability to make modifications due to military standards and technical data package constraints. In early 2003, USSOCOM officials began looking for new combat rifle capabilities and evaluated 12 weapons from nine manufacturers. In November 2004, FNH USA was awarded a contract to develop the SCAR, which includes a heavy 7.62 mm SCAR-H and a light 5.56 mm SCAR-L with interchangeable barrels. The SCAR-L is intended to replace the M4-A1 carbines used by USSOCOM. In April 2009, the first 600 SCARs were fielded to units of the 75th Ranger Regiment. The 600 SCARs issued to USSOCOM were fielded to units of the 75th Ranger Regiment for deployment into combat. Senator Tom Coburn questioned the Army's plan to spend $375 million on M-4 carbines without considering newer and possibly better weapons available on the market, citing reliability and lethality concerns. This led to a call for a competition to evaluate alternatives to the M-4. The Army conducted tests in December 2007 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, comparing the M-4 against the HK-416, HK-XM8, and FNH SCAR under sandstorm conditions. Each weapon fired 6,000 rounds, resulting in stoppages: XM-8 (127), FNH SCAR (226), HK-416 (233), and M-4 (882). The Army later claimed the M-4 had 296 stoppages, attributing the discrepancy to post-test evaluation processes. During the RAM Scoring Conference, failures were attributed to factors like operator error or part failure. Colt Defense, LLC raised concerns about discrepancies in testing, including using M-4 carbines that did not meet military specifications and were three-round burst weapons, unlike fully automatic weapons tested from other manufacturers. It was also alleged that testers were unfamiliar with operating the three-round burst M-4s. Allegations were made that testers were unfamiliar with operating three-round burst M-4s, leading to mistaken reports of stoppages during testing. This raised concerns about the consistency and validity of the December 2007 test results. The Secretary of the Army provided findings from the Small Arms Capabilities-Based Assessment to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees in January 2009. The assessment aimed to establish a small arms acquisition strategy through 2015. The study team identified 25 capability gaps related to engaging threat personnel, acquiring targets, determining range, breaching entry points, and avoiding weapon detection. Recommendations included improving training, updating doctrine, and using additional SA ancillary devices for greater lethality and knockdown power. The study recommended updating doctrine, using additional SA ancillary devices, developing a Small Arms Weapons Expert Program, and adding a weapons repairman at company level. Material solutions included developing special airburst munitions, improving combat optics, and creating new SA weapons with easier maintenance requirements. The study identified 42 Ideas for Material Solutions to address capability gaps. The study identified 42 Ideas for Material Solutions (IMAs) to address capability gaps, including new munitions, aiming devices, and weapon improvements. Secretary Geren's letter mentioned updating small arms requirements through open competition after completing the CBA, which incorporates analytical data from combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The CBA, derived from combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, does not explicitly call for a new combat rifle or carbine. Many proposed material solutions could be adapted to current rifles and carbines with little modification. A new design may only be necessary if new munitions, optics, and reliability improvements are incompatible with current small arms. Deficiencies cited in the CBA do not directly fault the current rifles or carbines. The SA CBA deficiencies do not fault the current combat rifle or carbine directly but call for ammunition, sight, and optic improvements. The Army plans to conduct a carbine competition in 2009 and consider other caliber weapons besides the current 5.56mm. Factors for evaluation include prototype weapons testing. The Army is evaluating new weapons beyond the current 5.56mm, focusing on accuracy, durability, and modularity. A DOD review is underway to address small arms requirements and potential challenges to the Army's decision. Concerns have been raised about the reliability and lethality of the M-4 carbine, questioning the consistency of testing and accuracy of performance results. The Army is considering replacing the M-4 carbine and is basing its decision on the Small Arms CBA. The DOD is conducting a review that may support the replacement competition or suggest an alternative. Congress may benefit from examining the results of the DOD's review for the Army's small arms modernization efforts. The Army is considering replacing the M-4 carbine based on the Small Arms CBA. USSOCOM's adoption of the FNH SCAR may impact the Army's small arms modernization efforts. The SCAR is a modular system replacing various weapons, offering adaptability for different missions and calibers, and accommodating modifications like grenade launchers and optics. The Army is considering replacing the M-4 carbine with a modular system like the FNH SCAR, which offers adaptability for different missions and calibers. Modifications such as grenade launchers and special optics are factors worth considering for future small arms programs. The Rangers' combat deployment with the SCAR may influence future Army small arms development and acquisition efforts."
