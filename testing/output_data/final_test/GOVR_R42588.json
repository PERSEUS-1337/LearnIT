    "content": "This report provides a status update on FY2013 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED). The bill provides discretionary and mandatory appropriations to federal departments and related agencies, with discretionary funds representing less than one-quarter of the total funds. The L-HHS-ED bill is typically the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic non-defense federal programs. The report focuses on discretionary appropriations in the L-HHS-ED bill, which is controversial due to its funding size and program scope. It addresses policy issues like restrictions on federal funds for abortion and research on human embryos and stem cells. Contact the Congressional Research Service for more information on specific agencies and programs funded in the bill. The report focuses on discretionary appropriations in the L-HHS-ED bill for FY2013. It includes sections on funding status, congressional actions, President's Budget request, and comparison of FY2013 funding levels with FY2012. The report focuses on discretionary appropriations in the L-HHS-ED bill for FY2013, including a comparison of funding levels with FY2012. It summarizes budget enforcement activities for FY2013, such as the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the FY2013 sequestration order. The report also provides an overview of House and Senate work on budget resolutions and allocations. The report focuses on discretionary appropriations in the L-HHS-ED bill for FY2013, including a comparison of funding levels with FY2012. It concludes with overview sections for each major component of the bill, providing selected highlights of FY2013 appropriations actions based on the Senate committee bill from the 112th Congress and the President's request. Note that detailed funding levels for individual programs can be found in the committee report accompanying S. 3295. The report is focused strictly on appropriations to agencies and accounts under the jurisdiction of the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittees of the House. The Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees oversee funding for various federal departments and agencies, excluding those under other subcommittees. The L-HHS-ED bill covers appropriations for the Department of Labor, most of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and related agencies like the Social Security Administration. The L-HHS-ED bill covers appropriations for the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and related agencies, including the Social Security Administration, Corporation for National and Community Service, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Institute of Museum and Library Services, National Labor Relations Board, and Railroad Retirement Board. Funding totals in the report do not include amounts provided outside the regular appropriations process. Certain direct spending programs like Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and parts of Medicare receive funding directly from their authorizing statute and are not subject to the regular appropriations process. Mandatory spending subject to annual appropriations is known as appropriated entitlements, with little control by appropriators over funding amounts. Entitlements like Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance receive direct spending budget authority and are not part of the annual appropriations process. The funding amounts in this report do not include direct spending budget authority provided outside the regular appropriations process. Mandatory amounts for the FY2013 President's request reflect current law estimates and do not include proposed changes to a program's authorizing statute. The report focuses on discretionary funding as it receives the most attention during the appropriations process. Budget authority is the amount of money Congress allows a federal agency to commit or spend, with appropriations bills including budget authority for the current fiscal year, future fiscal years, or a combination. Advance appropriations refer to amounts available in future fiscal years. The report focuses on total budget authority provided in appropriations bills, regardless of the year in which the funding becomes available. The report details current year appropriations and 302(b) allocation ceilings for appropriations subcommittees. Additional scorekeeping adjustments by the Congressional Budget Office are not reflected in the appropriations levels shown. Congress used a continuing resolution for FY2013 funding instead of enacting a regular L-HHS-ED appropriations bill. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) funded 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills, including L-HHS-ED, via a full-year CR in Division F. The full-year CR generally funded discretionary L-HHS-ED programs at their FY2012 levels, with a 0.2% across-the-board rescission. This funding level was lower than the previous six-month CR for FY2013, which generally funded programs at FY2012 rates plus 0.612%. The FY2013 sequester ordered by President Obama on March 1, 2013 further reduced CR funding. OMB calculated sequester amounts based on annualized funding levels under the six-month FY2013 CR. The impact of these reductions at the account, program, project, and activity level is unclear pending guidance from OMB. The full-year CR funds L-HHS-ED programs at FY2012 levels with some exceptions. The full-year CR provides funding increases for select L-HHS-ED programs compared to FY2012 levels. It also allows the Secretary of Labor to transfer unobligated funds to the Office of Job Corps and clarifies allocation rules for ED's IDEA Part B program. Additionally, $3 million is reserved for Project in ED's Safe Schools and Citizenship Education account. The final CR rescinds funding for various HHS programs, extends funding for TANF and Child Care Entitlement, and provides education-related services for schools affected by violence or trauma. The final CR, P.L. 113-6, contained anomalies for L-HHS-ED programs. H.R. 933 was approved by the House on March 6, 2013, and signed into law on March 26. The bill funded most programs at FY2012 levels with some exceptions. A six-month CR, P.L. 112-175, maintained funding at FY2012 rates plus 0.612% until March 27. The final CR, P.L. 113-6, funded discretionary programs at FY2012 rates plus 0.612% until March 27, 2013. It was superseded by the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2), which provided $50.7 billion in supplemental funding for Hurricane Sandy relief. $827 million was allocated to programs within L-HHS-ED, including $800 million to the HHS Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. The HHS secretary had discretion over $195 million for oversight and accountability activities, including transferring funds for repair and rebuilding of research facilities. $25 million went to DOL for job training, $2 million to SSA for Hurricane Sandy expenses. Congress initiated FY2013 L-HHS-ED appropriations actions during the 112th Congress. The House Appropriations L-HHS-ED Subcommittee approved a draft bill for full-year FY2013 L-HHS-ED appropriations, totaling around $150 billion for discretionary programs and activities. The bill was not further reviewed by the full committee before the end of the 112th Congress. The House Appropriations L-HHS-ED Subcommittee approved a draft bill for full-year FY2013 L-HHS-ED appropriations totaling around $150 billion for discretionary programs. The bill included provisions to increase funding for some programs like Head Start but decrease aggregate discretionary funding for DOL, HHS, and ED compared to FY2012. It also included measures to rescind funding, prohibit certain activities, and eliminate programs or agencies. The amount matches the budget cap set by the House Appropriations Committee and includes current year budget authority only. The bill proposed rescinding funding for certain aspects of the health reform law, terminating the HHS Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, halting the reorganization of various HHS agencies, terminating funding for ED's Race to the Top program, and eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a bill for full-year FY2013 L-HHS-ED appropriations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a bill for full-year FY2013 L-HHS-ED appropriations, which included $166 billion in discretionary funding, about 1% more than FY2012 levels. The bill also proposed $612 billion in mandatory funding, totaling nearly $778 billion for L-HHS-ED. This amount is roughly 5% more than FY2012 funding levels. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided funding for the L-HHS-ED bill, totaling roughly $778 billion, which was a 5% increase from FY2012 levels. This included both discretionary and mandatory funding, with the bill signed into law by President Obama on December 23, 2011. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 3672, P.L. 112-77) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided a total of roughly $741 billion in funding for L-HHS-ED accounts, including discretionary and mandatory funding. This amount included $164 billion in discretionary funding and $577 billion in mandatory funding. The FY2012 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill provided a significant amount of funding, with HHS receiving over three-quarters of the total appropriations. This trend continued in the FY2013 proposals as well. The FY2012 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill allocated a substantial amount of funding, with HHS receiving the majority of it. The Department of Education and Related Agencies also received significant shares of the funding, with the Department of Labor receiving the smallest share. The funding composition differs when looking at discretionary appropriations. The overall composition of L-HHS-ED funding in FY2012 and FY2013 proposals shows a split between HHS and ED, with a smaller portion going to the Department of Labor and Related Agencies. Congress considered FY2013 appropriations in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which allows for adjustments to discretionary spending caps. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan. Failure to enact legislation by January 15, 2012, triggered automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 delayed the implementation of sequestration and reduced the dollar amount of the joint committee sequester. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan. Failure to enact legislation by January 15, 2012, triggered automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 delayed the implementation of sequestration and reduced the dollar amount of the joint committee sequester by $24 billion. President Obama ordered the sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, with across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The sequester was ordered before full-year appropriations for FY2013, with OMB estimating a 5.0% reduction in non-exempt nondefense discretionary funding, a 2.0% reduction in certain Medicare funding, and a 5.1% reduction for most other non-exempt nondefense mandatory funding based on annualized funding levels under the six-month FY2013 CR. The FY2013 appropriations law requires federal agencies to submit operating plans reflecting sequestration effects and 0.2% rescission. Some programs are exempt from sequestration in the L-HHS-ED bill, such as Medicaid. Several programs in the L-HHS-ED bill are exempt from sequestration, including Medicaid, payments to health care trust funds, Supplemental Security Income, and certain family support payments. The bill also contains programs subject to special rules under sequestration, such as unemployment compensation and certain student loans. The Senate Committee on Appropriations adopted revised FY2013 funding caps for each appropriations subcommittee, including L-HHS-ED. The 302(a) allocations were established in the Senate via a \"deeming resolution\" filed by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad. The House agreed to make the House-passed budget resolution for FY2013 enforceable, pending adoption by both chambers. The House Committee on Appropriations reported out FY2013 spending based on these 302(a) allocations. The House Committee on Appropriations has reported FY2013 spending caps based on 302(a) allocations. The House's allocations are lower than the Senate's, which could pose challenges in reconciling legislation. See Table 3 for an overview of the allocations for L-HHS-ED in FY2013. Budget enforcement caps are applied to budget authority available in the current fiscal year. The House Committee on Appropriations has reported FY2013 spending caps based on 302(a) allocations, which are lower than the Senate's allocations. The figures in this section are based on regular L-HHS-ED appropriations only and are rounded to the nearest million or billion. The Department of Labor (DOL) comprises multiple entities focused on employment, training, worker protection, income security, and contract enforcement. Annual appropriations laws direct funding to all DOL entities, primarily in workforce development and worker protection. The Department of Labor (DOL) administers workforce employment and training programs, including the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) state grant programs, Job Corps, and the Employment Service. They also oversee worker protection services through agencies like OSHA, MSHA, and the Wage and Hour Division to ensure worker safety and adherence to labor laws. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on labor market issues. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed $14.68 billion in funding for the Department of Labor, with $12.34 billion being discretionary. This amount is slightly less than the FY2012 funding level. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed $14.68 billion in funding for the Department of Labor, $358 million more than the FY2013 President's Budget. It continued a provision limiting governors' reserve of WIA state formula grants to 5%, with an option to reserve up to 10% with conditions. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed to reserve up to 10% of WIA state formula grants for on-the-job training and incumbent worker support. It maintained funding levels for state formula grant programs and the Workforce Innovation Fund, with added language for Pay for Success pilot programs. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed eliminating funding for two programs and reallocating funds for research and evaluation activities. It also included $75 million for in-person re-employment assessments and improper payment reviews within the State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations account. The FY2013 Senate committee bill allocated $237.7 million for the WHD, a $10 million increase from FY2012, to combat employee misclassification and oversee minimum wage provisions. Additionally, $619 million was designated for BLS, a $10 million boost from FY2012, with a focus on the Secretary of Labor's directives. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed an increase in funding for various labor-related programs, including $262.8 million for VETS, a decrease from FY2012 but an increase from the President's FY2013 budget request. The bill also supported the National Longitudinal Surveys program and allocated more funding for the Transition Assistance Program within VETS. The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) funding increased from nearly $9 million in FY2012 to $14 million in FY2013 to support military members transitioning to civilian sector employment. The proposed increase in funding reflects the expected rise in transitioning service members. All figures are based on regular L-HHS-ED appropriations only, excluding funds for HHS agencies from other appropriations bills or outside the annual appropriations process. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a federal department with multiple agencies focused on improving Americans' health. The L-HHS-ED appropriations laws fund most HHS agencies, including five Public Health Service agencies: HRSA, CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, and AHRQ. These agencies support various health-related missions such as healthcare services, medical research, and disease prevention. Additionally, the L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for components of CMS, responsible for Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and consumer protections. The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for HHS agencies like ACF and ACL, focused on social services for vulnerable populations. ACL, a new agency, aims to increase community supports for older Americans and people with disabilities. Additionally, funding is allocated for the HHS Office of the Secretary for management, research, and oversight. The FY2013 L-HHS-ED bill proposed $621.6 billion in funding for HHS, including $71.0 billion in discretionary funding, representing a 5.5% increase from FY2012 levels. In FY2013, the HHS appropriations totaled $621.6 billion, with $71.0 billion in discretionary funding, a 5.5% increase from FY2012. CMS receives the majority of mandatory funding for Medicaid benefits, accounting for 87% of all HHS appropriations. PHS agencies follow with 8% of total HHS appropriations in FY2012. When considering discretionary funding, CMS constitutes 6-8% of total appropriations, while PHS agencies receive 64-66% of discretionary HHS funding. In FY2013, HHS appropriations totaled $621.6 billion, with $71.0 billion in discretionary funding, a 5.5% increase from FY2012. NIH receives the largest share of discretionary funding among HHS agencies, while ACF accounts for the second-largest share. The section discusses special funding mechanisms in the public health budget and highlights FY2013 discretionary funding across HHS. The FY2013 discretionary funding across HHS includes provisions from annual appropriations laws that restrict spending in controversial areas like abortion and stem cell research. Some HHS programs receive funding from the PHS Evaluation Tap, allowing for additional funding beyond regular appropriations for program evaluation purposes. Congress specifies the maximum percentage for the set-aside in the annual L-HHS-ED act. The FY2013 President's Budget proposed increasing the set-aside level for the PHS Evaluation Tap to 3.2%, making nearly $1.4 billion available for reallocation. However, the Senate Appropriations Committee in S. 3295 (112th Congress) rejected the increase and maintained the tap at 2.5% due to concerns about its impact on PHS Act agencies, particularly NIH. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established by the ACA to support public health programs. Initially pre-appropriated $1.25 billion for FY2013, later decreased to $1.0 billion by Congress. The PPHF funds can be transferred to agencies as specified in the appropriations bill. The President's Budget suggested allocations for the PPHF money, which was approved and adjusted by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The PPHF money supplements funding for selected programs. The PPHF funds, initially set at $1.25 billion for FY2013 but later reduced to $1.0 billion by Congress, can supplement funding for selected programs. Examples in S. 3295 (112 th Congress) include funding for CDC's Community Transformation Grants, CDC infectious disease programs, SAMHSA programs, and ACL and CDC programs on Elderly Falls Prevention. The FY2013 Senate committee bill compared funding levels to FY2012 and the FY2013 President's Budget for public health agencies and programs administered by CMS, ACF, and ACL. The Senate committee bill discussed FY2013 funding amounts for public health agencies, including new budget authority, evaluation tap funds, and Prevention and Public Health Fund allocations. The committee did not generally approve of replacing regular appropriations with other funding streams. The bill would have provided small increases for HRSA, CDC, and NIH, and a small decrease for SAMHSA in terms of new budget authority. The Senate committee bill for FY2013 proposed small increases for HRSA, CDC, and NIH, and a small decrease for SAMHSA in new budget authority. The bill also included emphasis on disease prevention, health promotion, medical research, and innovation, with $30.7 billion allocated for NIH, including a boost for the Cures Acceleration Network. Funding levels for some HRSA programs were maintained despite proposed cuts by the Administration. The Administration proposed decreasing or eliminating certain programs, but the Senate committee bill for FY2013 maintained funding for key programs such as Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education, Community Health Centers, and Area Health Education Centers. There were also increases for HRSA programs, including Ryan White AIDS programs and Rural Health programs. The committee did not approve funding for new State programs as requested by the Administration. The FY2013 Senate committee bill did not approve funding for new State Prevention Grant programs in mental health and substance abuse. It would have provided $610 million for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control activities and $4.37 billion for CMS Program Management, with the majority directed towards program operations. These funds were intended for program safeguard expenditures, ACA implementation, and addressing increased demand for services. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed funding increases for early childhood care and education programs like Head Start and the Child Care and Development Block Grant. It included $8.04 billion for Head Start and $2.44 billion for CCDBG, with a focus on cost-of-living adjustments and transition costs for low-performing grantees. The Senate committee bill proposed funding increases for early childhood care and education programs, including $30 million for ACL Program Administration and $8 million for Adult Protective Services State Demonstration Projects. These funds are intended to improve the workforce and provide competitive grants to states for elder justice initiatives. The Elder Justice Act authorizes grants for innovative approaches to detect and prevent elder abuse. The Senate committee bill accepted the transfer of State Health Insurance Programs (SHIPs) to ACL, funding them at $52 million. SHIPs provide counseling to Medicare beneficiaries and their families. Annual L-HHS-ED appropriations often include restrictions on controversial issues, such as limitations on the use of funds for abortions. Funding can only be used for abortions in cases of endangerment, rape, or incest. Additionally, funds cannot be used for managed care packages that include abortion coverage, except in specific circumstances. Federal programs and state/local governments receiving funding are also prohibited from discriminating against healthcare entities that do not provide abortion services. Furthermore, funds cannot be used to create human embryos for research purposes. The FY2012 and FY2013 appropriations bills included restrictions on the use of L-HHS-ED funds for controversial issues like abortion and gun control. The FY2012 law reinstated a provision prohibiting funds for needle exchange programs and expanded the prohibition on CDC spending for gun control advocacy. The FY2013 Senate bill would have modified these provisions. The federal government provides a small portion of funding for elementary and secondary education, with the majority coming from states and local districts. The United States Department of Education (ED) has various functions, including promoting educational standards. The United States Department of Education (ED) plays a key role in promoting educational standards, gathering data, disseminating research, and administering federal education programs. It focuses on improving academic outcomes for all students, especially disadvantaged students and those with disabilities. In higher education, the federal government supports a significant portion of direct aid for students. The United States Department of Education (ED) administers various higher education programs, including financial aid for college access through student loans and the Pell grant program. The FY2013 budget proposed $71.8 billion for ED, slightly higher than the previous year but less than the President's budget request. The FY2013 Senate committee bill for the United States Department of Education (ED) proposed roughly $68.5 billion in discretionary funding, which is slightly higher than the FY2012 level and lower than the President's budget request. The bill included highlights such as a reorganization of Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed increased funding for Education for the Disadvantaged State Grants and Individuals with Disabilities Act Grants to States, with slight increases compared to FY2012 funding levels. The President's budget requested level funding for these programs. Both the Senate committee bill and the President's budget allocated $463 million for IDEA Grants for Infants and Families. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed increased funding for the PROMISE program to $12 million, a $10 million (+501%) increase from FY2012. The President's Budget would have provided $30 million for the PROMISE Program. Impact Aid Payments for Federal Property would have been eliminated, resulting in a $67 million decrease from FY2012. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed to level fund the program for federally connected children. The President's Budget suggested increasing funding for the Race to the Top program to $850 million, a $301 million (+55%) increase from FY2012. The committee report indicated that a significant portion of the funding would be used for the Early Learning Challenge program, administered jointly by ED and HHS. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed funding a new organization within ED for advancing science and engineering in learning technologies. Up to 30% of the Investing in Innovation Fund would be allocated for this program. Additionally, the bill would increase funding for the Fund for the Improvement of Education to $86 million. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed increasing funding for the Fund for the Improvement of Education (FIE) to $86 million, with allocations for school libraries, childhood literacy, STEM, and Arts in Education programs. In contrast, the FY2013 President's Budget would have reduced FIE funding to $36 million. Both proposals aimed to increase funding for the Promise Neighborhood program. The FY2013 President's Budget requested $100 million, $40 million more than FY2012 funding of $60 million. The Senate committee bill proposed $49 million for Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act, $16 million less than FY2012. The President's Budget planned to consolidate programs and zero out two Rehabilitation Services and Disability Research programs. The FY2013 Senate committee bill proposed funding Rehabilitation Services and Disability Research Training Programs at $30 million, $5 million less than FY2012. It would transfer $5 million to Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants. The bill also increased funding for the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) to $44 million, a significant increase from FY2012. The President's Budget for FY2013 allocated $70 million for FIPSE, with $55 million designated for a new program, First in the World, aimed at increasing college completion rates. The FY2013 President's Budget proposed $1 billion for a new RTT program focused on College Affordability and Completion, aiming to increase college completion rates through systemic reform initiatives. The FY2013 Senate committee bill did not provide funding for this program. The FY2013 L-HHS-ED bill from the Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $69.56 billion in funding for related agencies, a 5.0% increase from FY2012. Approximately $14.14 billion (20.3%) of this amount would have been discretionary funding. The largest share of funding in the L-HHS-ED bill goes to the Social Security Administration (SSA), accounting for 97% of the entire related agencies appropriation in FY2012. The SSA primarily supports the Supplemental Security Income program with mandatory funding. Discretionary funding for the SSA covers administrative expenses for Social Security, SSI, and Medicare. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) is the next-largest agency in terms of funding, constituting roughly 2% of all funding and 8% of discretionary funding in FY2012. The FY2013 Senate committee bill from the 112th Congress proposed increased funding for program integrity activities at the SSA, including continuing disability reviews and redeterminations of SSI eligibility. The appropriation would have been raised from $756.05 million to $1.02 billion, with $273 million from base funding and $751 million from the budget cap adjustment authorized by the BCA. The Senate committee bill for FY2013 proposed increased funding for program integrity activities at the SSA, including continuing disability reviews and redeterminations of SSI eligibility. The bill would have provided $1.06 billion for the CNCS, which is $13.76 million more than the FY2012 funding level."
