    "content": "The United States rejected the UNFCCC 1997 Kyoto Protocol in 2001, which aimed to reduce GHG emissions. In the absence of federal action, some U.S. states, like California and states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, have taken aggressive steps to address climate change through laws and initiatives. California and states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions have enacted laws to reduce GHG emissions. California is proactive in environmental policy, with recent climate change actions including significant legislation and an executive order from the governor. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) involves 10 states working together to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The report also examines the potential effects, limitations, and legal challenges of state-led climate change actions from a federal policymaking perspective. California's recent climate change actions include legislation like AB 32, which aims to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The law grants authority to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop and implement a statewide program for this purpose. Despite the law's broad scope, it lacks crucial details, leaving much authority to CARB. The AB 32 law grants authority to CARB to establish a program to reduce GHG emissions without specifying a market-based system. CARB is responsible for determining regulated emission sources and meeting statewide targets, with set deadlines for agency milestones. The AB 32 law grants CARB authority to establish a program to reduce GHG emissions. Key dates include June 30, 2007 for identifying early reduction options, January 1, 2008 for establishing the 1990 baseline, and January 1, 2011 for finalizing regulations for the emissions cap. CARB begins enforcing the mandatory emission reduction program on January 1, 2012. AB 32, created in 2011, addresses emissions \"leakage\" where emission abatement in one location is offset by increased emissions in unregulated areas. Regulators must account for GHG emissions from electricity consumed in California, even if generated outside the state to prevent utilities from importing more electricity from unregulated sources. California's emission reduction program under AB 32 aims to decrease emissions, but potential leakage in neighboring states could offset the benefits. Governor Schwarzenegger's executive order called for a market-based compliance program to allow trading with the EU and other jurisdictions. California is also involved in developing a regional GHG emission reduction program. The Western Climate Initiative (WCI) was formed by Governor Schwarzenegger and governors of four western states, along with two Canadian provinces, to reduce GHG emissions by 15% below 2005 levels by 2020. The participating states/provinces agreed to develop a market-based cap and trade program to achieve this goal, but implementation may be hindered by legislative requirements. The Western Climate Initiative (WCI) aims to reduce GHG emissions by 15% below 2005 levels by 2020 through a market-based cap and trade program. Legislative obstacles may arise if states' legislatures disagree with reduction programs. Legal issues could also arise due to the inclusion of British Columbia and Manitoba, potentially violating the U.S. Constitution's compact clause. California has implemented a GHG performance standard for the electricity sector to influence long-term power generation investments. The GHG performance standard in California, enacted in 2006, restricts electricity producers from making new long-term financial commitments with power plants unless their GHG emissions are as low as a new natural gas facility. This standard applies to both in-state and out-of-state facilities exporting electricity to California. The California Public Utilities Commission issued interim performance standards in 2007 for investor-owned facilities, which accounted for 68% of the state's electricity consumption in 2003. The GHG performance standard in California, enacted in 2006, restricts electricity producers from making new long-term financial commitments with power plants unless their GHG emissions are as low as a new natural gas facility. The statute directs the California Energy Commission to issue regulations by June 30, 2007, to address electricity consumption from publicly owned utilities. The new performance standards complement the statewide GHG reduction program and act as a stop-gap measure until an economy-wide reduction regime is in place. Once fully implemented, the regulations would prohibit California consumers from using electricity generated by conventional coal-fired power plants. The GHG performance standard in California, enacted in 2006, restricts electricity producers from making new long-term financial commitments with power plants unless their GHG emissions are as low as a new natural gas facility. Compared to natural gas plants, coal-fired power plants emit more carbon dioxide. California will need to reduce energy or replace coal-generated electricity with alternative sources. The new standards will impact not only California but also other Western states. California's electricity imports contribute significantly to GHG emissions. The GHG performance standards in California affect the state's electricity sources, with most in-state electricity coming from non-coal sources while imported electricity is coal-generated. Once the standards take effect, coal-fired plants in neighboring states will need to find new customers, impacting states that historically exported coal-generated electricity to California. Legal issues regarding interstate commerce may arise. The U.S. transportation sector contributes significantly to the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, with automobiles and light-duty trucks being the main sources. California's transportation sector alone accounts for almost 41% of the state's annual emissions. California has unique authority to set motor vehicle pollution standards stricter than federal requirements, with other states having the option to adopt these standards. California enacted AB 1493 in 2002, requiring GHG limits for motor vehicles. CARB issued regulations in 2004, setting fleet average caps for vehicles starting in 2009. The caps become stricter annually, reaching 30% below 2009 levels by 2016. 14 states plan to adopt California's regulations, pending EPA waiver approval requested in 2005. EPA has yet to respond to California's waiver request. The EPA has not responded to California's waiver request for GHG emissions control under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court clarified in 2007 that the EPA has the authority to regulate GHG emissions, particularly from new motor vehicles. EPA Administrator Johnson planned to make a decision on the waiver request by the end of 2007. California issued an executive order to establish a low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) aiming to reduce transportation fuel carbon intensity by 10% by 2020. The LCFS would apply to all fuel stakeholders and measure fuel emissions on a full cycle basis. GHGs are emitted during the fuel's development, delivery, and final use. Corn-based ethanol is expected to help meet California's LCFS. Regulators must consider energy needed for production, transportation, conversion, and distribution. The LCFS executive order complements AB 1007, requiring the development of a State Alternative Fuels Plan. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a market-based effort by 10 states to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. It was under development since 2003 and aims to create a flexible cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide. Starting in January 2009, RGGI will be the nation's first mandatory cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide. The RGGI states have agreed to implement a cap of 188 million short tons of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants starting in January 2009. The cap will be lowered incrementally each year, reaching 10% below the initial level by 2018. In a cap-and-trade system, regulators set a limit on emissions and allocate credits to individual sources. Sources that exceed their allowance must buy credits from those emitting less, creating a financial incentive to reduce emissions. The RGGI cap-and-trade program will be implemented by individual states. The cap-and-trade program will be implemented by individual states in the RGGI region, with each state creating its own laws based on a model rule. A non-profit regional organization will assist in administering the program and ensuring consistency across state lines. Design details such as the cap level, cap applicability, emission allocation, and safety valve can significantly impact the program's effectiveness. Some observers view RGGI as a potential model for a federal cap-and-trade program, with its emission allocation scheme drawing both praise and criticism. States in RGGI agreed to allocate at least 25% of emission allowances for consumer benefit or strategic energy purposes, requiring power plants to purchase these allowances through an auction process. Stakeholders have raised concerns about this format. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the auction format used in RGGI for emission allowances. Power companies may struggle to share allowance costs with customers under fixed-price contracts, potentially leading to increased electricity bills. Policymakers have flexibility in using auction revenues, such as providing tax cuts to industries or assisting low-income families with energy bill increases. The auction approach is seen as more cost-effective than distributing allowances for free based on past or predicted emission rates. In a cap-and-trade system, a safety valve can control compliance costs by allowing sources to purchase credits at a fixed price instead of reducing emissions. The price cap ensures industry stability but may limit emission reductions if set too close to market value. In a cap-and-trade system, a safety valve can control compliance costs by allowing sources to purchase credits at a fixed price instead of reducing emissions. RGGI does not have a traditional safety valve but allows for compliance flexibility if the carbon dioxide allowance price reaches a certain level. This flexibility includes granting additional time for emissions reductions and the option to purchase credits from other facilities. If a national cap-and-trade regime is adopted, a traditional safety valve could be a crucial bargaining tool. The level and timing of emissions cap in a cap-and-trade program are crucial for policymakers, balancing climate change benefits and economic burdens. Political feasibility plays a role in setting the cap, like the RGGI 2009 cap negotiated among states. One strategy is to establish a cap for quick effect with modest emission reductions, allowing market forces to drive behavior change early on. The RGGI program's initial cap of 188 million short tons of carbon dioxide may be higher than actual emissions when it takes effect in 2009. Emissions have been relatively stable, with a drop in 2006 resulting in emissions being 13% below the 2009 cap. This could impact the effectiveness of the program if actual emissions remain below the cap. The RGGI program's initial cap of 188 million short tons of carbon dioxide may be higher than actual emissions when it takes effect in 2009. The allowance price might drop to such a low level that facilities would have no financial incentive to make reductions beyond their required allocation. This potential problem may be alleviated by the opportunity for affected sources to bank emission reductions for future use. Unlimited banking of reductions effectively spreads the costs of emission reduction over time and incentivizes additional reductions. States may use an emissions auction reserve price to address over-allocation. The RGGI program may face challenges with the supply of allowances exceeding demand, leading to low prices. States could set a reserve price for allowances in auctions to control price volatility. Uncertainty remains regarding electricity imports from non-RGGI states, which could impact emissions reductions. Leakage of emissions is a concern if RGGI states increase imports from non-RGGI states. The RGGI states are concerned about emission leakage to non-RGGI states due to price differences between high-carbon and low-carbon fuels. A working group has been established to address this issue, with a report expected by December 2007. This raises issues for Congress regarding emission reduction programs and legal challenges. Many U.S. states emit significant amounts of GHGs, with 18 states ranking in the top 50 for carbon dioxide emissions if classified as sovereign nations. States like Texas, the combined WCI and RGGI states, and California are top emitters. States can act as laboratories for climate change policy, testing different ideas and policies on a smaller scale to determine effective solutions. Programs in RGGI states and California have influenced federal environmental regimes. State programs like RGGI offer insights for potential national cap-and-trade systems, addressing key logistical details such as source regulation, emissions allowance allocation, cap levels, offset usage, and safety valve inclusion. These state programs can inform federal policymakers on climate change policy development. The development and passage of state climate change policies can provide insights for federal policymakers. Programs like California's emission reduction initiatives will impact consumers, businesses, and manufacturers, particularly in the automotive and electricity sectors. This could lead to the need for manufacturing different types of cars to meet new standards. The development of state climate change policies, like California's emission reduction initiatives, will impact automotive and electricity sectors. This may require manufacturing new types of cars to meet new standards, affecting technical means, marketing, compliance, pricing, and fueling infrastructure. State governments will need resources to enforce standards, potentially leading to higher vehicle prices for consumers. California and RGGI requirements will promote low carbon-intensive fuel generation and limit high carbon-intensive fuel generation, affecting electricity prices. The development of state climate change policies, like California's emission reduction initiatives, will impact automotive and electricity sectors. This may lead to increased electricity prices in states with emission limits and lower prices in states without such standards. Concerns include businesses moving to states without limits, higher cost of living, and a patchwork of regulations nationwide without a federal program. The absence of a federal program for climate change regulations may lead to a patchwork of standards nationwide, hindering company efficiency and creating economic burdens. Some companies are supporting a federal program to ensure consistent requirements across the United States. Climate change is a global issue with impacts that cannot be linked to specific emission sources, requiring widespread reductions worldwide to see local benefits. Actions by individual states and regions, like California and the Northeast, may serve as examples for broader applications in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the lack of a national or global approach limits the impact of state-level efforts, with legal challenges posing a significant uncertainty. Legal challenges against state climate change actions create uncertainty for the future, especially for more aggressive programs. Lawsuits have been filed in California, Vermont, and Rhode Island by car dealers and trade associations seeking to stop regulations on GHG emissions from motor vehicles. Some argue that California's regulations are preempted by federal law, but the impact of previous legal decisions on these cases remains uncertain. Further litigation is expected for recent state actions. Legal challenges against state climate change actions create uncertainty for the future, especially for more aggressive programs. Many expect a legal challenge to the RGGI program when the first state's rule is officially issued. Observers question the constitutionality of California's GHG performance standards, arguing it may regulate interstate commerce. The debate revolves around the states' ability to influence interstate commerce, which is limited by the U.S. Constitution granting Congress the power to regulate it. The legal arguments in these cases are complex and go beyond the Massachusetts case. Legal challenges against state climate change actions create uncertainty for the future, especially for more aggressive programs. The legal arguments in these cases are complicated and beyond the scope of this report. It is difficult to predict how the courts will interpret and decide these issues. Stakeholders will likely challenge the implementation of emission reduction programs, potentially causing delays in GHG reductions."
