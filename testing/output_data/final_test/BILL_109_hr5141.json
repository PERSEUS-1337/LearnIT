The National Science Foundation will establish a scholarship program for students in science, engineering, or mathematics programs pursuing certification for teaching. The scholarship amount will cover tuition, room and board, and fees up to $20,000 per year. Selection criteria include merit, financial need, and support for underrepresented groups. Students are limited to 5 years of undergraduate study under this program. The National Science Foundation offers scholarship support for students in science, engineering, or mathematics programs pursuing teaching certification. Students can receive up to $20,000 per year for tuition, room and board, and fees. If a student receives a grade of D or fails a course, they will be placed on probation. If they fail a course again after probation, they will forfeit the scholarship, and the amount received will be treated as a student loan. Students must fulfill a service obligation within 6 years of graduation if they received scholarship assistance for 3 or more years. The National Science Foundation offers scholarship support for students in science, engineering, or mathematics programs pursuing teaching certification. Students must complete 5 years of service if they received 3 or more years of assistance, or 3 years if they received fewer than 3 years. Service at eligible schools can reduce the obligation by 1 year. Students who forfeit the scholarship face consequences. A student forfeiting a scholarship provided by the National Science Foundation must repay the full amount if they withdraw from the program, fail classes, or declare they won't fulfill the service obligation. If a student fails to fulfill the service obligation under subsection (g), repayment for the full scholarship amount received plus interest is required in case of forfeiture. If the forfeiture is due to partial failure to meet the service obligation, repayment is required for students who received 3 or more years of scholarship assistance. Repayment for scholarship assistance received is required, reduced by \\1/5\\ for each year of service completed, plus interest. If fewer than 3 years of assistance received, repayment is reduced by \\1/3\\ for each year of service. The Director of the National Science Foundation may waive repayment requirement for extreme hardship, impossibility of compliance, or unconscionable repayment. Students with scholarship assistance can apply for additional funding for up to 2 years. For up to 2 years, students in a Master's program in STEM fields can receive scholarship assistance, with a service obligation increasing by 1 year for each year of assistance. A Scholarship Trust Fund will be established to receive gifts and donations in support of the program. Authorization of Appropriations for the National Science Foundation under this section includes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, $600,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, $800,000,000 for fiscal year 2010, and $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2011. SEC. 3. UNIVERSITY GRANTS. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a program to award annual grants of $1,000,000 to institutions of higher education for developing programs that offer undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering degrees, teacher certification, and professional development. Grants will be awarded competitively based on the applicant's ability to carry out the proposed program and with a balanced distribution on geographic location and institution size. The Director of the National Science Foundation will award annual grants to institutions of higher education for developing programs that offer undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering degrees, teacher certification, and professional development. Grants will be awarded based on the applicant's ability to carry out the proposed program, faculty quality, program impact on students becoming successful teachers, and ability to recruit students not pursuing teaching careers. Preference will be given to proposals with curriculum based on cognitive psychology, structured mentoring programs, and summer internships with researchers. The program offers summer internships with researchers in science, math, or engineering, mentored teaching experience, use of educational technology, practical teaching courses, and partnerships with private sector entities for financial support, mentoring, professional development, and collaboration with schools and organizations. Additionally, there are partnerships with other institutions for faculty sharing. The National Science Foundation program offers summer internships, mentoring, educational technology, teaching courses, and partnerships for financial support and collaboration.
