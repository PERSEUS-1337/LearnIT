    "content": "President Carter's 1978 Energy Tax Act introduced an excise tax exemption for alcohol fuel blends to achieve energy, environmental, and agricultural policy objectives. The exemption reduced the gasoline excise tax for \"gasohol\" from 18.4\u00a2 to 13.2\u00a2/gallon in 2004, with a credit of 52\u00a2 per gallon of alcohol used for fuel mixture. The motor fuels excise taxes provided a major subsidy to the ethanol fuel industry through an exemption that lowered the excise tax on blended fuel. This exemption reduced revenues for the Highway Trust Fund by an estimated $14,000 million through FY2004. In response, the Congress enacted the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which replaced the excise tax exemption with a new excise tax credit for alcohol fuel mixtures. The new incentive system increased the value of the subsidies due to interactions with the income tax system. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 proposes to expand the ethanol producer credit and introduce a renewable fuels standard, requiring gasoline suppliers to blend at least 8 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year. This would significantly increase ethanol use and federal tax revenue losses. The report explains the new alcohol fuels mixtures tax credit and compares the tax benefits under the new credit. The new alcohol fuels mixtures tax credit under \u00a740 of the Internal Revenue Code allows gasohol blenders to claim a 51\u00a2/gallon tax credit for alcohol used in qualified mixtures. This credit is different from most tax credits as it is claimed against income tax liability. The report also discusses the revenue and Highway Trust Fund implications of the new tax incentive, as well as three other tax subsidies for alcohol fuels. The new alcohol mixtures tax credit allows gasohol blenders to claim a 51\u00a2/gallon credit for alcohol used in qualified mixtures, which is different from most tax credits as it is claimed against income tax liability. This credit became effective on January 1, 2005, replacing the old excise tax exemption and providing a significant subsidy to the industry. To qualify for the full credit, the alcohol must be at least 190 proof. The new alcohol mixtures tax credit provides a 37.78\u00a2 per gallon credit for ethanol between 150 and 190 proof, available to blenders who use or sell the mixture as motor fuel. Ethanol and methanol qualify if not derived from petroleum, natural gas, coal, or peat, but in practice, ethanol from corn is mostly used. Methanol, mainly produced from natural gas, is too expensive as a blended motor fuel and does not qualify for tax breaks. The new federal tax credit for alcohol fuels applies to certain fuel additives like oxygenates produced from renewables such as corn, not fossil fuels like natural gas. ETBE, derived from ethanol and isobutylene, qualifies for the tax exemption, stimulating ethanol production. The federal tax credit for alcohol fuels applies to oxygenates like ETBE, which is derived from ethanol and isobutylene. This tax subsidy reduces the growth of MTBE and increases the demand for ethanol as an oxygenate. Methanol blended with gasoline also qualifies for a tax credit based on proof level. The new alcohol fuels mixtures excise tax credit is claimed against the gasoline excise tax, reducing the excise tax owed to the federal government. The 51\u00a2/gallon tax credit is still connected with the gasoline excise tax, requiring an understanding of the structure of federal excise taxes on motor fuels. Gasoline and diesel fuel used in highway transportation are taxed at rates of 18.4\u00a2 and 24.4\u00a2 per gallon respectively, with the revenue going to the federal highway trust fund. Other transportation fuels like jet fuel and motorboat fuel are also subject to tax. Compressed natural gas has an excise tax of 48.54\u00a2 per MCF since 1993. The excise tax on gaseous transportation fuels was introduced at 48.54\u00a2 per MCF. The tax subsidies for alcohol fuels were restructured to a tax credit under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The most important tax incentive for alcohol fuels was a partial exemption from standard excise tax rates, which was replaced by an alcohol mixtures excise tax credit in 2005. Gasohol, a mixture of 90% gasoline and 10% alcohol, was taxed at 13.2\u00a2 per gallon. The tax on gasohol, a mixture of 90% gasoline and 10% alcohol, was 13.2\u00a2 per gallon. The exemption equated to 52\u00a2 per gallon of ethanol, which is the same as a 52\u00a2/gallon income tax credit. Comparing the new alcohol fuel mixture excise tax credit with the old excise tax exemption on 90:10 blends, the subsidy value is measured in terms of its effects on the marginal costs of supplying fuel. The new excise tax credit for alcohol fuel blends results in a higher subsidy value compared to the old excise tax exemption. The net-after tax subsidy value per gallon of a 90:10 blend is 6.8\u00a2 under the credit, compared to 5.1\u00a2 under the exemption, making the credit 1.7\u00a2 greater or 33.3% higher. The excise tax credit for alcohol fuel blends provides a higher subsidy value compared to the old excise tax exemption. The subsidy value per gallon of ethanol is 68\u00a2 under the credit, 10 times greater than the 5.1\u00a2 under the exemption. This change results in a higher tax deduction and smaller tax liability due to the deductibility of excise taxes against income tax. The gasoline tax has generated over $400 billion in gross tax revenues from FY1932 to FY2003, with net revenues of about $300 billion after deductibility of excise taxes as a cost of doing business. In FY2003, the effective value of the tax credit for ethanol blends increased to 68\u00a2 per gallon, up from 51\u00a2 per gallon. In FY2003, the gasoline tax generated $20.1 billion for the Highway Trust Fund, with an additional $8.6 billion from diesel excise tax. The total excise tax receipts for the HTF in FY2003 were $33.7 billion, mostly from motor fuels taxes. Gasoline blended with ethanol generated about $4.1 billion in gross terms, with a net of $3 billion after income tax offsets. The lower tax rate on ethanol blends due to exemptions meant they did not contribute as much in tax revenue. The exemption of ethanol blends from higher taxes resulted in lower revenue generation for the Highway Trust Fund, costing the federal treasury approximately $14 billion in foregone revenues from 1978 to FY2004. If ethanol blends had been taxed at the same rate as pure gasoline, the HTF would have received about $1.4 billion more in gross revenues for FY2003. The tax code provision in 2003 allocated a portion of the excise tax on ethanol blends to the general fund instead of the Highway Trust Fund, resulting in a revenue loss of about $700 million for the HTF. The alcohol fuels exemption resulted in a total HTF revenue loss of about $2,100 million for FY2003. Replacing the exemption with a tax credit is projected to result in foregone revenues of about $1,500 million for FY2006. The income tax offset at the 18.4\u00a2 rate results in higher net income offsets compared to the non-subsidized full gasoline tax rate, leading to additional revenue loss. For FY2006, income tax offsets are estimated at $387.5 million, with projected revenue losses increasing significantly due to the new tax credit for alcohol fuels mixtures. The new excise tax credit for alcohol fuels mixtures is projected to more than double by 2010 if the Renewable Fuels Standard under the Senate's version of H.R. 6 is enacted. This tax credit, along with an income tax credit for ethanol fuels, will be major incentives for ethanol fuels. The tax credit for straight alcohol fuels, such as ethanol and methanol, is 60\u00a2/gallon and is available to users or sellers who sell it to the ultimate user. The credit is limited to ethanol from corn and small ethanol producers can receive a 10\u00a2 per gallon credit for up to 15 million gallons of annual production. The small ethanol producer credit, part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, is a production tax credit for manufacturers with a capacity of 30 million gallons per year or less. It is available to those who sell alcohol for blending into fuel or retail sale. The credit can be passed through to cooperative patrons, benefiting farmer cooperatives producing ethanol. Individuals or businesses purchasing alternative fuel vehicles can claim a tax deduction for incremental costs of new vehicles and upgrades. The maximum deduction for cars is $2,000 and for trucks, it can be up to $50,000. There is also a tax deduction of up to $100,000 for investments in equipment needed to dispense alternative fuels. Alternative fuels include compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, and electricity, among others. The deduction is reduced by 75% in 2006. The tax deduction for clean fuel vehicles was reduced by 75% in 2006 and eliminated after December 31, 2006. An income tax credit is available for the production of alternative fuels derived from various resources, such as oil from tar sands or shale. Certain alcohol fuels qualify for a non-refundable tax credit, but alcohol fuels produced from biomass do not qualify. The technical appendix calculates the economic value of the new alcohol fuel excise tax credit compared to the old excise tax exemption and non-subsidized gasoline. Profit maximization leads the firm to produce where price equals marginal cost. In a competitive market, a profit-maximizing firm facing a unit tax on gasoline sees a higher marginal cost curve by the amount of the tax. A pure income or profits tax is neutral and does not affect the level of output. However, with two unit excise taxes, the after-tax situation changes. The after-tax profit function is affected by excise tax deductibility for income tax purposes. The level of output that maximizes profits is determined by a specific condition. The shift in marginal cost curve due to deductibility of excise taxes is illustrated with examples of gasoline distributor and blender scenarios. The shift in marginal costs under the new alcohol fuels tax incentives is calculated to be 11.6\u00a2, which is less than the increase under the gasoline tax and the old exemption. This calculation takes into account the difference in tax rates between T1 and T2."
