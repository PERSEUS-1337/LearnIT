    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Geothermal Production Expansion Act.\" The Geothermal Production Expansion Act promotes the development of clean renewable geothermal energy on Federal lands through non-competitive leases authorized by the Bureau of Land Management. Leasing activity should focus on land development rather than speculation to avoid artificially raising costs. Developers of geothermal energy on Federal lands should be allowed to secure discovery of resources to promote successful development and increase revenue for the Federal Government through production royalties. SEC. 3. Noncompetitive leasing of adjoining areas for geothermal resource development. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to define 'industry standards' and 'qualified geothermal professional' for assessing geothermal resources. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act defines terms such as 'qualified lessee' and 'valid discovery' related to geothermal exploration and development. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act allows noncompetitive lease of adjoining lands to qualified lessees for geothermal development at fair market value per acre. The areas must not exceed 640 acres, each must be at least one acre, and not already leased or nominated for leasing. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act allows noncompetitive lease of adjoining lands to qualified lessees for geothermal development if certain conditions are met, including the submission of sufficient geological and technical data by a qualified geothermal professional. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act allows noncompetitive lease of lands for geothermal development if certain conditions are met, including fair market value per acre determined by the Secretary. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act allows noncompetitive lease of lands for geothermal development with a fair market value per acre set by the Secretary within a 90-day period. If the value is not determined, it defaults to $100 per acre until established, for leases applied for within a 15-year period. The fair market value per acre for noncompetitive lease of lands for geothermal development, set by the Secretary within a 90-day period, shall not exceed $200 per acre for leases applied for within a 15-year period."
