    "content": "The Act titled \"Wood Stove Regulatory Relief Act of 2014\" regulates new residential wood heaters, hydronic heaters, forced-air furnaces, and masonry heaters. During an 8-year period, the Administrator is prohibited from finalizing any rule related to new residential wood heaters, hydronic heaters, forced-air furnaces, or masonry heaters unless it meets specific requirements. This Act applies to rules under the Clean Air Act applicable to these sources. During an 8-year period, the Administrator cannot establish particulate matter emissions limits below 4.5 grams per hour for certain wood heaters/stoves certified before the rule's effective date. During a transition period, the Administrator cannot set particulate matter emissions limits below 4.5 grams per hour for wood heaters/stoves certified before the rule's effective date. Additionally, there are specific emission limits for residential hydronic heaters and forced-air furnaces. During the transition period, certified residential wood heaters can continue to be manufactured and sold for five years after certification. Forced-air furnaces have specific regulations, with exceptions for certain models. Forced-air furnaces manufactured before the effective date of a rule can be sold for at least one year after the rule takes effect. Furnaces manufactured after the effective date do not need to meet emissions limits until at least one year after the rule takes effect. Furnaces tested under Canadian Standards Administration B415.1-10 test are exempt from certain regulations. Forced-air furnaces meeting emissions limits can be sold for five years after the effective date of the rule. Hydronic heaters deemed qualified models are certified as compliant with emissions limits for the duration of their qualified status. During the specified period, the Administrator must ensure that certifications of compliance with emissions limits are issued by an independent accredited third party for any rule described in subsection (b). During the specified period, emissions limits must be certified by independent third-party laboratories accredited under ISO/IEC 17065. The EPA's role in the certification process is limited to conducting selective audits. ISO-accredited certification bodies or test labs perform quality assurance/control functions. Definitions include Administrator (EPA head), ISO (International Organization for Standardization), ISO/IEC 17025 (standard), ISO/IEC 17065 (standard), and new source (Clean Air Act definition). The term \"qualified model\" refers to a hydronic heater that meets performance levels set by the Administrator under a voluntary partnership program."
