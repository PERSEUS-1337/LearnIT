FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that Poland is a close ally of the United States, with strong diplomatic, political, military, and economic ties. While personal contacts between individuals are lacking, Poland actively supports the global campaign against terrorism. The threat of terrorist activities in Poland is smaller compared to other countries in the visa waiver program. Since joining NATO in 1999, Poland has been a reliable partner in security efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Bilateral relations with the United States have strengthened, leading to increased contacts between citizens since 1991. Poland unilaterally repealed its visa obligation for United States citizens in 1991, leading to increased contacts between citizens. Since 1989, Poland has undergone significant political, social, and economic changes, becoming committed to traditional values, freedom, and democracy. Poland joined the European Union in 2004, stabilizing its economy through integration. Over 150,000 Polish citizens visited the United States. Poland's visa refusal rate has significantly decreased, allowing more Polish citizens to visit the United States. The country also participates in programs like work and travel, enabling thousands of Polish students to visit annually. Warsaw International Airport Okecie is part of a pilot program for passenger screening for flights to the US. If Poland is conditionally included in the visa waiver program, the government will create necessary measures. The Polish government is committed to preventing citizens from overstaying in the US under the visa waiver program. They are ready to show safeguards against passport fraud and are determined to introduce secure passports with biometric identifiers. The New Jersey and Massachusetts assemblies passed resolutions urging eligibility for Poland in the visa waiver program. SEC. 2. TEMPORARY AND CONDITIONAL DESIGNATIONS OF POLAND FOR VISA WAIVER PROGRAM. Effective immediately upon enactment of this Act, Poland will be temporarily designated as a program country for the visa waiver program, expiring 18 months later. The Secretary of Homeland Security will review Poland's overstay rate within a year to determine if a permanent, conditional designation is warranted. Poland will be designated as a program country for the visa waiver program, with the condition that it maintains an annual overstay rate below 3 percent. If the overstay rate exceeds 3 percent, Poland's designation will be suspended for a year. If Poland's annual overstay rate exceeds 3 percent for two fiscal years, its designation as a program country for the visa waiver program will be terminated. The Secretary of Homeland Security can redesignate Poland if new safeguards are established to keep the overstay rate low. The term \"overstay rate\" refers to the percentage of Polish nationals who violated their nonimmigrant visitor admission terms. The overstay rate is the percentage of nationals who violated their admission terms, compared to the total number of visitors from that country."
