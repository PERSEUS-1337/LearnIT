    "content": "The People's Republic of China has the world's largest number of Internet users, estimated at 500 million people, with 300 million on microblogging sites like Twitter. Despite government restrictions, Chinese netizens access vast information, aiding political dissidents and civil society. The web facilitates public discourse and some government departments seek online input on policies. However, the Internet has not sparked democratic change as expected. China's strong internal security measures and aggressive stance limit its impact. China has an extensive internal security apparatus and aggressive Internet censorship system, ranking low in Internet freedom. Approximately 70 Chinese citizens are imprisoned for discussing sensitive topics online. U.S. congressional concerns include human rights, trade, investment, and cybersecurity related to China's Internet use. Congressional interest is linked to promoting freedom of expression, political dissidents' use of the Internet, and the role of U.S. Internet companies in spreading freedom in China. The Internet in China is heavily censored, with a small minority using proxy servers to access restricted content. Most Chinese users are satisfied with the limited online freedom, reducing public pressure for change. Despite occasional protests, the government maintains control over web content and usage. The Internet in China offers a wide range of services, with restrictions that are often unnoticed by users. Some experts argue that it creates an illusion of democracy by allowing online expression. The government justifies its Internet regulation to control illegal content and activities. U.S. efforts to promote Internet freedom in China focus on censorship circumvention and protecting user privacy. Counter-censorship technology has limited impact on promoting freedom and democracy in China. Analysts suggest a broader approach with tools and education for cyber dissidents, including secure communication, detecting spyware, maintaining Internet access, and online advocacy training. The PRC government controls online content through various methods like website blocking, keyword filtering, and monitoring Internet activities. This selective targeting creates fear and promotes self-censorship among users. Blocked sites include Radio Free Asia, Voice of America, Facebook, and Twitter. The Chinese government controls online content by blocking websites and filtering keywords. They also monitor Internet activities to promote self-censorship among users. Access to international human rights websites and Taiwanese news sites is restricted, along with searches related to sensitive topics like Tibet, Tiananmen Square, and Falun Gong. The government employs students to spread pro-government views online, and experts believe their control over the Internet is maintained through non-coercive incentives for compliance. The Chinese government maintains control over online content by blocking websites, filtering keywords, and monitoring Internet activities to promote self-censorship. Domestic and foreign Internet companies in China are required to follow government guidelines and practice self-censorship to maintain their business licenses. Companies like Baidu, Sina Weibo, and Tencent have thrived in this environment by employing hundreds of people to filter online discussions and censor content. Sina Weibo, for example, has around 1,000 employees dedicated to monitoring and censoring expression on its platform. In May 2012, Sina implemented a point system where customers start with points deducted for posting \"harmful\" content. If points reach zero, the account is terminated. Service providers balance providing engaging content with government guidelines, affecting their survival. The PRC government controls online information by shaping the Internet user experience in China, diluting opposition to censorship. China's censorship regime has diluted opposition, allowing Chinese internet users to access platforms like Baidu, RenRen, Kaixinwang, Sohu, and Sina. This has been referred to as \"Internet democracy\" by Chinese officials. Despite challenges, the Communist Party has managed to control the internet to stay in power. The government and netizens engage in a cycle of new platforms challenging control, followed by crackdowns or regulations. The Chinese government can block news dissemination or shut down the internet, but often cannot do so before events are publicized online. Chinese internet users can bypass government controls using proxy servers or virtual private networks (VPNs). Proxy servers and VPNs enable some motivated Internet users to avoid censorship in China, but the government occasionally attempts to curtail their use. The government tolerates these tools as long as it remains politically manageable and does not want to alienate the general online population or international business community. In 2009, the Chinese government faced opposition from domestic and foreign entities over a directive to install \"Green Dam Youth Escort\" software on all computers sold in China. Critics argued that the software could expand censorship, undermine computer operability, and weaken Internet security. The government backed down due to the outpouring of opposition. The Chinese government faced opposition in 2009 over a directive to install \"Green Dam Youth Escort\" software on all computers sold in China, which critics argued could expand censorship and weaken Internet security. The government later announced a delay in the mandatory installation of the software, with future policies to involve public input. Internet censorship in Tibet is harsher than in other parts of China, with online communication facing government restrictions but also opportunities for circumvention. Chinese Internet users have experienced cycles of adopting new technologies for expressing opinions on current issues, followed by government restrictions and the development of circumvention tools. The recent sensation in China is microblogging, similar to Twitter, with platforms like Sina and Tencent hosting 300 million microbloggers. Microblogs have become the country's most important public sphere, allowing for free speech and serving as a vital news source. They have been instrumental in exposing official malfeasance and sensitive news, such as the high-speed train crash in Wenzhou. News sites and online portals now feature popular microblogs. The Chinese government struggles to control the spread of information on microblogs, often censoring posts that undermine its leadership. Various entities, including government ministries, state media outlets, and celebrities, have opened microblog accounts. Pressure is placed on companies like Sina to censor messages deemed harmful to national interests. The Chinese government is nervous about rumors spreading online regarding the scandal involving Bo Xilai and his wife's arrest for murder. They have implemented controls on Internet use to induce self-censorship and rely on Internet Service Providers to avoid backlash. In recent years, PRC authorities have attempted to consolidate the management of Internet content and monitor users, focusing on curbing illegal content and political discourse. Users are required to provide real names or identification when using the Internet, but compliance has been low. Some U.S. Internet companies faced backlash for cooperating with Chinese government censorship efforts, leading to arrests of Chinese Internet users. Yahoo! was criticized for providing user information to state security authorities, resulting in the arrest of a journalist who forwarded sensitive information via his Yahoo! email account. In 2005, Chinese journalist Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for leaking state secrets via his Yahoo! email account. Microsoft shut down Chinese journalist Zhao Jing's blog for supporting a boycott of Beijing News. U.S. and Western companies like Cisco Systems were accused of aiding Chinese government censorship and surveillance efforts. Cisco Systems sold routers and technology to China for censorship and surveillance purposes, leading to lawsuits from human rights groups. They also provided networking equipment for a city-wide video surveillance system in Chongqing municipality. Some U.S. ICT companies argue they comply with local laws in China and do not tailor products for censorship. Cisco states they do not customize equipment for China, have a code of conduct to prevent human rights violations, and comply with U.S. regulations on high-tech products. Despite PRC censorship, companies claim to increase information availability in China. Some U.S. ICT companies in China claim to comply with local laws and do not customize products for censorship. Despite facing censorship, they argue that they are increasing information availability in the country. Google's clash with the Chinese government over censorship issues led to the limited services offered by Google.cn, which became the second most used search engine in China after Baidu. Foreign companies in China have been promoting freedom through the internet, although they have also made compromises with the government. Google limited its services in China to comply with censorship policies, avoiding some compliance and human rights issues faced by other companies. In January 2010, Google threatened to stop filtering its Chinese search engine or leave China after Chinese hackers attacked its Gmail service and corporate network. In January 2010, Google faced cyber attacks in China targeting Gmail accounts of activists and intellectual property. Google announced it would no longer censor search results on Google.cn, potentially shutting down its operations in China. Public opinion in China was divided, with some supporting Google's stance against the government while others viewed it as profit-driven. In February 2010, Google confirmed cyber attacks from mainland China, prompting the company to reroute searches in mainland China to its uncensored Hong Kong site. Beijing denied involvement and emphasized the importance of respecting Chinese laws and regulations. In June 2010, Google submitted a renewal application to do business in China, promising to create a new Google.cn landing page for users to access the uncensored Hong Kong search engine. Despite accusations of breaking promises by China's State Council Information Office, Google's search engine can still be accessed in mainland China through Hong Kong, although its market share has decreased significantly. The market share of Google in China fell from 30% in 2009 to 16% in 2012, while Baidu's share grew from 58% to over 78% during the same period. In response to criticism, U.S. information and communications technology companies, along with other entities, formed the Global Network Initiative (GNI) in 2008 to promote best practices related to U.S. companies' conduct in countries with poor Internet freedom records. The GNI adopts a self-regulatory approach to promote due diligence and awareness regarding human rights, providing guidance to the ICT industry on protecting freedom of expression and privacy. Companies undergo third-party assessments of their compliance with GNI principles. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) conducts third-party assessments to ensure companies comply with its principles. Despite criticism, supporters argue that the initiative sets realistic goals and incentivizes companies to uphold free expression and privacy. The U.S. government's efforts to promote Internet freedom are part of its cyberspace policy, outlined in the President's International Strategy for Cyberspace released in May 2011. The President's International Strategy for Cyberspace emphasizes promoting Internet freedom, enhancing security, and developing capacity in global digital networks. It outlines policy priorities such as opening markets, enforcing relevant laws, and ensuring military response capabilities. Some question the U.S. government's ability to effectively achieve these goals. The United States has faced criticism for using advanced surveillance technologies domestically and internationally, with repressive regimes utilizing technologies developed by U.S. companies. Google reported an increase in censorship requests from democratic countries, including the U.S. The State Department has included Internet freedom in its global human rights agenda, aiming for equal access to knowledge and ideas for all of humanity. The State Department's focus on Internet freedom is based on international commitments to free expression and information flow as human rights. Secretary Clinton has expressed concerns about threats to information flow in countries like China and Egypt, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to a free and open Internet. However, there are concerns about balancing security and protecting property rights online, which some view as conflicting with Internet freedom principles. The NetFreedom Taskforce, established in 2006, coordinates State Department policy on Internet freedom. It is co-chaired by Under Secretaries of State and implemented by various bureaus. The State Department focuses on human rights and democratization efforts related to Internet freedom. The NetFreedom Taskforce, established in 2006, coordinates State Department policy on Internet freedom, focusing on monitoring and increasing Internet access in foreign countries, responding to threats through diplomacy. US efforts in the early 2000s targeted censorship circumvention in China and Iran, raising questions about the global principle of Internet freedom. Some experts advocate a broader approach to Internet freedom activities by the State Department, which now include censorship circumvention technology, privacy protection, and educating civil society groups. However, rapid expansion of funding for these activities may pose risks such as delegitimizing local movements, providing targets for persecution, and diverting attention from grassroots activism. The State Department and USAID allocate funding for Internet freedom efforts, with approximately $95 million appropriated since 2008. The Secretary of State has requested $27.5 million for Internet freedom activities in FY2013. Funding is administered by DRL, NEA, and DCHA, and comes from ESF, HRDF, and NERD program accounts. Programs focus on technical assistance in circumvention technology for restrictive countries like China and Iran. Advocacy assistance for Internet freedom is provided to various countries, with a focus on new technologies to bypass online censorship and protect against cyberattacks. This includes tools for accessing blocked information, maintaining anonymity, and restoring websites after attacks. Advocacy assistance for Internet freedom includes optimizing mobile communications technologies, training activists in circumvention technology, media assistance for NGOs, pressing repressive governments on Internet freedom, and shaping international Internet freedom norms. The U.S. government promotes Internet freedom by leading international policy discussions, monitoring global Internet conditions, and engaging the private sector. Other agencies like the Broadcasting Board of Governors use counter-censorship software for international Internet programming. The BBG has increased funding for Internet censorship circumvention efforts, with Congress transferring $10 million in FY2011 and the agency receiving $9.1 million in FY2012. VOA sends e-mails to 8 million Chinese citizens daily with news and information on using proxy servers to access blocked websites. RFA's Freedom2Connect program develops online tools for secure browsing and e-mail in China. RFA's program \"How to Scale the Chinese Firewall\" aims to provide secure online tools for Internet users in China to bypass government censorship. Activists are advocating for increased funding for servers and bandwidth to combat China's Internet censorship system. Congress has allocated millions of dollars for global Internet freedom efforts, focusing on censorship circumvention technology, security training, media skills, and public policy in target countries. The U.S. government has targeted China and Iran with efforts to promote Internet freedom through circumvention and secure communications programs. Congressional committees have held hearings on Internet issues in China, including censorship, cybersecurity, free trade, and intellectual property rights. The Department of State and Congressional-Executive Commission on China address Internet freedom in their annual reports on human rights conditions in China. The U.S. government has focused on promoting Internet freedom in China and Iran through various programs. Congressional committees have conducted hearings on Internet issues in China, covering censorship, cybersecurity, free trade, and intellectual property rights. Various government bodies have addressed Internet freedom in their reports on human rights conditions in China. The Global Online Freedom Act (GOFA) was first introduced in 2006 and has evolved through four Congresses. It aims to establish an Office of Global Internet Freedom, require annual reports on \"Internet-restricting countries,\" and prevent U.S. companies from cooperating with governments that engage in censorship and human rights abuses. Key provisions include prohibiting U.S. companies from storing personally identifiable information in Internet-restricting countries and jamming U.S.-supported websites. The Global Online Freedom Act (GOFA) aims to prevent U.S. companies from cooperating with governments that engage in censorship and human rights abuses. The most recent version of the bill (H.R. 3605) emphasizes due diligence and transparency while removing provisions that would establish the Office of Global Internet Freedom and impose civil and criminal penalties. U.S. companies located in Internet-restricting countries would be required to disclose information related to censorship policies. Countries must include policies in their annual reports that address human rights due diligence and reflect OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. U.S. Internet service providers filtering or censoring information must notify users when content is removed at a country's request. Other changes include a requirement for the U.S. Trade Representative to report on trade issues related to foreign censorship policies and a section on export controls for telecommunications equipment. Some experts warned against earlier aspects of GOFA, such as provisions authorizing the U.S. Attorney General to determine when to bar U.S. Internet service providers from complying with foreign governments' requests for user information. Critics raised privacy concerns about potential access to individual account information. Other analysts expressed concern about current OGIF provisions requiring U.S. companies to disclose information to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The current OGIF provisions may impact political activists in Internet-restricting countries by requiring disclosure of blocking or surveillance technology. Some experts question designating certain countries as \"Internet restricting,\" suggesting it may overlook changes and interfere with diplomatic issues. Congress may need to address Internet freedom and regulate U.S. companies amidst growing tensions between state and society, including funding, programming, and coordination decisions. Congress may make decisions on funding, programming, and coordination for global Internet freedom efforts, including apportioning appropriations and setting benchmarks. They may aim to reconcile the Global Online Freedom Act and the Global Network Initiative, promoting human rights standards for ICT companies. The GNI includes corporations like Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, with Facebook as an observer. Congress may also explore linkages between the U.S. government, private sector, and international online freedom efforts. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) invites companies to join as members or observers to uphold principles on free expression and privacy. Observer status lasts for one non-renewable 12-month term. Seats are available for future member companies. Current members include civil society organizations, investors, academics, and academic organizations. Governments are not members but encouraged to support GNI goals. GNI's core documents outline objectives, commitments, and governance. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) Principles emphasize user rights to freedom of expression and privacy, guiding ICT companies on respecting and protecting these rights globally. Companies commit to conducting human rights risk assessments to inform policy decisions. Implementation Guidelines offer detailed guidance on putting the Principles into practice. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) Principles provide guidance to ICT companies on respecting user rights to freedom of expression and privacy. Companies are required to operate transparently when removing content, disclose applicable laws and policies, and assess human rights risks related to personal information. The guidelines are regularly reviewed and revised to incorporate stakeholder feedback. The Governance, Accountability & Learning Framework outlines a multi-stakeholder governance structure and compliance system. Independent third-party assessments are phased in over three stages to ensure company compliance with the Principles and Implementation Guidelines. In Phase Three (January 2012 onwards), the Board will accredit independent assessors to review companies' internal systems and responses to government demands on freedom of expression or privacy. Participating companies must submit annual reports to the Organization, with assessors evaluating their responses to government demands. The Board will assess compliance with the Principles and publish an annual report on each company's adherence. The GNI aims to increase membership in 2012. In 2012, the Global Network Initiative focused on increasing membership, deepening relationships with ICT companies, and conducting Phase III assessments of founding companies to evaluate the implementation of Principles. They also commissioned a study for a public engagement process and held the first Multi-Stakeholder Learning Forum in Washington, DC. The forum included discussions on Principles, shared learning, and the launch of a research report on balancing free expression, privacy, national security, and law. The GNI launched a research report on balancing free expression, privacy, national security, and law enforcement, along with confidential discussions among members on human rights issues in ICTs."
