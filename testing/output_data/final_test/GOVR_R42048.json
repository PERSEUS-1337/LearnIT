    "content": "The U.S. policy on legal permanent immigration is based on four major principles: family reunification, admitting skilled immigrants, protecting refugees, and promoting diversity by country of origin. These principles are outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system with per-country ceilings. The Immigration Act of 1990 made significant revisions to employment-based permanent immigration laws. Permanent immigrants enter the U.S. through a preference system, while nonimmigrants are admitted temporarily without using this system. The U.S. policy on legal permanent immigration is based on four major principles outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system with per-country ceilings. Interest has grown in the per-country ceilings, which limit the number of employment-based LPRs coming from specific countries each year. Some argue that the current numerical limits on employment-based LPRs are not working in the national interest. This report analyzes the impact of the per-country ceilings on the employment-based immigration process. The U.S. policy on legal permanent immigration is based on principles outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system with per-country ceilings for employment-based LPRs. The Department of State (DOS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigrant Services (USCIS) play key roles in administering the law and policies on migrant admission. DOS handles visa issuance, while USCIS approves immigrant petitions. The Department of Labor (DOL) ensures employers seeking to hire employment-based LPRs are approved. The report analyzes the impact of per-country ceilings on the employment-based immigration process. The report analyzes approved employment-based LPR petitions, including pending petitions with the DOS National Visa Center and USCIS. Legislative options to revise per-country ceilings are provided as suggestions for further discussions. The Immigration and Nationality Act sets a permanent annual worldwide level of 675,000 LPRs, with flexibility for certain categories to exceed limits. The Immigration and Nationality Act sets a permanent annual worldwide level of 675,000 LPRs, with flexibility for certain categories to exceed limits. Immigrants are admitted or adjusted annually, with numerical limits for different categories such as employment-based and diversity immigrants. Each year, countries are held to a numerical limit of 7% of the worldwide level of U.S. immigrant admissions, known as per-country limits. Employment-based immigrant visas are issued in order of petitions filed under specific preference categories for each country. Spouses and children of prospective LPRs have the same status and consideration order. Visas are prorated when demand exceeds per-country limits. The INA restricts admission for 2nd or 3rd preference LPRs for labor unless certain conditions are met. The foreign labor certification program in the U.S. Department of Labor ensures that foreign workers do not adversely affect U.S. workers' wages or working conditions. Employers must obtain a foreign labor certification before filing a visa petition for foreign workers under certain preference categories. The INA sets per-country levels at 7% of the worldwide level for permanent immigration, with a 2% ceiling for dependent foreign states. This per-country level is not a quota for individual countries. The per-country level for permanent immigration is set at 7% of the worldwide level, acting as a barrier against monopolization. The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 allowed for the surpassing of per-country ceilings for employment-based immigrants in oversubscribed countries. Employment-based preference allocations can exceed the 7% per-country limit within the overall level of 140,000 annually. The total number of employment-based LPR admissions increased from 123,291 in FY1994 to 246,865 in FY2005, with fluctuations in subsequent years. Employment-based LPR admissions increased from 123,291 in FY1994 to 246,865 in FY2005, with fluctuations in subsequent years. In FY2014, employment-based LPRs rose to 151,596, comprising 15% of the total 1,016,518 LPRs. The bulk of employment-based visas are allocated to the 1st through 3rd preference categories. Trends from 1994 to 2014 show increases in 1st and 2nd preference LPRs, while 3rd and 4th preference admissions decreased. Admissions for the 5th preference increased significantly. Petitions for employment-based LPR status are filed with USCIS by the sponsoring employer or individual. The process of obtaining permanent residency in the United States involves filing petitions with the National Visa Center (NVC) at DOS and being assigned a priority date. Once the priority date becomes current, individuals can proceed with the next steps based on their location. If already in the US, they must apply for an adjustment of status (Form I-485) through USCIS to switch to a permanent category. If not in the US, they need to go through consular processing. The National Visa Center handles processing of petitions for prospective LPRs without legal residence status in the US or living abroad. DOS assigns visa priority dates and numbers, with most foreign nationals becoming LPRs while already in the US. Adjusting status with USCIS or obtaining a visa abroad from Consular Affairs determines the process. Immigrant investors were mostly new arrivals (82% from FY2004-FY2014), requiring separate processing for employment-based immigrant visas by DOS and USCIS. DOS issues monthly Visa Bulletin with cutoff dates for visa queue. USCIS handles adjustment of status applications. The Visa Bulletin issues cutoff dates for numerically limited employment-based preference categories, determining waiting times for immigrants. Priority dates earlier than the cutoff dates are currently being processed. In August 2016, the 1st preference \"extraordinary workers\" visa category was current for all countries except China and India. The 2nd preference \"advanced degree\" category had a priority date of February 1, 2014 for all countries except China and India. The 3rd preference \"professional, skilled, and unskilled workers\" visas had a priority date of March 15, 2016, with longer waits for China, India, and the Philippines. The Visa Bulletin provides cutoff dates for employment-based preference categories, determining waiting times for immigrants. Priority dates earlier than the cutoff dates are currently being processed. The Department of State publishes approved visa petitions pending with the National Visa Center at the end of each fiscal year, reflecting persons approved for visas not yet available due to numerical limits. These data do not constitute a backlog of petitions to be processed. As of November 1, 2015, there were 100,747 approved petitions for employment-based LPR visas pending with the National Visa Center. These petitions include spouses and children entitled to derivative status. Among them, 82,706 were in the 1st through 3rd employment-based LPR preference categories. Figure 3 shows the distribution of these approved petitions by date of submission and preference category. The majority of approved employment-based LPR visas pending at the National Visa Center as of November 1, 2015, were those of 3rd preference \"professional and skilled workers\"\u201461,584. There were also 6,208 approved 3rd preference visas pending for \"unskilled workers.\" The decline in approved 3rd preference category petitions pending after 2007 is attributed to visa retrogression that year. Some petitions filed after 2007 have not yet appeared in the approved caseload. India leads as the source country for most of the approved petitions pending for employment-based LPR visas at the National Visa Center, with 30,281 approved pending petitions. Philippines follows with 29,297, China with 22,114, South Korea with 3%, and Mexico with 2%. India's approved visas pending are mostly in the 3rd preference for professional, skilled, and unskilled workers. The National Visa Center has a significant number of approved pending visas from India, Philippines, and China, with varying preference categories. India leads with 30,281 approved petitions, mostly in the 3rd preference category. Philippines has 29,297 approved visas pending, while China has 22,114, with a majority in the 5th preference category for immigrant investors. The caseload varies by source country and preference category, showing that India is the largest source country, but the Philippines and China also have a noteworthy portion of approved pending visas. The USCIS maintains approved employment-based I-485 petitions that are pending, providing data on approved employment-based LPRs. The I-485 Inventory includes petitioners adjusting status in the US, not new arrivals from abroad. As of April 2016, there were 117,731 pending approved I-485 petitions, categorized by preference and submission year. The USCIS maintains approved employment-based I-485 petitions that are pending, categorized by preference and submission year. As of April 2016, there were 117,731 pending approved I-485 petitions. The 2nd preference category had the most approved petitions pending (46,765), with many submitted several years ago. The decline in approved 3rd preference category petitions after 2007 is due to visa retrogression. There are 30,457 approved petitions pending in the 1st preference category and 37,971 in the 3rd preference category. The approved I-485 petitions pending in the USCIS Inventory are more numerous in the 1st and 2nd preference categories compared to the National Visa Center. India leads with 39% of approved I-485 petitions pending, followed by China with 12%. India dominates various preference categories, while China leads in the 5th \"immigrant investor\" category. Table 3 and Figure 9 compare the effects of per-country limits on legal immigration on oversubscribed countries. The data in Table 3 shows more pending visa applications for adjustments of status in the I-485 inventory compared to new arrivals in the NVC pending applications. The I-485 inventory has higher numbers of pending visas for the 1st, 2nd, and 4th preference categories than the NVC. The analysis shows that more employment-based migrants are adjusting status rather than newly arriving. Indians are mostly waiting to adjust status in the US, while Filipinos are waiting to immigrate from abroad. Policy options for India and China would also affect approved petitions pending from the Philippines. Employment-based immigration raises concerns about foreign workers competing with US workers. Concerns about foreign workers competing with U.S. workers persist, with high unemployment levels and a ratio of 13 job seekers for every 10 job openings in May 2016. Employers argue they need the \"best and the brightest\" workers, regardless of their country of birth, to stay competitive in the global market. Support for increasing employment-based immigration may be hindered by economic conditions. While concerns about foreign workers competing with U.S. workers persist due to high unemployment levels, proponents argue that employment-based immigration is essential for economic growth. Opponents believe there is no evidence of labor shortages and worry about the impact on salaries and working conditions. The option of lifting per-country caps on employment-based LPRs has gained attention, with some suggesting it would increase high-skilled immigrants without raising total admissions. Legislative options to increase high-skilled immigration to the United States include lifting country caps on employment-based preference categories, excluding them from family-based and worldwide ceilings. Other alternatives include reallocating employment-based visas. Several possible alternatives to increase high-skilled immigration to the United States include reallocating employment-based preferences, reallocating diversity visas, and permitting selected nonimmigrants to adjust to LPR status outside the numerical limits. These options aim to address the flow of employment-based immigrants and the distribution of approved LPR petitions from certain countries. Establishing an employment-based LPR category for foreign students with STEM graduate degrees from U.S. institutions. Uncertainty exists regarding the effects of revising per-country limits due to data discrepancies and visa retrogression impacts. The number of approved petitions and pending caseloads remain unclear, but it is likely that additional approvals would occur. Eliminating per-country ceilings for employment-based LPRs could lead to increased petitions and shorter wait times, benefiting both employers and foreign workers. Some argue that country caps are arbitrary and discriminatory, as employability should not be tied to country of birth. This change could also impact family-based immigration and other employment-based LPR categories. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 ended the country-of-origin quota system, leading to more equitable U.S. immigration policies. Proponents argue that per-country ceilings maintain diversity in immigrant flows, while opponents view them as discriminatory based on nationality.

Further analysis reveals differences among top countries in employment-based preference categories, with China, India, and the Philippines having the largest number of approved visa petitions pending at the National Visa Center. The Philippines has the largest portion in the 3rd preference category. India leads in approved pending I-485 petitions for all categories except the 5th preference, where China is dominant. China also ranks second in approved pending I-485 petitions for the 1st and 2nd preference categories."
