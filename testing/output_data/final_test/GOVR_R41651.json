    "content": "The Congressional Review Act (CRA) mandates federal agencies to submit final rules to the Comptroller General at the Government Accountability Office and Congress before they can take effect. Major rules must have their effective dates delayed until 60 days after publication in the Federal Register or submission to Congress. The Comptroller General must provide a report to congressional committees within 15 days of a major rule being submitted or published, summarizing the agency's compliance with rulemaking requirements. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires federal agencies to submit final rules to Congress and the Comptroller General before they can take effect. Major rules with significant economic impact must be delayed for 60 days. The CRA allows Congress to disapprove any final rule through expedited legislative procedures. Signed into law on March 29, 1996, as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. The Congressional Review Act (CRA), enacted in 1996 as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, gives Congress authority to disapprove agency regulations through expedited procedures. In contrast, the REINS Act would require approval of major rules before they take effect. The REINS Act requires major rules to be approved by Congress within 70 session days or they will not take effect. However, under Section 801 of Title 5, a major rule can take effect for 90 calendar days without approval in certain emergency situations. The Act aims to increase accountability and transparency in the federal regulatory process by ensuring Congress has oversight on major rules. The REINS Act aims to address Congress's excessive delegation of legislative powers by requiring a vote on major rules within 70 session days. Non-governmental observers have expressed mixed reactions, with some supporting the act for its potential to improve regulatory processes and accountability in government. Wayne Crews and Phil Kerpen support the REINS Act for its potential to reform the regulatory process in Congress and enhance accountability. Jonathan H. Adler also sees promise in the act for disciplining federal regulatory agencies. However, some, like Sidney Shapiro, have concerns about the legislation. Sidney Shapiro of the Center for Progressive Reform has expressed concerns about the REINS Act, stating that it would make Congress the final arbiter of significant regulatory decisions. He believes that this would replace the benefits of agency rulemaking with the drawbacks of the legislative process, as Congress may lack the necessary expertise and could be influenced by special interests during the approval process. The REINS Act has raised constitutional concerns about the congressional approval process and the time it would take to approve major rules each year. Sally Katzen criticized the Act, stating it is not well-considered and could have significant adverse effects on the economy and society. The report provides information on the types of major rules subject to the Act, the number of major rules issued in recent years, and the issuing agencies. The report discusses major rules issued in recent years and the agencies responsible. It also examines why certain rules from 2010 were considered major under the CRA. The GAO database was used to determine the number of major rules and their economic effects. The GAO database is considered authoritative for final rules and major rules under the CRA. OIRA determines major rules based on economic effects exceeding $100 million. The GAO database provides links to major rule reports summarizing agencies' compliance with rulemaking requirements. CRS analyzed why rules were considered \"major\" under the CRA using GAO reports and rule preambles. Conclusions were based on available information and OIRA criteria. The Obama Administration issued an average of 66 major rules per year during its first two years in office, compared to 47 and 48 major rules per year during the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, respectively. Different counts for the number of major rules issued in recent years have been offered by various observers. In recent years, federal agencies have issued between 50 and 100 major rules per calendar year, with the number exceeding 80 for the first time in 2008. The Obama Administration averaged 66 major rules per year in its first two years, compared to 47 and 48 major rules per year during the Clinton and Bush Administrations, respectively. During calendar year 2010, federal agencies published 100 major final rules. A comparison of major rules between the last full year of the Bush Administration and the first full year of the Obama Administration shows varying results. The Bush Administration published 102 major rules in its last year and 168 major rules in the last two years, while the Obama Administration published 79 major rules in its first year and 175 major rules in the first two years. During the first full year of the Bush Administration, federal agencies published 54 major rules, and during the first full year of the Obama Administration, they published 79 major rules. In the first two full years of the Bush Administration, 103 major rules were published, compared to 175 major rules in the first two years of the Obama Administration. The number of major rules issued in a year does not strongly correlate with the number of final rules issued during that year. The number of major rules issued varied significantly by department and agency from 2004 to 2010, with the Department of Commerce publishing over 2,000 final rules during this period. The total number of final rules issued did not necessarily correlate with the number of major rules issued by an agency. The Department of Commerce published over 2,000 final rules from 2004 to 2010, but only 6 (0.2%) were considered major. In contrast, the Department of Health and Human Services issued 627 final rules during the same period, with 144 (23%) classified as major rules. The definition of a \"major rule\" includes significant economic impact, cost increases, and adverse effects on competition and employment. The OMB, agency rules, and OIRA define a \"major rule\" as having a $100 million annual impact on the economy through compliance costs, economic benefits, transfer payments, increased revenues, or consumer surplus. Consumer spending is a key factor in determining a \"major rule.\" A table illustrates the various definitions of a \"major rule\" based on the 100 major rules published in 2010. The rules were considered major if they had a $100 million annual effect on the economy, which includes regulatory costs, benefits, transfers, consumer surplus, and fees. Some rules fell into multiple categories, leading to multiple explanations provided overall. The number of explanations provided overall exceeds the number of rules issued, with various categories of explanations identified. Some rules were considered major due to $100 million in costs or benefits, while others involved transfers, increased costs, consumer surplus issues, or changes to fee structures. The 100 major rules issued in 2010 were considered major for various reasons, including their expected $100 million annual impact on the economy. Some rules involved transfers of funds, such as federal funds to recipients like grants, food stamps, and Medicare. In 2010, 23 federal transfer rules showed an increase in transfer payments. For example, a DOE rule on the \"Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income Persons\" reduced procedural burdens for evaluating applications from HUD assisted buildings, public housing programs, Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, and USDA Rural Development Program. The $5 billion in grants provided under this program by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 constituted transfer payments. Additionally, a USDA Food and Nutrition Service rule established new eligibility and certification requirements for food stamps to simplify program administration. USDA expects a new rule to simplify program administration and provide greater flexibility. The estimated transfer costs to the government would be $2.669 billion in FY2010 and $13.541 billion over five years. The Investing in Innovation Fund provides funding support to educational agencies and nonprofit organizations. The final rule would result in annual transfers of $643 million from the federal government. The DOD rule provided retroactive stop loss special pay to military members as authorized in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009. The rule had a $100 million annual impact on the economy. A CMS rule announced an annual update to the hospice wage index for FY2011, increasing federal hospice payments by $220 million in FY2010. The Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (OCIIO) implemented a rule to establish a temporary high-risk health insurance pool program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The program aimed to provide affordable health insurance coverage to uninsured individuals with pre-existing conditions. OCIIO estimated annual costs to be less than $2 million, with $5 billion in federal funds transferred to contractors for program administration from July 1, 2010, to December 31, 2013. Additionally, a Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) rule was issued on August 31, 2010, to implement the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' decision. The Department of Veterans Affairs implemented regulations confirming the link between herbicide exposure and certain diseases, estimating a total cost of $13.6 billion for FY2010. Additionally, the Farm Service Agency issued a rule for emergency assistance in specified counties for crop losses due to excessive moisture in 2009. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) published a rule for Special Community Disaster Loan (CDL) Program cancellations in the Gulf Coast region following Hurricanes Katrina. The program aimed to establish procedures and requirements for cancellations authorized by a specific act. The estimated cost for the Crop Assistance Program ranged from $137 million to $543 million, depending on producer applications in disaster counties. FEMA estimated up to $1.3 billion in loans, interest, and costs could be forgiven for communities in the Gulf Coast region following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. A CMS rule implemented a new payment system for Medicare outpatient end-stage renal disease dialysis facilities, resulting in a $200 million decrease in payments to all facilities for renal dialysis in 2011. The August 16, 2010, CMS rule revised Medicare hospital payment systems for acute care hospitals, updating rates and factors for operating and capital-related costs. It also updated payment policies for long-term care hospitals. The CMS revised the payment rates and policies for long-term care hospitals under the LTCH PPS, resulting in a $440 million decrease in operating payments and a $21 million decrease in capital payments for FY2011. Additionally, a DOD rule implemented changes to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program under the National Defense Authorization Act. The DOD implemented changes to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program to ensure pharmaceuticals are subject to Federal Ceiling Prices, resulting in cost reductions of $375 million to $560 million for Defense Health Program spending and $474 million to $707 million for Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund spending. Five major rules were expected to result in annual transfers of $100 million or more between population groups. The IRS, EBSA, and CMS jointly issued a rule requiring parity between mental health/substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits under group health plans. This rule replaced regulations implementing the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and was considered \"major\" due to a 0.4% increase in total health care premiums. The agencies estimated transfers of $25.6 billion over 10 years for mental health and substance use disorder benefits. A rule implemented in 2010 required coverage for children up to age 26. Another rule involved transfers of $3.5 to $6.9 billion from individuals with family health insurance coverage without dependents aged 19-25 to those with dependents. The Commodity Credit Corporation issued a major rule regarding non-federal transfers. Six rules from the Fish and Wildlife Service established hunting seasons for migratory birds, resulting in a consumer surplus of $205 million to $270 million. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued rules establishing hunting seasons for migratory birds, resulting in a consumer surplus of $205 million to $270 million. Other rules, such as those from the NRC and Department of State, implemented fee structures to fund government operations. For example, the NRC amended fees to recover approximately $912.2 million in FY2010, while the Department of State adjusted fees for Consular Services based on independent cost assessments. The Department of State adjusted the Schedule of Fees for Consular Services to ensure fees reflected the costs of providing services. This included increasing the Passport Book Application Services fee to $70 and the Passport Book Security Surcharge to $40, generating additional fees of $138 million and $239 million respectively. Additionally, a DHS rule adjusted the fee schedule for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to fully recover costs and maintain service levels, expected to provide an average of $209 million. The DHS rule adjusted the fee schedule for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to generate additional revenue of $209 million annually. This increased revenue would fund the full cost of processing immigration benefit applications and provide similar benefits to asylum and refugee applicants at no charge. Executive Order 12866 requires covered agencies to prepare a cost-benefit analysis for economically significant rules. The executive order requires agencies to consider both quantifiable and qualitative costs and benefits in regulatory decisions, prioritizing approaches that maximize net benefits across various factors. In 1999, 39 major rules were expected to have compliance costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually. In 1999, 39 major rules were expected to have compliance costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually. Of these rules, 20 were estimated to have costs and benefits exceeding $100 million. The agencies' estimates showed that regulatory benefits generally outweighed compliance costs, although there were cases where the ranges of estimated benefits and costs overlapped. This suggests that while most rules were likely to produce net benefits, there was a theoretical possibility that costs could exceed benefits. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a rule in 2010 establishing a new 1-hour standard for nitrogen dioxide. The estimated cost of the rule in 2020 was between $270 million and $510 million, with benefits ranging from $120 million to $580 million. This could result in either positive or negative net benefits. In 2010, the EPA issued a rule for emission standards and air pollutants for certain stationary engines, with estimated costs of $744 million in capital and $373 million annually. The rule's benefits were estimated between $850 million and $2.3 billion in 2013. If capital costs exceed $478 million in 2013, the total costs would surpass the lowest benefits. Additionally, a rule by the FAA in May 2010 added requirements for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out. The FAA issued a rule for ADS-B Out avionics requirements in certain airspace classes within the U.S. National Airspace System to enhance aircraft surveillance. The estimated benefits ranged from $6.8 billion to $8.5 billion, while costs were between $3.3 billion and $7.0 billion. Despite higher cost estimates, the benefits exceeded costs on average. The Department of Justice (DOJ) revised the regulation implementing Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to adopt enforceable accessibility standards consistent with guidelines from the Access Board. Compliance costs were estimated at $12.8 billion to $25.8 billion, with benefits ranging from $22.0 billion to $66.2 billion, showing that benefits exceeded costs. The Department of Justice revised the ADA regulation to adopt accessibility standards, with compliance costs estimated at $12.8 billion to $25.8 billion. Benefits ranged from $22.0 billion to $66.2 billion, showing that benefits exceeded costs. In 14 of the 20 rules with estimated costs and benefits of at least $100 million, regulatory benefits exceeded compliance costs. For example, a DOE rule on energy conservation for small electric motors had annualized costs of $264 million with benefits ranging from $867.5 million to $1.36 billion. The FDA rule issued in 2010 prohibited the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to individuals under 18, with estimated compliance costs between $174 million to $187 million in one-time costs, and $149 million to $185 million in annual operating costs. The rule aimed to prevent 60,000 early deaths, with health benefits valued between $9.2 billion to $43 billion per year. The FMSCA rule issued in 2010 introduced new performance standards for electronic on-board recorders (EOBRs) in commercial motor vehicles. The costs of the rule over a 10-year period were estimated at $139 million, while the benefits were determined to be $182 million annually, including safety benefits from reduced hours of service violations and fatigue-related crashes. The DOE and OSHA issued rules in 2010 to update energy conservation standards for residential water heaters and revise safety standards for cranes and derricks in construction. The DOE estimated annual benefits of $1.67 billion to $2.02 billion, with costs between $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion. OSHA's rule aimed to protect employees during crane and derrick use by specifying industry work practices. OSHA issued a rule in 2010 to update safety standards for cranes and derricks in construction, estimating total annualized costs of $154.1 million. The rule aimed to prevent injuries, fatalities, and property damage from tipovers, with total monetized benefits of $209.3 million. Additionally, the Federal Railroad Administration issued a rule on \"Positive Train Control Systems\" required on certain rail lines to improve safety. The Federal Railroad Administration enacted a rule to improve safety following rail accidents, estimating benefits at $440-674 million but costs at $9.5-13.2 billion. The agency noted the imbalance but was constrained by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. Compliance costs for other rules were estimated at $100 million or more with qualitative descriptions of benefits exceeding costs. The SEC and FDA issued rules with compliance costs exceeding $100 million, but benefits were deemed substantial, including increased investor confidence and more efficient allocation of assets. The FDA removed essential-use designations for substances in self-pressurized containers, leading to increased expenditures on inhaled medicines. The benefits were environmental and public health improvements from reducing chlorofluorocarbons emissions. Additionally, an October 29, 2010, ED rule aimed to improve integrity in certain programs, with potential annual paperwork-related costs exceeding $100 million. The ED rule aimed to improve integrity in certain programs with potential annual paperwork-related costs exceeding $100 million. The benefits of the regulations were qualitative descriptions such as updated administrative structures and enhanced reliability and security. Despite the high costs, ED believed that the benefits justified the burdens of compliance. Seventeen major rules published in 2010 were expected to result in a major increase in costs or prices for various entities. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) issued a rule in 2010 amending livestock regulations under the national organic program. The rule requires producers to maintain ruminant slaughter stock on pasture during the grazing season. Benefits include uniformity in application and reduced violations, while costs include increased production costs for some producers. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) issued a rule in 2010 requiring producers to maintain ruminant animals on pasture during the grazing season. The rule aims to ensure at least 30% dry matter intake for the animals. Additionally, a SEC rule addressed \"pay to play\" practices in investment advising, prohibiting advisers from providing services for compensation to government clients after making contributions to certain officials. This would incur costs for advisers to monitor contributions and establish compliance procedures. The SEC estimated initial compliance costs for firms of $2,352-$58,813 and ongoing expenses of $2,940-$235,250 per year. Advisers would incur annual costs of $200,246 and non-labor costs of $20,080,000. The rule aims to prevent market manipulation in advisory services to state and local governments. The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) requires providers of employee pension benefit plans to disclose information for assessing contracts, compensation, and conflicts of interest. The estimated annual cost of this rule from 2011 to 2020 is between $54.3 million and $58.7 million. Another rule implemented provisions of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008. The rule mandated mortgage loan originators at national banks to register with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, obtain a unique identifier, and provide it to consumers. National banks had to adopt procedures for compliance. Regulatory costs were not quantified in the rule. OMB prepares reports on benefits and costs of federal regulations in accordance with the \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act.\" The act defines a \"major rule\" as meeting certain criteria, with 66 major final rules reviewed in the most recent report issued in July 2010. In July 2010, OMB reviewed 66 major final rules from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2009. Independent regulatory agencies issued 11 additional major rules during this period, totaling 77 rules in the report. OMB categorized 33 rules as \"transfer rules\" involving income transfers from taxpayers to program beneficiaries, with estimates exceeding $100 million in 22 rules. In the 77 rules reviewed by OMB, 36 rules were categorized as \"major rules\" due to transfer estimates exceeding $100 million or the size of transfers involved. Additionally, in three DOI/FWS migratory bird hunting rules, the economic benefit estimates were more than $100 million. In 15 other major rules, only regulatory costs were estimated, with some rules having costs less than $100 million. In 15 of the remaining 16 rules, OMB provided monetized estimates of both benefits and costs. Only 3 rules had benefits approaching or exceeding $100 million, with none having costs at that level without corresponding benefits. 8 rules were expected to produce positive net benefits even with the highest cost estimates and lowest benefit estimates. The analysis of major rules issued during calendar years 2008 and 2009 showed that all 15 rules were expected to have positive net benefits. The REINS Act aims to give Congress more authority over agency rulemaking, particularly for rules with significant costs or benefits. The number of \"major rules\" imposing over $100 million in annual costs has increased in recent years. Supporters of the REINS Act argue that Congress should vote on these rules. There are misconceptions about the number and significance of major rules issued, with claims of a sharp increase during the Obama Administration. The Wall Street Journal reported an increase in major final rules issued by federal agencies in recent years, with 100 major rules published in 2010. Despite claims that all major rules have annual costs of at least $100 million, this report indicates otherwise. The report indicates that major rules published in recent years were categorized as \"major\" due to significant changes in federal transfer payments, rather than expected regulatory compliance costs or benefits. Some may argue that these transfers are actually regulatory costs, but they differ from compliance costs imposed on specific industries. Despite annual compliance cost estimates of $100 million or more for major rules, the estimated benefits often exceeded these costs. In 2010, agencies' highest compliance costs were lower than estimated benefits. Only one rule had benefits lower than costs, driven by specific statutory requirements. Many rules had monetized cost estimates but only qualitative benefit descriptions. Other rules had cost increases under $100 million or not monetized. The reasons for major rule classification varied beyond compliance costs, supporting congressional oversight of agency regulations. Congress may want to examine and approve regulatory transfers to ensure consistency with underlying statutes and sustainability in the budgetary environment. Fee structures for major rules should be appropriate to cover costs of governmental functions. Regulatory costs should not outweigh expected benefits to warrant congressional oversight of agency regulations. Congress may want to closely examine estimated regulatory costs and benefits of rules, potentially preventing rules with greater costs than benefits from taking effect. Congressional oversight may question the accuracy of estimated benefits and costs, leading to the decision not to approve certain rules. This oversight can be carried out through actions under the CRA. Congress may require specific expertise for oversight actions related to regulatory rules. H.R. 214 (112th Congress) proposes the creation of a Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis (CORA) to provide this expertise. The CORA director would be responsible for preparing reports on major rules, including potential benefits. The director of the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis (CORA) would prepare reports on major rules, including benefits, costs, and alternatives. Temporary experts and consultants can be hired for assistance. Agencies determine major rules based on factors like grant amounts or budget allocations. The NRC's June 16, 2010, major rule aimed to recover 90% of its FY2010 budget through fees. Congress may need to review statutory requirements to prevent future major rules with similar effects. Being more specific in statutes can help prevent burdensome federal regulations. Congress's allocation of regulatory responsibilities determines agency discretion and congressional control over regulations. When Congress mandates specific dates, elements, and procedures for regulations, it retains control over the policymaking process. However, detailed statutes can limit agencies from creating cost-effective regulations. For instance, the Federal Railroad Administration's rule on \"positive train control systems\" in 2010 had expected costs far outweighing benefits due to statutory constraints. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 does not allow flexibility in implementing positive train controls."
