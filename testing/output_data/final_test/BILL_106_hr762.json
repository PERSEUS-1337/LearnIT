The Congress recognizes lupus as a serious autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women, with three main types: systemic lupus, discoid lupus, and drug-induced lupus. Early detection and treatment are crucial as lupus can be fatal and difficult to diagnose due to its varied symptoms. African-American women are disproportionately affected by lupus. African-American women are three times more likely to develop lupus compared to white women. Between 1,400,000 and 2,000,000 Americans have been diagnosed with lupus, with many more undiagnosed cases. Current treatments can have damaging side effects, causing debilitating pain and fatigue for many sufferers. In fiscal year 1996, the National Institutes of Health allocated $33,000,000 for lupus research, less than one-half of 1 percent of their budget. Expansion and intensification of activities related to lupus research are being addressed in the Public Health Service Act. The Director of the Institute is tasked with expanding and intensifying research on lupus, coordinating with other national research institutes, and conducting programs to understand the causes and find a cure for lupus, particularly focusing on the elevated prevalence in women, including African-American women. The Director of the Institute is responsible for increasing research on lupus, focusing on the higher prevalence in women, including African-American women. This includes basic research on the disease's causes, epidemiological studies, improved diagnostic techniques, clinical research for new treatments, and education programs.
