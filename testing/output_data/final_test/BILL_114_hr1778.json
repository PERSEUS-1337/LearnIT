The Secretary will require tax return preparers to disclose fees charged for tax preparation and the average refund processing time for electronically filed returns. Enforcement actions may be taken against incompetent preparers. Tax return preparers subject to this section may face penalties if they are incompetent, disreputable, violate regulations, or intentionally mislead consumers.
