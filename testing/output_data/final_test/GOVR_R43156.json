    "content": "The THUD appropriations subcommittees draft bills for annual funding of DOT, HUD, and related agencies. DOT primarily provides grants and regulatory oversight for transportation infrastructure, except for aviation which is overseen by the FAA. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) primarily addresses housing issues for low-income households through rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance. Additionally, HUD utilizes block grant programs like HOME and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) to support housing and community development initiatives. Block Grants (CDBG) from HUD help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. Other grant programs assist homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. FHA insures mortgages for home buyers with low downpayments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Title III of the THUD appropriations bill funds transportation and housing agencies like the Access Board and the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. The THUD appropriations bill includes funding for NeighborWorks, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, and government conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill's funding is mainly in the form of contract authority, with discretionary funding making up only half of the total. For more details on the bill's composition, refer to Appendix B. The FY2013 funding for THUD agencies was complex, with funding initially provided through a continuing resolution at FY2012 levels. Congress later passed a consolidated appropriations act (P.L. 113-6) that generally maintained FY2012 funding levels for THUD agencies, with some exceptions. The final FY2013 funding was further reduced by an across-the-board sequestration required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. President Obama ordered the BCA-mandated sequestration on March 1, 2013, which required reductions in defense and nondefense discretionary funding as well as mandatory funding. The sequestration was a result of Congress failing to take action to reduce future deficits as required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. About two-thirds of total DOT spending is exempt from sequestration under Section 255 of P.L. 99-177. The sequestration ordered by President Obama in March 2013 resulted in a 2% reduction in DOT funding. Funding for DOT's programs and activities for FY2013 was cut by about $1.6 billion, affecting programs such as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts Program. Congress passed P.L. 113-9 to prevent disruptions in air travel by allowing the DOT to transfer funds to avoid furloughs of air traffic controllers. HUD's budget, mostly nondefense discretionary funding, faced a 5.1% reduction. The sequestration in 2013 led to a 5.1% reduction in funding for HUD's programs, totaling about $3 billion. The President's FY2014 budget requested $76.9 billion for DOT, including an additional $5 billion for passenger rail facilities. The House and Senate bills differed in their proposed funding amounts, with the Senate bill at $73.0 billion and the House bill at $70.3 billion. The major difference was the House bill's proposal to eliminate funding for passenger rail facilities. The House and Senate bills differed in funding amounts for various transportation programs. The House bill proposed cuts to programs such as TIGER grants, FAA, bridge repairs, Amtrak, and Federal Transit Administration. The President's FY2014 budget requested $35 billion for HUD, while Congress enacted $33.4 billion in FY2013. The House bill would have provided $28 billion in new budget authority. The House bill (H.R. 2610) proposed $28 billion in new budget authority, while the Senate bill (S. 1243) proposed over $35 billion. The Budget Control Act (BCA), as amended by ATRA, established discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021, with separate caps for defense and nondefense spending. Both House and Senate appropriations bills for FY2014 would violate the spending caps, potentially triggering a sequestration. The overall budget total exceeds the BCA cap, potentially leading to a budget enforcement sequestration. The House level sequestration would only impact defense spending, while the Senate level would affect both defense and non-defense spending. Funding trends for DOT and HUD from FY2008-FY2013 are shown in Table 3, excluding emergency and supplemental funding. Table 4 compares FY2014 appropriations for DOT to FY2013, with a total request of $76.9 billion, $5.6 billion more than FY2013 enacted funding. The Administration's FY2014 budget request for transportation was $5.6 billion more than FY2013 enacted funding, with an additional $5 billion for passenger rail grants. The House bill proposed $70.3 billion for FY2014, not supporting the Administration's request for passenger rail development funds. Additionally, the House bill would eliminate the $500 million TIGER grant program and rescind $237 million from FY2013 TIGER funding. The Senate bill for FY2014 transportation funding would provide $73.0 billion, differing from the Administration's request by $737 million. The bill does not include the additional $5 billion for passenger rail development. The highway trust fund has faced deficits in recent years, with Congress transferring $34.5 billion from the general fund to keep it solvent. The highway trust fund faced deficits in recent years, leading to transfers from the general fund to keep it solvent. The fund's shortfall is attributed to the stagnant federal gas tax since 1993, coupled with improved fuel efficiency and inflation reducing tax revenues. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act authorized additional transfers to maintain solvency through FY2014. The federal gas tax for gasoline is 18.3 cents per gallon and 24.3 cents for diesel. Inflation and increased fuel efficiency have reduced the tax's ability to support transportation infrastructure. The Congressional Budget Office predicts flat gasoline consumption through 2022 due to improved vehicle efficiency. Revenue for the highway trust fund is forecasted to be $41 billion in FY2022, falling short of necessary expenditures. Reports suggest that the nation is not investing enough in maintaining its infrastructure. Reports from various groups indicate that the nation is underinvesting in transportation infrastructure. Higher spending levels are recommended by both federal and state governments. Congress will need to decide on funding options for surface transportation when the current authorization expires. The viability of motor fuel taxes as the main revenue source is in question due to increasing fuel efficiency and electric vehicle usage. The Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program was created to address criticisms of federal transportation funding structure. It provides grants for projects with regional or national impacts, aiming to overcome limitations of current funding distribution methods. The TIGER program provides grants for projects of regional or national significance on a competitive basis, with recipients selected by the federal DOT. Congress has supported the program through annual DOT appropriations acts. The House bill for FY2014 would not provide funding for the program, citing lack of defined selection criteria. The Senate bill proposes $550 million in funding. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, funded at $237 million in FY2013, is aimed at maintaining air service to small communities by subsidizing costs. The Senate bill proposes $550 million for the program, which has seen costs double since FY2008 due to airline route reductions. Supporters argue that the program fulfills a commitment made during airline deregulation in 1978 and promotes economic development in rural areas. Critics point out the high subsidy cost per passenger and question the program's efficiency. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, funded at $237 million in FY2013, aims to maintain air service to small communities by subsidizing costs. The program has seen costs double since FY2008 due to airline route reductions. The Administration requested $146 million for the EAS program in FY2014, with a mandatory annual authorization of $100 million financed by overflight fees. Total funding provided for the EAS program in FY2013 was $193 million. The Administration's FY2014 request for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program includes $246 million, with support from both the House and Senate bills. They aim to eliminate the requirement for airlines to use 15-passenger aircraft for EAS communities to reduce program costs. The House bill also prohibits funding to communities with a subsidy per passenger greater than $500. Reforms in the current FAA authorization act aim to limit EAS program costs. The FY2014 appropriations act proposed limiting funding for communities receiving subsidies in FY2011 and coverage to airports with at least 10 passengers per day. The legislation also repealed the local participation program. A total of $6.4 billion was allocated for a National High Performance Rail System program, with $2.7 billion for a Current Passenger Rail Service grant program and $3.7 billion for a Rail Service Improvement grant program. Neither the House nor the Senate bill supported this proposal. The 111th Congress provided $10.5 billion for DOT's high speed and intercity passenger rail grant program, with $8 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Congress has not provided additional funding for this program since then, rescinding $400 million in FY2011. The program mainly funds intercity passenger rail service with speeds of 90 or 110 miles per hour, with California being the only state actively pursuing a high speed rail line. California is actively pursuing a high-speed rail line with federal funding of $3.6 billion, but the total cost is estimated at over $70 billion. Amtrak funding is proposed to be placed in a new Federal Railroad Administration account, with $2.7 billion requested. Amtrak received $1.344 billion in FY2013 after sequestration and requested $2.65 billion for FY2014. Amtrak requested $2.65 billion for FY2014, with additional funding for capital improvements and new rolling stock. The House bill would provide $950 million, while the Senate bill would provide $1.45 billion. The difference lies in capital funding. For operating assistance, the House bill would provide $350 million, the Senate bill up to $390 million. For capital assistance grants, the House bill would provide roughly $400 million, and the Senate bill roughly $860 million. Amtrak requested roughly $2 billion. Amtrak requested $2.65 billion for FY2014, with additional funding for capital improvements and new rolling stock. The majority of FTA's $10 billion funding is funneled to transit agencies through formula programs, with the largest discretionary grant program being the Capital Investment Grants programs. This program funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions to existing lines, with components based on project cost. Congress added a third component, Core Capacity, in the transit program reauthorization enacted in 2012. The Capital Investment Grants program received $1.85 billion in FY2013 after sequestration, leading to a funding reduction that prevented new grants for the first time in 20 years. For FY2014, the Administration requested $1.98 billion, with the House bill proposing $1.82 billion and the Senate bill $1.94 billion. Existing grant agreements will account for $1.71 billion. The federal share for New Starts projects can be up to 80%, but a provision in DOT appropriations acts since FY2002 limits it to 60%. Critics argue this favors highway projects over public transportation. Advocates say the provision allows FTA to support more projects with limited funding. The FTA supports more projects with limited funding by requiring a higher local match. Table 6 compares FY2014 appropriations proposals for HUD to FY2013 enacted levels, pre and post-sequester. The FHA's single-family mortgage insurance program is funded through the MMI Fund, supported by borrower fees, not appropriations. The MMI Fund is funded by borrower fees, not appropriations, with permanent budget authority to draw funds from Treasury if needed. Increased mortgage defaults and falling house prices have raised expected future losses, reducing available funds for unexpected losses. The FY2014 budget includes $943 million in mandatory funding for the MMI Fund. The MMI Fund transferred funds from its secondary reserve account to the primary reserve account to cover expected future losses on insured loans. $1.7 billion was drawn from Treasury at the end of FY2013 for this purpose, marking the first time funds were needed from Treasury. Some localities are considering using eminent domain to purchase mortgages with negative equity at current market values, providing a new mortgage to borrowers for a lower principal amount. This proposal has sparked debate among policy makers, with concerns raised about undermining private contracts and future mortgage lending. Government agencies, like FHA, have been called upon to clarify their policies if such programs are adopted. The House committee report expressed concerns over the potential use of eminent domain. The House committee report (H.Rept. 113-136) and the Senate committee report (S.Rept. 113-45) expressed concerns over the possible use of eminent domain to purchase negative equity mortgages. The Community Development Fund (CDF) supports various community development activities, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The Administration requested $3.143 billion for Community Development Fund (CDF) activities in FY2014, including $2.798 billion for CDBG formula grants. The total amount available for CDF in FY2013 was approximately $3.135 billion. The requested amount is $8 million more than the FY2013 appropriation, $152 million less than the Senate recommendation, and $1.446 billion more than the House recommendation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.150 billion for CDBG formula grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee-passed bill recommended $3.150 billion for CDBG formula grants, exceeding the President's request by $352 million. The House Appropriations Committee's H.R. 2610 recommended $1.637 billion for CDBG formula grants, $1.161 billion less than the President's request and $1.513 billion less than the Senate's recommendation. S. 1243 included $75 million for Regional Integration Planning Grants, consistent with the Administration's request. The Administration proposed limiting CDBG formula grants to communities meeting a minimum grant allocation. The President's proposal for CDBG entitlement communities includes a minimum grant amount based on population criteria, which would eliminate 239 communities from receiving funds. The proposal also aims to phase out grandfathering provisions, potentially affecting an additional 57 communities. The HUD proposal to end grandfathering for CDBG entitlement communities would impact communities not meeting the population threshold. Some communities could enter joint agreements with urban counties or participate in the state-administered CDBG program. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the Administration's proposal, as shown in Table 7 of the appropriations bill. NeighborWorks America supports community revitalization efforts. NeighborWorks America is a national network supporting community revitalization and affordable housing through grants, training, and technical assistance. They also administer the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) to address high foreclosure rates. The President's FY2014 budget allocated $204 million for NeighborWorks, with $127 million for traditional activities and $77 million for NFMCP, compared to $204 million in FY2013. The House committee proposed $185 million for NeighborWorks, with $127 million for traditional activities and $58 million for NFMCP. The Senate committee suggested $215 million, with $138 million for traditional activities and $77 million for NFMCP. The House committee justified the reduction in NFMCP funding by citing decreasing foreclosure rates, while the Senate committee believed continued funding was necessary due to high historical foreclosure levels. The federal government experienced a funding lapse in FY2014, resulting in a partial government shutdown. The lapse ended when the Continuing Appropriations Act was signed into law on October 17, 2013. This shutdown included the suspension of non-essential government services and the furlough of federal employees. Funding was provided through January 15, 2014, with further appropriations acts needed to avoid another gap. All federal employees were retroactively paid for the shutdown period. Federal agencies were required to submit contingency plans detailing the impacts of the shutdown, which services would continue, and which employees would be exempted. The Department of Transportation and Department of Housing and Urban Development's shutdown contingency plans can be accessed online. THUD appropriations bills may have different totals reported by various sources. The THUD appropriations bills include different funding mechanisms and savings, resulting in varying figures reported for the same programs. Most programs in the bill are funded through regular discretionary appropriations from the general fund of the Treasury. Advance appropriations and emergency appropriations are also provided in some cases. Emergency appropriations are provided in response to disasters, often through supplemental spending bills. These funds come from the general fund and are in addition to regular annual appropriations. The Department of Transportation's budget mainly comes from contract authority, derived from federal trust fund resources like the highway trust fund and airport trust fund. Congressional appropriators have limits on non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide. Congressional appropriators are subject to limits on non-emergency discretionary funding. Ways to stay within these limits include appropriating no more than the allocated amount in the annual appropriation act or offsetting higher funding levels. Regular annual appropriations for the THUD bill are offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts from federal agency fees. Appropriations Committee subcommittees receive \"302(b) allocations\" that include net discretionary budget authority. The THUD figure includes net discretionary budget authority, excluding contract authority from trust funds. Appropriations subcommittees allocate funds mainly to HUD, but contract authority is not included in the allocations. The total resources available to the Department of Transportation (DOT) are greater than those available to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) due to factors like rescissions and offsets. These budget savings can impact the amount of new appropriations provided by the THUD subcommittees each year, as they reduce the \"cost\" of providing additional appropriations. The level of these savings can vary annually, affecting the cost of providing the same level of appropriations."
