    "content": "The Act titled \"Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act of 2010\" or \"ConTACT Act of 2010\" introduces guidelines for managing concussions in school-aged children under section 317U of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will establish concussion management guidelines for school-aged children, including prevention, identification, treatment, and return-to-play standards after a concussion. A conference will be convened with medical, athletic, and educational stakeholders to assist in guideline establishment. Grants to states will be provided after the guidelines are established. The Secretary may make grants to States for collecting information on concussions among school-aged children, ensuring guideline implementation, funding testing, and other specified activities. Grant eligibility requires adherence to guidelines. To be eligible for a grant, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information, including strategies for disseminating and implementing concussion guidelines. The Secretary requires States receiving grants to periodically provide data on concussions among school-aged children and utilize expertise from sports associations for implementing concussion guidelines. The Secretary coordinates with other federal departments and agencies in carrying out activities related to concussions and traumatic brain injuries. Reports on the implementation of subsection (a) and a grant program with data collection are required within specific timeframes. The Secretary will report to Congress on the implementation of concussion management guidelines, including the number of states and target entities following them, and data on concussions among school-aged children. The term `return to play' refers to a school-aged child returning to sports after a concussion. School-aged children are defined as individuals aged 5 to 18. `Second impact syndrome' is when a concussion occurs while healing from a previous one. The `Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The term `State' includes all 50 states and the District of Columbia. A `target entity' is an elementary school. The term 'target entity' refers to an elementary school, secondary school, or youth sports association. The House of Representatives passed the legislation on September 30, 2010, with Lorraine C. Miller as the Clerk."
