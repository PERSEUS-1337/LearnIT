    "content": "The International Donors Conference on Haiti in 2004 aimed to secure financial support for the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF) developed by the interim Haitian government and international organizations. The ICF outlines Haiti's priority needs and programs for 2004-2006, focusing on stabilization and a participatory process. The Interim Cooperation Framework aimed to address Haiti's needs totaling $1.37 billion, seeking $924 million through a donors conference. International organizations and governments pledged $1.085 billion over two years to help rebuild infrastructure and improve services. Aristide's government collapsed amidst protests and pressure, leading to his exile in South Africa. An interim government was established in Haiti after Aristide went into exile, with Chief Justice Boniface Alexandre assuming the Presidency. The United Nations authorized an international force to restore order, replaced by a U.N. peacekeeping force in June 2004. Gerard LaTortue became Prime Minister through a compromise process. Elections were postponed multiple times, with presidential and legislative elections scheduled for December 27 and runoff elections for January 31, 2006. Political tensions, violence, and human rights violations continue to pose challenges. The Interim Cooperation Framework in Haiti faces challenges due to political tensions, violence, and human rights violations, hindering the organization of free and fair elections. Congressional concerns focus on the disbursement rate of funds and the effectiveness of assistance provided. The framework was developed in collaboration with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. The Interim Cooperation Framework in Haiti was developed with the collaboration of various international organizations and governments. A Joint Committee oversees the implementation and monitoring of the plan, which involves members from the Haitian government, civil society, and donor community. The Interim Cooperation Framework in Haiti is overseen by a Joint Committee consisting of members from the Haitian government, civil society, and donor community. The committee conducts oversight through sectoral tables led by Haitian government and donor counterparts, focusing on priority needs and projects in four broad categories. Meetings are held to discuss progress, shortfalls, and fund reallocations to address emerging priorities. The Interim Cooperation Framework in Haiti focuses on four strategic axes: political governance, economic governance, economic recovery, and access to basic services. Axis 1 aims to strengthen political governance and national dialogue, addressing Haiti's history of violent and authoritarian politics since independence in 1804. The 1987 constitution in Haiti established democratic institutions, including two legislative chambers, an independent judiciary, and an electoral council for overseeing elections. However, democratic processes have been undermined by authoritarian traditions, leading to President Aristide's ousting in 1991 and subsequent struggles to maintain stable governance and credible elections. The judicial system is described as \"largely moribund\" and not fully respected in practice, with no fully legitimate parliament recognized since 1997. Rights Report for 2004 criticizes Haiti's judicial system as \"largely moribund\" and influenced by the executive and legislative branches. Political parties are seen as self-serving, leading to a polarized society. Observers blame both the government and opposition for violence and lack of negotiation. Priorities include enhancing security, police professionalization, and disarming illegal armed groups. MINUSTAH's mission in Haiti includes demobilizing and disarming armed groups, promoting justice and human rights, and supporting the electoral process. Priorities include combating impunity, strengthening judicial independence, and holding free and credible elections. Cooperation with NGOs is also emphasized for the protection of human rights. The UN mission (MINUSTAH) and the OAS support Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council in organizing free, credible elections. The dates for the presidential and legislative elections have been changed multiple times. National dialogue is a priority to promote reconciliation and find consensus-based solutions to local and national issues. The Interim Cooperation Framework involves various sectors in creating development plans for Haiti. The international community aims to establish a framework for national dialogue on development priorities in Haiti. Economic governance and institutional development are key focuses, with a history of misuse of public funds leading to a \"kleptocracy.\" The ICF highlights the urgent need for reforms to improve economic governance, including transparency in the budget process and better management of public finances. The international community aims to establish a framework for national dialogue on development priorities in Haiti, focusing on economic governance and institutional development. The priorities include expanding the tax base, improving public fund allocation, attacking corruption, strengthening institutional capacities, improving human resources in public administration, and promoting economic recovery in the poorest country in the western hemisphere. Haiti is ranked 150th among 175 countries in the U.N.'s Human Development Index, with an economy in decline. To promote economic recovery, the country needs to focus on establishing macro-economic stability, rehabilitating infrastructure, developing the private sector, improving agricultural production, and protecting the environment. Programs are in place to contain inflation and rehabilitate key public services in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund. The macroeconomic program aims to contain inflation at 14%, rehabilitate public facilities, and provide essential services in Haiti. Priorities include improving electricity production and distribution, developing the private sector, creating jobs through labor programs, and promoting micro-finance. The framework in Haiti focuses on creating jobs through labor programs and promoting micro-finance, with a goal of creating 687,000 jobs from 2004-2006 and increasing access to micro-credit, especially for women. In agriculture, priorities include providing vaccinations, disease control, repairing farm equipment, and distributing tools and seed, along with technical assistance in agricultural techniques. The report also recommends rehabilitating the Ministry of Agriculture and training staff and farmers organizations for effective interventions. In Haiti, 80% of farmers struggle to meet basic food needs. The transportation infrastructure, including roads and ports, is in dire need of investment and maintenance. Currently, only 5% of roads are in good condition, and improvements are necessary to ensure continuity of port and aviation activities. The program in Haiti focuses on promoting sustainable use of natural resources, halting land degradation, and supporting disaster management plans to break the cycle of poverty and vulnerability to natural disasters. It aims to improve access to basic services and enhance port management for economic development. Axis 4 of the program in Haiti aims to improve access to basic services, such as sanitation and water sources, as well as addressing the lack of healthcare resources. Priorities include emergency humanitarian aid and post-disaster relief in response to crises like the collapse of the Aristide government in 2004 and armed violence. These conditions leave the majority of the population vulnerable to disease and malnutrition, without educational resources or social safety nets. Haiti faces challenges with limited access to social services and food, making humanitarian aid urgent. The country is vulnerable to natural disasters, requiring long-term reconstruction efforts. Strengthening governmental authorities to assist vulnerable groups is crucial. The International Crisis Group (ICF) emphasizes the need for assessing humanitarian needs periodically and developing a rehabilitation and reconstruction program with a preventative approach for flood-affected areas in Haiti. Priority areas include improving access to potable water and sanitation, as over half of Haitians lack access to improved water sources. The ICF emphasizes improving access to potable water and healthcare in Haiti, particularly for vulnerable groups like children, pregnant women, and HIV/AIDS-infected individuals. They call for restarting priority health programs, regulating drug prices, and establishing a national healthcare system. The ICF in Haiti focuses on improving access to education, including basic, professional, and university levels. Programs aim to enhance school conditions, reduce costs for vulnerable groups, improve teacher training, and increase literacy programs. Currently, half a million children lack basic education, with only 35% completing 5th grade. The government is urged to improve communication with the private sector, which provides 80% of primary education. The programs in Haiti aim to improve access to education at all levels, including professional and university education. Efforts are focused on enhancing school conditions, reducing costs for vulnerable groups, improving teacher training, and increasing literacy programs. The private sector currently provides 80% of primary education. Initiatives for professional training include strengthening government institutions, identifying workforce training needs, and recruiting personnel. Higher education initiatives aim to reduce dropout rates, provide scholarships and food services, improve access and quality of programs, and repair damage to universities from political violence in 2004. The dropout rate in higher education in Haiti is high, possibly due to political upheaval damaging university facilities. The Inter-American Development Bank calls for focusing on vulnerable youth sectors and promoting social cohesion through sports. Priorities include strengthening culture and media for a pluralist and democratic society. The role of culture and media in promoting a pluralist and democratic society in Haiti includes strengthening broadcast capacities for supporting elections, integrating marginalized groups, protecting cultural heritage, and supporting artisans. Other priorities involve addressing food insecurity and upgrading slums through institutional and community improvements. The urban population in Haiti has been growing rapidly, with a 5% annual increase compared to the general population growth of 2% from 1982 to 2003. The head of MINUSTAH emphasizes the need to improve living conditions in the slums to reduce violence and build confidence. Solid waste management is a priority, including involving the private sector and citizens, creating waste treatment sites, and strengthening existing institutions. The ICF estimates that less than 30% of solid waste is properly managed. The ICF estimates that less than 30% of solid waste is removed in metropolitan Port-au-Prince, with most waste being dumped in rivers in other cities. Priority areas for social protection include promoting human rights, reducing malnutrition, increasing access to healthcare, and providing social assistance to vulnerable groups. Assistance provided by the Haitian government is described as fragmented and scattered. The Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF) criticizes the Haitian government's assistance as fragmented and without significant impact. Social protection services are mainly provided by NGOs, but resources are limited. The ICF is praised for its inclusive nature and consultation with various sectors. It aims to bridge short-, medium-, and long-term development efforts, offering immediate aid, job creation, and basic services. The strategy is designed to extend beyond the interim government for six months. The Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF) aims to strengthen national institutions in Haiti to improve government capacity and transparency. Past interventions have been criticized for not building sustainable institutions or training Haitians for governance after international actors leave. The ICF is working towards a Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2006-2009 to support the newly elected government and address long-term development challenges. The Interim Cooperation Framework in Haiti aims to enhance government capacity by strengthening institutions and creating new ones. Absorptive capacity must be gradually improved to prevent system collapse. Some suggest international actors should play a stronger role until Haitian institutions are more capable. Suggestions include making Haiti an international protectorate or forming a multilateral donor commission for oversight and accountability. Some observers express concern that the elections system in Haiti relies too heavily on technology unsuitable for the country's conditions, where electricity is unreliable and half the population is illiterate. They argue that current conditions are not conducive to free, fair, and safe elections, and suggest postponing the vote until there is greater security and all parties can participate freely. Former President Aristide's party, the Lavalas Family, has registered to participate in the elections. Former President Aristide's party, the Lavalas Family, has registered to participate in the elections, but some members are calling for a boycott due to political persecution. Others argue that fair and credible elections are crucial for stability. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice emphasized the need for a new President to be inaugurated on February 7 for Haiti's stability, citing technical obstacles to meeting this date. The international community must support Haiti in accelerating election preparations and ensuring free, fair, and inclusive elections. Long-term commitment is needed to sustain changes under the Interim Cooperation Framework, with plans for a post-election stabilization program to address issues like insecurity. International organizations and governments pledged $1.085 billion at the International Donors Conference in July 2004 to support Haiti's transition from the Aristide government. The funds were to be distributed over almost two and a half years, with priorities outlined for where the funds would be directed. Total pledges and disbursements by countries and institutions were shown in tables and graphs as of March 2005. The International Donors Conference in July 2004 pledged $1.085 billion to support Haiti's transition from the Aristide government. Various countries and institutions made pledges, with some contributing to other international funds as well. Tables showed pledges and disbursements as of October 2004. The United States pledged $230 million in aid to Haiti at the 2004 Donors Conference, with allocations for job creation, government infrastructure, security, humanitarian aid, and elections support. The original pledge was exceeded, with assistance for FY2005 initially set at $52 million. The United States pledged $230 million in aid to Haiti at the 2004 Donors Conference, with allocations for job creation, government infrastructure, security, humanitarian aid, and elections support. Assistance for FY2005 was increased to about $177 million, with a request for $152 million for FY2006. Additional funding from Congress and emergency supplemental appropriations also support Haiti under the Interim Cooperation Framework. Legislation related to funding of U.S. assistance to Haiti includes various acts such as the Haiti Economic and Infrastructure Reconstruction Act, the New Partnership for Haiti Act, the Jubilee Act, and the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act, among others. Some donors made pledges at the International Donors Conference for Haiti, which are not detailed on World Bank charts. Not all donors pledged specific monetary amounts, some offered humanitarian assistance, troops for MINUSTAH, or technical assistance. Chile, for example, mentioned its willingness to provide technical assistance. Chile and Argentina are collaborating with other countries and international organizations to support MINUSTAH in Haiti. Argentina is sending 600 armed forces members and offering legal and humanitarian assistance through the Cascos Blancos organization. The Cascos Blancos organization will provide a volunteer force for humanitarian missions in Haiti. Belgium is contributing 593,000 euros annually for various programs in Haiti. Brazil has deployed over 1,200 soldiers for MINUSTAH and offers technical assistance. Chile, Greece, and Norway are providing assistance to Haiti through various means such as sending military personnel, financial contributions, and technical support for projects like agricultural rehabilitation and HIV diagnosis. Several countries, including Greece, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, have pledged financial support to Haiti for various projects and humanitarian efforts. Norway has organized political dialogue and allocated funds, the UK provided support for civil unrest and flooding, and Switzerland prioritized water and sanitation projects and humanitarian aid. Switzerland has pledged financial support for sanitation projects, humanitarian aid, and Swiss NGOs working on water, sanitation, education, and health in Haiti. An additional $1.0 - $1.5 million may be provided for a new project in environmental management. Progress has been made in the Interim Cooperation Framework, with a mid-way assessment expected by the end of 2005. In terms of political governance and national dialogue, efforts have been made to register Haitian citizens to vote for upcoming elections, which are currently scheduled for December 11 or 18, 2005. The upcoming elections in Haiti are scheduled for December 11 or 18, 2005, with a new government set to be inaugurated on February 7, 2006. Challenges in organizing the elections include the need for more voter registration, hiring election supervisors and poll workers, and identifying polling stations. The electoral council rejected 22 out of 54 presidential candidates, leading to disputes that need to be resolved by the Haitian Supreme Court. Efforts have been made to promote national dialogue and civic action in local communities to increase citizen participation in decision-making. Governance structures have been strengthened to increase citizens' participation in decision-making processes, despite concerns about violence and human rights violations hindering dialogue. Anti-corruption units have been established, transparency and procurement have improved, and discretionary spending has been reduced by the interim government in Haiti. Cooperation with international financial institutions has also been enhanced. Improved cooperation between Haiti and international financial institutions, including clearing arrears with aid from donors. The interim government granted the executive branch authority to incur debt, leading to economic recovery with well-designed budgets contributing to macroeconomic stability. Donors primarily provide grants rather than loans, and external trade has returned to pre-crisis levels with stable currency and declining inflation. The gourde remains stable, inflation is decreasing, and reserves are increasing. Economic reforms include fiscal discipline, cleaning up state-owned utilities, and reducing corruption. Progress in basic services includes road rehabilitation, clean water access for 250,000 people, and committee establishment. The curr_chunk discusses various improvements in Haiti, such as new roads, clean water access for 250,000 people, health services for 400,000 people, scholarships for children, waste removal, and school rehabilitation. Concerns exist about the sustainability of these improvements, with examples like the restoration of electricity service falling after subsidies ended. Reforms like fiscal discipline and fighting corruption require political will to be carried out effectively. Political will to implement reform in Haiti has been difficult to maintain. Congressional concerns are addressed in the Interim Cooperative Framework, focusing on democratic governance, fund transparency, and poverty reduction. Concerns about the slow disbursement of funds and aid effectiveness were raised after the Donors Conference. Interim President Alexandre urged for quicker fund release, stating Haiti was on the brink of crisis. The rate of disbursement of pledged funding for Haiti has improved since the initial slowness, with around $400 million disbursed by May and an estimated $500 million by July 2005. Disbursements are spread out over a two-year period, with delays due to program design and authorization processes. Disbursements have been uneven among donors. Some donors have disbursed funds unevenly, with the United States and Canada leading in disbursements. Japan has exceeded its pledged amount. International financial institutions like the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank aimed to commit funds over two years, anticipating delays in program implementation. Due to a lack of transparent accounting by Haitian governments, donors are cautious about transferring funds to the current government, leading to reliance on non-governmental organizations for funding distribution. The interim government of Haiti also bears responsibility for challenges in disbursing pledged funds. The interim government of Haiti faces challenges in disbursing pledged funds, with delays in developing a spending plan for donors' funds. The government's capacity to absorb assistance and execute development plans is also a concern, as efforts are made to promote good economic governance and strengthen institutions to increase donor confidence. The ongoing political instability in Haiti is hindering the disbursement of donor funds and execution of aid programs. Violence, including frequent kidnappings, has created a hostile environment for aid workers and ordinary citizens, disrupting daily life and increasing the need for social and health services. The U.S. State Department has issued travel warnings due to the volatile security situation. The State Department warns of the volatile security situation in Haiti, hindering aid programs and creating an uncertain atmosphere for elections. Concerns include political persecution and the need for national reconciliation through dialogue and elections. Congressional scrutiny focuses on the effectiveness of donor funds in Haiti. Some Members argue for more US funding to reduce poverty, improve government accountability, and prevent migration. Donors support Haiti's transition under the Interim Cooperation Framework, emphasizing long-term commitment for sustainable changes. Juan Gabriel Valdes, head of MINUSTAH, announced plans for a post-election stabilization program in Haiti during the most recent meeting in October 2005. The international community is urged to make a long-term commitment to Haitian development to address issues like insecurity."
