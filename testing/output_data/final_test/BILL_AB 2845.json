    "title": "AB 2845",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the need for safe school environments for all pupils, especially those of Muslim, Sikh, or South Asian descent who face harassment. Reports show a high percentage of these pupils experiencing bullying, prompting federal government intervention through the Asian American and Pacific Islander Bullying Prevention Task Force. The need for safe school environments for pupils facing harassment, particularly those of Muslim, Sikh, or South Asian descent, is acknowledged. Studies show that bullying negatively impacts academic performance and mental health. Pupils facing hate-based bias do not report incidents due to lack of trust in school staff. Creating supportive learning environments improves pupil performance. The US Department of Education offers resources to support pupils facing bullying based on religion, race, or national origin. The Legislature encourages schools to provide resources for educating staff on supporting Muslim, Sikh, and other pupils facing bias and bullying. Section 234.1 of the Education Code is amended to monitor adherence to regulations and assess local educational agencies. The policy adopted prohibits discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on various characteristics. It applies to all school activities and attendance within the jurisdiction of the school district superintendent. The policy adopted includes a process for receiving and investigating complaints of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on various characteristics. It requires immediate intervention by school personnel witnessing such acts and establishes a timeline for resolving complaints. An appeal process is available for complainants who disagree with the resolution of a filed complaint. Forms related to this process must be translated. Antidiscrimination policies, including complaint filing information, must be publicized and translated for pupils, parents, employees, and the general public. Provided to certificated schoolsite employees serving grades 7-12, information on resources for LGBTQ pupils and those facing bias or bullying based on religious affiliation. Resources for LGBTQ and at-risk pupils include schoolsite resources like peer support clubs, counseling services, staff training, and inclusive curriculum materials. Community resources may involve community-based organizations and health providers with experience in supporting these pupils. The policy requires posting in schools and offices, documenting complaints, protecting complainants from retaliation, appointing a compliance officer, and not mandating engagement with religious institutions. The Education Code is amended to require the Superintendent to provide a list of statewide resources for youth affected by discrimination, harassment, bullying, gang violence, gun violence, and trauma on the department's website and to school districts."
