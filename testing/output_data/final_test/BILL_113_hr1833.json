    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The Act may be cited as the \"Improving the Juvenile Justice System for Girls Act of 2013.\" Congress finds that the proportion of girls entering the justice system has increased steadily, with many having histories of violence. Girls' pathways into juvenile justice involvement are different from boys', with a higher proportion of nonviolent status offenders. A study by the Oregon Social Learning Center found that girls in juvenile justice have their first sexual encounter at an average age of 6.75. The trauma of untreated physical and sexual abuse leads to various negative outcomes such as higher mortality rates, psychiatric problems, dysfunctional relationships, poor educational achievement, substance abuse, and reliance on social services. Girls in the juvenile justice system face equal or higher risks compared to non-delinquent girls. Girls in the juvenile justice system have high rates of mental health issues. Gender-responsive, strength-based programming with trauma-informed care is effective in preventing juvenile offenses and reducing recidivism. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 is being amended to include Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs. This amendment updates definitions in section 502. The term 'State advisory group' refers to the advisory group appointed by the chief executive officer of a State under a specific plan. 'Gender-responsive services' are practices or services that address the needs of girls in the juvenile justice system comprehensively. The term 'trauma-specific services' refers to services that address the effects of trauma on individuals, including neurological, biological, psychological, and social aspects. These services are essential for addressing the common experiences of girls in the juvenile justice system, such as abuse, violence, broken family relationships, and substance abuse, as well as the social and cultural factors affecting at-risk girls. The text chunk discusses the importance of trauma-specific services for victims, including resources on trauma exposure, trauma treatment, strengthening resilience, trauma-informed therapeutic interventions, and continuity of care. The text chunk introduces gender-responsive services and outlines how funds under this section will increase the effectiveness of the plan and activities. The text chunk modifies section 505 by updating the fiscal years covered from 2004-2008 to 2014-2019."
