    "content": "Two different SAFE Acts introduced in the House and Senate address issues related to the USA PATRIOT Act, including FISA wiretaps, search warrants, library exemptions, and the definition of \"domestic terrorism.\" The bills are titled the Security and Freedom Ensured Act of 2005 (H.R. 1526) and the Security and Freedom Enhancement Act of 2005 (S. 737). The \"SAFE Act\" proposed an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) regarding electronic surveillance orders. Before 9/11, FISA orders specified the target's identity or description, as well as the nature and location of surveillance facilities. The USA PATRIOT Act and the intelligence authorization act for 2002 temporarily altered the requirements for FISA surveillance orders, allowing for general commands for third-party assistance without identifying specific individuals. This change was made to address targets who regularly changed communication methods to evade surveillance. The orders may now simply describe the target without specifying their identity or the locations being surveilled. The USA PATRIOT Act and the intelligence authorization act for 2002 temporarily altered the requirements for FISA surveillance orders, allowing for general commands for third-party assistance without identifying specific individuals. Both House and Senate bills now require FISA surveillance orders to identify either the target or the facilities/places targeted. If the facilities/places cannot be identified, surveillance is limited to times when the target is present. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring officers to knock and announce their purpose before executing a search warrant. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, officers were instructed to leave a notice of the search and an inventory of seized items at the search location. Federal law allows delayed notification to customers of government access to their communications stored with service providers, with limits on delays for adverse consequences. The lower federal appellate courts were divided on whether failure to provide notification should be considered a violation of the Rule or a constitutional violation, and on how long notification could be postponed in exigent circumstances. The USA PATRIOT Act allows delayed notification of search warrants or court orders under certain adverse conditions, limiting the grounds to exigent circumstances and capping the delay period at 7 days. The bills direct the Attorney General to issue a public report every six months documenting the number of notify postponements and extensions requested and granted or denied, with the possibility of 21-day extensions. The report should also identify the nature of crimes that have led to these requests. Before the USA PATRIOT Act, FISA allowed judges to grant FBI access to certain business records for gathering foreign intelligence or investigating terrorism based on specific facts. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow FBI access to business records without specific facts if seeking foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism. Orders could be issued to various businesses, with recipients prohibited from disclosing them except as necessary for access. Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows for access to business records for foreign intelligence or counterterrorism purposes, with recipients protected from civil liability. The orders must be based on specific reasons to believe the records are related to a foreign power. The Senate bill adds restrictions to ensure the orders are not overly broad and include notice of recipient rights. The Senate bill adds oversight provisions for the House and Senate Judiciary Committees regarding the FBI's use of FISA access orders. It also includes exceptions and time limits for nondisclosure, a procedure for recipients to challenge orders, and use provisions similar to FISA surveillance orders. H.R. 1526 does not have these provisions. Federal intelligence officials have the power to demand information directly under four statutes. The FBI can demand information directly under four statutes without involving a FISA court judge. These statutes include requests for customer information from communication service providers, financial institutions, and consumer reporting agencies. The statutes lack enforcement mechanisms, do not allow recipients to modify or challenge requests, and prohibit disclosure of the requests. The USA PATRIOT Act amended four provisions allowing the FBI to issue national security letters without involving a FISA court judge. The amendments removed the requirement for the request to pertain to a foreign power, allowed any FBI agent to issue the request, changed the standard for issuance, and prohibited access based solely on First Amendment rights. One federal district court found that the national security letter authority violated the Fourth and First Amendments due to lack of judicial supervision and a permanent gag order. H.R. 1526 exempts libraries from 18 U.S.C. 2709 and adds an expiration date to certain USA PATRIOT Act provisions. S. 737 does not make the same addition. S. 737 rewrites national security letter statutes, setting specific criteria for information requests, imposing time limits on gag orders, allowing recipients to challenge requests in court, and holding letters to standards similar to grand jury subpoenas in espionage cases. The revised national security letter statutes under S. 737 set criteria for information requests, impose time limits on gag orders, allow recipients to challenge requests in court, and establish procedures for use and suppression of evidence generated by the letters. Federal law defines \"federal crimes of terrorism\" and \"domestic terrorism\" to address activities involving acts dangerous to human life that violate criminal laws. The definition of domestic terrorism and federal crimes of terrorism in the United States involves acts intended to intimidate or coerce civilians, influence government policy, or affect government conduct through mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping within the country's jurisdiction. These terms are used for cross-reference purposes and have implications for prosecution and asset confiscation related to terrorism activities. The bills aim to merge the definitions of domestic terrorism in federal law, emphasizing that state terrorism laws can still be enforced. Trap and trace devices and pen registers track phone calls and are deemed legal by the Supreme Court. The USA PATRIOT Act amended procedures for trap and trace devices and pen registers in law enforcement and FISA contexts, including e-mail and Internet communications. The FISA amendment prohibits targeting individuals based solely on First Amendment rights and expires in 2005. The FISA amendment expires in 2005, while the law enforcement amendment does not. Housebill H.R. 1526 adds the law enforcement amendment to the list of USA PATRIOT Act sections expiring in 2005. Senate bill S. 737 amends FISA and law enforcement procedures, requiring specific facts for device installation, expanding reporting requirements, and establishing a notice provision. The USA PATRIOT Act sections, including delayed notification of search warrants, trap and trace devices, and terrorism search warrants, are set to expire on December 31, 2005, under H.R. 1526. Senate bill S. 737 addresses similar concerns by limiting delayed notification justifications to exigent circumstances. The USA PATRIOT Act allows for delayed notification of search warrants in cases of terrorism, with 7 and 21 day caps for delays. Judges can issue search warrants for terrorism cases outside their own districts under section 219. The USA PATRIOT Act allows for delayed notification of search warrants in terrorism cases, with 7 and 21 day caps for delays. Judges can issue search warrants that may be executed \"within or outside the district\" under F.R.Crim.P. 41(a)(3). H.R. 1526 sunsets section 219 on December 31, 2005. The intelligence reform legislation amended FISA to require the Attorney General to report semi-annually to Congressional committees on FISA use and interpretation, with S. 737 amending section 1871 to make these reports public. H.R. 1526 does not have similar provisions. The term \"Federal crime of terrorism\" is defined as an offense calculated to influence government conduct through intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government actions. It includes violations such as destruction of aircraft, violence at international airports, arson, biological weapons, chemical weapons, assassination, nuclear materials, and bombing of government property.
