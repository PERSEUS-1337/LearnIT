    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Community Radio Act of 2005\". Congress found that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 led to increased consolidation in the radio industry, with concerns raised about too much consolidation in some local markets. A commitment to localism in radio operations, programming, and news would enhance listenership. Despite efforts by local communities to launch radio stations, limited spectrum availability and high costs hinder many from establishing stations. In 2003, the average cost to acquire a commercial radio station was over $2,500,000. In 2000, the Federal Communications Commission introduced low-power FM (LPFM) to promote community-oriented radio broadcasting. LPFM aimed to provide opportunities for new voices on the airwaves and allow local groups to offer programming tailored to local needs and interests without compromising the FM radio band's integrity. The FCC is committed to creating a low-power FM radio service without causing interference to existing radio stations. FM translator stations can operate on adjacent channels with up to 250 watts power, based on their performance without interference. Small rural broadcasters have expressed concerns. In September 2000, the FCC established a simplified process to address interference complaints for LPFM stations. Congress delayed full implementation of LPFM in December 2000 due to concerns about interference in the FM band, preventing many Americans from having local community radio stations. Despite the delay, around 300 LPFM stations were allowed to proceed. After a 2-year study costing $2,193,343 in taxpayer dollars, concerns of LPFM broadcasters were found to be unsubstantiated. These stations, operated by various civic-oriented organizations, continue to broadcast despite congressional actions. The Federal Communications Commission repeals Section 632 of the 2001 Appropriations Act and eliminates minimum distance separation requirements between low-power FM stations and other FM stations. Rules protecting radio reading services and ensuring spectrum availability for LPFM stations are retained. SEC. 6. ENSURING AVAILABILITY OF SPECTRUM FOR LPFM STATIONS. The FCC must ensure licenses are available for both FM translator and low-power FM stations, with decisions based on local community needs."
