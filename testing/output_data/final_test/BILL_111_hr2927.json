    "content": "The \"Border Tax Equity Act of 2009\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings and declarations of policy. The \"Border Tax Equity Act of 2009\" outlines findings regarding the use of indirect taxes like value-added taxes (VAT) in 150 countries, with an average VAT rate of 15.7%. Direct taxes like corporate income taxes rebated upon export are considered export subsidies under WTO rules, while indirect taxes like VAT rebates are not seen as subsidies. The curr_chunk discusses the disparate treatment of border taxes affecting US agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers due to indirect taxes acting as export subsidies for foreign exporters and resulting in double taxation for US exporters. The curr_chunk highlights the significant impact of border tax inequity on US businesses, with foreign governments providing VAT rebates to their producers exporting to the US while collecting VAT equivalent taxes on US imported goods. This resulted in a combined goods and services disadvantage of $474 billion in 2007. Congress has long recognized the prejudicial effect of this disparate treatment of border taxes. The US has recognized the unfair treatment of border taxes and aims to negotiate a solution through various trade acts passed by Congress. The US aims to revise WTO rules regarding border taxes to address the disadvantage faced by countries relying on direct taxes. Congress emphasizes the need to resolve this issue in WTO negotiations. If WTO negotiations fail to revise rules on border taxes to address the disadvantage faced by countries relying on direct taxes, Congress may consider legislative action due to the significant trade distortions affecting US agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers. REPORT ON RESULTS OF WTO NEGOTIATIONS TO REVISE WTO RULES REGARDING BORDER TAXES. The United States Trade Representative must report to Congress within 60 days of WTO negotiations completion, certifying if U.S. trade objectives on border tax treatment have been met. Objectives include revising WTO rules on border adjustments for internal taxes to address disadvantages for countries relying on direct taxes. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 addresses the elimination of trade disadvantages in services related to direct and indirect taxes. WTO negotiations aim to revise rules on border tax adjustments for internal taxes. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 addresses negotiations for revisions to WTO rules regarding border tax treatment.

Subchapter G of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on imports from foreign countries with an indirect tax system. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 addresses negotiations for revisions to WTO rules regarding border tax treatment. Subchapter G of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on imports from foreign countries with an indirect tax system. The tax is based on the difference between indirect taxes rebated on exported goods and any indirect taxes imposed at the US border. Importers are liable for paying the tax at the time of entry. The tax on imports is imposed at the time of entry and applies until US trade negotiating goals are met. The tax is collected by Customs and Border Protection and deposited into a special account for payments to qualified US exporters. Definitions include the Secretary of Homeland Security and the term 'importer'. The term 'importer' is defined as the party eligible to file customs entry documentation for goods or services. The term 'time of entry' refers to the specified time for imports of goods. The term 'importer' is the party eligible to file customs entry documentation for goods or services, and the 'time of entry' refers to the specified time for imports of goods. Regulations (19 C.F.R. 141.68) specify the time for imports of goods and services, while a foreign country employing an indirect tax system grants rebates on indirect taxes paid on exported goods or services. Value-added taxes (VAT) are an indirect general consumption tax levied by the exporting country on the value added to goods. Value-added taxes (VAT) are levied by the exporting country on the value added to goods and services in that country at multiple stages of the production and supply chain. This tax is also known as a goods and services tax (GST). Regulations allow the Secretary to prescribe rules and regulations necessary to implement this section. SEC. 314 of the Tariff Act of 1930 allows payments to U.S. exporters to offset discriminatory border taxes imposed by importing countries. SEC. 314 of the Tariff Act of 1930 allows payments to U.S. exporters to offset indirect taxes imposed by importing countries with an indirect tax system. The Secretary of Homeland Security can pay exporters an amount equal to the foreign country's taxes on goods or services, minus any U.S. taxes already paid. Exporters requesting payment must provide specific information. Exporters requesting payment under SEC. 314 of the Tariff Act of 1930 must identify and provide proof of indirect taxes imposed by the importing country. Payments will be made from a special account authorized by the Internal Revenue Code, with additional appropriations if necessary. The Treasury of the United States will provide necessary funds for payments under the Border Tax Equity Act of 2009. The Secretary of Homeland Security can create regulations for this section, and it applies until trade negotiating goals are met.

Value-added taxes (VAT) are a type of indirect general consumption tax levied on the value added to goods and services at multiple stages of production and supply chain. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATES. If the United States Trade Representative fails to certify to Congress by the specified date that trade negotiating objectives regarding border tax treatment have been met, certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code and Tariff Act will take effect after 90 and 120 days respectively. If the United States Trade Representative does not certify to Congress by January 1, 2010, that trade negotiating objectives on border tax treatment have been met, section 314 of the Tariff Act of 1930 will apply to exports of services from the United States. Appropriations will be made as necessary for payments related to these exports. Until the special account under section 4491 of the Internal Revenue Code is established and adequately funded, section 314 of the Tariff Act of 1930 will apply for payments related to exports of services from the United States."
