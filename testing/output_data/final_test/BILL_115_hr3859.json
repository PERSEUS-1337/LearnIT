    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Drinking Water Infrastructure for Job Creation Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of infrastructure investments in creating jobs and meeting critical needs in communities across the United States. Data from the Brookings Institution shows that infrastructure jobs employed nearly 14.5 million workers in 2013, with competitive wages that are up to 30 percent higher for low-income workers compared to national averages. The American Society of Civil Engineers rated the U.S. infrastructure as a \"D+\" in 2017, highlighting the need for a $4.59 trillion investment by 2025 to improve its condition. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the United States needs to invest $150 billion by 2025 to bring the drinking water and wastewater infrastructure to a state of good repair. There are approximately 240,000 water main breaks per year in the US, wasting over two trillion gallons of treated drinking water. Exposure to lead can cause serious health problems, including damage to the brain and nervous system. The Drinking Water State Revolving Funds were created in 1996 to help public water systems finance infrastructure projects to comply with regulations. An estimated 6.5 to 10 million homes nationwide receive water through lead service lines. EPA conducts surveys to determine funding distribution based on system needs. In 2013, EPA estimated $384 billion is needed over 20 years for drinking water infrastructure improvements. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $2 billion for Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to assist public water systems. Past appropriations are insufficient to meet the investment needs. Appropriating $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2017 for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds will enable immediate expansion of investments in drinking water infrastructure across the United States. Restricting appropriations through budget caps or sequestration hinders economic recovery, disrupts planning, and leaves critical infrastructure needs unmet. Emergency supplemental appropriations are necessary to address these challenges. Emergency supplemental appropriation of $7.5 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds in fiscal year 2017 will improve drinking water infrastructure and create jobs without reducing funding for other priorities. The funds will be available for 6 years, allowing states to distribute funds to eligible water systems and implement plans for infrastructure improvements. An additional $7.5 billion is appropriated for capitalization grants under the Safe Drinking Water Act for fiscal year 2017. The funds will be available through September 30, 2022, and are designated as an emergency requirement. The appropriation in section 3 is exempt from sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
