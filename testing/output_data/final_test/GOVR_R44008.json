    "content": "The importance of early learning for children's healthy development and positive outcomes in school and the workforce has led to increased congressional interest in funding improvements in early childhood education programs. Research shows that quality early childhood care and education can enhance academic achievement and other student outcomes, especially for disadvantaged students. The effectiveness of these programs is measured by assessing cognitive functioning, school readiness, and social behavior. Investments in high-quality preschool have been shown to have a positive impact on children's academic achievement and social behavior. Research from the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) indicates that the benefits of universally available preschool for three- and four-year-olds outweigh the costs, with a lifetime return on investment of seven dollars for every dollar spent. Studies on programs like the Chicago Child Parent Center and the Perry Preschool program have shown long-term benefits such as reduced likelihood of being held back in school or needing remedial help. Access to high-quality preschool programs varies in the United States, with only 29% of four-year-olds and 5% of three-year-olds enrolled in state-funded preschool nationally in school year 2014-2015. NIEER found that only six states met all 10 of their quality benchmarks that year. Less than 4% of children served in state-funded preschool met these benchmarks. In SY2014-2015, less than 4% of children in state-funded preschool met all 10 NIEER quality benchmarks. The lack of a cohesive public preschool system has led to a fragmented landscape of providers with varying funding sources and quality. This report focuses on two early childhood initiatives funded by the Obama Administration between FY2011 and FY2016. The Obama Administration funded two early childhood initiatives between FY2011 and FY2016: Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC) grants and Preschool Development Grants (PDG). These programs aimed to improve access to high-quality preschool and enhance coordination between local, state, and federal preschool programs. Funding for RTT-ELC grants was provided in FY2011-2013, while funding for PDG was allocated in FY2014-2016. The programs are jointly administered by the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services. This report offers background information on both initiatives and the states that have received grants from them. The Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC) and Preschool Development Grants (PDG) were early childhood initiatives funded by the Obama Administration. The RTT-ELC program aimed to improve statewide early learning systems and increase access to high-quality programs for high-need children. The PDG program, established under the Every Student Succeeds Act, differs from the RTT-ELC program. The RTT-ELC focused on building successful state systems and high-quality programs aligned with common standards. Accountable Programs align various early childhood education initiatives to create a unified statewide system. Promoting Early Learning Development Outcomes through common standards, assessments, and quality improvement guidelines. Supporting a Great Early Childhood Workforce with professional development and incentives for promoting children's learning and development. Early Learning Challenge Grants aim to improve young children's learning and development by measuring outcomes and progress through data collection and analysis. Congress considered these grants as part of the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, proposing $1 billion in annual funding for states to enhance early learning programs for children aged birth to five. The Early Learning Challenge Grants program received funding through the Race to the Top program in FY2009, totaling $4.35 billion. Subsequently, the program was funded in FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013 through appropriations, becoming known as Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC) grants. The final FY2011 Continuing Resolution provided $699 million for Race to the Top. In FY2011, $699 million was provided for Race to the Top, with $497 million reserved for RTT-ELC funding. Additional funding of $133 million in FY2012 and $370 million in FY2013 was allocated to the program. States awarded RTT-ELC funding receive it for a four-year period, with certain state agencies required to participate in the program. Required Participating State Agencies for the RTT-ELC State Plan include agencies overseeing various education and childcare programs such as IDEA, CCDF, preschool, home visiting, ESEA, Head Start, and Maternal and Child Health Services. States receiving RTT-ELC funds must develop a Quality Rating and Improvement System for early learning programs. The RTT-ELC program requires participating states to develop a tiered Quality Rating and Improvement System (TQRIS) for early learning programs. TQRISs are compared to market-based approaches like star ratings for restaurants or hotels, allowing consumers to easily compare programs based on factors like child/staff ratios and staff experience. RTT-ELC recipient states must have a tiered TQRIS to show the number of quality indicators met by each program. The program includes five proposed priorities in its competitions. The RTT-ELC program requires states to develop a tiered Quality Rating and Improvement System (TQRIS) for early learning programs. There are five proposed priorities in the competitions, including an absolute priority for promoting school readiness for children with high needs. States can address competitive preference priorities for extra points, and invitational priorities without extra points. Changes were made to Phase 1 requirements based on feedback from nearly 350 comments. Several changes were made to the Phase 1 RTT-ELC priorities in response to feedback from 350 comments. The draft executive summary listed two proposed absolute priorities, but only one element - promoting school readiness - was included in Phase 1. Other elements were incorporated into competitive preference priorities. The invitational priorities remained unchanged. Language changes were made for the third round of the RTT-ELC grant competition. Changes were made to existing criteria and new provisions were added, including reporting data by race and ethnicity on program participation of children with high needs. Program Standards were revised to require culturally and linguistically responsive family engagement strategies. Kindergarten Entry Assessments cannot be the sole measure for high stakes decisions. Invitational priority 4 was elevated to a competitive priority, with states able to earn up to 10 points by addressing preschool through third grade quality, alignment, and continuity. States were required to address preschool through third grade quality, alignment, and continuity of teaching and learning, with a new competitive priority added for addressing the unique needs of rural populations. ED and HHS provided resources such as training sessions, webinars, and funding for an Early Learning Challenge Technical Assistance Center (ELCTA) to support states in developing and implementing their RTT-ELC programs. ELCTA offers activities like Needs Assessments, technical assistance (TA) Plans, Communities of Practice, and Peer Exchange Networks. Peer Exchange Networks, Best Practice Guides, Toolkits, Webinars, Onsite Technical Assistance, and the GRADS360\u00b0 Public Domain Clearinghouse provide support for grantees and non-grantees in the Early Learning Challenge program. Private organizations like BUILD and the First Five Years Fund collaborate to assist states in applying for and implementing RTT-ELC. The RTT-ELC program has had three competitions, with funding totaling $500 million awarded to nine states from FY2011 RTT funding. In FY2012, $549 million was provided for RTT, with $200 million reserved for RTT-ELC funding awarded to five states. Additional $133 million was made available for awards to the next highest scoring states. In December, $67 million in Phase 2 RTT-ELC grant funding was distributed to the five Phase 2 grantees. The Phase 2 winning states received approximately 75% or more of the possible points in the first round of the competition. The $133 million awarded to the Phase 2 winners in 2012 funded each state's application at 50% of its original FY2011 request level. Adjustments to budgets, timelines, and performance measures of selected activities were allowed. In FY2013, $89 million was added to the original FY2011 proposals for six grantees from Phases 1 and 2. Phase 2 states received an additional $67 million, bringing their total funding to $200 million. Total funding for Race to the Top (RTT) in FY2013 was $520 million, with $370 million reserved for RTT-ELC. Phase 3 states received $281 million after augmenting grants for previous recipients. ED and HHS monitor states' progress in meeting RTT-ELC requirements. Grantees are monitored by ED and HHS to ensure they meet goals, timelines, and budget requirements. State grantees are responsible for monitoring localities, programs, and partners, including community- and faith-based organizations. They must submit plans detailing how they will monitor subgrantees within 180 days of receiving the grant award. The RTT-ELC funds require states to submit annual performance reports summarizing their activities. Some accomplishments include Maryland and Ohio collaborating on a Comprehensive Assessment System, California establishing a TQRIS, and Washington exceeding participation targets for its Early Achievers program. Across 20 states, there was an 85% increase in early childhood programs participating in TQRISs. The PDG program aims to expand access to high-quality preschool for low-income four-year-olds. It supports state and local efforts to develop and expand preschool programs. The program includes PDG-Expansion Grants and PDG-Development Grants, with the goal of preparing states for the proposed Preschool for All program. The number of programs rated in the top two tiers of TQRISs more than doubled from 9,025 to 21,114 programs by the end of 2015. The PDG program offers two grant programs: PDG-Expansion Grants for states with robust preschool programs, and PDG-Development Grants for states with limited or no state-funded preschool programs. Grantees aim to create or expand high-quality preschool programs, improve state-level infrastructure, and establish strong partnerships between school districts and early learning providers. The Obama Administration requested $750 million in discretionary funding for the PDG program in the FY2014 President's Budget. The PDG program received $250 million in discretionary funding for FY2015 and FY2016 through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This funding allowed existing grantees to receive continuation awards but was not enough to fund new grantees. The PDG program received $250 million in discretionary funding for FY2015 and FY2016, allowing existing grantees to receive continuation awards. States must demonstrate progress towards program goals to receive funding in subsequent years. One required use of funds is to develop and implement a plan to increase access to high-quality preschool programs. States applying for PDG grants must address specific priorities outlined by the ED. States applying for PDG-Development and PDG-Expansion grants must outline how they will serve eligible children, subgrant funding for high-quality preschool programs in high-need areas, and allocate funding for improving state preschool infrastructure. For PDG-Expansion Grants, states must prioritize increasing access to high-quality preschool in high-need areas by serving eligible children within one year, subgranting at least 95% of funding for high-quality programs, and using no more than 35% of funding for infrastructure improvements. The PDG grants require states to serve eligible children, fund high-quality preschool programs in high-need areas, and allocate a small percentage for infrastructure improvements. Competitive priorities include matching funds, supporting a birth through grade 3 continuum, and expanding high-quality preschool slots. Selection criteria and allowable operational costs are also outlined for subgrantees. The PDG grants fund high-quality preschool programs for eligible children with disabilities, with $250 million appropriated in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. Eligible providers include LEAs, charter schools, Head Start programs, licensed child care providers, and others defined by the State. Non-LEA subgrantees must show a strong partnership with LEAs. All providers must offer high-quality preschool programs. In FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016, $250 million was appropriated for the PDG program. 18 states and outlying areas received FY2014 funding, with FY2015 and FY2016 funding going to existing grantees. Funding was insufficient for new grantees. States are funded based on the population of four-year-olds in families below 200% of the federal poverty level. $80 million was for PDG-Development Grants, $170 million for PDG-Expansion Grants, and the rest for national activities and peer review. Eight states and Puerto Rico applied for PDG-Development Grants. In 2014, five states received PDG-Development Grants, while 13 states received PDG-Preschool Expansion Grants in Year 1 and Year 2 of the program. Recipients must submit annual reports to ED on their progress, goals, timelines, and budget. States receiving grants must meet annual targets and goals set in their application. ED reviews adherence regularly and may take enforcement actions if requirements are not met. Glossary defines terms like \"Children with High Needs\" as those from low-income families needing special support. The RTT-ELC grants prioritize promoting school readiness for children with high needs, including those with disabilities, English language learners, and those in foster care. Kindergarten Entry Assessments (KEAs) are used to measure school readiness, and states must implement a Tiered Quality Rating and Improvement System (TQRIS) to enhance early childhood education quality. Tiered Quality Rating and Improvement System (TQRIS) is a systematic approach to assess, improve, and communicate quality levels in early learning programs. It includes program standards, monitoring, support for improvement, and public ratings. Workforce Knowledge and Competency Framework outlines expectations for early childhood educators. The Workforce Knowledge and Competency Framework outlines the knowledge and skills early childhood educators should have, including evidence-based practices, early learning standards, child development, effective instructional practices, data use, behavior management, and feedback from experts. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act on December 10, 2015, including a new Preschool Development Grant program. This program differs from the previous PDG program in various ways, as outlined in Table C-1."
