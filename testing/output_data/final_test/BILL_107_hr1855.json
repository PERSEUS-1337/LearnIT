    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Parental Involvement Enhancement Act\" and includes findings. The \"Parental Involvement Enhancement Act\" acknowledges the importance of parental involvement in a child's education, citing research that shows it leads to improved academic performance, better school attendance, decreased violence and substance abuse, and higher rates of graduation. For example, in schools where parents are actively involved, fourth-grade reading scores were 17 points above the national average. According to the National Commission on Children, over 70% of students aged 10-13 and over 50% of students aged 14-17 want to talk more to their parents about school. 95% of parents believe parental involvement is crucial for student success, and 69% think more opportunities for parental involvement are needed to improve public schools. A survey found that many parents see low levels of parental involvement and poor communication from schools as serious issues. Teachers prioritize strengthening parental roles in children's education as a key issue in public education policy. Low parental involvement and poor communication from schools are significant problems. Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new part called \"PART G--PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT\" which establishes the PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT GRANT PROGRAM. The Secretary may grant funds to schools for promoting parental involvement in education. Funds can be used for educational materials or to pay eligible parent liaisons with specific qualifications. The individual hired as a parent liaison must have qualifications in counseling, psychology, human resources, or relevant fields. They should be bilingual or multilingual if needed by the school. Responsibilities include facilitating communication between teachers and parents, explaining tests and assessments, and interpreting report cards for parents with limited English proficiency. The individual hired as a parent liaison must have qualifications in counseling, psychology, human resources, or relevant fields. Responsibilities include facilitating communication between teachers and parents, explaining tests and assessments, and interpreting report cards for parents with limited English proficiency. Schools seeking grants must submit an application describing their student population and plans to increase parental involvement, including the employment of parent liaisons. The school applying for grants must describe the parent liaisons they plan to hire, activities to increase parental involvement, and resources to be acquired. The evaluation of materials, success of activities, and parental input are also required. The Secretary will give preference based on selection criteria. The Secretary will prioritize schools with a high percentage of students with limited English proficiency and low parental involvement. Schools receiving funds must involve parents and local parent organizations in hiring decisions for parent liaisons. Authorization of appropriations for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is also included. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to authorize $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 for parental involvement in schools with limited English proficiency and low parental involvement."
