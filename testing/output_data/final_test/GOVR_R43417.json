Funding comes from discretionary and mandatory appropriations, with additional discretionary monies sometimes provided through supplemental appropriations bills. Continuing appropriations resolutions are used to maintain funding when regular appropriations bills are not enacted before the fiscal year starts. The Forest Service manages 193 million acres of the National Forest System and conducts forestry research. Funding comes from discretionary and mandatory appropriations, with additional discretionary monies sometimes provided through supplemental appropriations bills. The FS also receives annual mandatory appropriations under existing authorizing statutes, allowing them to spend money without further action by Congress. This report presents and analyzes the discretionary and mandatory appropriations for the FS over the five years from FY2012 to FY2016, including a section on the President's FY2017 budget request. Discretionary appropriations account for 88% of total agency appropriations and are primarily divided among six main accounts, with some dependent on revenue generated by activities on the national forests. The Wildland Fire Management and National Forest System accounts receive nearly 85% of total FS discretionary appropriations. FS budget requests allocate monies at the account and subaccount levels for specific programs and activities. The FS accounts include Forest and Rangeland Research (FRR) for research and development efforts, averaging 6% of FS discretionary appropriations, and State and Private Forestry (S&PF) for financial and technical assistance to nonfederal forest owners and managers. The State and Private Forestry (S&PF) program provides financial and technical assistance to nonfederal forest owners and managers, protecting communities and the environment. It receives approximately 5% of FS discretionary appropriations. The National Forest System (NFS) account manages 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands, with the Forest Products subaccount receiving over 20% of the NFS appropriation for the Timber Sales program. The NFS account averages around 28% of FS discretionary appropriations. Capital Improvement and Maintenance (CI&M) activities fund facilities, roads, and infrastructure needs, receiving about 7% of FS discretionary appropriations. Land Acquisition (LA) activities allow the FS to acquire land. Land Acquisition (LA) activities allow the FS to acquire lands for conservation purposes, funded primarily through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. LA received approximately 1% of FS discretionary appropriations on average over the last five years. Wildland Fire Management (WFM) and FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund (FLAME) fund activities related to wildfire management and suppression. The FLAME account, established under the Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act of 2009, is used for emergency wildfire suppression activities. FLAME and Wildland Fire Management (WFM) accounts are sometimes combined for funding purposes. WFM and FLAME appropriations, along with supplemental appropriations, have averaged 54% of the FS discretionary appropriation over the last five years. Additionally, there are smaller accounts for range betterment, research gifts, donations, and national forest land management. The FS manages various accounts for research, gifts, donations, and national forest land management, receiving less than 0.5% of discretionary appropriations. Funds are allocated among regions, research stations, service centers, and headquarters in DC. Allocation to national forests varies, with some accounts managed nationally. Analyzing appropriations by region or forest can be challenging due to varying needs and boundaries. The Forest Service manages multiple permanent appropriations accounts and trust funds, constituting about 12% of total agency appropriations. Budget authority for these accounts is provided in authorizing laws, with some dependent on receipts from specific activities. For example, the Timber Sales Pipeline Restoration Fund allows the FS to use revenue from timber sales for future projects in the same region. Another example is the Payments to States fund. The Payments to States fund includes various programs dependent on receipts, authorized under the Payments to States Act of 1908 and the Secure Rural Schools Act. The latter was reauthorized in 2015 (P.L. 114-10) with makeup payments for missed periods. Forest Service requested and enacted appropriations for these programs. In FY2016, Forest Service requested and enacted discretionary and mandatory appropriations are provided in figures and tables, showing comparisons and changes in current and constant dollars. Total FS enacted appropriations for FY2016 included discretionary and mandatory funds. Total FS enacted appropriations in FY2016 were $7.065 billion, a 25% increase from FY2012. Adjusted for inflation, appropriations rose by 17% since FY2012. FY2016 had the largest appropriation in the five-year period, while FY2012 had the smallest. Mandatory spending made up about 12% of total appropriations, around $755.0 million. In FY2016, mandatory spending was estimated at $700.8 million. FS discretionary appropriations increased by 32% from FY2012 to FY2016, reaching $6.364 billion in FY2016. Within this period, appropriations fluctuated, with some accounts decreasing while others increased. For example, CI&M appropriations decreased by 9%, NFS appropriations decreased by 3%, and total WFM appropriations increased by 71% since FY2012. Adjusted for inflation, FS total discretionary appropriations increased by 24% since FY2012. In FY2016, the Forest Service requested $5.797 billion in discretionary appropriations, a 26% increase from FY2012 in current dollars. Adjusted for inflation, the overall budget request for FY2016 was 18% higher than in FY2012. The distribution of discretionary appropriations among different accounts is detailed in Figure 2. The WFM appropriation averaged $2.892 billion over five years, ranging from $2.290 billion in FY2012 to $3.909 billion in FY2016. The FY2016 WFM appropriation reached a high of $3.909 billion, the largest since at least FY2004. WFM accounts received 54% of the total FS discretionary appropriation on average over the last five years, increasing to 61% in FY2016. The NFS account received $1.502 billion on average, or 28% of the total FS discretionary appropriation. The FY2016 NFS appropriation of $1.509 billion (24% of FS discretionary appropriations) slightly increased from FY2015. The difference between requested and enacted appropriations may reflect various factors. The Forest Service's enacted appropriations have exceeded the requested amount in four out of the last five years, with variations at the account level. The differences between enacted and requested appropriations for Wildland Fire Management may be due to supplemental appropriations or account restructuring. In FY2017, the Administration is requesting $5.757 billion. The Administration is requesting $5.757 billion in discretionary appropriations for the Forest Service in FY2017, which is $40.0 million below the FY2016 request and $606.9 million below the FY2016 enacted discretionary appropriation. The Forest Service has proposed a new funding mechanism for wildfire suppression activities, including eliminating the FLAME reserve account. They are requesting $2.451 billion for Wildland Fire Management in FY2017, with up to $864.1 million available for emergency suppression operations. The Forest Service's overall agency appropriations increased in FY2016, with funding for wildfire management responsible for most of the differences. However, funding for other accounts decreased, raising questions about the allocation of resources and the extent to which wildfire management activities impact other statutory obligations."
