    "content": "The House and Senate Committees are concerned about the state of military families, particularly with readiness and deployments. Congress authorized the Cold War Recognition Certificate to recognize the contributions of armed forces and government civilians during the Cold War period. Veterans' organizations have supported these efforts. The Cold War Recognition Certificate was authorized by Congress to honor the contributions of armed forces and government civilians during the Cold War. Veterans' organizations have supported the creation of this medal. In 1950, laws were enacted to provide financial support to local schools with military dependents, helping to lessen the impact on schools near military facilities. The Cold War Recognition Certificate was authorized by Congress to honor the contributions of armed forces and government civilians during the Cold War. Laws were enacted in 1950 to provide financial support to local schools with military dependents, lessening the impact on schools near military facilities. Additionally, impact aid laws are augmented in cases of substantial military presence or significant changes in student attendance due to military basing strategies. P.L. 102-484 authorizes benefits for spouses and former spouses of retirement-eligible members who lose eligibility for retired pay due to misconduct involving abuse of dependents. Spouses are provided the same rights and benefits as if there had been no abuse. For example, time in confinement for abuse prior to retirement eligibility is not creditable towards retirement. The House language would have allowed time in confinement to count towards retirement eligibility. The Death Gratuity is a benefit for survivors of military personnel, providing immediate cash payment until other benefits become available. Beneficiaries are designated in order of eligibility, with the surviving spouse first, followed by children. A service member can designate up to 50% of the death gratuity to someone other than the recipient under law. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides an annuity for survivors of those who die while serving in the Armed Forces or have retired from the Armed Forces. A portion of retired pay is withheld for those participating in the SBP. The law allows service members to designate a beneficiary or specifies other beneficiaries if no designation is made. This authority ends on September 30, 2007. The Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs offsets the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) on a dollar-for-dollar basis for eligible surviving spouses. If DIC is paid to an SBP-eligible spouse, a portion of the deceased retiree's original SBP contributions will be refunded. SBP payments can be restored if the beneficiary becomes ineligible for DIC but remains eligible for SBP, with refunded payments needing to be returned. Military widows/widowers may be confused when benefits offset each other, leading to payment returns and potential recoupments. The House provision was expected to clarify the recoupment process for overpayments, but the language was not included in the law. Surviving spouses eligible for both Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuity and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) will have their SBP benefit reduced dollar-for-dollar by DIC. Military widows/widowers may feel money has been unfairly taken away due to offsetting benefits. Under the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP), military service members and retirees can provide an annuity to spouses, former spouses, and dependent children upon their death. The Senate language allows for a guardian or caretaker to be designated as a beneficiary for dependent children who are too young or mentally incapacitated to handle the funds. Additional payments of up to $50 per month are available for eligible spouses or former spouses receiving DIC. The military Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides annuities to survivors of military personnel and retirees. In 1999, Congress reduced the cost of the SBP for certain retirees with the \"paid-up\" provision, where deductions in retired pay cease when the retiree reaches age 70 and has participated in the SBP for 360 months. The Senate language allows a guardian or caretaker to be designated as a beneficiary for dependent children who are young or mentally incapacitated. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) was created in 1972 and allows military retirees to receive annuities. Congress reduced the cost of the SBP for certain retirees by implementing a \"paid-up\" provision, where deductions in retired pay stop at age 70 after participating in the SBP for 360 months. Efforts to change the effective date of this provision in 2005 and 2006 were unsuccessful. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) was created in 1972 to provide military retirees with annuities. Efforts to change the \"paid-up\" provision, which stops deductions in retired pay at age 70 after 360 months of participation, were unsuccessful in 2005 and 2006. Despite combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Bush Administration and Department of Defense resisted calls to permanently increase Army and Marine Corps end strength. The Quadrennial Defense Review recommended an Army end strength of 482,400 and a Marine Corps end strength of 175,000. On January 19, 2007, DOD announced plans to seek approval for a permanent increase in active Army end strength. On January 19, 2007, DOD announced plans to increase permanent active Army end strength by 65,000 to 547,400 and Marine Corps end strength by 27,000 to 202,000 by FY2012. Committees noted the need for higher recruiting and retention goals, projecting 85,000-87,000 recruits for the Army and 36,000-38,000 for the Marine Corps annually. Achieving these goals may be challenging. Reference: CRS Report RL31334. Hardship Duty Pay (HDP) is compensation for demanding duty, with the maximum authorized amount recently increased to $750 per month. The actual rate paid will be determined by the Secretary of Defense, currently set at $100 per month for Iraq and Afghanistan. Active duty military personnel are eligible for full retirement benefits after 20 years of service. Active duty military personnel are eligible for full retirement benefits after 20 years of service, while reservists can retire after 20 years of qualifying service but do not receive retired pay or health benefits until age 60. Legislative proposals aim to lower the age for reservists to receive these benefits, with recent laws allowing certain reservists to draw retired pay after serving on active duty for a specified period. The retirement age for reservists cannot be reduced below age 50, and they can receive retiree medical benefits at age 60. Congress has been concerned about the allocation of resources to POW/MIA operations in recent years. The FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act required DOD to submit a five-year overview of funding for POW/MIA operations. The FY2008 President's Budget would support 91 percent of the total funding required, with a shortfall of $8.0 million. If supported by appropriations, these increases would fund FY2008 POW/MIA operations at 100% of the requirement. Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to highlight the military pay issue. The military pay issue is highlighted by ongoing challenges. Title 37 U.S.C. 1009 provides a formula for annual pay raises tied to the Economic Cost Index (ECI). The FY2008 President's Budget requested a 3.0 percent raise, consistent with the formula. Congress approved raises above the formula in previous years. This year's legislation does not mention targeted pay raises. Since FY2003, Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) has been available to military retirees with 20+ years of active duty, excluding reservists and those medically retired before 20 years. VA 100% Unemployable were set to be eligible in 2014, changed to Oct 1, 2009 by FY2006 NDAA. This law expanded CRSC eligibility. The \"GI Bill\" educational benefit was enacted in 1944 to help World War II servicemembers readjust to civilian life. It later became a military recruiting incentive. The \"Montgomery GI Bill\" (MGIB) was established in 1984, with benefits for active duty personnel (MGIB-AD) and the Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR) to encourage membership. In 2004, Congress introduced the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) for reservists who had served at least 90 days on active duty in support of a contingency operation. This program aimed to maintain proportional parity with the Active Duty GI Bill by linking its benefit level to the MGIB-AD basic benefit in Title 38. Transferring the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve statutory authority from Title 10 to Title 38 has been proposed to ensure equitable payment rates. The tensions between military leadership and reserve components have resurfaced in recent years, particularly regarding decisions impacting the Army and Air National Guard. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the need to revamp disaster response efforts, with a focus on the National Guard's role as both a state and federal force. The FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act directed changes in this area. The FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act directed the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve to review proposed changes to the National Guard Bureau Chief's role and report recommendations to Congress. The CNGR submitted its Second Report to Congress in March 2007, with provisions in Title V and Title XVIII of the bill aligning closely with its recommendations. This included increasing the rank of the NGB Chief to 4 stars. The law increased the rank of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to general and transferred authority for prescribing the NGB charter to the Secretary of Defense. The NGB was established as a joint activity of the Department of Defense, with the Chief having an advisory role. The law also introduced new functions for the NGB, aligning with some CNGR recommendations but differing in other areas. The law made changes to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau's rank and authority, aligning with some CNGR recommendations but differing in other areas. It required a plan for responding to disasters and terrorism, which differed from CNGR recommendations. The selection process for the NGB Chief was modified, a topic not addressed by the CNGR. The law made changes to the selection process for the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, aligning it with recommendations for other high-ranking officers. It added requirements for joint duty experience and capability to serve effectively in the position, consistent with the CNGR report's emphasis on equal standards for reserve and active component officers. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act prohibited increases in Tricare Prime enrollment fees for retired personnel under age 65. DOD proposed fee increases again in FY2008 budget for potential savings of $1.9 billion. Two reports on defense health care budget issues were requested. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act prohibited Tricare Prime fee increases for retired personnel under 65. Two reports on defense health care budget issues were requested, favoring increased costs for beneficiaries. Despite opposition, the Armed Services committees aim for a comprehensive approach to health care budget changes. The conference report urges DOD to improve military health care quality and effectiveness, suggesting any TRICARE cost sharing increases be made carefully. The conferees recommend that any TRICARE program cost sharing increases should only occur after improvements are made to the health care program, considering comprehensive reports mandated by Congress and consulting with military beneficiary advocates. This follows the FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act's prohibition on employers offering incentives to military retirees not to enroll in employee-sponsored health care plans. Tricare beneficiaries are eligible for government health care plans without inducements to forego employer-sponsored plans. The legislation aims to prevent cost shifting to DOD without reducing benefits for retired servicemembers. Some employers offer cafeteria plans for Tricare-eligible employees, causing confusion. Some employers oppose provisions increasing health care costs, leading to discussions of repealing the FY2008 provision. The law did not address confusion among beneficiaries and opposition from some employers regarding employer-sponsored health care regulations. A rule on DOD regulations is expected to be published soon. Currently, dependents of active-duty and retired servicemembers must make co-payments for pharmaceuticals. The Administration proposed increasing co-payments for generic and formulary drugs. Banning the proposed increases would raise DOD's costs by $187 million. The Administration proposed increasing co-payments for generic and formulary drugs, with resistance from beneficiaries and organizations. GAO concluded that the anticipated savings may not be fully achieved, but significant savings are still likely. The DOD Task Force recommended gradually increasing cost-sharing over three to five years to avoid sudden changes. The dispute over pharmaceutical pricing rules for Tricare retail network prescriptions was not addressed in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act. The final bill stated that prescriptions from the Department of Defense Retail Pharmacy Program qualify for discounted drug prices. The House version allows flexibility for DOD, while the Senate provision makes federal pricing mandatory after October 1, 2007. There has been resistance from pharmaceutical companies and retail drug stores. Making federal pricing mandatory for the Tricare Retail Pharmacy Program could set a precedent for Medicare retail prices. The curr_chunk discusses setting retail prices for pharmaceuticals obtained through Medicare."
