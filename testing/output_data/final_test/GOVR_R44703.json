    "content": "A generic drug is a lower-cost copy of a brand-name chemical drug that can be marketed once the brand-name drug's patent protection expires. FDA-approved generic drugs have the same quality, strength, and purity as brand-name drugs, meeting the same standards. They must contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredient but may have different inactive ingredients. The FDA requires clinical data to approve brand-name drugs, ensuring their safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allows generic drug manufacturers to submit abbreviated NDAs to the FDA for premarket review, relying on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the approved drug. Generic drugs must be bioequivalent to brand-name drugs, delivering the same active ingredients in the same amount of time. This allows generic drug companies to sell their products at a lower cost without the need for costly research and marketing. Generic drug companies can sell their products at a lower price compared to brand-name drugs, with costs being 80 to 85 percent lower on average. Generics account for 89% of prescriptions but only 27% of total drug costs, while brand-name drugs make up 11% of prescriptions but contribute to 73% of drug spending. The use of generic drugs from 2006-2015 resulted in savings of $1.46 trillion. Brand-name drug prices are set by the manufacturer based on various factors, including patent and regulatory exclusivity to recoup research costs and provide profits. The branded drug is protected by patents and regulatory exclusivity, allowing the company to charge higher prices. For example, the cancer drug Gleevec can be produced at a much lower cost than its current price. The number of manufacturers marketing a drug affects its price, with generics significantly reducing prices compared to brand-name drugs. The average generic price for a product decreases significantly as more generic manufacturers enter the market. For example, the generic version of Zocor (simvastatin) is currently priced at three cents per pill, a 99% savings compared to the brand-name price of $2.62 per pill. Similarly, generic versions of Zoloft have led to 45 million prescriptions being dispensed in 2015, showing a significant cost reduction for consumers. In 2015, 45 million prescriptions were filled for generic Zoloft at six cents per pill, a 97% price drop from the brand price. Media attention has highlighted significant price increases for certain generic drugs, but a review by the Department of Health found that two-thirds of generic products had price declines in 2014. Explanations for large price increases include limited market entry, mergers, acquisitions, and market exits. ASPE states that problems like mergers, acquisitions, and market exits impact certain therapeutic areas but have little influence on overall spending increases. Funding for premarket review of ANDAs is provided by Congress and user fees from the generic drug industry. The report discusses the anticipated reauthorization of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 by Congress. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from brand-name drug manufacturers in 1992 with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The FDA, industry, and Congress agreed on performance goals and the use of fees for new product application reviews. User fees now make up 41% of the FDA budget, allowing for increased staff and faster review times. The Hatch-Waxman Act posed challenges due to the growing number of generic drug submissions, leading to delays. The increasing number of ANDAs and other submissions for generic drugs led to delayed approvals, a major concern for the generics industry, FDA, consumers, and payers. In March 2012, the median review time for generic drug applications was around 31 months, with a backlog of over 2,500 ANDAs. FDA was receiving about 100 NDAs and 800-900 ANDAs annually, requiring more inspections as the number of manufacturing facilities, especially foreign ones, grew. The generic industry was experiencing significant growth in India and China, posing challenges for FDA in conducting foreign inspections. The FDA faced challenges in inspecting foreign generic drug manufacturers due to disparities in inspection schedules and limited resources. To address this, the agency proposed generic drug user fees to expedite ANDA reviews and ensure parity between domestic and foreign inspections. These fees were made possible by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act in July 2012. The Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) under the Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) authorized FDA to collect fees from industry for generic drug activities. GDUFA I allowed fees to be collected from October 2012 to September 2017, totaling $299 million for FY2013. Various fees were established for ANDA applications, Drug Master Files, and facility fees for API and FDF production. The first GDUFA agreement specified fee proportions and inflation adjustments for FY2014-2017. Like PDUFA, GDUFA ensures fees supplement congressional appropriations. GDUFA defines human generic drug activities broadly, including submissions, inspections, and postmarket safety. The GDUFA agreement includes provisions for inspections, monitoring, and regulatory science. It also outlines risk-based biennial inspections, parity of domestic and foreign inspection schedules, and higher inspection fees for foreign facilities. The FDA collects GDUFA fees annually and provides reports on fee collection and spending. Changes to the generic drug program have been made following the enactment of GDUFA I. The FDA reorganized the Office of Generic Drugs in December 2013 and established the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality in January 2015. They exceeded their hiring goal by bringing on 1,176 staff in the first three fiscal years and 346 new staff in FY2016. Additionally, a new informatics platform was implemented to track application reviews and facility inspections. Communication with generic drug applicants was improved by consolidating application deficiencies in one letter. The FDA issued a complete response letter to address application deficiencies and provided new guidance documents for generic drug applications. They made refinements to the review program in response to applicant concerns. The average time for FDA to complete the first review cycle decreased from 26 months to about 14 months. FDA had acted on 89 percent of all ANDAs submitted in fiscal year 2015 within 15 months of receipt, exceeding its GDUFA goal. The FDA exceeded its GDUFA goal by acting on 89 percent of all ANDAs submitted in fiscal year 2015 within 15 months of receipt. Congress specified a $50 million backlog fee for GDUFA I, with FDA exceeding its goal of acting on 90% of the ANDA backlog by September 30, 2017. The FDA exceeded its GDUFA goal by acting on 89 percent of all ANDAs submitted in fiscal year 2015 within 15 months of receipt. A complete response letter (CRL) describes deficiencies in an ANDA that must be addressed before approval. Lack of crucial information can slow down the review process. The five-year generic drug user fee authority is set to sunset on September 30, 2017, with reauthorization outlined in the FFDCA as amended by GDUFA. The FDA initiated the reauthorization process of the GDUFA program in June 2015. Negotiation sessions with the generic drug industry were held from October 2015 to August 2016. The draft GDUFA II agreement was posted in October 2016, setting FDA performance goals for FY2018 through FY2022. Senate and House committees favorably reported bills for floor consideration based on the GDUFA II recommendations. The FDA and industry agreed on GDUFA II user fees totaling $493.6 million annually for ANDA reviews. FDA received more ANDAs than projected under GDUFA I, leading to increased spending. GDUFA II aims to review 90% of standard original ANDAs within 10 months. GDUFA II aims to review ANDAs within specific timeframes based on submission date and preapproval inspection requirements. The goal is to review and act on 90% of standard PASs within 6 months if no inspection is needed, and within 10 months if an inspection is required. GDUFA II introduces new features for priority ANDAs and PASs, aiming to review and act on 90% of priority ANDAs within 8 months and 90% of priority PASs within 4 months if no inspection is required. If an inspection is needed, FDA aims to review and act on 90% of priority PASs within 8 months. The FDA has approved over 16,000 ANDAs, but only around 10,000 are currently approved and not withdrawn. More than 20% of these have been approved since GDUFA was implemented, but many do not go to market. Lack of generic competition for off-patent drugs may be due to industry not submitting applications, rather than FDA speed in approval. The FDA is working on a Drug Competition Action Plan to increase the development of lower-cost generic drugs. They announced a new policy to expedite the review of generic drug applications until there are three approved generics for a given drug product. Scott Gottlieb, Commissioner of Food and Drugs, indicated that there are 23 innovator drugs with ANDAs pending and no patent or exclusivity protection, and another 125 innovator drugs with no approved generics and no ANDAs submitted."
