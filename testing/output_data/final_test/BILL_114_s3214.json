    "content": "The \"Vote By Mail Act of 2016\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section follows. Congress finds an inequity of voting rights in the US due to some states allowing universal mail-in voting while others do not. Many voters face difficulties getting to polls on election day, especially those with disabilities. Twenty-eight states currently allow universal absentee voting. Voting by mail, also known as \"no-excuse\" absentee voting, allows any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. Three states conduct elections entirely by mail, while twenty-two states allow some elections to be conducted by mail, especially in large and rural areas where it is convenient. Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their choices, which is crucial for ballots with complex issues. Voting by mail is cost-effective, with states like Oregon and Colorado seeing significant cost savings after implementing all-mail balloting. Costs dropped by nearly 30% in Oregon and 40% in Colorado, making vote-by-mail elections one-third to one-half less expensive than polling place elections. Additionally, the elimination of temporary labor costs for poll workers further contributes to the savings. Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can reduce waiting times at polling stations. In 2016, voters in Arizona waited in line for 1 to 5 hours, while in New York, stations ran out of ballots and lacked staff during voting hours. Voting by mail is preferred by many as an alternative to in-person voting, with 19% of ballots in the US cast by mail in 2012, up from 10% in 2000. This method is increasingly popular among voters who want to ensure they can vote regardless of any unforeseen circumstances on election day. Voting by mail reduces physical obstacles and time constraints on election day. Signature verification, ballot tracking, and postal service cooperation minimize fraud. Requiring personal information for mail-in voting violates privacy without preventing fraud. State laws requiring notary signatures for mail-in voting add cost and inconvenience without increasing security. Early voting is popular, with over 40% of voters in some states choosing to cast their ballots early. Voting by mail increases turnout in all elections, especially in special and primary elections. Oregon and Washington have seen success with their vote-by-mail systems. Oregon and Washington have successful vote-by-mail systems with high voter turnout rates. Oregon had a 45 percent turnout in the 2012 primary elections, while Washington had 38 percent. Automatic voter registration legislation has been introduced in 18 states and the District of Columbia, with Oregon and California automatically registering citizens when they apply for a driver's license. This system can increase participation, protect election integrity, and reduce registration costs. SEC. 3. PROMOTING ABILITY OF VOTERS TO VOTE BY MAIL IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS.
