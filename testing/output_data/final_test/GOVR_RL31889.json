The Qatari monarchy aimed to modernize Arab media as part of its reform effort and provided Al-Jazeera with an initial grant of $137 million. The station retained many of the BBC's Arab correspondents, including prominent Egyptian and Lebanese journalists. Al-Jazeera was a groundbreaking Arabic television station founded in 1996 in Qatar by the Emir of Qatar, Shaykh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani. It hired Arab correspondents, many of whom were prominent Egyptian and Lebanese journalists with western training. Al-Jazeera provided a new level of freedom in expressing opinions, including criticisms of Arab governments, which was not common in the Arab media landscape at the time. The station was seen as a novelty for being the first 24-hour, all-news Arabic television station, offering a different perspective from state-controlled media and other Arab satellite channels. Al-Jazeera, founded in 1996 in Qatar, modeled its format after western news services like CNN and the BBC. Its correspondents aimed to provide a more balanced perspective on events, particularly focusing on issues important to Arab audiences. The station's motto, \"The View and the Other Point of View,\" reflects its goal of being an uncensored, authentically Arab news source.

Some viewers find this approach informative and entertaining, while others criticize it as sensationalistic. Al-Jazeera has been accused of creating inflammatory lead-in segments to news reports, featuring montages of violence in conflict zones like the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The station's coverage of Operation Iraqi Freedom included showing civilian casualties, exploding bombs, and U.S. soldiers in civilian areas.

Al-Jazeera has been praised for providing a platform for Arab opposition movements to criticize their governments freely, breaking taboos in Arab media. However, it has also faced criticism for perceived lack of objectivity, with some analysts claiming its reporting is slanted towards a popular pan-Arab, pan-Islamist viewpoint. Critics like Fouad Ajami of Johns Hopkins University argue that Al-Jazeera's reporters see themselves as anti-imperialists, playing to an Arab audience and feeding political bitterness. Moafac Harb, director of network news for Radio Sawa, criticizes Al-Jazeera for feigning objectivity by inviting U.S. and Israeli officials while presenting one-sided news stories lacking neutrality. U.S. Ambassador Chris Ross acknowledges Al-Jazeera's clear point of view but emphasizes the station's role in opening up intellectual and cultural life in the Arab world.

Despite defenders pointing out bias in all media outlets, Al-Jazeera was commended for providing airtime to dissenting opinions. Al-Jazeera has been praised for giving a voice to all sides in conflicts like the Palestinian uprising and the war in Afghanistan. Despite speculation on how it operates freely in a restrictive media environment, commentators point to Qatar's political and social reforms as key factors. Qatar's stability and economic prosperity, with a high per capita income and a majority of foreign workers, have been leveraged through Al-Jazeera's progressive reporting style to promote the country's image as a modern state in the Middle East. Despite the government's attempt to distance itself from the news outlet, Al-Jazeera indirectly serves Qatar's foreign policy goals by increasing the country's visibility and influence. Al-Jazeera's independence may be compromised due to reliance on Qatari state financing, hindering profitability. Market conditions and reluctance of Arab conglomerates to advertise on the station have led to annual deficits, despite a lean workforce of 775 employees. Al-Jazeera's financial dependence on Qatar blurs its status as a private or public news organization, with Qatar funding its budget while exerting little editorial control. Despite promoting an independent image, the station faces annual deficits and struggles to attract advertisers, raising questions about its true independence. Al-Jazeera's ambiguous status raises questions about its independence and financial sustainability. Critics note its lack of scrutiny towards Qatar compared to other Arab governments, while executives argue that Qatar's stability reduces the need for criticism. Al-Jazeera's coverage of financial and political deals between Arab governments and Israel has been criticized for not investigating Qatar's trade office in Tel Aviv or its relationship with the U.S. military. While the station covered a U.S. war game in Qatar in 2002, it has not thoroughly examined the U.S. military presence in the country. Additionally, Al-Jazeera's coverage of Iraq has received both praise and criticism, with the station outmaneuvering other networks during the Iraq-U.S. confrontation in 1998. Al-Jazeera's coverage of the 2003 war in Iraq was praised for its access inside Iraq but criticized for being sensationalistic and biased in its reporting on the U.S. military operation. The network's popularity and credibility in the Middle East were established during Operation Desert Fox, where it obtained an exclusive interview with Saddam Hussein.

Hays Parks, a special assistant to the Judge Advocate General of the Army, criticized Al-Jazeera for airing a tape of U.S. soldiers in humiliating circumstances, violating the Geneva Convention. Al-Jazeera's broadcasts were labeled as inflammatory and biased towards showing Iraqi suffering rather than celebrating the downfall of Saddam Hussein. The network also faced criticism for its coverage of wounded children in a Baghdad hospital, with a correspondent expressing dismay over broken promises of a \"clean war.\" Al-Jazeera has faced criticism for its biased terminology and coverage, with accusations of being anti-U.S. and promoting U.S. propaganda.

Accusations of U.S. targeting journalists were denied. Relations with the U.S. military improved, according to Al-Jazeera producer Omar al-Issawi. In postwar Iraq, Al-Jazeera's coverage continues to be critical of the United States, labeling Iraqi attacks against U.S. forces as \"resistance\" to the \"occupation.\" The news network gained global attention due to its proximity to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, despite facing criticism for biased reporting.

Al-Jazeera faced criticism for airing Osama Bin Laden's speeches, with Western media accusing the network of being a mouthpiece for Al Qaeda. Many analysts believe Al Qaeda chose Al-Jazeera due to its large Arabic-speaking audience and lack of governmental scrutiny. Al-Jazeera's London Bureau Chief, Yosri Fouda, interviewed top Al Qaeda leaders and was chosen by them to tell their story. Fouda was chosen by Al Qaeda leaders to tell their story because they believed he was more secular and credible. Al Qaeda saw Al-Jazeera as an outlet willing to present their point of view without editorializing. Fouda is described as a chameleon who can easily mix in different social settings. Al-Jazeera's coverage of U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq was criticized for airing Taliban claims without U.S. response and focusing on Afghan civilian suffering. Critics noted the station's different framing of the war as \"the war on what it calls terror.\" Al-Jazeera's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been criticized for its perceived bias towards the Arab perspective, with some arguing that objectivity is challenging due to the reporters' personal connections to the region. Al-Jazeera has faced criticism for broadcasting interviews with Israeli officials, a practice not common among Arab media channels. Despite accusations of collaboration with Israel, Al-Jazeera maintains its coverage approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Al-Jazeera's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been criticized for its personalization of news, emphasizing Arab and Muslim victimization. Experts suggest this approach is also seen in their coverage of Iraq and Afghanistan. Mamoun Fandy highlighted an instance where Al-Jazeera mistakenly replaced the US with Israel in their reporting on the Iraq war. Al-Jazeera has faced criticism for allegedly promoting anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli views, with accusations of sensationalizing news to boost ratings.

Al-Arabiya, a new competitor news network in Dubai's media city, has received financial backing from conservative sources. Despite Al-Jazeera's popularity, many viewers still seek local news coverage in the Middle East. Al-Jazeera's high subscription cost makes it popular outside the Middle East as well. Subscribers in the US can order Al-Jazeera through satellite dish companies bundled with other channels for a few hundred dollars a year. Al-Jazeera's ability to cover breaking news and its pan-Arab, pan-Islamist projection have contributed to its success. Al-Jazeera's influence in promoting its pan-Arab, pan-Islamist approach to news coverage has led to discussions among U.S. officials and analysts on how to respond. Some experts warn against overt U.S. action, suggesting it could be seen as heavy-handed. Al-Jazeera claims that U.S. efforts to promote balanced media in the Arab world may backfire. Congress allocated $30.5 million for the Middle East Television Network in 2003.

The METN aims to explain America's policies, people, and culture to the Middle East through TV. The Broadcasting Board of Governors also sponsors Radio Sawa, an Arabic radio station. Some suggest tying foreign aid to media reform and buying commercial air time on Arab networks to promote balanced media in the region. The Office of Public Diplomacy implemented the \"Shared Values Program\" to promote positive images of Muslim life in America through TV advertisements in various countries. The State Department stopped running the commercials after Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon refused to air them on state-run television. Policy experts suggest engaging Arab media more actively by having U.S. officials, especially those fluent in Arabic, appear on channels like Al-Jazeera to convey confidence in U.S. foreign policy. Some analysts suggest U.S. officials should appear on moderate Arab satellite networks to counter Al-Jazeera's bias. Encouraging privatization of media and funding media reform programs through MEPI could promote freedom of the press in Arab states. Some argue that focusing on solving the Arab-Israeli conflict could combat biased coverage by channels like Al-Jazeera. Despite U.S. engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan, Al-Jazeera will continue to report on U.S. foreign policy to the Arab world."
