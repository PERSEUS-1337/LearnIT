    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Common Sense Housing Investment Act of 2012\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress acknowledges the disparity in achieving the goals of increasing home ownership and providing affordable rental housing. There is a significant imbalance in budgetary resources allocated towards supporting home ownership compared to affordable rental housing. Renters face a greater burden of housing costs, with a shortage of nearly 7 million affordable homes for low-income families. Only a quarter of eligible families receive rental housing assistance. Public housing facilities in the United States have over $26 billion in deferred maintenance, leading to the loss of 10,000 units annually. The low-income housing tax credit provides 100,000 affordable housing units each year. Tax reform commissions suggest capping the mortgage interest deduction, as it primarily benefits the top 20% of earners. Less than half of tax filers with a home mortgage claim this deduction. Only 9 percent of rural tax filers claim the mortgage interest deduction, with 96 percent of homes sold between 2000 and 2009 selling for less than $500,000. A better approach is needed to provide equitable benefits for families buying homes, assist low- and moderate-income homeowners, and invest in affordable rental housing for those in need. SEC. 3. REPLACEMENT OF MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION WITH MORTGAGE INTEREST CREDIT. This section introduces a nonrefundable credit for interest on indebtedness secured by a qualified residence. The tax code allows a 20 percent credit for qualified residence interest paid by individuals. Qualified residence interest includes acquisition and home equity indebtedness on the taxpayer's qualified residence. The determination of qualified residence is made at the time the interest is accrued. The tax code limits the aggregate amount of indebtedness for qualified residence interest to $500,000 ($250,000 for married individuals filing separately). Acquisition indebtedness refers to debt incurred in acquiring, constructing, or improving a qualified residence, secured by the residence, including refinanced debt meeting these criteria. The tax code limits qualified residence interest indebtedness to $500,000 ($250,000 for married individuals filing separately), including acquisition indebtedness for acquiring, constructing, or improving a qualified residence. Home equity indebtedness is any debt secured by a qualified residence, not exceeding the fair market value reduced by acquisition indebtedness. The aggregate home equity indebtedness cannot exceed $100,000 ($50,000 for married individuals). The tax code limits qualified residence interest indebtedness to $500,000 ($250,000 for married individuals filing separately). A qualified residence includes the principal residence and one other selected by the taxpayer for the taxable year. Married couples not filing jointly are treated as one taxpayer for this purpose. The tax code allows individuals to consider one principal residence and one other residence for qualified residence interest indebtedness. If a taxpayer does not rent a dwelling unit during the taxable year, it can still be treated as a residence. Security interests cannot be disregarded solely due to ineffective enforceability under state or local laws. The tax code allows individuals to consider one principal residence and one other residence for qualified residence interest indebtedness. Security interests cannot be disregarded solely due to ineffective enforceability under state or local laws. Special rules apply for estates and trusts regarding qualified residence interest. Taxpayers may elect to apply this section instead of the deduction under section 163 for qualified residence interest. Phaseout of the deduction is also addressed in the code.
