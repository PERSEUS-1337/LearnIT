    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom from Government Competition Act of 2009\". Congress finds that private sector businesses are the strength of the US economic system, and unfair government competition is detrimental. Current laws have not effectively addressed this issue. The Federal Government should rely on the private sector to provide goods and services for Federal agencies to avoid unfair competition. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"agency\" in this Act refers to executive departments, military departments, and independent establishments. SEC. 4. PROCUREMENT FROM PRIVATE SOURCES. The Federal Government policy is to not compete with citizens and rely on commercial sources for products and services. Federal employees should only perform inherently governmental functions. The Federal Government policy is to obtain goods and services from private sources, except in specific circumstances such as when required by law or for national defense or homeland security. The Federal Government policy is to obtain goods and services from private sources, except in specific circumstances such as national defense or homeland security, when a good or service is inherently governmental, or when there is no private source capable of providing it. Goods and services not exempt must be procured through divestiture of Federal involvement or by awarding contracts to private sector entities using competitive procedures. The Federal Government policy is to obtain goods and services from private sources, except in specific circumstances such as national defense or homeland security. Goods and services not exempt must be procured through divestiture of Federal involvement or by awarding contracts to private sector entities using competitive procedures. Additionally, activities can be converted to performance by a qualified firm owned by an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian Organization, or through a public-private competitive sourcing analysis to determine the best value for the taxpayer. The head of an agency may use Federal employees to provide goods or services previously offered by a private entity after a competitive sourcing analysis to ensure the best value for the taxpayer. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will establish regulations to enforce compliance with this policy when using Federal funds. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, along with the Comptroller General of the United States, will conduct a study to evaluate agency activities, including commercial and inherently governmental ones. A report will be submitted to Congress before June 30 each year, assessing exemptions and outlining a schedule for transferring commercial activities to the private sector within 5 years."
