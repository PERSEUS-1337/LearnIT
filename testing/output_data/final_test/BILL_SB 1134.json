    "title": "SB 1134",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1473 of the Penal Code is amended to allow a person unlawfully imprisoned to file a writ of habeas corpus for reasons such as false evidence introduced during a hearing or trial, or false physical evidence that influenced a guilty plea. New evidence that is credible, material, and could have changed the trial outcome can be grounds for a writ of habeas corpus. The prosecution's knowledge of false evidence is not relevant to the habeas corpus proceedings. This section does not limit the grounds for a writ of habeas corpus. For the purposes of this section, \"false evidence\" includes expert opinions that have been disavowed by the expert or undermined by later scientific research. This section does not impose additional liabilities on experts who retract their opinions or whose opinions are contradicted by new research. Section 1485.5 of the Penal Code is amended. Section 1485.5 of the Penal Code is amended to state that if the district attorney or Attorney General agrees to or does not dispute the facts underlying a writ of habeas corpus or motion to vacate a judgment, those facts will be binding on them and the California Victim Compensation Board. The district attorney must notify the Attorney General before agreeing to facts for such motions. In contested or uncontested legal proceedings, court's factual findings, including credibility determinations, are binding on the Attorney General, factfinder, and California Victim Compensation Board. \"Express factual findings\" are the basis for the court's ruling. The definition of \"court\" includes state or federal courts. Section 1485.55 of the Penal Code is amended. Section 1485.55 of the Penal Code is amended to state that in contested proceedings, a finding of factual innocence by the court shall be binding on the California Victim Compensation Board for claims, leading to a recommendation for payment without a hearing. If the court grants a writ of habeas corpus but does not find factual innocence, the petitioner may seek a finding of innocence based on evidence that the crime was not committed or not by them. If a judgment is vacated under Section 1473.6, the petitioner can seek a finding of factual innocence by proving the crime was not committed or not by them. If proven, the board will recommend payment without a hearing. No presumption exists for failure to make a motion or obtain a favorable ruling. If a federal court finds a petitioner factually innocent by a preponderance of the evidence, the board will recommend payment without a hearing to the Legislature for an appropriation."
