    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature in California declares that a child of a minor parent or nonminor dependent parent should not be considered at risk of abuse or neglect based solely on the parent's past history or health diagnoses. If one or both minor parents have been deemed dependent children of the juvenile court, certain provisions of the law do not apply unless specific circumstances are present. In California, efforts must be made to prevent the removal of a child born to minor parents through remedial services. These efforts should involve the child's extended family, social services agencies, caregivers, and other service providers. The definitions of \"child\" and \"minor parent\" are as set forth in Section 16002.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. Section 825.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code requires court files for minor dependent parents to be kept separate from files for the child in dependency proceedings. Records can be disclosed to the county and court, but only admitted as evidence with a court order. Any party in the proceedings can request the records to be used as evidence. Section 16002.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. The Legislature aims to support families headed by minor and nonminor dependent parents by placing them together in a family-like setting, unless it poses a risk to the child. The State Department of Social Services is required to collect and make publicly available data on parenting minor and nonminor dependents, including information on their age, ethnicity, placement type, time in care, number of children, and parental status. The State Department of Social Services collects data on parenting minor and nonminor dependents, including their placement type, time in care, number of children, and parental status. Minor parents and nonminor dependent parents and their children are provided access to services to support the parent-child bond and the parent's ability to provide a safe home, such as child care, parenting classes, and visitation. Child welfare agencies may offer support to minor parents and nonminor dependent parents through trained social workers or resource specialists. They are encouraged to update case plans for pregnant and parenting dependents promptly and hold specialized conferences to assist with healthy parenting planning and access to resources. The conferences involve the pregnant or parenting minor or nonminor dependent, family members, supportive adults, and trained professionals. The specialized conference for pregnant and parenting dependents involves trained professionals, family members, and supportive adults. Participation is voluntary, and access to resources is not dependent on attending the conference. The minor parents and nonminor dependent parents are encouraged to attend school, complete homework, and engage in age-appropriate activities apart from parenting. Efforts are made by child welfare agencies and educational institutions to provide access to school programs with childcare for those who haven't finished high school. Foster care placements for minor parents and nonminor dependent parents must provide support and assistance, preserve the family unit, and refer parents to preventive services. Contact between the child, custodial parent, and noncustodial parent should be facilitated if in the child's best interest. \"Child\" refers to the child of the minor parent, and \"minor parent\" refers to a dependent child who is also a parent. The section defines \"nonminor dependent parent\" as a nonminor dependent who is also a parent. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
