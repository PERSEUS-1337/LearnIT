This amendment aims to improve support for students with mental illness and reduce dropout rates and suicide statistics among youth. The Secretary will award grants to State educational agencies for programs educating school personnel on mental health conditions in children. Eligible local educational agencies can receive subgrants for this purpose. Eligible agencies include those in partnership with mental health organizations or community nonprofits. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of \"eligible State educational agency,\" \"school personnel,\" and \"specialized instructional support personnel.\" These terms are important for understanding the grant program for educating school personnel on mental health conditions in children. The curr_chunk defines \"school personnel\" as professionals providing various services to meet student needs. Eligible State educational agencies can apply for grants under this section to support activities related to mental health education for school personnel.

The eligible local educational agency must support a training program developed by the school or a community organization with expertise in mental illness. The program involves school counselors, psychologists, and social workers providing training to school personnel on understanding children's mental health needs. The program for understanding children's mental health needs includes annual in-service training for teachers, school personnel, and support staff to better recognize mental health conditions, communicate with families, implement classroom strategies, and understand school-specific information. The training program for schools includes linking students to mental health services, providing information on school services, incorporating family perspectives, and covering all areas of the state.
