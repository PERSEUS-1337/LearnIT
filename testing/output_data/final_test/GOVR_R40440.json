    "content": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Rothe Development Corporation v. Department of Defense, a case challenging the constitutionality of the DOD's \"small disadvantaged business\" program. The program aimed to award contracts to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, with a 10% price evaluation adjustment. Rothe Development Corporation contested the program's constitutionality after losing a contract. Rothe Development Corporation challenged the constitutionality of the DOD's SDB program after losing a contract to a Korean-American-owned firm. The Federal Circuit found the program unconstitutional due to lack of evidence for race-conscious contracting. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division, followed the Circuit's decision in Rothe by enjoining defense agencies from implementing programs authorized by Section 1207 that provided assistance to minority-serving institutions. However, the 111th Congress responded by enacting legislation allowing defense agencies to provide similar assistance. The Obama Administration proposed amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in response to the Rothe decision, which would impact contracting programs for minority-owned and women-owned small businesses. The proposed changes include deleting provisions governing price evaluation adjustments for small disadvantaged businesses and relocating provisions related to monetary incentives and evaluation factors for subcontracting. The report analyzes Rothe's potential effect on programs like the Business Development Program under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. The Rothe decision could have significant implications for federal contracting programs for small businesses, including subcontracting programs under Sections 8(a) and (d) of the Small Business Act. The case involved a constitutional challenge to DOD's SDB program, which aimed to achieve a 5% contract goal for minorities. Section 1207 established a 5% contract goal for DOD to award to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. DOD was required to take steps like making advance payments and providing technical assistance to meet this goal. Additionally, DOD had discretion to use less competitive procedures and apply price adjustments for small disadvantaged businesses. The SDB program, based on Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, aimed to assist socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Section 1207, initially for DOD in FY1987-1989, later included NASA and the Coast Guard until 2009. Re-enactments extended contracting goals for minorities, but lacked evidence of discrimination in defense contracting according to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) temporarily granted other federal agencies the authority for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses, but these provisions were not reauthorized after FY2003. While Section 1207 set a 5% goal for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses, other government-wide goals also exist. The Small Business Act requires the federal government to award at least 5% of all contract dollars to small disadvantaged businesses, with similar goals established by DOD in conjunction with the SBA. Section 644(g) does not allow agencies to use price evaluation adjustments to meet contracting goals. The constitutionality of Section 1207 was challenged in the Rothe case due to DOD awarding a contract using its price evaluation adjustment authority. The Air Force awarded a contract to International Computer and Telecommunications, Inc. (ICT) after subtracting 10% from their bid, making it the lowest. RDC, not eligible for the price evaluation adjustment, filed a lawsuit alleging that Section 1207 deprived them of equal protection under the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit focused on the 1992 and 2006 re-enactments of Section 1207. The lawsuit focused on the 2006 re-enactment of Section 1207, with DOD arguing it satisfied the strict scrutiny standard. The claims and defenses in the Rothe litigation were based on the U.S. Constitution and equal protection under the Fifth Amendment. Consideration of race by the federal government is constitutional only if it meets the strict scrutiny test, requiring a narrowly tailored program to further a compelling government interest. The government must identify discrimination specifically and have a strong basis in evidence before implementing race-conscious remedies. The burden is on the government to provide statistical evidence of discrimination to support their actions. The government must provide statistical evidence of discrimination to support their actions in implementing race-conscious remedies. Plaintiffs challenging the government's action have the burden of persuasion in refuting the government's evidence and establishing race-neutral explanations for any alleged racial disparities. Federal courts issued opinions prior to the Federal Circuit's November 2008 decision, upholding the constitutionality of Section 1207 and denying relief to the plaintiffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit transferred the case to the Federal Circuit due to claims under the Tucker Act and the U.S. Constitution. The Federal Circuit vacated the district court's decision in Rothe v. DOD, remanding it for further proceedings as strict scrutiny was not applied. The court found that DOD failed to demonstrate sufficient evidence of discrimination when Section 1207 was re-enacted in 1992, but had shown such evidence in 2002. The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on the as-applied challenge and remanded for consideration of the facial challenge. RDC appealed the district court's summary judgment on the facial challenge, leading to the Federal Circuit's decision on November 4, 2008. The Federal Circuit's decision on November 4, 2008, found Section 1207 unconstitutional on its face due to lack of evidence supporting race-conscious contracting necessity. The district court's upheld constitutionality in \"Rothe VI\" was based on disparity studies, which the Federal Circuit disagreed with. The Federal Circuit found significant flaws in the disparity studies used to support race-conscious contracting necessity, stating they lacked a strong basis in evidence and did not provide a broad statistical foundation. These studies failed to exclude unqualified businesses and did not consider the capacity of minority-owned small businesses in government contracting. The studies only covered a small fraction of regions in the United States, leading the Federal Circuit to deem them inadequate. The Federal Circuit found flaws in disparity studies supporting race-conscious contracting, deeming them insufficient for the nationwide SDB program. Other statistical data and anecdotes were also considered inadequate for the program. Some evidence mentioned in floor speeches lacked congressional findings and descriptions. The Federal Circuit criticized the lack of sufficient evidence to support the nationwide SDB program, including anecdotal evidence and disparity studies. The court noted a lack of specific instances of discrimination in DOD contracts, casting doubt on the government's justification for the program. The Federal Circuit criticized the lack of evidence supporting the nationwide SDB program, including anecdotal evidence and disparity studies. The court noted a lack of specific instances of discrimination in DOD contracts, casting doubt on the government's justification for the program. In discrimination, as required under City of Richmond v. Croson, a government entity can resort to racial classifications in situations when it is not remedying its own prior discrimination if it can show it is a \"passive participant\" in a system of racial exclusion practiced by industry. The Federal Circuit remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, declaring Section 1207 as facially unconstitutional and enjoining the application of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2323. The district court disagreed with the government's argument to limit the judgment to specific subsections of Section 1207, instead striking down the entirety of Section 1207 as unconstitutional. This included provisions allowing awards to various minority-serving institutions to count towards DOD's 5% goal. The district court struck down Section 1207 in its entirety, including provisions for HUBZone small businesses, HBCUs, HSIs, ANNHIs, and MMIs to count towards DOD's 5% goal. Provisions for technical and infrastructure assistance, advance payments, and definitions were also addressed. The court rejected arguments that preferences for HUBZone businesses are race neutral and ruled that RDC has standing to challenge infrastructure assistance to colleges and universities. The Under Secretary of Defense directed that activities relying on 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2323 authority should cease, including contracts, advance payments, grants, and scholarships. The Department of the Army clarified that options under existing contracts should not be exercised if funding solely came from Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2323. Army's goals for assistance to HBCUs remain as aspirational goals. The Army's goals for assistance to HBCUs remain in effect as aspirational goals, with pre-existing agreements able to continue until they lapse. The 111th Congress established a new program to assist HBCUs, HSIs, ANNHIs, MMIs, and other MSIs in defense-related research activities. The Obama Administration proposed amending the FAR to delete portions governing price evaluation in light of court decisions. The Administration proposes to delete portions of the FAR governing price evaluation adjustments for small disadvantaged businesses in defense contracts. It also plans to relocate provisions related to monetary incentives and evaluation factors for subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses. These changes are in response to the Rothe decision and could impact federal contract percentages. The Rothe decision could have significant implications for federal contract dollars awarded to minority-owned small businesses and other small business contracting programs. The demise of DOD's price evaluation adjustment authority may not be significant on its own, but the decision could impact programs for small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small businesses, potentially leading to constitutional challenges. The Rothe decision could impact federal contract dollars awarded to minority-owned small businesses, potentially decreasing the percentage of contracts. DOD's price evaluation adjustment authority is barred, affecting programs for small disadvantaged and women-owned businesses, leading to potential constitutional challenges. In FY2010, DOD spent $367.1 billion on contract awards, accounting for 68% of federal contract spending. DOD's authority under Section 1207 is crucial for meeting minority-contracting goals, as it is the only provision in federal law allowing agencies to take specific steps in meeting their contracting goals. The Rothe decision removed DOD's authority under Section 1207 to increase federal contract dollars awarded to minority-owned businesses, potentially impacting contracting with such businesses. Despite concerns, immediate decline is not certain due to other provisions of law. The Rothe decision removed DOD's authority to increase federal contract dollars awarded to minority-owned businesses. DOD has not granted price evaluation adjustments in over a decade due to Section 801 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act. This provision barred DOD from granting adjustments in fiscal years following ones where at least 5% of contract dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses. The impact of Rothe on contracting with minority-owned small businesses may only be fully felt if DOD fails to meet the 5% goal or if Section 801 is repealed. The Rothe decision could have significant implications for federal contracting with minority-owned small businesses, as it removed DOD's authority to increase contract dollars awarded to such businesses. While DOD has not granted price evaluation adjustments in over a decade, other provisions of law also set goals for contracting with minority-owned small businesses. The SBA's \"Procurement Scorecards\" track agencies' progress towards these goals, which may help keep agencies and the public informed. The impact of Rothe on contracting with minority-owned small businesses may be felt even if immediate declines do not occur. The Rothe decision could have significant implications for federal contracting with minority-owned small businesses, as it removed DOD's authority to increase contract dollars awarded to such businesses. This could potentially impact programs like the Business Development Program under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, which support minority-owned small businesses. There are government-wide programs providing contracting assistance to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, with goals for prime contracts and subcontracts awarded by federal agencies. The federal government and individual agencies support subcontracting with small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals through programs like the 8(a) Business Development Program. Contract clauses and plans are included in prime contracts to encourage subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses. Evaluation factors and incentives are used to promote subcontracting with these businesses. Technical assistance and outreach programs are also provided for small disadvantaged businesses participating in the program. These programs presume that minorities are socially and economically disadvantaged, similar to the DOD's SDB program. The federal government supports subcontracting with small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals through programs like the 8(a) Business Development Program. Some federal contracting assistance programs may be vulnerable to constitutional challenges, such as those involving aspirational goals and technical assistance. Programs like subcontracting under Sections 8(a) and (d) of the Small Business Act may be more vulnerable due to potential bid protests and contract disputes. The federal government supports subcontracting with small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals through programs like the 8(a) Business Development Program. Some federal contracting assistance programs may face constitutional challenges, but aspirational goals encouraging contract dollars to small disadvantaged businesses are likely not vulnerable. The federal government supports subcontracting with small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals through programs like the 8(a) Business Development Program. Problems arise when actions to meet goals result in disparate treatment, but technical assistance and outreach programs for minority-owned small businesses are unlikely to face constitutional challenges. The Department of Justice (DOJ) stated that minority outreach and recruitment programs are generally not subject to strict scrutiny, even when targeted to minorities, citing precedents that such programs do not result in unequal treatment. Potential challenges to these programs may be limited by the doctrine of standing, requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate injury, causation, and standing to challenge them. Standing to challenge technical assistance or outreach programs targeted to minorities may be difficult to establish, as plaintiffs must prove injury, causation, and redressibility. Plaintiffs' alleged decreased ability to compete with minority firms due to federal programs may not be easily attributed solely to the programs or remedied by their cessation. \"Taxpayer standing\" is generally not recognized, preventing potential plaintiffs from claiming harm from government spending on minority-owned small business programs. The programs under Sections 8(a) and (d) of the Small Business Act and the FAR are highly susceptible to challenges for minority-owned small businesses. These programs allow agencies to assist small disadvantaged businesses more concretely, potentially leading to bid protests or contract disputes. The programs could be seen as subjecting individuals to different treatment by setting aside contracts for competitions limited to small businesses in the 8(a) Business Development Program. Challenges to federal procurement activities involving programs like the 8(a) program could lead to bid protests or contract disputes. Disappointed bidders or offerors may have standing to challenge agencies' decisions on subcontracting, evaluation factors, or monetary incentives favoring minority-contractors. Incumbent contractors also have standing to challenge agency actions in contract disputes. Standing to challenge agency actions in contract disputes, such as terminating a contractor or imposing liquidated damages for failure to abide by an 8(d) subcontracting plan, may be difficult to establish outside the 8(a) context. Subcontractors alleging non-selection by prime contractors due to aspirational, not mandatory, aspects of federal programs may face challenges in showing standing. The 8(d) subcontracting plans require agencies to \"encourage subcontracting opportunities\" for small disadvantaged businesses without mandating specific steps for prime contractors to meet goals. Rothe could serve as precedent for the court deciding the challenge for several reasons. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims and the Federal Circuit are the only judicial forums with jurisdiction to hear federal bid protests and contract disputes. Plaintiffs can generally select their forum and would have little incentive to avoid courts where Rothe is precedent. The programs under Sections 8(a) and (d) of the Small Business Act, as well as the evaluation factors, are also important considerations. The 5% goal in Section 1207, coupled with the price evaluation adjustment authority, can be seen as quota-like, unlike other federal programs. Section 8(a) and the FAR do not aim for a fixed percentage of subcontracts to be awarded to minority-owned small businesses. The FAR allows agencies to consider prime contractors' performance in subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses, but does not require specific steps to meet goals. Contractors' failure to meet goals in their subcontracting plans is excused if they acted in good faith. Evidence of discrimination may justify race-conscious programs. The \"strong basis in evidence\" test focuses on the evidence before Congress when enacting race-conscious remedies in response to discrimination. Each program may have unique evidence, and failure of evidence in one program doesn't mean others are inadequate. Even if Congress lacked strong evidence, the Secretary of Commerce's determinations may provide a sufficient basis for programs. Agencies can use evaluation factors and incentives in industries where the Secretary found \"substantial\" opportunities. The Small Business Administration extended the comment period on its proposed rule for the contracting assistance program for women-owned small businesses under Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act due to concerns about gender classifications and equal protection review under the Constitution. The Small Business Administration extended the comment period for the contracting assistance program for women-owned small businesses under Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act to review evidence on gender classifications. The SBA issued new proposed regulations for the program, stating that the means chosen by Congress ensure the program is substantially related to its goals. The Small Business Administration extended the comment period for the contracting assistance program for women-owned small businesses under Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act. Congress limited the WOSB Program to industries where women are underrepresented in contracting. SBA issued final regulations without addressing constitutional issues. The focus of any challenges would likely be on the disparity studies determining eligible industries. The Rothe decision should not impact other federal contracting programs for small businesses. The constitutionality of programs for small businesses owned by various demographic groups is determined by the level of scrutiny applied. Programs based on non-suspect classifications like business size, military status, disability, geography, or poverty are subject to rational basis review, where deference to legislative judgment is given. Challenges to these programs are generally upheld if they are rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The Rothe decision may influence future legal decisions in this area. The Rothe decision may impact future legal challenges regarding race-conscious measures or legislation subject to strict scrutiny. Congress must establish a \"strong basis in evidence\" to support compelling governmental interests, as required by the Supreme Court. Subsequent court cases have clarified this requirement, indicating when such a basis exists or is lacking in specific circumstances. The Rothe court's approach to the \"strong basis in evidence\" requirement did not depart significantly from precedent, placing an increasing evidentiary burden on Congress. This contrasts with the initial deference to congressional authority following the Adarand Constructors v. Pe\u00f1a decision, which has eroded over the years. Congress now faces a heavier burden in enacting remedial legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment. The erosion of deference to congressional authority requires Congress to support race-conscious measures with strong statistical evidence of discrimination to withstand judicial scrutiny."
