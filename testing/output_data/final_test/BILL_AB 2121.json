    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Responsible Beverage Service Training Program Act of 2016, also known as Article 4, Section 25680, defines an accredited training provider as one accredited by ANSI or another authorized agency for RBS training courses. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to alcohol service, including \"alcohol server,\" \"RBS training course,\" and \"self-training and assessment.\" These terms are essential for understanding the regulations outlined in Section 25681. Beginning July 1, 2020, alcohol servers must complete an RBS training course within three months of employment and every three years thereafter. Licensees are responsible for ensuring compliance, and a current certificate from an accredited provider is required. Nonprofit organizations holding temporary alcohol licenses must designate trained individuals to be present at events. The department must establish a list of RBS training courses by January 1, 2020, consisting of at least four hours of instruction covering the social impact of alcohol, its effects on the body, state laws, intervention techniques, and management policies. The RBS training course provides basic instruction on various elements and can be completed through trainer-led classes or self-training. A certificate or card is issued upon successful completion with a minimum score of 70%. The certificate is valid for three years, and additional training standards may be established by the department. Beginning January 1, 2019, the department will include RBS training course requirements on license applications and renewal notices. The cost of a training course should not exceed $15, and at least one course must be offered in Spanish. The department may authorize accreditation agencies to accredit training providers, in addition to ANSI, and collect fees for the approval process. Beginning July 1, 2020, authorized licensees must maintain records to show compliance with the section. Violations by licensees, agents, employees, or alcohol servers will result in civil and administrative penalties. Alcohol servers are also subject to Section 25602."
