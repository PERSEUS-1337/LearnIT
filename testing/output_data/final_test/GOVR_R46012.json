    "content": "The increasing migration across the Southwest border of the United States has posed challenges to federal agencies. Unauthorized migration flows, measured by the number of migrants apprehended by DHS's CBP, had been declining until FY2017. However, in FY2018 and FY2019, apprehensions increased significantly. The recent increases have been characterized as a border security issue. The recent increases in migration across the Southwest border have been characterized as a border security and humanitarian crisis by some Members of Congress and former CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. McAleenan emphasized the difference in the characteristics of apprehended migrants and the risks they face, stating that it is both a border security and humanitarian crisis. The demographics of migrants at the Southwest border have changed significantly in the past decade. Previously, Mexican adult males seeking U.S. employment dominated unauthorized migrant flows. Now, migrants from the \"Northern Triangle\" countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras make up the largest group, with smaller numbers coming from other regions such as South America, the Caribbean, Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia. Migrant flows in the past decade have shifted towards families and unaccompanied children, with a growing number seeking asylum and protection from violence. Factors pushing migrants to make the journey include poverty, inequality, high crime rates, and vulnerability to natural disasters in the Northern Triangle. Pull factors include U.S. asylum policies that allow asylum seekers to remain in the country while awaiting processing. Recently, most asylum seekers were allowed to stay in the United States while awaiting a decision on their cases. Court backlogs enable migrants to reunite with family and work after six months. Some argue that recent migrant flows challenge the rule of law, questioning the legitimacy of asylum claims. Others see it as a legitimate international humanitarian crisis. The recent migrant flows are seen as a legitimate international humanitarian crisis due to violent circumstances in migrants' countries of origin. Observers believe the crisis at the border reflects the inability of U.S. federal agencies to process arriving migrants and adjudicate their immigration claims. Resource challenges include capacity shortfalls in holding facilities, lack of appropriate detention centers for families, reassignment of personnel, and immigration court backlogs causing delays in proceedings. DHS has been forced to release migrants due to resource constraints and legal restrictions on detention times. The Trump Administration has implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), also known as the \"remain in Mexico\" policy, to address the increase in unauthorized migration flows. This program allows DHS to return migrants to Mexico to await their court proceedings, with the assistance of the Mexican government. The Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), also known as the \"remain in Mexico\" policy, is being implemented by the Trump Administration with the assistance of the government of Mexico. The program operates in six border locations and aims to address unauthorized migration flows. Recent migrant apprehension trends at the Southwest border are discussed, highlighting changes in migration patterns in terms of numbers, origin countries, demographics, and motivations. The report also touches on policy implications and the context of border security debates. Border security has been a congressional focus since the 1970s, with increased attention after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Current debates center on securing the Southwest border with barriers and Border Patrol agents. CBP's primary mission is to secure the border while facilitating trade and travel. Foreign nationals arriving without valid documentation can seek asylum if they fear persecution or torture in their country. The CBP is responsible for monitoring the Southwest border with Mexico, which is the main entry point for unauthorized migration, illicit drugs, counterfeit products, and trafficked children. They also inspect individuals and vehicles at U.S. ports of entry for security purposes. Between ports of entry, the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) and the Office of Field Operations (OFO) monitor the Southwest border, collecting statistics on individuals who cross illegally or are denied entry. USBP agents apprehend those not lawfully present, while OFO officers inspect at ports of entry and deny entry to noncitizens without valid documents or deemed \"inadmissible\" for various reasons. Inadmissible migrants accounted for 27%, 24%, and 13% of all arrivals. Inadmissible migrants accounted for 27%, 24%, and 13% of all migrants arriving at Southwest border ports of entries in FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019, respectively. The number of inadmissible migrants slightly increased from FY2018 to FY2019, but their percentage share of all CBP encounters decreased compared to apprehensions. Apprehensions data historically have been used to gauge trends in unauthorized migration flows, but their effectiveness in measuring border enforcement is limited due to various factors. The data on apprehensions at the Southwest border do not include illegal border crossers who evade USBP agents or those discouraged from attempting entry. It is unclear if increased apprehensions result from more attempts or higher apprehension rates. The statistics may be less relevant now as migrants actively seek out Border Patrol agents to request asylum, overstating apprehension levels. The classification of migrants as apprehensions may exaggerate the effectiveness of border enforcement. Total annual apprehensions at the Southwest border have fluctuated over the years, reaching a 45-year low in FY2017. In FY2019, apprehensions more than doubled to 851,508, the highest level since FY2007. Recent changes in migrant flows have impacted apprehension levels. Apprehensions at the Southwest border peaked at 1.62 million in 1986 after the Immigration Reform and Control Act. Numbers declined but rose again to 1.64 million in FY2000. Apprehensions fell to a low of 327,577 in FY2011 and have since fluctuated. The national origins of apprehended migrants have shifted in the past two decades. In the past two decades, apprehensions at the Southwest border have seen a shift in national origins. In FY2000, almost all apprehended aliens were Mexican nationals, but by FY2019, \"other-than-Mexicans\" made up 81% of apprehensions. The number of Mexican nationals apprehended decreased by 37% from FY2012 to FY2019, while apprehensions from other countries increased significantly. CBP categorizes unauthorized migrants into single adults, family units, and unaccompanied alien children. In FY2012, apprehensions at the Southwest border consisted mainly of single adults, with family units and unaccompanied alien children making up a smaller portion. However, by FY2019, apprehensions of persons in family units had significantly increased, accounting for 65% of all apprehensions. Approximately 48% of family units apprehended in FY2019 were headed by mothers, 44% by fathers, and 8% by others. In FY2019, family units apprehended at the Southwest border were mostly headed by mothers (48%), fathers (44%), or two parents (8%). The national origins of these apprehensions shifted from mostly Mexican in FY2012 to mainly Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran in FY2019. Salvadorans accounted for 35% of family unit apprehensions in FY2016 but declined to 12% in FY2019, while Hondurans and Guatemalans each made up about 39% of the total in FY2019. In FY2019, family units apprehended at the Southwest border were mainly headed by mothers (48%), fathers (44%), or two parents (8%). The national origins shifted from mostly Mexican in FY2012 to mainly Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran in FY2019. Salvadorans accounted for 35% of family unit apprehensions in FY2016 but declined to 12% in FY2019, while Hondurans and Guatemalans each made up about 39% of the total in FY2019. The number of unaccompanied alien children apprehended at the Southwest border has significantly increased over the past decade, reaching 76,020 in FY2019. In FY2019, UAC apprehensions reached 76,020, exceeding the previous peak in FY2014. Approximately 30% of apprehended UAC were girls. The country-of-origin composition has shifted from mostly Mexican to Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran UAC. Mexican UAC made up 14% of all apprehensions in FY2019, while Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran UAC accounted for 16%, 40%, and 27% respectively. The shift in the country-of-origin composition of apprehended UAC has impacted processing and care agencies. Apprehensions follow a seasonal migration cycle, with peak numbers in spring and lower numbers in summer. During FY2019, apprehensions at the Southwestern border followed a seasonal pattern, with lower numbers in the summer months, a decline in fall, and a rise in spring. The total apprehensions declined by nearly 70% from May to September, primarily due to a decrease in family unit apprehensions. The number of persons in family units dropped by 81% during this period. Apprehensions of unaccompanied minors also decreased by 72%, while apprehensions of single adults saw a smaller decline of 42%. The report highlights a decline in apprehensions at the Southwest border from May to September, with a significant decrease in family unit and unaccompanied minor apprehensions. The composition of unauthorized migrant flows has shifted away from primarily Mexican individuals in recent years. The unauthorized migrant flow at the Southwest border has shifted, with a larger number now originating from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. It is no longer dominated by economic migrants seeking employment but includes asylum seekers and those escaping violence. Families and children traveling without parents are now more common, and migrants often seek out Border Patrol agents rather than evading them. This change in migration patterns is also affecting how federal agencies respond. Changing migration patterns at the Southwest border, such as increased travel in large groups and arrivals at remote CBP outposts, are impacting federal agencies' responses. Recent migrants require more resources and personnel for processing, especially those from non-contiguous countries, leading to longer processing times and higher costs. Unaccompanied alien children from non-contiguous countries pose additional challenges for inter-agency coordination. If unaccompanied alien children from noncontiguous countries arrive, they are protected by statutes and put into formal immigration proceedings under ORR custody. Asylum seekers need a credible fear hearing and may be detained in DHS facilities before processing by EOIR. CBP is heavily impacted by the shift in migration patterns, facing challenges with border infrastructure and personnel due to the influx of families and children arriving in large groups. CBP has adjusted operations to accommodate vulnerable migrants and address smuggling tactics. Migration patterns may shift based on perceptions of border enforcement policies. The Trump Administration has implemented changes to reduce unauthorized migration and discourage fraudulent claims for humanitarian relief. The Trump Administration has implemented policy changes to make it harder for migrants to receive asylum, including suspending entry for aliens crossing the Southwest border and implementing the Migrant Protection Protocols. National Guard and active duty personnel have been supporting DHS at the border. In 2019, President Trump declared a national emergency to fund a border barrier with Mexico using $6.1 billion from the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense redirected funds from military construction projects to border barrier projects. An interim rule was issued making aliens ineligible for asylum if they arrive at the Southwest border without seeking protection in other countries first. The U.S. is collaborating with Mexico and Central American governments to reduce migrant flows and improve regional governance. The changing character of recent migrant flows at the Southwest border may make apprehensions less useful for measuring border enforcement. Many apprehended migrants now actively seek out U.S. Border Patrol agents to request asylum, which can increase resource needs for federal agencies due to the more intensive administrative requirements for asylum claims. The challenge of deterring unauthorized migrants from entering the United States has become more complex. Recent migration patterns at the Southwest border show a shift towards more migrants seeking asylum due to civil conflict, violence, weather events, and climate change. Declining birth rates in Latin America and better job opportunities in Mexico have reduced the number of single adult migrants coming for employment. On the other hand, there is an increase in Central American and Mexican families and children seeking humanitarian relief due to high levels of violence and lack of public security. Congress may consider legislative options to address these changing trends. Options for Congress in response to changing migrant flows at the Southwest border include legislative proposals to reshape the system for processing unauthorized migrants seeking humanitarian protection. This could involve greater supervision of released migrants, mandating detailed data collection from DHS, and assessing the impact on border enforcement and the immigration court system."
