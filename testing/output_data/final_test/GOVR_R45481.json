    "content": "The debate over affirmative action in higher education has been reignited in recent years, with a focus on both voluntary consideration of race in admissions and mandatory use of race to address state-imposed segregation. Federal courts have analyzed these issues under the Fourteenth Amendment. The federal courts have analyzed affirmative action under the Fourteenth Amendment, focusing on race-conscious measures in de jure segregated public university systems. The Supreme Court outlined a three-step inquiry in the 1992 case United States v. Fordice to assess if a state has fulfilled its obligation to eliminate discriminatory effects from the segregated system. Outside of this context, affirmative action refers to different practices. The federal courts have upheld affirmative action policies in higher education, specifically the use of race in admissions decisions, under strict scrutiny. These policies aim to increase the representation of racial minorities previously excluded from societal institutions. The educational benefits of a diverse student body justify considering race in admissions decisions. Universities must clearly define their diversity goals and demonstrate how their policies achieve those goals while treating each applicant as an individual. Constitutional requirements for public universities also apply to private colleges receiving federal funds under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The report discusses the role of Title VI in ensuring equal protection in higher education, addressing government-sanctioned racial segregation in institutions of higher education. The Supreme Court has ruled that intentional segregation in higher education violates the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court has held that states must eliminate all discriminatory effects of formerly segregated public university systems. Failure to do so violates the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Maintaining policies traceable to segregation is unconstitutional, allowing for race-conscious measures to address ongoing racial segregation. Race-conscious measures are constitutionally permissible and may be required to remedy unconstitutional remnants of segregation in public university systems. Prior to the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, racially segregated post-secondary schools denied black students admission based on educating white students only. The Equal Protection Clause previously allowed segregated systems if black schools were equal to white schools, as seen in the Sweatt v. Painter case challenging the University of Texas Law School. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a black student challenging the University of Texas Law School's white-only admissions policy in 1946. Despite the state creating a separate law school for black students, the Court found it did not offer an education equal to that of the University of Texas Law School, leading to the plaintiff's admission based on the Equal Protection Clause. The Court's 1954 decision in Brown I declared that race-based segregation in public education violates the Equal Protection Clause, as it deprives minority students of equal opportunities and signifies inferiority. This ruling applies to public higher education, including colleges and universities, as reaffirmed in the subsequent 1955 decision in Brown II. The Supreme Court's application of Brown I and Brown II in higher education was demonstrated in State of Fla. Ex. Rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control, where the Court ordered a white-only law school to admit a black student promptly, emphasizing the need for desegregation without delay. This decision reinforced the principles of equal protection in public education. In the public education context, the Court's equal protection jurisprudence expanded significantly to address dismantling racially segregated systems in public school districts. The duty of formerly segregated public school entities is to eliminate vestiges of unconstitutional de jure systems. In higher education, the Court addressed the state's duty to dismantle a formerly de jure segregated public university system in the 1992 decision United States v. Fordice. In the 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, the Court addressed Mississippi's prior de jure public university system, which remained racially segregated even after admitting its first black student in 1962. Mississippi had created four exclusively white institutions and three exclusively black institutions through 1950, maintaining its segregated university system for 12 years. In 1987, Mississippi's segregated university system remained largely intact, with white students predominantly attending formerly white-only universities. The Court emphasized that eradicating policies traceable to prior segregation is necessary to satisfy constitutional obligations. Simply adopting race-neutral policies is not enough to demonstrate abandonment of the dual system. The Court set out a three-step analysis to determine if a state has satisfied its duty to dismantle its prior de jure public university system, aside from segregative admissions policies. The analysis examines whether the state's policies are traceable to its prior system, such as admissions standards and unnecessary program duplication. The Court's analysis found that current policies traceable to the former de jure system include assignments of academic missions to higher education institutions based on past segregation, despite interim changes or justifications not necessarily severing the connection. The Court's analysis found that current policies traceable to the former de jure system may not be severed by new justifications. If traceability is shown, discriminatory intent may not need to be proven. The focus then shifts to whether these policies have ongoing discriminatory effects in student choice and enrollment. The Court emphasized the need to consider the combined effects of all challenged policies in evaluating whether a state has dismantled its prior de jure segregated system. The focus of the second step is not on establishing causation but on determining if the state has sufficiently dismantled its former system. The state must prove the absence of segregative effects, and policies with discriminatory effects must be reformed. At the third step, the court assesses whether traceable policies can be \"practicably eliminated\" consistent with sound educational practices, with the burden on the state to show that the challenged policies are \"not susceptible to elimination without eroding sound educational policy.\" The Court suggested that if a current policy lacks sound educational justification, it can be practicably eliminated in part or in whole. In some cases, a merger or closure of institutions could be constitutionally required to eliminate vestiges if other methods fail. The Court emphasized that as long as discriminatory vestiges remain, the state is in violation of the Equal Protection Clause unless it can prove it cannot practically eliminate those policies. Justice O'Connor highlighted the narrow circumstances under which a state can maintain segregative policies, stating that the state must show good faith and a heavy burden to justify retaining such practices even if essential for legitimate goals. The Court in Fordice emphasized the need to counteract and minimize the segregative impact of policies, including possible closure or merger of institutions to eliminate discriminatory effects. However, it did not specify which institutions would be subject to such action, raising questions about when closure or merger would be required. The Court in Fordice emphasized the need to counteract segregative policies through possible closure or merger of institutions. It directed the lower court to consider various factors in determining if closure or merger is constitutionally required, noting that maintaining all eight higher education institutions in Mississippi was deemed wasteful and irrational. Close proximity between institutions offering similar programs could also be a relevant factor in assessing remedial closure or merger. Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion, highlighted the importance of historically black colleges and universities, stating that their continued operation is constitutionally permissible. He emphasized their critical role in academic flourishing and leadership development, noting that closing these institutions would be ironic given their history of supporting black students during segregation. The continued operation of historically black colleges and universities is constitutionally permissible as long as admission is race-neutral. Challenges have been brought against practices traceable to de jure segregated university systems, including unnecessary program duplication, scholarship policies, funding practices, and limited representation of black history and culture in curricula. The Fordice standard in federal case law is limited, with few appellate decisions applying it. These decisions provide analytical examples and show differences in approach, especially regarding the evidence needed to satisfy the standard's third element. The Supreme Court has not addressed claims challenging higher education policies as unconstitutional vestiges of de jure segregation since its 1992 decision. The Supreme Court in Fordice identified \"unnecessary program duplication\" as a practice traceable to prior de jure segregation in higher education. Courts have traced duplicative courses and degree programs to the prior dual system. Federal courts have considered methods for eliminating program duplication, such as transferring programs or eliminating them altogether. Plaintiffs have raised equal protection challenges to state funding practices that allocate federal and state land grants unequally between formerly white-only and black-only institutions. For example, in Knight v. Alabama, the state allocated federal funds predominantly to Auburn University, a formerly white-only institution, over Alabama A&M University, a black-only institution. The state allocated federal and state funds predominantly to Auburn University over Alabama A&M University, a black-only institution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found the funding allocation traceable to de jure segregation and instructed the lower court to make determinations based on the Fordice test. The Eleventh Circuit noted that reduced efficiency would not necessarily make a proposed modification impracticable or educationally unsound. The Fifth Circuit affirmed a district court's ruling allowing a state to maintain its traceable funding practices despite finding discriminatory effects. The Supreme Court has not revisited its analysis in Fordice, leaving questions about its legal standard open. Few courts of appeals have addressed claims under Fordice, limiting its development in federal case law. One unresolved question is when traceability can be established under Fordice when a state changes a discriminatory policy. The Supreme Court and circuit courts have not addressed how far a district court can go in remedying an unconstitutional vestige of a prior de jure public university system under Fordice. In the K-12 context, district court orders have been upheld to desegregate schools in noncompliant districts, but it is unclear if similar extensive remedies can be ordered under Fordice. Few cases alleging Fordice-type claims have reached federal appellate courts. The Supreme Court and circuit courts have not provided clear guidance on the extent of a court's authority to mandate specific remedies for a state's failure to dismantle its formerly segregated public university system. In cases of intentional state-imposed segregation in higher education, a finding of intent to segregate by race is crucial for proving a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The state has an obligation to eliminate all vestiges of de jure segregation. The state has an affirmative duty under the Equal Protection Clause to eliminate all vestiges of its de jure system by dismantling discriminatory segregation infrastructure and mechanisms. According to the Supreme Court's 1992 Fordice decision, this duty requires more than just repealing state laws sanctioning racial segregation in higher education. The state must also uproot or reform any policy or practice traceable to its formerly de jure system that continues to have a discriminatory effect. In Fordice, the state's intent to racially segregate its higher education system was evident through the establishment of public universities exclusively for white persons and the creation of segregated institutions over a century. The creation of segregated institutions for white and black students was not unique to Mississippi, as dual systems of public higher education existed in other states. Federal courts have addressed de jure segregation in the context of codified segregation, but intentional segregation may still exist even without a codified system. The Supreme Court decision in Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, shows that state authorities can engage in unconstitutional racial segregation even without statutory segregation laws. The Supreme Court has yet to address segregative intent in higher education, leaving uncertainty on what evidence would establish de jure segregation in public universities. Despite the absence of codified segregation laws, intentional segregation can still exist, as shown in the Keyes v. School District No. 1 case. The Supreme Court has noted that determining discriminatory intent in cases of de jure segregation in public education is a complex and fact-intensive process. Evidence of a state actor implementing policies or practices that foreseeably segregate students by race can support a finding of de jure segregation. Additionally, if segregative intent is found in one part of a school system, it can create a presumption of intentional segregation in other parts of the same system. This nonstatutory evidence of de jure segregation imposes an affirmative obligation on the state to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed segregation. The vestiges of state-imposed segregation, such as de jure segregation shown through state or local laws, may be difficult to distinguish from existing segregation not linked to state intent. Evidence at the K-12 level may not directly apply to cases at the collegiate or graduate level alleging segregative intent. Categorical distinctions between types of evidence are challenging to draw, leading to questions about the analysis of \"segregative intent\" by the courts. The Court has questioned the distinction between de jure and de facto segregation, but still recognizes it. Evidence of segregative intent may not be necessary when addressing vestiges of past segregation. The Court allows the use of race-conscious policies to remedy intentional racial segregation, as race-neutral measures may not be sufficient for equitable relief. The Court has an affirmative obligation to consider race in de jure segregation cases for equitable relief, but not in other contexts. Colleges can use race-conscious measures to increase diversity, separate from de jure segregation. The Supreme Court has only addressed one type of discretionary race-conscious measure in higher education. The Supreme Court has addressed only one type of discretionary race-conscious measure in higher education, specifically admissions policies. These policies are evaluated based on their precision in achieving compelling educational interests. \"Affirmative action\" originally aimed to eliminate de jure segregation, but it now also includes voluntary policies to help racial minorities overcome past exclusion. Unlike court-ordered measures, these policies are voluntary and their legality depends on their voluntary nature. In the context of voluntary affirmative action policies, the Supreme Court has been divided on their constitutionality for over forty years. Justices disagree on how strictly to review these policies and what justifications are needed for their use of racial classifications. Recent decisions have subjected these policies to strict scrutiny, only accepting them if they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling interests. The Supreme Court has long been concerned about the use of racial classifications, emphasizing equal protection under the law for all races. The government's use of such classifications must be narrowly tailored to serve compelling interests, as stated in recent decisions. The Supreme Court views government's use of racial classifications as suspect and subject to strict scrutiny, especially in cases like affirmative action. The Bakke case involved a challenge to an affirmative action program at UC Davis Medical School, highlighting the ongoing debate over racial classifications. In the early 1970s, UC Davis Medical School implemented a race-conscious admissions policy to increase enrollment of \"disadvantaged\" students by setting aside 16 seats for specific racial minorities. Allan Bakke, a white male, challenged this policy under the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI, leading to a Supreme Court case with a divided bench. The Supreme Court Justices were divided over the level of scrutiny to apply in reviewing Bakke's challenge to UC Davis Medical School's race-conscious admissions policy. Some Justices found the program violated Title VI, while others would have upheld it under a form of intermediate scrutiny. Justice Powell emphasized that all government-drawn racial distinctions must be scrutinized. In Bakke, Justice Powell insisted that all government-drawn racial distinctions must undergo strict scrutiny, requiring precise tailoring to serve a compelling interest. He concluded that UC Davis Medical School's affirmative action policy could not survive this scrutiny, hinting at uncertainty in how the Court might treat other race-conscious policies. The Supreme Court's uncertainty regarding the appropriate standard of review for affirmative action policies outside of higher education contexts lasted for a decade. In 1989, the Court signaled that strict scrutiny would be applied to state and local affirmative action plans, but in the following year, a different approach was suggested for federal plans. In the Court's view, \"benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress\" need to \"serve important governmental objectives\" and be \"substantially related to the achievement of those objectives\" to satisfy an intermediate level of scrutiny. However, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u0144a, the Supreme Court reversed course, stating that any person has the right to demand justification for any racial classification subjecting them to unequal treatment under strict scrutiny. This rule precluded the divided regime upheld in Metro Broadcasting, subjecting states' use of racial classifications to strict scrutiny. The Adarand Court applied strict scrutiny to federal racial classifications, requiring them to serve a compelling governmental interest and be narrowly tailored. This overruled the previous standard set in Metro Broadcasting. The Court extended this holding to higher education in Fisher v. University of Texas, stating that race may not be considered in admissions unless it can withstand strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court requires racial classifications in admissions to higher education to withstand strict scrutiny, serving a compelling governmental interest and being narrowly tailored. This standard applies to all classifications based on race, even if for a \"benign\" purpose. The Supreme Court requires strict scrutiny for race-based remedies in higher education admissions, even for affirmative action policies. Despite the contextual difference, the Court's scrutiny remains strict. The Supreme Court has adjusted its framework for scrutinizing race-conscious admissions policies over the years. It now requires public universities to clearly explain the diversity-related educational goals served by affirmative action policies and prove their compelling interest under strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court now expects universities to prove that their affirmative action policies achieve \"concrete and precise goals\" in a flexible way under strict scrutiny. To survive this scrutiny, a university must demonstrate that its purpose is constitutionally permissible and substantial, with the sole recognized interest being the attainment of a diverse student body. This has led to the development of criteria for appropriately tailored affirmative action policies. The Supreme Court now requires universities to provide a clear and reasoned explanation for their affirmative action policies, focusing on achieving specific diversity-related educational goals. This shift in expectations emerged from the Court's decisions in Fisher v. University of Texas, emphasizing the need for a principled rationale behind affirmative action admissions policies. The Supreme Court requires universities to justify their affirmative action policies by focusing on achieving diversity-related educational goals. Justice Powell emphasized the importance of student body diversity for promoting academic freedom and quality higher education. The right to select students for diversity is a key concern of the First Amendment, according to Justice Powell. He outlined the theory behind diversity justifying affirmative action in university admissions, but emphasized that it must have limits and not violate individual rights or resort to racial quotas. Justice Powell's views on the limits of diversity in university admissions were unclear after the Bakke Court's fractured decision. Lower courts struggled to interpret this, leading to uncertainty in cases involving affirmative action programs. Clarity on diversity theory came in 2003 with the Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger cases at the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan Law School's admissions policy, challenged in Grutter, aimed to create a diverse student body without setting specific numerical targets for racial groups. The policy considered LSAT scores, GPAs, and individualized factors, including race, to achieve a \"critical mass of underrepresented minority students.\" The University of Michigan Law School's admissions policy in Grutter aimed to achieve student diversity by considering various factors, including race, without specific numerical targets for racial groups. The Supreme Court held that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that justifies the use of race in university admissions. The Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's admissions policy, stating that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that justifies the use of race in university admissions to achieve educational benefits. The Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's admissions policy, stating that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that justifies the use of race in university admissions to achieve educational benefits. The Court was willing to treat the school's use of \"critical mass\" as a permissible proxy for diversity benefits, although not all Justices agreed. Justice Kennedy dissented, arguing that the concept of \"critical mass\" was a delusion masking racial quotas, which he found incompatible with the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court's decision in Grutter confirmed that achieving student diversity was a compelling interest for public universities to consider race in admissions. This ruling allowed schools to enroll a \"critical mass\" of underrepresented minorities. The decision also overturned lower court rulings against affirmative action policies, leading the University of Texas to reintroduce race as a factor in its admissions process. UT Austin revised its admissions policy to include an Academic Index and Personal Achievement Index, which considered SAT scores, academic record, character, and race. Abigail Fisher, a white student, challenged the system for allegedly discriminating against her. Her case, Fisher v. University of Texas, reached the Supreme Court. The Fisher v. University of Texas challenge reached the Supreme Court, where the Court upheld the school's admission policy. Justice Kennedy reaffirmed the importance of student diversity and outlined principles for reviewing race-conscious admissions policies. Kennedy confirmed that Grutter's bottom line remained good law, stating that obtaining educational benefits from student body diversity was still a compelling interest. However, he clarified that asserting a broad interest in diversity would not suffice, as it would make the university's goals too vague for judicial scrutiny. The Court set new benchmarks for reviewing a university's use of race in admissions, requiring precise and measurable goals and a reasoned explanation for pursuing those goals. The majority in UT Austin's admissions case upheld the use of race for diversity goals, meeting the benchmarks set by the Court. Justice Kennedy emphasized the importance of a clear and principled rationale for pursuing diversity goals, aligning with the standards from previous cases like Grutter. The concept of \"critical mass\" was not explicitly addressed in this decision. In Fisher II, the Court found UT Austin's goals constitutionally adequate, meeting the benchmarks for pursuing diversity. The Court reiterated that a racially diverse student body is a compelling interest that justifies the use of race in admissions, but it must involve specific objectives, not just a desire for diversity in general. Under the Fisher formulation, universities must articulate specific goals for their affirmative action policies and provide a reasoned explanation for pursuing them. Meeting these criteria is crucial for a strong case in support of race-conscious admissions policies. The second test under strict scrutiny involves ensuring that the policy is narrowly tailored to achieve diversity-related benefits, as seen in the Court's review of affirmative action policies. The model for a narrowly tailored policy, endorsed in Bakke, is exemplified by Harvard College's admissions program. The Harvard plan, endorsed in Bakke, serves as a model for evaluating affirmative action policies. The Court developed specific criteria based on this plan, known as the \"five hallmarks of a narrowly tailored affirmative action plan.\" The uncertainty following the Bakke case left lower courts without clear guidance on the permissibility of race-conscious admissions policies structured differently. In Bakke, Justice Powell explained why the Medical School's set-aside for minority students was not narrowly tailored under the Equal Protection Clause. He cited the Harvard plan as an example of a better affirmative action policy, where race is considered a \"plus\" but does not guarantee admission. The file of a black applicant may be examined for potential contribution to diversity without race being decisive compared to an Italian-American applicant with qualities promoting educational pluralism. Qualities could include personal talents, work experience, leadership potential, compassion, overcoming disadvantage, and communication skills. Weight attributed to qualities may vary yearly based on student body and applicant mix. Unlike the rigid Medical School policy in Bakke, the Harvard plan considers race as a \"plus\" for admission. In the case of Bakke, Justice Powell criticized the rigid policy of reserving seats for a selected ethnic group in the Medical School, stating that it prevented a holistic review of applicants. He argued that race or ethnic origin should not be the sole determining factor in admissions, as it unfairly excluded other applicants. Powell believed that a more individualized and holistic approach, like Harvard's, would be a better alternative. While Bakke suggested strict scrutiny of race-conscious admissions policies, later cases showed that such scrutiny may not always be fatal. The Supreme Court cases of Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger demonstrated different outcomes for affirmative action admissions policies at the University of Michigan. The Court upheld the Law School's policy in Grutter but struck down the undergraduate admissions policy in Gratz. The key factor was how closely the challenged policies resembled the Harvard plan, with the Court finding the Law School's policy to be highly individualized and holistic in its approach to diversity. The Law School's admissions policy, like the Harvard Plan, provided flexible consideration to each applicant without predetermined diversity bonuses based on race or ethnicity. In contrast, the undergraduate admissions policy automatically awarded points to underrepresented minority applicants solely based on race, violating the principles outlined in Bakke. The undergraduate admissions policy did not offer individualized selection processes like Harvard's example, leading to a lack of nuanced judgments on applicants' contributions to diversity. Justice O'Connor found that even though points were assigned to non-racial factors, they were capped at lower levels, undermining the policy's effectiveness. The admissions policy's problematic effect was highlighted by Justice O'Connor, who criticized the weighting system that limited the points awarded to non-racial factors, hindering the assessment of applicants' diversity contributions. This approach, resembling a nonindividualized, mechanical balancing, was deemed too close to the condemned practice in the Bakke case. Gratz and Grutter cases outlined criteria for evaluating race-conscious admissions policies, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced and individualized approach. The key details of the curr_chunk are about the five hallmarks of a narrowly tailored affirmative action plan, specifically focusing on the prohibition of quotas in race-conscious admissions programs. This ban on quotas was emphasized by Justice Powell in the Bakke case and has been consistently reaffirmed by the Court. The Court emphasizes individualized consideration in affirmative action plans, rejecting rigid quotas and promoting a holistic review of each applicant's file. The Court promotes individualized consideration in affirmative action plans, rejecting quotas and emphasizing a holistic review of each applicant's file, including the use of race as a 'plus factor' in admissions. Universities are not required to exhaust every race-neutral alternative but must show serious consideration of such options before implementing a race-conscious policy. The Court requires universities to consider race-neutral alternatives before implementing race-conscious admissions policies, ensuring they are narrowly tailored and do not cause undue harm. Justice O'Connor emphasized the importance of not unduly harming any racial group in race-conscious admissions programs, suggesting that policies should not burden individuals outside of favored racial and ethnic groups. This principle may play a role in the Court's review of similar plans in the future. The Fourteenth Amendment was intended to eliminate government-imposed racial discrimination. Justice O'Connor stated that race-conscious admissions policies must have a time limit and cannot be justified permanently. The policies could end through a durational limit or periodic reviews to assess the necessity of racial preferences for student body diversity. Justice O'Connor emphasized the need for a time limit on race-conscious admissions policies, suggesting that a review process should determine when racial preferences are no longer necessary for achieving student body diversity. This obligation of constant reflection may lead to an expiration date for the use of racial preferences in admissions. The Supreme Court Justices, including O'Connor and Kennedy, are uncertain about the future of race-conscious admissions policies. The Harvard plan from Bakke case is still seen as a satisfactory model for achieving diversity while treating each applicant individually. Race plays a significant role in higher education, reflecting the two aspects of affirmative action. The report discusses the mandatory and voluntary roles of affirmative action in higher education, focusing on admissions decisions at selective colleges and universities. The Court has considered affirmative action in relation to public universities under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI protects against discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs or activities. Congress has a significant role in determining the scope and enforcement of Title VI. The Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects against discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs or activities. Federal funding agencies have the authority to issue regulations and enforce them, with interpretive authority falling to the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Education. These agencies have processes for investigating complaints of Title VI violations, with the Department of Education also issuing rules for colleges and universities receiving federal education funds. Agencies can enforce regulations through investigations that may result in penalties for noncompliant recipients. The U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice have the authority to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs based on race, color, or national origin. Violations can lead to termination, suspension, or refusal of federal funds, with the possibility of broad liability and potential funding jeopardy for the institution as a whole. Enforcement actions can include administrative fund termination proceedings and court interventions to achieve compliance. The Department of Justice and Department of Education enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, addressing discrimination in federally funded programs. They handle private suits and represent executive branch agencies in lawsuits related to Title VI violations. Congress can amend Title VI to make it more restrictive. Congress could amend Title VI to either make it more restrictive by prohibiting the use of voluntary race-conscious measures, or to be expressly permissive of such measures. This amendment would impact admissions policies at universities receiving federal funds, potentially excluding race as a factor in decisions. Congress could amend Title VI to provide for disparate impact liability, resolving a significant debate on the issue and clarifying Congress's intent for the antidiscrimination mandate. This could include incorporating a private right of action and defining remedies under Title VI. Congress could amend Title VI to clarify its intent for the antidiscrimination mandate, including providing for disparate impact liability and defining remedies. Oversight is also exercised by Congress over agencies enforcing Title VI, such as DOJ and ED in educational programs. Both offices maintain public archives of investigations and enforcement priorities. The Department of Justice (DOJ) publishes news on Title VI enforcement activities in various program areas beyond colleges and universities. Race plays two key roles in higher education, with \"affirmative action\" addressing both state-imposed segregation and voluntary policies to aid racial minorities. In higher education, race-conscious admissions policies have been used to diversify student bodies, with the Court approving remedial and voluntary measures. Affirmative action policies must be narrowly tailored to compelling educational goals, subject to close scrutiny by the Court. Several Justices have raised concerns about the rationales supporting these policies. Several Justices have suggested that the rationales supporting voluntary race-conscious measures in higher education may eventually be questioned. However, for now, these measures are still supported by two lines of authority. Questions remain unanswered, such as whether a public institution can use its history of intentional exclusion as a basis for race-conscious admissions policies. The courts' assessment of such arguments may depend on the further development of existing authority. Congress also plays a significant role in this area through its authority to revise Title VI. Congress has authority to oversee the enforcement of Title VI, which plays a significant role in this area."
