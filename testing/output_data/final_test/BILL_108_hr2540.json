    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fairness to All Vietnam Veterans Act\". The \"Fairness to All Vietnam Veterans Act\" authorized the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund to construct a memorial wall inscribed with the names of those who died or went missing during the Vietnam war. The Fund relied on the Department of Defense for the list of names and criteria for inclusion. The Memorial Fund established procedures for correcting mistakes in inscribing names on the memorial wall. The Department of Defense determines eligibility requirements for veterans' names to be inscribed, which have been periodically modified. As of February 1981, veterans must have died in Vietnam between November 1, 1955, and December 31, 1960, or in a specified combat zone on or after January 1, 1961. Public Law 106-214 authorizes the placement of a plaque at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to honor veterans who died as a direct result of their service in the Vietnam war but are not eligible for inscription on the memorial wall. Names of servicemembers who died aboard the USS Frank E. Evans in 1969, outside the combat zone, are not eligible for inscription on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall or plaque. SEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT. The Secretary of Defense will conduct a study to identify veterans who died as a result of military operations in southeast Asia after November 1, 1955, but are not eligible for inscription on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The study will also evaluate revising eligibility requirements for the memorial wall and consider alternative means of recognition, such as an education center at the memorial. A report is due within 180 days. The Secretary of Defense will submit a report to Congress within 180 days, detailing reasons why certain veterans are not eligible for inscription on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, alternative eligibility requirements considered, alternative means of recognition, and conclusions/recommendations on feasibility and equitability of alternatives. The Secretary of Defense will consult with various organizations in conducting a study and preparing a report on alternative eligibility requirements for inscription on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial."
