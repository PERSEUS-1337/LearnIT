    "content": "The impact of the expansion of standards-based assessments under ESEA Title I-A began in 1994 with the Improving America's Schools Act. The requirements were expanded further under NCLB to include assessments for all public school pupils in grades 3-8 in reading and math. The NCLB expanded academic achievement standards for public school pupils in grades 3-8 in reading, math, and science. Assessment results must be provided to schools and teachers for diagnostic and accountability purposes. The NCLB expanded academic achievement standards for public school pupils in grades 3-8 in reading, math, and science. Assessment results must be provided to schools and teachers for diagnostic and accountability purposes. States must ensure that their assessments meet the required performance levels and technical quality standards under Title I-A, with annual grants available to help cover costs. States and LEAs participating in Title I-A must report assessment results and other data to parents and the public through \"report cards.\" The NCLB requires states and LEAs to publish report cards with academic performance data disaggregated by various factors. States participating in Title I-A must also participate in NAEP tests for 4th and 8th-grade reading and math. NAEP is administered by NCES and overseen by NAGB. The NAEP assessment, overseen by NAGB, reports pupil scores based on performance levels in challenging subjects. Tests are given to a representative sample of K-12 students in public and private schools. NAEP conducts assessments in 4th and 8th grade math, reading, and science at the state level, as well as in selected major cities. The purpose is to confirm trends in pupil achievement. The expanded ESEA Title I-A pupil assessment requirements aim to confirm trends in pupil achievement through state-selected assessments. Issues include implementation deadlines for math and reading assessments in grades 3-8, consequences for states not meeting deadlines, and loss of funding for failure to implement assessments on schedule. As of January 2009, 39 states have fully approved assessment programs. The current discussion revolves around expanding assessments for senior high school students under ESEA Title I-A. Proposals suggest including assessments for grades 10-12, such as a 12th grade NAEP assessment, to improve determining yearly progress. However, the diverse nature of high school programs raises questions about including exit or graduation tests and allowing states to use different types of assessments. Some concerns have been raised about the impact of emphasizing reading and mathematics in high school assessments, potentially reducing time for other subjects like writing, science, history, civics, and foreign languages. There is a debate on whether states should be allowed to use different types of tests for students in various academic programs to meet assessment requirements. Additionally, questions have been raised about using Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate tests to fulfill assessment needs for students in those programs. The debate surrounds the impact of focusing on reading and math assessments, potentially neglecting other subjects like writing, science, history, civics, and foreign languages. There are discussions on incorporating \"national standards\" into assessments to address differences in state performance standards and to enhance educational quality. Calls have been made for a more explicit role for \"national standards\" in the outcome accountability process of the No Child Left Behind Act. Some argue for national standards in education to address quality concerns and ensure consistency in accountability policies. Others believe states should have the authority to set educational standards due to their significant financial contributions and constitutional powers. The debate also questions if adequate yearly progress requirements effectively improve education for disadvantaged students and identify low-performing schools. The ESEA requires adequate yearly progress (AYP) for schools, LEAs, and states to identify inadequate performance and provide support. Consequences are imposed on schools or LEAs failing to meet AYP for two consecutive years. Under the NCLB, AYP standards apply to Title I-A schools and LEAs based on pupil scores in math and reading. States must also include an additional academic indicator, like graduation rates for high schools. No sanctions for states overall, only potential identification and technical assistance. Under NCLB, AYP standards must be met by schools and LEAs based on math and reading scores. AYP calculations require disaggregation by demographic groups, including economically disadvantaged, LEP, disabled, and racial/ethnic groups. Constraints exist for small pupil groups where results may not be statistically significant or individual identities could be revealed. The selection of the minimum number of pupils in a group for AYP determinations varies by state. States define major racial and ethnic groups for AYP calculations. Pupils who haven't attended the same school for a full year are excluded at the school level but included in LEA and state AYP determinations. The use of confidence intervals in AYP determinations aims to enhance validity and reliability by reducing the number of schools failing to meet standards. This statistical technique, not explicitly authorized by NCLB, is included in state accountability plans approved by ED. It is based on the assumption that test administration represents a sample survey of pupils' achievement levels, introducing uncertainty in reflecting actual achievement. The use of confidence intervals in AYP determinations aims to improve validity and reliability by reducing the number of schools failing to meet standards. These intervals are like windows around a threshold test score level, with the size varying based on the number of pupils tested and the desired degree of probability. A school fails to make AYP if the average score falls below the lowest score in the window. State AYP standards must move towards all pupils reaching a proficient level. The NCLB AYP provisions aim to ensure all pupils reach a proficient level of achievement by the end of the 2013-2014 school year. It includes an assessment participation rate requirement of at least 95% for all pupils and demographic groups. The structure for AYP determinations is based on a group status model with a set threshold level of achievement. The NCLB AYP provisions require all pupils to reach a proficient level of achievement by 2013-2014. A \"uniform bar\" approach is used, with a threshold percentage set for all pupil subgroups. Safe Harbor provision allows schools to meet AYP with a 10% reduction in the achievement gap. Individual/cohort growth model tracks pupil achievement over time. Under an ED initiative, 15 states have been approved to use growth models for tracking pupil achievement. Schools must meet AYP standards by reaching required performance levels on assessments and academic indicators for all pupil groups. Data on the impact of NCLB's AYP provisions show varying results across states. Based on data from 47 states, 36% of public schools did not meet AYP standards in 2007-2008, showing a 28% increase from the previous year. The percentage of schools failing to meet AYP in 2006-2007 was 29%, with wide variations among states. Factors contributing to these differences include achievement levels and the rigor of state performance standards. In 2007-2008, 36% of public schools did not meet AYP standards, a 28% increase from the previous year. Factors contributing to these differences include achievement levels, rigor of state performance standards, and variations in state policies. ED's report in 2007 identified 11,648 public schools for improvement, with schools in large, urban LEAs, high poverty rates, and large minority enrollment most likely to be identified. The percentage of identified schools varied widely among states. Approximately 30% of LEAs failed to meet AYP standards for 2006-2007, with significant variation among states. Alabama and Michigan had no failing LEAs, while Wisconsin had only two out of 426. However, 100% of LEAs in Florida, South Carolina, and Hawaii failed to meet AYP. Around 10% of LEAs were identified as in need of improvement for consecutive years. Concerns were raised about the rigidity of current AYP requirements leading to high failure rates. The current AYP standards are so detailed and rigid that many schools and LEAs are failing to meet them, especially those with diverse pupil populations. Future increases in performance thresholds may lead to even higher percentages of schools and LEAs failing to make AYP. Without specific requirements for achievement gains by major pupil groups, there is a risk of insufficient attention to the performance of disadvantaged pupil groups, for whom the Title I-A program was established. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy, efficacy, and complexity of the accountability system, with a high percentage of schools identified as failing to make progress. Studies show that schools with diverse demographic groups are less likely to meet AYP standards. There is a question of whether states should have more flexibility in implementing AYP models under NCLB. The use of growth models for AYP has been allowed by ED, but with restrictions. The ESEA may be modified to allow states to use a wider range of growth and other models for AYP. There is a debate on whether AYP determinations should retain a \"pass-fail\" structure or use a more varied rating scale. Analysts suggest a more nuanced grading scale, such as dividing schools into higher and lower priority categories or using grades from A to F. The challenge lies in determining where schools fall on this scale. The ESEA may be modified to allow states more flexibility in determining AYP. There is a debate on whether to use a pass-fail structure or a varied rating scale. Considerations include setting maximum levels for state group size and confidence interval policies, and allowing some states to use multiple indicators for AYP. Many educators argue for a broader range of criteria beyond just reading and math test scores to determine school effectiveness. Opponents believe the focus should remain on math and reading scores. There is a debate on whether AYP requirements set realistic expectations for all students to perform at a proficient level by 2014. The goal of having all pupils reach a proficient level by a specific date may be criticized as unrealistic. Many states, schools, and LEAs may not meet the NCLB's 2014 AYP goal without lowering standards or using statistical techniques. The NCLB requires states to identify schools and LEAs that fail to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years for program improvement. Title I-A schools failing to meet AYP standards for two years must be identified for program improvement. Schools failing to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years are identified for program improvement and remain in \"needs improvement\" status until they meet the standards. Technical assistance based on research is provided to these schools, funded through a state reservation of 4% of Title I-A grants. Parents are notified of the school's status, and students have options to attend other public schools. Public school choice must be offered to students in schools designated as needing improvement or unsafe. Transportation must be provided for pupils utilizing this option. LEAs are required to establish cooperative agreements with other LEAs if all schools in the district need improvement. Children can remain in the new school until completing the highest grade, but transportation may be discontinued if the originating school meets AYP standards for two years. Title I-A schools failing to meet AYP standards for a third year must offer low-income students the opportunity to receive supplemental services from approved providers. States identify and monitor these providers, with funding capped at the LEA's Title I-A grant per child. LEAs must allocate up to 20% of their Title I-A grants for transportation and supplemental services for pupils exercising public school choice options. If funds are insufficient, services may be focused on the lowest-achieving pupils. Participation rates in public school choice and supplemental services were low in the 2004-2005 school year. Low participation rates in public school choice and supplemental services in most states may result from various factors. Corrective actions for Title I-A schools failing to meet AYP standards include replacing staff, implementing new curriculum, appointing outside experts, and restructuring the school. State or LEA discretion determines which actions to take. Schools failing for a fifth year must plan for restructuring. In cases where schools fail to meet AYP standards for a sixth year, they must implement a restructuring plan, which can involve actions such as reopening as a charter school, replacing staff, state takeover, or other major governance changes. A report by the Education Commission of the States found that restructuring options applied to schools have been relatively mild to moderate, such as changing curriculum or school management structure. In cases where schools fail to meet AYP standards for a sixth year, they must implement a restructuring plan, which can involve actions such as reopening as a charter school, replacing staff, state takeover, or other major governance changes. Restructuring options applied to schools have been relatively mild to moderate, such as changing curriculum or school management structure. Political difficulties have arisen in cases where stronger forms of restructuring have been applied, and some options could not be implemented due to state law restrictions. LEAs that receive Title I-A grants and fail to meet AYP requirements face similar procedures. States may choose to base decisions on LEA status and corrective actions only on Title I-A schools within each LEA. LEAs receiving Title I-A grants must meet state AYP standards. Failure for two consecutive years leads to identification for improvement and technical assistance. SEAs provide support based on research, and corrective action is taken after four years of non-compliance, which may include reducing funds, changing curriculum, or replacing staff. The NCLB requires states to take action if LEAs fail to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years, such as appointing a receiver or trustee, restructuring the LEA, or allowing students to transfer to higher-performing schools. States failing to meet goals are listed in an annual report to Congress and provided with technical assistance. A peer review process evaluates state progress after the third year of implementation. Approximately 12% of all public schools, or 20% of Title I-A participating schools, have been identified as in need of improvement due to failing to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years or more. As NCLB requirements continue, more schools and LEAs may face consequences for not meeting AYP standards for multiple years. The NCLB also includes limited provisions for performance-based rewards for high-performing schools and LEAs in the Title I-A program. States are required to establish Academic Achievement Awards for schools that reduce achievement gaps or exceed AYP requirements for consecutive years. The Bush Administration announced a pilot program granting waivers to states proposing alternative NCLB accountability policies. Six states were initially selected for this program. Nine states, including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana, and New York, were approved to participate in a Differentiated Accountability Pilot program. The program involves categorizing schools for improvement, adjusting consequences based on improvement categories, and focusing on pupil groups with the lowest performance levels. Performance-based sanctions under NCLB are a key issue. Issues with performance-based sanctions under NCLB for senior high schools due to limited impact and low participation in Title I-A grant program. Concerns raised about accountability and effectiveness in improving high school performance without broader participation. The NCLB provides limited resources for states and LEAs to support schools in need of improvement. Additional funding has been allocated for school improvement grants, but concerns remain about the capacity of state educational agencies to provide necessary guidance. The NCLB raises questions about the low participation in supplemental services and school choice options for low-performing schools. Limited information on the effectiveness of third-party services is available, prompting discussions on addressing the lack of meaningful options, information dissemination, funding limitations, and parental interest. The effectiveness of supplemental services compared to public school instruction is uncertain, leading to debates on how to improve the situation. The NCLB raises questions about the impact of competition and choice on quality assurance in education. There is a debate on the effectiveness of performance-based rewards for LEAs and schools, as well as the impact of teacher qualification requirements. The NCLB required LEAs to ensure that teachers hired with Title I-A funds were \"highly qualified\" and all public school teachers in core subjects to be \"highly qualified\" by 2005-2006, with a possible extension to 2006-2007 for states showing effort. The Secretary of Education approved plans for meeting highly qualified teacher requirements in all states except one. However, no state had yet achieved the goal of having 100% of teachers highly qualified based on data from the 2005-2006 school year. Criteria for being deemed \"highly qualified\" include holding a bachelor's degree, obtaining state certification, passing teacher licensing exams, and holding a teaching license. Teachers in public charter schools have exceptions to these requirements. Program regulations provide exceptions for teachers in public charter schools, who must meet state charter school law requirements. Alternate certification program participants meeting certain criteria are considered \"highly qualified\" provisionally for three years to obtain necessary credentials. New teachers must demonstrate subject area knowledge and teaching skills through state tests or academic qualifications. Teachers at the elementary or secondary level can be deemed \"highly qualified\" by meeting specific criteria or demonstrating competence in all subjects taught. Special flexibility is granted to teachers in certain circumstances, such as those in small, rural LEAs or science teachers with state certification policies. Middle school teachers, like other secondary school teachers, can teach various subjects depending on state certification policies. Paraprofessionals, funded by ESEA Title I-A grants, make up half of the staff, with 15% of funds used for their salaries. NCLB set requirements for paraprofessionals paid with Title I-A funds, effective from 2005-2006, including completing two years of higher education or meeting a rigorous standard of quality. Paraprofessionals in Title I-A programs must have knowledge and ability in reading, writing, and math, with a high school diploma or equivalent. States have various approaches to meeting these requirements, with some exceeding NCLB standards and requiring certification for paraprofessionals. Paraprofessionals in Title I-A programs must meet specific qualifications, with 36 states using the \"ParaPro\" test and 17 using the \"WorkKeys\" test. Responsibilities include tutoring, classroom assistance, parental involvement, and more. Issues regarding teacher and paraprofessional qualifications under ESEA Title I-A are being discussed. The NCLB's flexibility for small, rural schools and multi-subject teachers may need to be expanded to other school settings, such as middle schools. There is a question about whether the minimum qualification requirements for teachers are reliable indicators of quality and effectiveness. The NCLB's HQT requirements are closely linked to state teacher certification and attainment of degrees in the subject taught. However, these requirements may not fully address teacher effectiveness in improving student achievement. The difficulty lies in measuring and evaluating the characteristics associated with teacher effectiveness. The current statute may not provide sufficient authority to ensure an equitable distribution of teacher quality across schools and LEAs. The NCLB's paraprofessional qualification requirements for Title I-A programs have received less attention than the HQT requirements. States and LEAs are responding to these requirements in varying ways, with concerns about paraprofessionals losing their jobs if they do not meet the qualifications. The NCLB has sparked debate on funding levels for ESEA programs, with a focus on differences between authorized and appropriated amounts. While concerns exist about paraprofessionals losing their jobs due to qualification requirements, there is no systematic evidence of this happening yet. Should ESEA programs be funded closer to maximum authorized amounts, and what should future authorizations be set at? The NCLB sparked debate on ESEA program funding levels, focusing on the gap between authorized and appropriated amounts. Concerns about paraprofessionals losing jobs due to qualification requirements have not been systematically proven. The discussion will focus on the ESEA overall, programs with specified authorization levels, and Title I-A LEA grants. Table 1 shows appropriations for FY2001-FY2009 and the FY2010 Administration budget request compared to authorization levels for Title I-A LEA grants and other specified ESEA programs. For FY2009, funding was provided under regular appropriations legislation and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, with a total of $13.95 billion in additional appropriations for ESEA programs. This included $10 billion for Title I-A grants to LEAs. Authorization levels for ESEA programs were the same as FY2007 levels for FY2008, but no levels were specified beyond that year. In FY2009, additional appropriations for ESEA programs included $10 billion for Title I-A grants to LEAs, $3 billion for School Improvement Grants, $650 million for education technology, $100 million for school construction grants, and $200 million for the Teacher Incentive Fund program. These funds are available for use over two school years. Authorization amounts for ESEA programs were specified only for FY2002, with a total appropriation of $21,954 million. The ESEA appropriation for FY2002 was $21,954 million, with $13,500 million authorized for Title I-A. Funding increased for FY2003 and FY2004, with a slight decline in the rate of increase. Funding remained flat from FY2004 to FY2007, with a notable increase in FY2008. Funding trends for FY2009 and FY2010 depended on ARRA appropriations. The ESEA funding for FY2009 and FY2010 heavily depends on ARRA appropriations. If all ARRA funds are associated with FY2009 alone, total ESEA funding for FY2009 increases substantially. Appropriations represented a decreasing share of authorizations for ESEA programs with specified authorization levels from FY2002 to FY2007, but rose somewhat in FY2008. In FY2008, appropriations rose to 54% and 57% of authorized levels for ESEA programs and Title I-A. In FY2009, total appropriations were close to FY2008 levels for Title I-A LEA grants and five ESEA programs. The question remains whether ESEA funding has increased enough since FY2001 to cover the costs of meeting NCLB requirements. The evaluation of the costs and benefits of NCLB participation by states and LEAs is complex. Costs can be narrowly defined as direct expenses like assessments, or broadly to include all costs of helping low-performing schools. Studies have examined this issue from different perspectives. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a study on the costs of developing and administering assessments required under Title I-A. State costs depend on the types of test questions used. It is difficult to estimate the broader costs of improving pupil performance to meet NCLB requirements, which may exceed total ESEA appropriations. The federal government may question its responsibility for all costs associated with improving low-performing schools under NCLB. There is no consensus on the most cost-effective ways to enhance school performance. Questions arise on comparing NCLB implementation costs with total funding levels for Title I-A and other ESEA programs. Evaluating costs and benefits separately for states, LEAs, and individual schools is also debated. State governments and Local Education Agencies (LEAs) have different responsibilities under NCLB. State Education Agencies (SEAs) are in charge of developing and implementing policies, while LEAs receive funding based on the number of low-income students. This has led to decreased funding for some LEAs with low poverty rates. The debate continues on whether to evaluate costs and benefits solely in financial terms or consider broader factors like student achievement. The expanded NCLB requirements may lead to increased attention to disadvantaged pupils and their schools, higher achievement expectations for all students, and a wider range of assessment data. Non-financial costs include increased federal influence on public school policies and a focus on assessments that may limit the curriculum. Reauthorization issues for ESEA/NCLB funding levels are also a concern. The authorization levels for ESEA programs in future years are being questioned, with debates over setting specific levels. While specifying authorizations can provide goals for increased funding, the impact beyond generating debate is uncertain. Additionally, linking implementation of requirements to specified minimum levels is being considered. In the NCLB, new pupil assessment requirements were tied to minimum funding levels. This approach may be used in a reauthorized ESEA to address funding debates and cost-benefit concerns. The question of whether the costs of meeting ESEA requirements outweigh the benefits of federal aid increases since 2001 is difficult to resolve. Accountability provisions like those in the NCLB are debated as mechanisms for ensuring effective use of federal funds. The ESEA should focus on enhancing the nation's international competitiveness in science, mathematics, and foreign language achievement. National policy discussions highlight the link between educational performance and the nation's long-term economic competitiveness. Concerns arise from below-average academic achievement levels in science and mathematics among U.S. K-12 pupils compared to other developed nations, especially at the high school level. In the 2006 PISA assessments, 15-year old pupils in the United States scored below many OECD nations in math and science. U.S. 12th grade students also scored lower than most other countries in math and science in the mid-1990s IEA assessments. The United States performed below many OECD nations in math and science in the 2006 PISA assessments. However, younger U.S. pupils scored above the international average in math and science in the 2007 TIMSS assessments. The country's performance in TIMSS was in the middle overall, with a focus on earlier grades and a wider range of participating nations. The ESEA has programs to improve instruction in math, science, and foreign languages. The ESEA has programs to improve instruction in math, science, and foreign languages, with a focus on mathematics and science in Title I-A assessments. Possible changes to federal K-12 education policies regarding assessments and accountability are being considered by the 111th Congress. The 110th Congress passed the America COMPETES Act, which supports non-ESEA programs for K-12 math and science education. Current ESEA requirements include standards-based assessments in reading, math, and science, but science results are not always used for AYP determinations. Options to address competitiveness concerns are being considered. Options to address competitiveness concerns in K-12 education include expanding science and math assessment requirements, encouraging STEM graduates to become K-12 teachers, and improving infrastructure for science and math instruction. Proposed ESEA amendments may focus on these areas to enhance international competitiveness. Some question if the requirement for all students to achieve proficiency in state academic assessments by 2013-2014 is hindering schools' ability to provide challenging education to high-achieving students. Limited federal support for advanced K-12 programs is a concern, with a focus on raising base achievement levels. The federal strategy in recent decades has focused on raising the base achievement level for disadvantaged students. Alternative proposals suggest giving credit for advanced student achievement towards meeting AYP requirements. There is a debate on whether states and LEAs should be required to include science assessment results in AYP determinations and expand the number of science assessments. Increasing the emphasis on science education in the ESEA could involve administering science assessments in more grades and including science assessment results in AYP determinations. The debate surrounding the ESEA reauthorization focuses on whether programmatic aid should be targeted specifically on science, mathematics, and foreign languages. Opponents argue against expanding the ESEA's assessment and AYP provisions, suggesting that decisions should be left to state and local educational authorities. The NCLB increased federal involvement in K-12 education, leading to discussions on maintaining the active federal role in education. The reauthorization debates on the federal role in K-12 education have focused on various aspects such as assessments, AYP, performance-based sanctions, and staff qualifications. The NCLB significantly increased federal involvement in K-12 education, raising concerns about both statutory provisions and their implementation by the Department of Education. This marked a major expansion from previous federal education program requirements. The NCLB, a significant expansion of federal requirements under the IASA, impacts assessment, accountability, staff qualifications, and other policies in public schools. Concerns have been raised about the transparency and consistency of ED's review procedures for state policies. The Bush Administration expanded federal regulation of ESEA programs and allowed flexibility through waiver authority. New regulations in October 2008 expanded requirements for high school graduation rates and school choice in schools identified for improvement. The regulations in October 2008 expanded requirements for high school graduation rates and school choice in schools identified for improvement, reflecting increased federal influence and control over education policies. The NCLB increased federal involvement in K-12 education, but also included proposals to increase state and LEA flexibility in using federal aid. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schools to use ESEA Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis to 40%, aligned with the national average of low-income students. It allowed most LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their grants among different programs and provided additional flexibility to states and LEAs. The NCLB also continued the strategy of providing ESEA aid through separate categorical programs. The NCLB reduced eligibility for ESEA Title I-A funds, allowed transfers among programs, and continued providing aid through categorical programs. Currently, there are 45 authorized ESEA programs, with federal involvement in K-12 education more extensive under NCLB. Congress will decide on reauthorization and the continuation of this federal strategy. The Congress will decide on reauthorization of federal involvement in K-12 education, considering whether to expand or limit federal requirements. Possible issues include sustaining or expanding the current level of federal involvement. The debate over federal involvement in K-12 education revolves around whether to sustain or expand current policies. The focus is on the effectiveness and transparency of implementing major requirements like NCLB, with a call for increased transparency and consistency in future activities. The debate over federal involvement in K-12 education revolves around sustaining or expanding current policies. There are discussions on the level of flexibility provided to states and LEAs in using ESEA grant funds, as well as constraints on the Secretary of Education's authority to change ESEA policies through regulations or waivers. In 1994, under the IASA, major assessment, AYP, and accountability policies of ESEA Title I-A could be waived at the discretion of the Secretary."
