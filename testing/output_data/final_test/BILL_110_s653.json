    "content": "The \"Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Act\" aims to modernize the visa waiver program by enhancing security requirements and extending visa-free travel privileges to allies in the war on terrorism. This expansion is expected to improve counterterrorism cooperation, information sharing, boost tourism and business opportunities, and strengthen bilateral relationships. SEC. 3. DISCRETIONARY VISA WAIVER PROGRAM EXPANSION. Section 217(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive visa refusal rates for countries that meet security requirements. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive visa refusal rates for countries that meet security requirements, including cooperation on counterterrorism initiatives and sustained reduction in refusal rates. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may consider various security factors when determining a country's eligibility for a visa waiver program, including airport security standards, air marshal programs, passport quality, and other security-related factors. The Secretary of Homeland Security may consider the rate at which nationals of a country violate visa terms by staying in the US after visa expiration. SEC. 4. SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS TO THE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM. SEC. 4 amends Section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to include electronic transmission of identification information for operators of aircraft and eligibility determination under the electronic travel authorization system for aliens traveling under the program. The Secretary of Homeland Security determines alien eligibility for travel to the US under the program, including reporting lost or stolen passports and repatriation of aliens. The government of the country accepts repatriation of citizens, former citizens, or nationals with a final order of removal within 3 weeks. No duty for the US or rights for aliens are created. Passenger information exchange is also included. The government of the country agrees to share information with the United States about their nationals traveling to the US, to assess any potential security threats. The Attorney General is replaced by the Secretary of Homeland Security in certain paragraphs. The Secretary of Homeland Security will provide technical assistance to program countries for the electronic travel authorization system and new country participation in the program. The Secretary of Homeland Security will develop an electronic travel authorization system to collect biographical information for determining alien eligibility before travel. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish an electronic travel authorization system to determine alien eligibility for travel to the United States. Fees may be charged for system use to cover costs, and regulations will set a validity period of up to 3 years for travel eligibility. The Secretary of Homeland Security can revoke travel eligibility determinations at any time and for any reason. A determination of eligibility does not mean the alien is admissible to the United States, and there is no judicial review allowed for eligibility determinations under the System. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report on the implementation of the System to specific Senate and House committees 60 days before publishing notice in the Federal Register. The House of Representatives designates specific committees for oversight of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 217(a)(11) will take effect 60 days after the Secretary of Homeland Security publishes notice in the Federal Register. SEC. 5. EXIT SYSTEM. The Secretary of Homeland Security must establish an exit system within a year of this Act's enactment to record the departure of visa waiver program participants. The system must match biometric information against watch lists and airline data to confirm departures. A report to Congress is required within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must report to Congress on the progress of developing the exit system and improving the calculation of nonimmigrant visa violators. SEC. 6. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out this Act and its amendments."
