    "content": "The 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) was signed into law on December 13, 2016, by President Barack Obama. It consists of three divisions: Division A focuses on funding for biomedical research, including the Precision Medicine Initiative and the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, as well as addressing the opioid crisis. Division A also modifies FDA pathways for approval. The 21st Century Cures Act includes reforms to FDA pathways for medical product approval and NIH reforms. It builds on previous legislation and bipartisan initiatives to support medical innovation. The Senate's medical innovation package, a companion effort to the House's 21st Century Cures initiative, resulted in the passage of 19 bipartisan bills, including The Adding Zika Virus to the FDA Priority Review Voucher Program Act. This bill was signed into law on April 19, 2016. The House had previously passed the initial version of the 21st Century Cures Act in July 2015. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held meetings since spring 2014 focusing on various topics like clinical trials, patient perspectives in research, precision medicine, and digital healthcare. H.R. 6 aimed to increase investments in medical research at NIH and change FDA's regulatory oversight for new drugs and devices. The 21st Century Cures Act (Division A of P.L. 114-255) consists of five titles: Innovation projects, Discovery, Development, Delivery, and Savings. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the lead federal agency for biomedical research, with a budget increase from $13.65 billion to $27.1 billion between FY1998 and FY2003. Annual budget increases have since been between 1.0% and 3.2%. The growth rate of the NIH budget has been below inflation, with funding in FY2015 22% lower than FY2003. U.S. government research funding declined from 57% to 50% of the global total, with Asia, particularly China, increasing investment in biomedical research. The United States remains a top supporter of medical research, but concerns have been raised by Members of Congress and the research community. Many in the biomedical research community and some Members of Congress are worried about other countries investing more in research. Calls for increased support for NIH research have been made, but a recent analysis warns against unsustainable rapid budget increases. The focus should be on steady growth of federal funds for research. NIH Director Francis Collins prefers steady annual budget increases for NIH over temporary larger investments. The Advisory Committee to the Director of NIH provides advice on biomedical research. The NIH Innovation Account in the Treasury supports NIH Innovation Projects with appropriations available until expended. The provision authorizes appropriations for various research initiatives including the Precision Medicine Initiative, BRAIN Initiative, cancer research, and regenerative medicine using adult stem cells. The total funding for these initiatives is capped at $1.455 billion, $1.511 billion, $1.8 billion, and $30 million respectively. Research is to be coordinated with the FDA, and a work plan must be submitted to Congress within six months of enactment. The NIH Director must seek recommendations from the Advisory Committee for the allocations of funds and work plan for NIH Innovation Projects each year from FY2017 to FY2026. The work plan must include project descriptions, funding allocations, and how they align with NIH Strategic Plan priorities. A report must be submitted to Congress by October 1 each year from FY2018 to FY2027 detailing project funding, descriptions, and progress. The section specifies that funds allocated for NIH Innovation Projects must align with strategic research priorities identified in the NIH Strategic Plan. The House and Senate committees can request updates on funding allocation and project descriptions, which the NIH Director must provide through reports or testimony. Funds can only be used for NIH Innovation Projects, and are not available until appropriated in subsequent acts. Appropriations for FY2017 through FY2026 are subtracted from cost estimates for budget controls. The appropriations from the account will not be counted against spending limits for FY2017 through FY2026. FDA regulates the safety of foods, cosmetics, drugs, and medical devices. FDA's budget has two funding streams: annual appropriations and industry user fees. The FDA's budget has two funding streams: annual appropriations and industry user fees. User fees contribute only to the Salaries and Expenses account, accounting for 42% of FDA's total program level in FY2016. The Science Board provides advice on scientific and technical issues important to the FDA's mission. The FDA Innovation Account, established by Section 1002, authorizes $500 million to be transferred over nine years for FDA Innovation Projects. These funds are available for activities like Patient Focused Drug Development and Medical Device Innovations. The FDA Innovation Account, established by Section 1002, authorizes $500 million to be transferred over nine years for FDA Innovation Projects. The appropriations from the account will not be counted against any spending limits for FY2017 through FY2025. The FDA Commissioner is required to submit a work plan within six months of enactment, detailing the proposed allocation of funds for each fiscal year for the FDA Innovation Projects. The FDA Commissioner must seek recommendations on fund allocations and work plan contents from the Science Board for FDA Innovation Projects. The work plan must include Science Board recommendations, funding details for each project, and project descriptions. The Commissioner must submit an annual report to congressional committees detailing funding allocation, project descriptions, and how activities benefit public health. Committees can request updates on funding allocation and project descriptions. Section 1002 of the FDA Innovation Projects specifies that funds may only be used for FDA Innovation fund projects until September 30, 2025. SAMHSA administers block grants and other grants authorized by PHSA Title XIX and Title V, with states required to report on block grant funds received. Section 1003 establishes the \"Account for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis\" with a transfer of $500 million to the Treasury. The \"State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis\" in the Treasury involves transferring $500 million for FY2017 and FY2018 to support state responses to opioid abuse through grants. Funds must be used specifically for addressing the crisis and supplementing opioid-related activities. Recipients must adhere to the same requirements as SAMHSA's substance abuse programs. The state receiving the grant must report on its use, with the amounts in the account only available upon appropriation. Appropriations from the account for FY2017 and FY2018 are excluded from spending limits. NIH's authority comes from the Public Health Service Act, granting the HHS Secretary research authority. The Public Health Service Act grants the HHS Secretary broad permanent authority to conduct and sponsor research. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 authorized funding levels for NIH appropriations for FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009. Overall NIH authorization expired in FY2009, but annual appropriations have allowed NIH programs to continue. Section 2001 of the Act authorizes appropriations for NIH in FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358) allows federal agencies to conduct prize competitions to stimulate innovation. The White House OSTP publishes annual reports on the implementation of this act. Several federal agencies, including NIH, sponsor challenges in science and medical research. Examples of research topics include breast cancer genetics, antimicrobial resistance, and drug abuse research. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 allows federal agencies like NIH to conduct prize competitions in areas such as breast cancer genetics, antimicrobial resistance, and drug abuse research. Section 2002 of the Act requires the NIH Director to support prize competitions for advancing biomedical science and improving health outcomes, particularly for diseases with a significant burden in the United States. The competitions may target diseases with limited research investment and potential for a high return on investment. The NIH Director is required to collect information on the impact of prize competition innovations on advancing biomedical science and health outcomes, as well as federal expenditures. Precision medicine, also known as personalized medicine, focuses on providing healthcare based on individual patient characteristics. The Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) was launched in 2015 and involves key entities like NIH, FDA, and ONC. The Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) involves key entities like NIH, FDA, and ONC. The FY2017 President's budget requests $309 million for PMI, with funds allocated to FDA, ONC, and NIH. Concerns exist regarding access to large amounts of health data for precision medicine research. The sharing of genetic and genomic data raises concerns about potential public release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), but exemptions allow agencies to withhold certain records. NIH issues Certificates of Confidentiality to protect research data from disclosure, promoting privacy and research participation. Sharing genomic data from NIH-funded research is also a concern under FOIA exemptions. NIH has established a policy for sharing genomic data from NIH-funded research to support precision medicine. Investigators must outline data-sharing plans in funding applications, or risk funding being withheld. Title II, Subtitle B aims to support precision medicine by codifying the PMI, issuing Certificates of Confidentiality, protecting sensitive information, and requiring data sharing in certain circumstances. Section 2011 is part of this effort. Section 2011 of Title II, Subtitle B codifies the President's Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) by encouraging the HHS Secretary to establish and carry out the PMI, identifying requirements of the initiative, and requiring data access policies and procedures to be submitted to Congress. Section 2012 amends PHSA Section 301(d) to issue Certificates of Confidentiality to research investigators collecting sensitive information in federally funded research. Section 2012 amends PHSA Section 301(d) to issue Certificates of Confidentiality to research investigators collecting sensitive information in federally funded research, protecting the privacy of research participants and making the information immune from legal processes. The HHS Secretary must ensure these protections exist indefinitely, minimize compliance burden for researchers, and coordinate across HHS entities. Effective 180 days after enactment, Section 2013 allows the HHS Secretary to exempt specified biomedical information from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(3) to prevent reidentification risks. Section 2014 amends PHSA Section 402(b) to allow the HHS Secretary to require recipients of NIH grants to share data in compliance with federal laws. Congress aims to reduce the time for young investigators to receive their first independent NIH research grant. NIH has initiatives to expedite this process. The NIH has initiatives to reduce the time for young investigators to achieve research independence. The Next Generation of Researchers Initiative was established to coordinate NIH policies and programs focused on promoting opportunities for new researchers and earlier research independence. The NIH Director is required to coordinate with various entities to improve information on the biomedical workforce for training and retention programs. NIH funds seven loan repayment programs for researchers, including three intramural programs supporting researchers from disadvantaged backgrounds. The NIH funds seven loan repayment programs for researchers, including programs supporting those investigating AIDS, health disparities, contraception and infertility, clinical research, and pediatric-related topics. Researchers may receive up to $35,000 per year in loan repayment benefits under each program. Loan repayment appropriations remain available until the end of the second fiscal year after they are appropriated. Section 2022 renames PHSA Section 487A to \"Intramural Loan Repayment Program.\" Section 2022 of the PHSA renames the \"Intramural Loan Repayment Program\" and consolidates existing NIH programs. It transfers administration to the NIH Director, increases maximum repayment amounts to $50,000, and expands benefits to researchers in emerging scientific areas. The NIH Director can adjust eligible categories as priorities change and must consider loan amounts relative to income before entering into contracts. Section 2022 of the PHSA amends the NIH's extramural loan repayment program, transferring authority to the NIH Director, increasing maximum repayment amounts to $50,000 per year, and requiring individuals to have substantial educational loans relative to income. Amounts appropriated for new loan repayment contracts remain available for two fiscal years. Section 2022 of the PHSA amends the NIH's extramural loan repayment program, increasing maximum repayment amounts to $50,000 per year and expanding eligibility to researchers in emerging scientific areas. It also authorizes the NIH Director to adjust eligible categories as priorities change and repeals existing authorizations for NIH loan repayment programs. A GAO report is required to assess NIH efforts in attracting and retaining emerging scientists, including underrepresented individuals in the sciences. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 enhanced the authority of the NIH Director's Office for strategic planning and established the Common Fund to support research priorities. The Act aims to address workforce shortages in the sciences and requires coordination among NIH Institutes and Centers for strategic planning. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 established the Common Fund to support research priorities and enhance the authority of the NIH Director's Office for strategic planning. Section 2031 of the Act requires the development and submission of a six-year NIH Strategic Plan every two years to guide biomedical research investments, promote collaboration among Institutes and Centers, and advance biomedicine. The NIH Strategic Plan focuses on addressing disease burden, health disparities, coordinating research, funding priorities, training the biomedical workforce, and collaborating with other agencies. The plan is informed by input from IC directors, researchers, patient advocacy groups, and industry leaders. PHSA Title IV establishes reporting requirements for the NIH Director related to agency activities. The NIH Director is required to submit a report to Congress biennially on NIH activities, including an assessment of biomedical and behavioral research. Section 2032 changes this to a triennial requirement and adds new reporting requirements, such as describing intra-NIH activities and funding for collaborative research. The National Cancer Institute Director is appointed by the President, while other NIH Institute Directors are appointed by the HHS Secretary. NIH Institutes are appointed by the HHS Secretary, and each Director reports to the NIH Director. Research proposals are evaluated through a two-tiered peer review system by expert committees. Funding decisions are based on the scientific merit score assigned by reviewers and further reviewed for program relevance by the IC's National Advisory. Section 202 of the Labor/HHS/ED Appropriations Act, 1993, sets limits on compensation for consultants and scientists appointed for limited periods of time by NIH ICs. Section 2033 amends PHSA Section 405 regarding the appointment and terms of directors of NIH ICs, requiring their appointment by the HHS Secretary through the NIH Director. The HHS Secretary, through the NIH Director, appoints IC Directors for five-year terms, with the option for reappointment and removal if necessary. Vacancies in IC Director positions result in a new five-year term. Compensation limitations for consultants and scientists are outlined in Section 2033. The Labor/HHS/ED Appropriations Act, 1993, exempts IC Directors from time-limited appointments for consultants and scientists. IC Directors must review and approve new research grants, considering IC mission, scientific priorities, and input from staff and advisory councils. The HHS Secretary must report to Congress on efforts to prevent duplicative biomedical research within two years of enactment. The report must describe how the HHS Secretary distinguishes necessary scientific replication from unnecessary duplication and provide examples of steps taken to eliminate unnecessary duplication. The Federal Demonstration Partnership aims to reduce administrative burdens in federal research grants. Surveys in 2005 and 2012 found researchers spend 57% of their time on research and 43% on pre- and post-award requirements. The most time-consuming administrative responsibilities for researchers include federal project finances, personnel, effort reporting, IRB and IACUC requirements for projects involving human or animal subjects, clinical trials, subcontracts, and cross-agency differences. Section 2034 aims to reduce administrative burden on researchers funded by NIH and other federal agencies by reviewing financial conflict-of-interest regulations and policies. The HHS Secretary and NIH Director are required to review financial conflict-of-interest regulations and policies to reduce administrative burden on researchers. Additionally, measures will be implemented to reduce burdens related to monitoring grant sub-recipients and evaluate financial expenditure reporting procedures for NIH funding recipients. The HHS Secretary, NIH Director, and FDA Commissioner will review regulations for laboratory animal care to reduce administrative burden on investigators. The OMB Director will establish a Research Policy Board to harmonize regulations and minimize administrative burden across federal research agencies. The Research Policy Board will submit reports on scientific research policy to specified offices and committees, with recommendations on regulatory benefits and burdens. The board will sunset in 2021, and a GAO evaluation will be conducted within four years. The Paperwork Reduction Act established OIRA in OMB, requiring agencies to seek permission before collecting public information. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) aims to minimize paperwork burden for individuals by requiring federal agencies to obtain clearance from OIRA before collecting information from the public. PRA clearance is needed for standardized information collected from 10 or more respondents within a year. PRA exemptions include certain scientific research not sponsored or conducted by the agency. Section 2035 of the PHSA exempts NIH research from PRA requirements. Other transaction (OT) authority is used by federal agencies for research and development funding. The government uses Other Transaction (OT) authority for research and development (R&D) funding. OT is not a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement, and is used when agencies need leading-edge R&D from commercial sources. OT authority is granted to certain agencies, allowing them to engage in transactions other than contracts or grants. Section 2036 of the PHSA allows the NIH Director to approve OT requests for projects related to the Precision Medicine Initiative or emerging scientific opportunities. The provision requires collaboration between multiple ICs for research on emerging scientific opportunities and public health challenges. Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to test medical products before FDA approval. Phase I trials determine dosing, metabolism, and side effects with a small number of healthy volunteers. Phase II trials involve more participants with the disease to gather safety data and preliminary efficacy evidence. Phase III trials study the drug in a larger group to confirm efficacy. In Phase III trials, a larger number of participants with the disease are studied to test the drug's effectiveness, monitor side effects, and compare effects to standard treatment. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) can provide resources for all phases of clinical trials research but only supports activities up to the end of Phase IIA, with exceptions for rare diseases in Phase IIB. NCATS intends to support clinical trial activities in Phase IIB for at least 120 days, with no other organization showing intent to continue trials beyond Phase IIA. NCATS' support in Phase IIB will not increase federal liability. Section 2037 extends NCATS' authority to Phase IIB and rare disease treatment to Phase III. The NCATS annual/biennial report will include methods and tools developed since the previous report, with a focus on their use by the FDA in medical product reviews. The report will also list all methods and tools developed by NCATS-supported research. Racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented in clinical trials, which can be attributed to biological differences affecting how individuals respond to treatments. The importance of studying the safety and effectiveness of medical products in a diverse sample of people, including women and minorities, is highlighted in PHSA Section 492B. This section requires the NIH Director to include women and minorities in clinical research and develop guidelines for their inclusion. Additionally, Section 2038 amends PHSA Section 402(b) to ensure accurate data on study populations, specifying the inclusion of women, members of minority groups, and relevant age groups. The NIH Director is required to include women, minorities, and relevant age groups in clinical research, with data disaggregated by research area and made public on the NIH website. Collaboration between research ICs is encouraged, along with utilizing a diverse study population to address health disparities. Section 2038 amends PHSA to make the biennial report a triennial report, requiring specified data on women and minority group inclusion in clinical research projects. Section 2038 of the PHSA requires the NIH Director to promote research on the health of sexual and gender minority populations by increasing their participation in clinical research. The HHS Secretary, in collaboration with the NIH Director, must support the development of measures for reporting health information of these populations, which will be disseminated within two years. Additionally, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Director may be involved in these efforts. The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Director may foster partnerships between ICs and encourage collaborative research to achieve NIH goals related to minority health and health disparities. Within two years, the NIH Director must develop policies for basic research to assess biological variables, including sex differences, and consult with relevant offices and communities. The NIH Director is required to update guidelines on sex differences in research, convene a workshop on age groups in studies, and potentially update policies on age group inclusion in clinical studies. The NIH Director must ensure age-related data in the triennial report is publicly available on the NIH website. Research supported by NIH undergoes a peer review system where applications are evaluated for scientific merit by expert committees. Applications are then reviewed for program relevance by IC's National Advisory Councils or Boards. The NIH Director is required to convene a working group to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of NIH-funded research. Recommendations must be considered, policies developed or updated, and a report issued to Congress within two years. No disclosure of confidential information is authorized. The National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research was established in 1990 within the NIH to conduct research on the rehabilitation of individuals with physical disabilities. It also required the creation of a Medical Rehabilitation Coordinating Committee and a National Advisory Board on Medical Rehabilitation Research. Section 2040 amended PHSA Section 452 to instruct the Director of the Center to develop a comprehensive plan for medical rehabilitation research. The PHSA Section 452 mandates the Director of the Center to collaborate with the Institute, coordinating committee, and advisory board to develop and update a comprehensive plan for medical rehabilitation research every five years. The plan must include research goals and objectives, with progress reports and recommendations provided to the coordinating committee and advisory board. The Director must transmit the updated plan to the President and congressional committees. Additionally, Section 2040 requires the HHS Secretary and other federal agencies to review and prevent duplication in medical rehabilitation research programs. Section 2040 of the PHSA mandates the HHS Secretary and other federal agencies to review and prevent duplication in medical rehabilitation research programs. Section 2041 requires the establishment of a Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant and Lactating Women, with specified duties and reporting requirements. The HHS Secretary is also required to update regulations regarding the inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in research within two years of enactment. The PHSA Title IV mandates reporting requirements for the NIH Director on biomedical and behavioral research activities. Section 2042 modifies NIH reporting requirements, including a report on funding for collaborative research between different ICs. The PHSA Title IV mandates reporting requirements for the NIH Director on biomedical and behavioral research activities, including collaborative research funding between different ICs. This information will be included in the triennial report required by Section 403(a), as amended by Section 2032. Additionally, it eliminates various annual and periodic reporting requirements related to experts, consultants, doctoral degrees, vaccines, NCATS, Centers of Excellence, rapid HIV testing, and the National Institute on Nursing Research. The HHS Secretary is authorized to provide assistance to public authorities, scientific institutions, and scientists for research on physical and mental diseases. Section 2043 allows the Secretary to collect payments for research substances and organisms provided to researchers. The NIH Director ensures clinical research includes minority groups as subjects. IC advisory councils report compliance biennially. Congress urges inclusion of underrepresented populations in clinical trials. Sponsors must submit trial information to ClinicalTrials.gov. The NIH Director ensures diverse inclusion in clinical research. ClinicalTrials.gov requires registration of trial information for FDA-regulated products. The HHS Secretary expanded requirements for submission of clinical trial results information to ClinicalTrials.gov in a proposed rule published in November 2014. The final rule, published in September 2016, will take effect on January 18, 2017. Section 2051 of PHSA now requires the NIH Director to inform responsible parties of the option to request public posting of medical device clinical trial information before clearance or approval. Section 2052 of the PHSA requires the HHS Secretary, in collaboration with the NIH Director and FDA Commissioner, to submit a report to Congress within two years of enactment. This report describes efforts to promote compliance with the clinical trials database requirements and includes information on registered clinical trials activities. The HHS Secretary must submit reports on registered clinical trials, compliance with reporting requirements, and efforts to include women and minorities in NIH-funded research. The reports also detail actions taken to enforce compliance with ClinicalTrials.gov requirements. Section 2053 of the PHSA amends requirements for grant recipients conducting research on women and minority populations in clinical trials. The NIH Director must ensure compliance with reporting requirements and consider this when awarding future grants. The HHS Secretary must consult with FDA, NIH, and CDC before establishing a data bank on clinical trials for serious diseases. The PHSA requires the HHS Secretary to consult with experts to ensure accurate information on a database for clinical trials. It also mandates consultation with federal agencies and stakeholders to improve ClinicalTrials.gov within 90 days. The PHSA does not specifically mandate surveillance of neurological diseases. The PHSA does not mandate surveillance of neurological diseases in general, but authorizes it for specific disorders like ALS and autism. A new section requires the HHS Secretary to establish a National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System to collect data for research purposes. The PHSA authorizes surveillance for specific neurological disorders like ALS and autism. A new section requires the HHS Secretary to establish a National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System to collect data for research purposes, including diagnostic markers, prevention, detection, management, and treatment approaches. The HHS Secretary may address a limited number of neurological diseases and award grants for implementation. Information obtained must be shared with federal health agencies, state and local agencies, researchers, and the public. Reports on the system's establishment and implementation are required to be provided to Congress and the public. The PHSA authorizes the HHS Secretary to conduct research on disease causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Funding of $5 million per year is allocated for activities from 2018 to 2022. While not explicitly mentioned, HHS agencies research tick-borne diseases under the Secretary's authority. Section 2062 mandates ongoing research on vector-borne diseases, including tick-borne diseases. The PHSA authorizes the HHS Secretary to conduct research on disease causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, including tick-borne diseases. It requires the HHS Secretary to ensure that the NIH Director's triennial report to Congress includes information on NIH activities related to tick-borne diseases. Additionally, a working group must be established to review tick-borne disease research and federal activities, reporting every two years. The group's membership, responsibilities, meeting frequency, and reporting are outlined, and it will terminate six years after enactment. The HIPAA privacy rule governs the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by HIPAA-covered entities. The HIPAA privacy rule allows covered entities to use or disclose PHI for treatment, payment, and routine health care operations with few restrictions. Researchers generally need individual authorization, unless waived by an Institutional Review Board. HHS now permits authorizations for future research with clear descriptions. Section 2063 of the HIPAA privacy rule instructs the HHS Secretary to issue guidance clarifying researchers' access to PHI, allowing remote access with safeguards in place and specifying requirements for HIPAA authorizations for future research. Section 2063 of the HIPAA privacy rule requires the HHS Secretary to convene a working group to study the uses and disclosures of PHI for research purposes. The working group must provide recommendations on potential modifications for research purposes, with the report being submitted to Congress and made publicly available. Additionally, Section 2071 amends PHSA Section 409(D)(d) to enhance support for pediatric research through the NIH Pediatric Research Network. Section 2071 amends PHSA Section 409(D)(d) to enhance support for pediatric research through the NIH Pediatric Research Network, eliminating the requirement to consult with the Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. It now requires collaboration with ICs conducting pediatric research, funding for pediatric research consortia, and limits support to five years. Section 2072 urges NIH to establish a global pediatric clinical study network, engage with international authorities, and support new investigators. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) expanded FDA's authorities to safeguard public health by increasing patient participation in the regulatory process for medical product review. Section 569C of the FDASIA directs the HHS Secretary to develop strategies to involve patients in the development process and regulatory discussions. Section 3001 of the FDASIA requires the HHS Secretary to make patient experience data public upon approval of a new drug application, including information submitted by patients, caregivers, and advocacy organizations. Section 3002 of the FDASIA mandates the development of guidance on collecting patient experience data for drug development over five years, including methods for data collection and analysis. Section 3003 exempts FDA from the Paperwork Reduction Act when requesting information. Section 3003 of the 21st Century Cures Act exempts FDA from the Paperwork Reduction Act for patient experience data requests. Section 3004 requires the HHS Secretary to publish reports on patient experience data use in regulatory decisions. Surrogate endpoints using biomarkers can expedite drug development in long clinical trials. Surrogate endpoints enable faster and cheaper clinical trials, but favorable effects on surrogates may not always translate to health benefits. FDA approves about half of new drugs based on surrogate endpoints. Clinical endpoints reflect how a patient feels, functions, or survives, while surrogate endpoints are biomarkers. The FDA approves new drugs based on surrogate endpoints, which are biomarkers that substitute for clinical endpoints. Surrogate endpoints predict clinical benefit based on scientific evidence, such as blood pressure in cardiovascular disease trials. FDASIA amended FFDCA Section 506 to encourage the development of surrogate and clinical endpoints. Section 3011 of FDASIA introduces a new FFDCA Section 507, \"Qualification of Drug Development Tools,\" requiring the HHS Secretary to establish a process for qualifying drug development tools like biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments. The HHS Secretary can prioritize review based on factors like disease severity or prevalence. The HHS Secretary can consult with biomedical research consortia to review qualification submissions for drug development tools. These consortia are collaborative groups that include various stakeholders. The Secretary must conduct a full review to determine if the tool is qualified for its intended use in drug development. The HHS Secretary can rescind or modify granted qualification for drug development tools if deemed inappropriate, with the requestor granted a meeting to discuss the decision. New FFDCA Section 507 mandates the Secretary to make public information on qualification submissions and determinations, while ensuring confidentiality of drug approval or licensure applications. The HHS Secretary is required to publish draft guidance to implement new FFDCA Section 507 within three years of enactment, in consultation with stakeholders. The guidance will describe appropriate standards and scientific approaches for biomarker development, with final guidance issued within six months after the comment period closes. The HHS Secretary is required to develop a taxonomy for biomarker classification for drug development, with a public meeting and report publication mandated within specified timeframes. Precision medicine, also known as personalized medicine, focuses on providing healthcare based on individual patient characteristics. Precision medicine focuses on providing healthcare based on individual patient characteristics, using companion diagnostics to target drugs to specific subsets of patients. Targeted therapies for rare genetic diseases are challenging to develop due to small patient populations, leading to the creation of orphan drugs for treating small subsets of patients. Orphan drugs are designated to treat rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the US. The Orphan Drug Act encourages firms to develop pharmaceuticals for these conditions by providing market exclusivity. A new FFDCA section, 529A, aims to facilitate the development of genetically targeted drugs for rare diseases. Section 3012 of the FFDCA allows the HHS Secretary to permit reliance on previously submitted data for genetically targeted drugs and variant protein-targeted drugs to address rare diseases. The new FFDCA Section 529A defines genetically targeted drugs and variant protein targeted drugs. It does not limit the HHS Secretary's product approval authorities or allow sponsors to access another sponsor's application without permission. FDASIA added Section 529, creating a pediatric priority review voucher program funded by user fees. This program provides a transferable voucher to a sponsor of an approved new drug for a rare pediatric disease for priority review of another application. A rare pediatric disease affects individuals aged 0-18 years and fewer than 200,000 persons in the US. The FDASIA created a pediatric priority review voucher program for rare pediatric diseases, allowing sponsors to transfer a voucher for priority review of another drug application. BioMarin sold a voucher for $67.5 million for the drug Vimizim, which was used to expedite the approval of Praluent. The program was terminated one year after the third voucher was awarded, with the FDA awarding the third voucher in March 2015. The pediatric priority review voucher program for rare pediatric diseases was extended multiple times, with the latest extension in September 2016. The definition of \"rare pediatric disease\" was amended to include individuals aged from birth to 18 years. The 21st Century Cures Act extended the pediatric priority review voucher program for rare pediatric diseases until September 30, 2020. The program incentivizes the development of drugs for rare pediatric diseases. The GAO was required to study the program's effectiveness, but this requirement was removed. A drug designated as a rare pediatric disease drug before September 30, 2020, remains eligible for a priority review voucher if approved by September 30, 2022. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992, FDA established a two-tiered system for drug review times: Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review aims to take action on an application within 6 months for drugs treating serious conditions with significant safety or effectiveness improvements. FDA has two priority review voucher programs funded by user fees. The bill creates a new priority review voucher program to incentivize the development of drugs and vaccines for national security threats. A study will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of existing FDA priority review voucher programs. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 incentivizes drug development for rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US. FDA has approved over 400 new orphan drugs since its passage, providing sponsors with market exclusivity and tax credits. The bill also establishes a new priority review voucher program for drugs and vaccines targeting national security threats, with a study to evaluate existing FDA voucher programs. Sponsors of orphan drugs receive market exclusivity, tax credits, user fee waivers, and federal grants for clinical testing expenses. The Orphan Drug Act grants exclusivity for specific time periods to approved drug applications for rare diseases or conditions, first generic versions, certain pediatric uses, and new infectious disease products. FDA does not approve marketing for other manufacturers during exclusivity. HHS Secretary can provide grants for clinical testing expenses related to rare disease drug development. Section 5 of the Orphan Drug Act defines \"qualified testing\" as clinical testing expenses for drugs developed for rare diseases. It includes human clinical testing under specific exemptions and preclinical testing before drug application submission. Section 3015 expands the use of grants by HHS for clinical testing expenses. Section 5 of the Orphan Drug Act broadens the use of grants by the HHS Secretary to include observational studies and analyses for rare diseases. The FDA Commissioner mentioned new manufacturing technologies that could lower costs and reduce supply chain vulnerabilities. Section 3016 allows the HHS Secretary to award grants for these purposes. Section 3016 of the Orphan Drug Act allows the HHS Secretary to award grants for studying and recommending improvements to the process of continuous manufacturing of drugs and biological products. Traditional clinical trials have a pre-planned design to avoid bias in data review. In recent years, researchers have explored adaptive trial designs and statistical analyses, such as Bayesian statistics, to provide mid-course feedback in clinical trials. The FDA has been cautious in accepting alternative trial designs to avoid mistaken findings of drug effectiveness or safety. In 2010, the FDA published draft guidance on the use of adaptive trial design, requiring the HHS Secretary to issue guidance to assist sponsors in incorporating novel trial designs into clinical protocols for new drugs under FFDCA. The FDA has published draft guidance on incorporating novel trial designs into clinical protocols for new drugs under FFDCA Section 505. The HHS Secretary must consult with stakeholders before updating or issuing guidance, which should address complex adaptive trial designs and the types of information to be submitted for review. Final guidance must be issued within one year after the public comment period on the draft. The FDA reviews new drug applications to determine safety and effectiveness based on substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical investigations. If one study provides sufficient data for effectiveness, confirmatory evidence may also be considered. The Secretary may consider data and evidence as substantial evidence for effectiveness in new drug approval. A structured risk-benefit assessment framework will be implemented to balance benefits and risks, with criteria for evaluating drug applications remaining unchanged. Characteristics of \"adequate and well-controlled studies\" are outlined in the associated rule. The FDA rule outlines characteristics of controlled clinical trials for determining effectiveness claims. A new provision requires the evaluation of real-world evidence to support new drug indications and post-approval studies. The provision requires the evaluation of \"real world evidence\" for new drug indications and post-approval studies. The HHS Secretary must establish a framework for the program, consult with interested parties, and use the program to inform industry guidance. This does not change the standards for drug approval. The HHS Human Subject Regulations, also known as the \"Common Rule,\" set federal standards for protecting human subjects in research. Research protocols must be approved by an Institutional Review Board to ensure subjects' rights and welfare are protected, including obtaining informed consent. The Common Rule outlines the requirements for informed consent in research, including providing information on the purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits to subjects. IRBs can waive consent if the research poses minimal risk and is not feasible otherwise. Additional protections are in place for vulnerable populations like pregnant women, prisoners, and children. FDA has its own regulations similar to the Common Rule. The FDA has regulations similar to the Common Rule for research oversight, applying to all research it regulates, including clinical trials. Humanitarian use devices require local IRB approval for use in facilities, with exceptions for emergencies. HHS proposed amendments to the Common Rule in 2011 to enhance protections for human subjects and streamline the research oversight system. HHS is seeking comments on refining the risk-based regulatory framework, coordinating IRB review of multisite studies, and harmonizing regulations and guidance across different agencies. A proposed rule to amend the Common Rule was released by HHS and 15 other federal departments and agencies. Section 3023 requires harmonization of HHS and FDA Human Subject Regulations, reducing duplications and delays, accommodating multisite research projects, and protecting vulnerable populations. Section 3024 of the FDA regulations allows the HHS Secretary to waive informed consent for individuals in clinical trials of medical devices if minimal risk is involved and appropriate safeguards are in place. Harmonization of HHS and FDA regulations is required to avoid duplication and delays in research projects involving vulnerable populations. Section 3024 of the FDA regulations allows the HHS Secretary to waive informed consent for individuals in clinical trials of medical devices if minimal risk is involved and appropriate safeguards are in place. This amendment also modifies the requirement for informed consent for drug trials, allowing exemptions if it is not feasible, contrary to human interest, or poses minimal risk with safeguards in place. The FDA requires sponsors to submit an NDA with data on a drug's safety and effectiveness, manufacturing process, and labeling. Manufacturers must submit a supplemental NDA for any changes in labeling, manufacturing, dosing, or adding a new indication. Regulations specify the required contents of these applications, including clinical data analysis and relevant safety and effectiveness information. The FDA requires sponsors to submit an NDA with data on a drug's safety and effectiveness, manufacturing process, and labeling. Manufacturers must submit a supplemental NDA for any changes in labeling, manufacturing, dosing, or adding a new indication. The clinical data submission must include an integrated summary demonstrating substantial evidence of effectiveness for claimed indications. HHS Secretary can rely on qualified data summaries to support approval of a supplemental NDA for adding a new qualified indication. The HHS Secretary can approve a supplemental NDA for a new qualified indication based on a qualified data summary demonstrating safety and effectiveness. The FDA regulates drug approval based on evidence of safety and effectiveness. The FDA regulates drug approval based on evidence of safety and effectiveness, including for biological products. Approval or licensure is required for distribution, but under certain circumstances, expanded access to investigational drugs, known as \"compassionate use,\" may be granted to patients with serious diseases lacking alternative therapies. Expanded access to investigational drugs, also known as \"compassionate use,\" is limited by the manufacturer's decision to provide the drug, as the FDA cannot compel them to participate. Manufacturers consider factors such as supply, liability risk, resources, and data needs when deciding. FDA reports the number of requests received, but manufacturers do not disclose this information. Section 3032 of the FFDCA requires manufacturers or distributors of investigational drugs for serious diseases to make their compassionate use policies public. The policy must include contact information, request procedures, criteria for evaluation, response time, and a link to the clinical trial record. Posting the policy does not guarantee patient access to the drug. The 21st Century Cures Act allows manufacturers to revise their compassionate use policies for investigational drugs. Regenerative medicine involves creating functional tissues to replace damaged ones. The FDA regulates cells and tissues intended for implantation in patients, including stem cells. The 21st Century Cures Act allows for efficient development and expedited review of regenerative advanced therapies. These therapies must be intended to treat serious diseases, have preliminary clinical evidence, and may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. The 21st Century Cures Act allows for expedited review of regenerative advanced therapies, including cell therapy and tissue engineering products. Eligible therapies can request priority review and accelerated approval, with early FDA interactions. Postapproval requirements are specified, without altering existing approval authorities. Section 3034 mandates draft guidance issuance by the FDA Commissioner. The 21st Century Cures Act mandates the issuance of draft guidance by the FDA Commissioner for regenerative advanced therapies. It also requires the HHS Secretary to submit an annual report to Congress on the status of applications for these therapies. Additionally, a new section is added to the FFDCA for standards in regenerative medicine and therapies. The new Section 506G mandates the HHS Secretary, in consultation with NIST and stakeholders, to develop standards for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies. It also requires the review and update of relevant regulations and guidance, coordination of timely review of combination products by the Office of Combination Products, and additional duties related to communication and facilitating meetings. The new Section 506G mandates the HHS Secretary to develop standards for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies in consultation with NIST and stakeholders. It also requires updating regulations and guidance, coordinating timely review of combination products by the Office of Combination Products, and adding duties related to communication and meetings. The HHS Secretary is required to identify types of combination products and manufacturing processes that may adopt different good manufacturing processes. Drug or device misbranding under FFDCA Section 502 includes false or misleading labeling. Health care economic information related to approved drug uses is not considered misleading if based on scientific evidence. Drug companies are not allowed to promote unapproved uses of drugs that have not been deemed safe and effective by the FDA. Health care providers can prescribe drugs for off-label use if they believe it is medically appropriate. Companies argue that current regulations hinder them from sharing important information about off-label uses with physicians. FDA held a public meeting in November 2016 to gather input on off-label uses of medical products. Section 3037 allows drug and device companies to provide health care economic information to payors, formulary committees, and similar entities. This information can now be \"related\" to an FDA-approved indication, rather than \"directly-related\" as previously required. The standard of \"competent and reliable scientific evidence\" is maintained, with a requirement to disclose any material differences in the information provided. The FDA allows drug and device companies to provide health care economic information related to an FDA-approved indication. The information must be supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence, with a requirement to disclose any material differences. The definition of health care economic information has been expanded to include various components of analysis. FDA regulatory authority covers drugs, biological products, and medical devices. The FDA divides responsibilities for reviewing marketing applications among its product-centered offices. CDER reviews new drug applications, CBER reviews biologics license applications, and CDRH reviews premarket approval applications and 510(k) notifications. In 2002, Congress directed FDA to establish OCP to regulate combination products. Both drugs and devices are defined as products intended to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease. Unlike drugs, devices do not achieve their primary function. The FDA assigns different centers to review marketing applications for drugs, biologics, and devices. OCP regulates combination products, determining primary mode of action. Manufacturers must prove device exclusionary clause to be treated as a device. Products assigned to CDER face higher evidence standards, user fees, and longer review times than those assigned to CDRH. Section 3038 amends FFDCA to assign a primary center for regulation. Section 3038 of the FFDCA amends regulations for combination products, requiring the HHS Secretary to assign a primary center for their regulation and conduct premarket reviews under a single application. The determination of the primary mode of action for a combination product is crucial for the review process, with the HHS Secretary needing to provide a scientific rationale if sponsors disagree with the determination. The sponsor may propose additional studies to establish the relevance of any chemical action in the product's primary mode of action. They can request a meeting for clarity and certainty. The HHS Secretary can require submission of necessary safety information for combination products with approved constituent components. When submitting a combination product through a device pathway containing an approved drug constituent, the applicant must certify patents related to the drug and give notice to the patent owner. The product may be eligible for various regulatory exclusivity periods. The 505(b)(2) application allows for separate applications for constituent parts of a combination product unless deemed necessary by the HHS Secretary. OCP coordinates timely reviews and designates points of contact for sponsors. Final guidance on the review process must be issued within four years, with added reporting requirements to Congress. The OCP amends FFDCA Section 520(h)(4) to prohibit using information from a class III device application in a combination product application with an approved drug constituent without a patent certification. The HHS Secretary must identify types of combination products and manufacturing processes for different good manufacturing processes within 18 months. This list will be published in the Federal Register and updated as needed. The CDC reports that in the U.S., 2 million people get antibiotic-resistant infections annually, with 23,000 deaths. The U.S. National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB) has five goals: Antibiotic Stewardship, One Health Surveillance, Diagnostic Innovations, Treatment Research, and Prevention Development. The section amends PHSA Section 319E to require the HHS Secretary to carry out activities related to reporting antimicrobial drug use, drug resistance, and stewardship programs in healthcare facilities. The HHS Secretary is mandated to provide guidance on antimicrobial stewardship, assist states with resistance prevention, and establish a reporting mechanism for facilities. Data collected will be made publicly available, addressing barriers to new antimicrobial drug development. Limited population drug approval pathway is one approach to this issue. The Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs allows the HHS Secretary to approve new antimicrobial drugs for serious or life-threatening infections in a limited patient population with unmet medical needs. The pathway requires meeting new drug approval standards and a written request from the sponsor. The Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs allows the HHS Secretary to approve new antimicrobial drugs for serious or life-threatening infections in a limited patient population with unmet medical needs. Products approved using this pathway must carry prominent labeling noting the intended use for a limited and specific population of patients. Sponsors must submit promotional materials to FDA for review 30 days prior to dissemination. The legislation requires the HHS Secretary to provide timely advice to sponsors on limited population drug approval. If the drug later receives broader approval, post-marketing conditions can be removed. The HHS Secretary must report to Congress biennially on approval requests. The Comptroller General will report on the pathway's impact on drug resistance by December 2021. This section does not affect the HHS Secretary's drug approval authority. The FFDCA regulates product sponsors in marketing, labeling, and promotion of medical products, but not healthcare providers in the practice of medicine. Providers can prescribe drugs off-label. Section 3043 clarifies that it does not restrict healthcare professionals' prescribing authority or limit healthcare practice. Laboratory tests help determine drug effectiveness against specific infections. The FFDCA regulates product sponsors in marketing, labeling, and promotion of medical products. Section 3044 establishes a new FFDCA Section 511A, \"Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microorganisms,\" to ensure antimicrobial drug and AST device labels reflect current information. The new FFDCA Section 511A clarifies the HHS Secretary's authority to update susceptibility test interpretive criteria for addressing drug resistance. It requires the establishment of a public \"Interpretive Criteria Website\" within one year of enactment to list recognized criteria standards. The new FFDCA Section 511A requires the establishment of a public \"Interpretive Criteria Website\" to list recognized criteria standards for antimicrobial drugs. The website must meet specified requirements for transparency and conflict of interest management. The HHS Secretary is required to publish a notice of establishment in the Federal Register. Reference to the website in drug labeling does not constitute misbranding, and protected trade secret information cannot be disclosed. The HHS Secretary must review and update criteria standards for antimicrobial drugs on the Interpretive Criteria Website every six months. Any changes must be published on the FDA website and in the Federal Register annually for public comment. These criteria are considered recognized standards for premarket review and legal requirements. Sponsors can use standards not listed on the website. Sponsors of antimicrobial drugs must reference the Interpretive Criteria Website on the label for drugs approved after its establishment. Section 3044 allows the HHS Secretary to authorize the marketing of AST devices using website information instead of clinical trials. The section also acknowledges interpretive criteria standards on the website. The section recognizes interpretive criteria standards on the Interpretive Criteria Website as device standards. It requires the HHS Secretary to report to Congress on implementation progress and exempts FDA from Paperwork Reduction Act requirements when updating susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards. This section does not affect the HHS Secretary's authority to clear devices under the FFDCA or PHSA. FDA mandates registration, listing, and adherence to general controls for medical device manufacturers. Devices are classified based on risk, with low-risk devices exempt from premarket review and application submission. Most medical devices listed with FDA are exempt from premarket review, with about two-thirds falling into this category. Moderate- and high-risk devices require premarket review for FDA approval before marketing. Manufacturers can use the premarket approval (PMA) pathway or the 510(k) pathway to bring devices to market. PMA involves FDA assessing device safety and effectiveness, while 510(k) involves clearance based on substantial equivalence. The FDA determines the safety and effectiveness of medical devices through 510(k) reviews, which assess if the device is equivalent to others. The review time includes FDA handling time and sponsor responses. Priority is given to breakthrough technologies with no approved alternatives under FFDCA Section 515(d)(5). The FDA issued draft and final guidance on expedited access for premarket approval medical devices for unmet medical needs. The guidance focuses on balancing risks and benefits, drafting a Data Development Plan, and collecting postmarket data for devices with priority review designation. The FDA's expedited review process for medical devices with priority designation involves lower premarket requirements, increased postmarket data collection, and reliance on surrogate endpoints. The Expedited Access PMA program aims to provide earlier access to safe and effective devices through interactive engagement with FDA staff. FDA may withdraw approval if sponsors fail to meet postmarket requirements or if data show the device is not safe and effective. The FDA's expedited review process for medical devices with priority designation involves lower premarket requirements, increased postmarket data collection, and reliance on surrogate endpoints. Comments on the FDA draft guidance questioned the agency's ability to enforce postmarket study requirements and urged evaluation of FDA's authority to promptly withdraw product approval if necessary data are not collected or if product benefits do not outweigh risks. The EAP program estimates that about six devices a year may qualify, representing 15% of FDA's total PMA applications. Concerns were raised about FDA's resources dedicated to the EAP program. Section 3051 adds a new \"Breakthrough Devices\" section to the FFDCA, requiring the HHS Secretary to establish it. The new section of the FFDCA requires the HHS Secretary to establish a program for priority review of medical devices that offer more effective diagnosis or treatment for life-threatening conditions. Requests for priority review can be made for PMA, 510(k), and one other type of regulatory decision. The HHS Secretary must decide on the request within 60 days, with evaluation by experienced FDA staff. If approved, the designation cannot be withdrawn. The HHS Secretary approves priority review designation for medical devices offering more effective diagnosis or treatment for life-threatening conditions. Once approved, the designation cannot be withdrawn even if another breakthrough device is cleared. Each priority review device is assigned a team of staff with appropriate expertise overseen by senior FDA personnel to facilitate efficient development and review. Interactive communication with the sponsor is required during the review process, and manufacturing and quality systems compliance are expedited. The HHS Secretary must disclose information to the sponsor at least 5 business days in advance. The HHS Secretary is required to disclose information to the sponsor at least 5 business days in advance regarding consultations with external experts or advisory committees. They may coordinate with the sponsor on a data development plan and ensure efficient clinical trial design. Agreements on clinical protocols are binding and must be agreed to in writing, with the possibility of changes under certain circumstances. The HHS Secretary must issue guidance on implementing new FFDCA Section 515C and report to committees on the program. The Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) encourages devices for rare conditions. Section 3052 amends FFDCA Section 520(m) to allow HDE grants. Section 3052 of the FFDCA allows for the granting of a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) to treat and diagnose diseases affecting up to 8,000 individuals in the US. The HHS Secretary must publish guidance on evaluating the health benefit of HDE devices. FDA classification of medical devices into Class I, II, or III determines regulatory requirements based on risk levels. Class II devices are subject to special controls to ensure safety and effectiveness, including special labeling requirements, premarket data requirements, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, guidelines, and performance standards. However, only about 15% of Class II devices have these controls in place due to the lack of promulgated standards by the FDA. The FDA has faced challenges in fully developing guidance and standards for Class II devices due to resource limitations. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 simplified the process by allowing the use of special controls for these devices. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 further enabled the recognition of appropriate performance standards developed by U.S. or international entities. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 allowed FDA to recognize appropriate performance standards developed by U.S. or international organizations. Section 3053 of the Act amends FFDCA Section 514(c) by adding new requirements for submitting requests for standard recognition. The HHS Secretary must make a determination within 60 days and provide a written response with the rationale for recognition. Training on recognized standards is required for FDA employees reviewing premarket submissions for devices. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 allowed FDA to recognize performance standards from U.S. or international organizations. Manufacturers submit a 510(k) notification 90 days before marketing new products. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from premarket review. FDA employees reviewing submissions must undergo training on recognized standards. FDA released guidance on July 1, 2015, exempting 120 medical devices from premarket notification requirements. These devices are primarily Class II, with a few Class I and pre-amendment unclassified devices included. Until a final rule exempts these devices from 510(k) requirements, FDA will not enforce compliance. Section 3054 of the FDA Modernization Act requires the HHS Secretary to identify class I devices no longer needing reports under subsection. The FDA Modernization Act requires the HHS Secretary to identify Class I and Class II devices that no longer require reports under subsection (k) for safety and effectiveness assurance. The Secretary must publish lists of exempt devices in the Federal Register, with a public comment period for Class II devices. The FDA Modernization Act requires the HHS Secretary to identify Class I and Class II devices that no longer require 510(k) notices for safety and effectiveness assurance. The final list of exempt devices is published in the Federal Register, with advisory committees providing expert advice to the FDA. Advisory committee meetings serve as a forum for public hearings on important matters, with FDA making the final decisions. In April 2015, FDA issued draft guidance for Medical Devices Advisory Committee meetings, replacing two earlier guidance documents. The draft guidance for Medical Devices Advisory Committee panel meetings includes information on types of meetings, information exchange, and conduct. The committee has 17 advisory panels addressing various specialty areas. FDA may refer matters to specific panels for advice on premarket submissions of public interest or controversial nature. Panels may also provide advice on regulatory actions and general scientific matters related to device safety and effectiveness. Advisory panels consist of qualified individuals to evaluate device safety and effectiveness. The HHS Secretary appoints members to panels with diversified expertise in fields like clinical medicine, engineering, and sciences. Panels include non-voting members representing consumer and device manufacturing interests. Organizations can nominate individuals for panel appointments. Section 3055 amends FFDCA to ensure \"adequate expertise\" on device classification panels. The HHS Secretary appoints members with diversified expertise to device classification panels, ensuring \"adequate expertise\" by including voting members with relevant specialties and technology knowledge. Patients, patient representatives, and sponsors can recommend experts for panel positions annually. The section amends FFDCA Section 513(b)(6) regarding the panel review process and participation in the panel meeting, allowing device manufacturers to correct misstatements of fact during the meeting. Adequate time for presentations is required for the device manufacturer and the HHS Secretary, and the panel may ask questions to the manufacturer's representative. The HHS Human Subject Regulations are federal standards for protecting human subjects in HHS-sponsored research. Under the Common Rule and FDA regulations, research protocols must be approved by an Institutional Review Board to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects in research. FDA's Human Subject Regulations apply to all research it regulates, including clinical trials of new drugs and medical devices. An investigational device exemption (IDE) is required for clinical evaluations of unapproved devices. An IDE allows for the lawful shipment of a device for investigation without full FDA compliance. HDEs are for treating rare diseases and do not require effectiveness data. Local IRB approval is needed for facility use, except in emergencies. Section 3056 amends FFDCA sections regarding IDEs and HDEs by removing \"local\" in references to IRBs. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 provide CMS with authority to regulate clinical laboratories based on the complexity of testing. Laboratories must receive certification before conducting clinical tests, with low-complexity tests receiving a certificate of waiver (COW) from CMS. FDA categorizes tests based on complexity levels. Tests categorized as waived tests receive a certificate of waiver (COW) from CMS, while moderate- and high-complexity tests require certification. FDA determines test complexity based on manufacturer submissions and guidance is provided for demonstrating simplicity and accuracy. Section 3057 of the guidance document requires the HHS Secretary, through the FDA Commissioner, to publish draft guidance revising Section V within a year of enactment. This includes clarifying the use of comparable performance between waived and moderately complex laboratory users to demonstrate accuracy. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 added the \"Least Burdensome Provisions\" to FFDCA Section 513, requiring FDA to consider the least burdensome data necessary for demonstrating a reasonable. The FDA considers the \"least burdensome\" data necessary to demonstrate device effectiveness in PMA applications or substantial equivalence to predicate devices. FDA guidance allows for the use of non-clinical data in certain circumstances, and manufacturers can use study designs to shorten clinical trials, including surrogate endpoints and Bayesian analyses. The FDA allows for the use of statistical methods and study designs other than randomized controlled trials in medical device evaluations. Postmarket controls like surveillance and reporting requirements are suggested to reduce premarket burden while ensuring device safety. However, the FDA's authority to mandate postmarket studies is limited, with a high percentage of ordered studies being inactive. The FDA's activities related to implementing the least burdensome provision, including training for staff and advisory panels, are posted on FDA's website. Section 3058 amends FFDCA Section 513 by adding a new subsection (j), \"Training and Oversight of Least Burdensome Requirements.\" The HHS Secretary must ensure that each FDA employee involved in the review of premarket submissions receives training on the \"meaning and implementation of the least burdensome requirements\" and must periodically assess the implementation of such requirements, including employee training. The FDA ombudsman responsible for device premarket review is required to conduct an audit of the least burdensome training, including the effectiveness of the training, 18 months after enactment. The audit for device premarket review process must include interviews with industry representatives and a list of measurement tools. Audit findings must be submitted to Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee within 30 days. The amendment to FFDCA Section 515(c) requires the HHS Secretary to consider the least burdensome means to demonstrate device safety and effectiveness. Postmarket information must also be considered in determining safety and effectiveness. The provision amends FFDCA Section 517A(a) to include a brief statement on how the least burdensome requirements were considered and applied in FDA's decision-making process for PMAs, 510(k)s, or IDEs. FFDCA Section 510(k) mandates medical device manufacturers to register with the HHS Secretary and report device classification and regulatory compliance actions before introducing a device into interstate commerce. The 510(k) premarket approval pathway requires manufacturers to demonstrate substantial equivalence to a predicate device for FDA clearance. FDA released guidance on reprocessing reusable medical devices in 2015. The FDA issued guidance in 2015 on reprocessing reusable medical devices, requiring manufacturers to submit data validating the effectiveness of their reprocessing methods. Industry concerns led to the withdrawal of a 2011 guidance on 510(k) device modifications, with the prior 1997 guidance remaining in effect. The FDA issued guidance in 2015 on reprocessing reusable medical devices, requiring manufacturers to submit data validating the effectiveness of their reprocessing methods. Section 3059 of the FFDCA added a new subsection (q) regarding reusable medical devices, mandating the inclusion of instructions for use and validation data in 510(k) reports for certain device types. The FDA issued guidance in 2015 on reprocessing reusable medical devices, requiring manufacturers to submit data validating the effectiveness of their reprocessing methods. Section 3059 of the FFDCA added a new subsection (q) mandating the inclusion of instructions for use and validation data in 510(k) reports for certain device types. The HHS Secretary, through the FDA Commissioner, is required to issue final guidance on when a notification under 510(k) is needed for modifications to legally marketed devices. Mobile health, using portable devices for medical purposes, is a rapidly growing area with software applications (\"apps\") being used for various healthcare functions. Mobile apps are used on mobile devices for various healthcare functions, including accessing medical information, inputting patient data into electronic health records, and providing clinical decision support. Regulators are concerned about apps that could pose risks to patients if they malfunction, such as those used to display patient monitor data or transform a mobile platform into a medical device. The FDA has regulatory authority over software that meets the definition of a medical device and is intended for diagnosing diseases. The FDA released guidance on regulating mobile medical apps in 2013 and updated it in 2015. They focus on the functionality of the app, not the device itself, and only regulate apps that pose a risk to patient safety if they malfunction. Apps that do not meet the definition of a medical device are not subject to FDA regulation. The FDA provides guidance on regulating mobile medical apps, focusing on functionality rather than the device itself. Apps that do not meet the definition of a medical device are not subject to FDA regulation. The agency exercises enforcement discretion for certain mobile apps that pose minimal risk to the public, such as those for tracking asthma episodes or general wellness. However, apps that meet the definition of a medical device and pose significant risks to patient safety are subject to regulatory oversight. The FDA guidance focuses on regulating mobile medical apps that function as medical devices and pose significant risks to patient safety. Certain types of health software are excluded from the definition of a medical device, including products for administrative and health management functions, electronic health record technology, and software for clinical diagnosis or treatment decisions. This would prevent FDA regulation of these products. Section 3060 of the FDA guidance allows regulatory authority over health software if serious adverse health consequences are likely. This exception applies to EHR systems, CDS tools, and other analytic software. The HHS Secretary must report on the health risks and benefits of excluded software biennially. Section 3060 of the FDA guidance grants regulatory authority over health software for patient safety. It amends FFDCA Section 513(b) to classify health software accessories based on intended use. The Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research Service (SBRS) is a special hiring mechanism for accomplished scientists in PHS agencies, not subject to civil service requirements. Currently limited to 500 members, SBRS members are doctoral-level scientists in biomedical or clinical research. Pay rate is capped at Level I of the Executive Schedule. The Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research Service (SBRS) is renamed as the Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research and Biomedical Product Assessment Service (the Service). The number of authorized members is increased to 2,000, with a focus on biomedical product assessment expertise. The HHS Secretary is not required to reduce employees in other HHS systems to accommodate new Service members. Experts will be appointed to agencies within HHS based on expertise needs. The Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research Service is renamed as the Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research and Biomedical Product Assessment Service, with an increased number of authorized members. The provision broadens the expertise requirement for appointed persons and increases the pay rate limit. Additionally, a study by the GAO is required to assess the effects of the changes on HHS departments and agencies. The FDA has the authority to appoint scientific, technical, and professional personnel without following the usual competitive service rules. This allows for the hiring of qualified candidates to support the development and regulation of medical products. The FDA Commissioner can determine their pay. The FDA Commissioner can determine pay for qualified employees in order to retain them, not exceeding the President's annual pay rate. This provision also requires the HHS Secretary to submit a report to Congress on FDA workforce planning within 18 months of the 21st Century Cures Act enactment. Additionally, the Comptroller General will conduct a study on FDA's ability to hire, train, and retain staff necessary for public health protection. The FDA has regulatory authority over drugs, biological products, and medical devices. Responsibilities for reviewing marketing applications are divided among different offices. The Obama Administration has proposed an Oncology Center of Excellence as part of the Cancer Moonshot Initiative to enhance collaboration across FDA programs. The FDA is focusing on companion diagnostic tests and combination therapies for cancer treatment. The FDA is focusing on precision medicine for cancer treatment, using diagnostic tests and drug combinations. The proposed Oncology Center of Excellence aims to enhance collaboration across FDA programs. Section 3073 introduces new Intercenter Institutes for coordinating activities in major disease areas beyond cancer. The FDA is establishing new Intercenter Institutes to coordinate activities in major disease areas beyond cancer, with provisions for public comment and termination if not beneficial. Restrictions on conference travel for federal employees were imposed following misspent funds allegations in 2010. The memorandum from FY2013 directed agencies to reduce travel expenses by 30% compared to FY2010 and maintain this reduction through FY2016. Senior-level approval is needed for conferences exceeding $100,000, with a $500,000 limit. Exceptions can be made if deemed cost-effective. Scientific meetings related to professional duties are exempt from reporting requirements. The provision exempts scientific meetings related to professional duties from federal reporting requirements and OMB restrictions, but not from federal travel regulations. HHS operating divisions must post annual reports on scientific meeting attendance and travel spending. The FDAAA required FDA to take actions on informing the public about drug safety and effectiveness, including biweekly screening of the FAERS database and quarterly reporting. The FDAAA mandated biweekly screening of the FAERS database for new safety information and required quarterly reporting on the FAERS website. It also established a website for drug safety information and mandated the preparation of a summary analysis of adverse drug reaction reports within 18 months of drug approval or after use by 10,000 individuals. The FDAAA introduced REMS and expanded FDA's risk-management authority, including elements to assure safe use (ETASU) to minimize risks while allowing access to beneficial drugs. Section 3075 of the FDAAA amends FFDCA to require the HHS Secretary to conduct regular screenings of the FAERS database, post guidelines on the FDA website for drug safety surveillance, and remove the requirement for a summary analysis of adverse drug reaction reports within 18 months of drug approval. The FDAAA amends FFDCA to expand the authority to evaluate drug safety surveillance activities for newly approved drugs. It changes the requirement for evaluating the ETASU for drugs from \"annually\" to \"periodically\" and establishes the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA to advance its mission. The Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA advances its mission by prioritizing unmet needs, awarding grants, holding meetings, and obtaining patents. It is led by a Board of Directors with appointed members from various sectors. The Board of Directors of the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA is composed of representatives from academic research organizations, patient advocacy groups, healthcare providers, and members with relevant expertise. Section 3077 amends FFDCA Section 770 to allow voting members to increase the board size and appoint new members by majority vote. The membership is limited to 30% from industries like pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. All board members are required to have specific expertise, and each member serves a four-year term. The provision in Section 3077 of the FFDCA allows for staggered terms for board members appointed under the 21st Century Cures Act. It also removes the salary cap for the Executive Director and changes the requirement for separating funds from the Treasury to be managed as individual programmatic funds. The federal government established new authorities and programs in the Department of Health and Human Services to support the development and procurement of medical countermeasures in response to CBRN agents. The Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response coordinates the effort and provides Congress with an annual budget plan. The ASPR provides Congress with a 5-year budget plan that includes countermeasure activities outside its office, such as research at NIH and stockpiling at CDC. BARDA supports advanced research through contracts and partnerships, including Project BioShield for procuring countermeasures. The Cures Act adds requirements and authorities for ASPR and BARDA, modifying the Project BioShield procurement process. Section 3081 of the Cures Act mandates timely guidelines for medical countermeasure utilization in the Strategic National Stockpile and changes reporting requirements when Project BioShield funding falls below $1.5 billion. Section 3082 shifts contracting authority for Project BioShield and BARDA research to the BARDA Director, as recommended by the Blue Ribbon Panel. Section 3083 of the Cures Act requires ASPR to provide additional information in its annual budget plan, publicly available without compromising national security, to consider countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases. Section 3084 allows the HHS Secretary to partner with a non-profit entity to accelerate the development of medical countermeasures and address public health needs. The HHS Secretary can partner with a non-profit entity to develop medical countermeasures and address public health needs, such as antimicrobials for drug-resistant organisms and platform technologies for diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. The partner may offer business advice and invest in companies working on medical solutions, following criteria like prior technology innovation experience and successful government partnerships. Regular reports on fund spending and progress meeting government needs are required. The Comptroller General will evaluate the partnership between HHS and a non-profit entity in developing medical countermeasures. Section 3085 removes the requirement for presidential approval of Project BioShield appropriations. FDA established specific goals under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 for drug review times. The FDA has two types of review times: Standard Review (approximately 10 months) and Priority Review (goal of action within 6 months). Priority Review is designated for drugs treating serious conditions with significant safety or effectiveness improvements, or with a priority review voucher. FDA has two priority review voucher programs funded by user fees to incentivize new treatment development for diseases. The priority review drug voucher programs incentivize the development of new treatments for diseases that may not attract interest from companies due to cost or market opportunities. A new priority review voucher program, funded by user fees, has been established to provide a transferable voucher to sponsors of approved new human drug applications for material threat medical countermeasures. This program aims to expedite the review process for applications related to biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents identified as material threats. The Public Health Service Act authorizes the HHS Secretary to award vouchers to mitigate harm from administering drugs against certain agents. The HHS Secretary can determine public health emergencies under PHSA Section 319, allowing for enhanced response flexibility. The Paperwork Reduction Act ensures federal agencies do not overburden the public with data collections, potentially slowing responses to emergencies. Section 3087 would add a provision related to these processes. Section 3087 of the Public Health Service Act allows for a waiver of voluntary data collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act during public health emergencies, as determined by the HHS Secretary. This waiver facilitates preparedness and response activities, with its duration at the discretion of the Secretary. Additionally, it allows for the introduction of drugs, devices, and biologics into interstate commerce without FDA approval under certain circumstances. The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allows for the temporary use of unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products in response to specified emergencies declared by the HHS Secretary. Section 3088 amends the FFDCA to extend EUA provisions to animal drugs, referencing various sections related to animal drug approval. This expansion recognizes the dual nature of vaccines as both commercial products and public goods. The ACIP, a group of experts, makes recommendations on vaccine use in the US population based on epidemiology and vaccine availability. They may recommend routine use for a subset of the population, even if FDA has licensed it for all. Vaccine manufacturers are interested in factors considered by ACIP, CDC, and FDA in vaccine decisions. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plays a crucial role in vaccine use and licensing decisions, impacting reimbursement for immunizations and the vaccine market. ACIP's statutory roles include recommending immunizations for private health insurance coverage and overseeing the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which provides free federally purchased vaccines. The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program provides free federally purchased vaccines to eligible children based on ACIP recommendations. In 1986, Congress established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to compensate individuals injured by certain vaccines and waived manufacturers' liability. The HHS Secretary could modify compensable injuries and time frames for vaccines on the Injury Table through rulemaking. New vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine use in children were automatically included in the Injury Table. The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) informed the HHS Secretary in 2013 that the VICP authority could discourage the use of vaccines for pregnant women. Section 3091 requires the ACIP to consider newly licensed vaccines at their next meeting and make timely recommendations. Section 3092 mandates the CDC Director to review ACIP processes for vaccine recommendations and publish a report within 18 months. Section 3093 requires coordination of immunization efforts within CDC and a report on promoting innovation in vaccine development within one year. The HHS Secretary is required to produce a report on vaccines for infectious diseases, prioritizing needs and addressing obstacles to innovation. The report also amends PHSA Sections 2111 and 2114 to include vaccines recommended for pregnant women in the vaccine injury table. Additionally, federal policies to promote EHR technology adoption are discussed in Sections 4001 through 4008 of Title IV. The HITECH Act of 2009 authorized Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments for using electronic health record technology. Providers must meet meaningful use objectives by capturing and storing patient data. Certification is required for EHR technology capabilities. Stage 2 of meaningful use, authorized by the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), requires eligible hospitals and physicians to use EHR technology for advanced functions like patient data access and exchange during care transitions. Starting in 2015, non-meaningful EHR users face Medicare payment adjustments unless they qualify for a hardship exception. CMS finalized rules in October 2015 for Stage 2 objectives and Stage 3 requirements by 2018, addressing provider concerns about EHR challenges and burdens. The CMS addressed concerns of healthcare providers by focusing on advanced uses of EHR technology, such as clinical decision support and health information exchange. The 2015 Edition final rule expanded the certification program to certify HIT products with different capabilities for various healthcare settings. New transparency requirements for HIT developers were also established to improve the certification program. The program established new transparency requirements for HIT developers and aims to improve interoperability by requiring certified HIT products to adopt updated standards for structured health information. ONC released a national interoperability roadmap in October 2015 to coordinate efforts towards achieving HIT interoperability goals over the next 10 years. The roadmap aims to promote interoperability in healthcare by addressing payment and regulatory drivers, legal barriers, and governance issues. The goal is to achieve widespread interoperability of certified EHR technology by the end of 2018, as defined by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). MACRA mandated the establishment of interoperability metrics to measure progress towards achieving widespread interoperability of certified EHR technology by July 1, 2016. If the objective is not met by December 31, 2018, a report identifying barriers and recommendations must be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2019. Information Blocking ONC released a report to Congress on health information exchange. The ONC released a report to Congress on health information blocking in April 2015, defining it as interfering with the exchange of electronic health information. The report detailed ONC's actions to address information blocking and identified gaps in authority. MACRA requires hospitals and physicians to attest they have not limited interoperability of their EHR technology. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule allows individuals to access their health information through certified EHR technology. Hospitals and physicians must meet meaningful use objectives by providing individuals with the ability to view, download, and transmit their electronic health information. EHR developers are required to publish APIs to enable access to clinical data. ONC released a report on patient identification and matching in 2014, recommending standardization. The ONC released a report on patient identification and matching in 2014, recommending standardization of patient attributes for information exchange. The 2015 Edition final rule for HIT certification program addressed patient matching by requiring EHR systems to include standardized patient data in summary-of-care documents. Additionally, Section 4001 mandates the HHS Secretary to develop a strategy for reducing regulatory and administrative burdens in healthcare. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements and recommendations for reducing regulatory burdens of using EHR technology, including delegating documentation to non-physicians and encouraging HIT certification for medical specialties. It also mandates the HHS Secretary to submit a report on meaningful use statistics and amends PHSA Section 3001(c)(5) to require HIT developers to provide assurances for certification. Developers must provide assurances against information blocking, allow communication on HIT product usability, and publish APIs. Section 4002 establishes EHR payment adjustment exceptions and a reporting program for EHR product selection. Section 4003 of the bill authorizes $15 million for information blocking and Medicare EHR payment provisions. It requires ONC to develop a trusted exchange framework and a common agreement for health information networks. The HHS Secretary will establish a digital contact directory, and a new HIT Advisory Committee will replace existing committees. The HIT Advisory Committee will replace existing committees and is responsible for advancing interoperability nationwide. Section 4004 defines information blocking and authorizes penalties for developers, exchanges, and networks engaging in this practice. The OIG can investigate and penalize information-blocking practices by HIT developers, exchanges, networks, and healthcare providers. Section 4004 defines information blocking and authorizes penalties for developers, exchanges, and networks engaging in this practice. OIG can investigate and penalize information-blocking practices. ONC is required to issue guidance on barriers to electronic health information exchange and implement a process for reporting instances of information blocking. Section 4005 mandates certified HIT to transmit data to clinical registries and extends confidentiality protections to HIT developers reporting patient safety information. Section 4006 of the PHSA amends to facilitate patient access to electronic health information by encouraging partnerships between health information networks, providers, and stakeholders. It also requires education on using exchanges for patient access, developing policies for technology solutions, and supporting patients' rights under HIPAA. ONC may require HIT standards to support patients' access. Section 4007 and 4008 of the PHSA mandate GAO studies on patient matching and access to health information. GAO will review ONC's policies, stakeholders' activities, and make recommendations on patient matching effectiveness, privacy, and security. The findings must be reported to Congress within two years of enactment. Additionally, GAO will study patients' access barriers, provider complications, and methods for requesting health information, with findings reported within 18 months. The GAO must report findings to Congress within 18 months of enactment regarding Medicare program administration by CMS through contracts with private entities like MACs. MACs assist in day-to-day operations, program integrity activities, and local coverage determinations. Medicare covers a broad range of medical treatments, services, and equipment, but there are limitations to coverage based on reasonableness and necessity for diagnosis or treatment. Medicare law allows for coverage of services and items that are deemed reasonable and necessary for diagnosis, treatment, or improving body function. The HHS Secretary has the authority to determine specific coverage policies nationally and locally, with MACs making decisions on coverage at a contractor-wide level. NCDs by CMS describe circumstances for nationwide coverage, but most coverage policy is determined locally by MACs through LCDs. Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) are determined by MACs on a local level, using input from various stakeholders. MACs develop LCDs based on medical literature, advice from local medical societies and consultants, public comments, and input from the provider community. They ensure LCDs align with all relevant regulations and national coverage decisions. MACs are guided by CMS's Medicare Program Integrity Manual in the LCD development process. Section 4009 of the Cures Act requires MACs to display key information about each LCD on their websites and the Medicare website at least 45 days before the effective date. This includes the proposed LCD, its public release details, links to the LCD and comments, evidence considered, and rationale. The Act also mandates the provision of ombudsman services for entities seeking Medicare coverage for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, or diagnostic products. The Cures Act mandates ombudsman services for entities seeking Medicare coverage for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, or diagnostic products. The Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman is tasked with addressing systemic issues affecting beneficiaries but cannot advocate for payment increases or new coverage. Section 4010 of the Cures Act mandates a pharmacy and technology ombudsman within CMS to address complaints and issues related to coverage, coding, or payment for Medicare-covered products. The ombudsman is prohibited from advocacy and has the authority to identify problems similar to the Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman. Medicare payments for services can vary based on where they are provided, such as in a physician's office, hospital outpatient department, or ambulatory surgical center. The Cures Act mandates a pharmacy and technology ombudsman within CMS to address complaints related to Medicare-covered products. Medicare payments can vary based on where services are provided, with recommendations for \"site-neutral\" policies to equalize payment rates between hospitals and physician offices. Section 4011 establishes requirements for price transparency, with the HHS Secretary making Medicare payment information available to the public starting in 2018. The HHS Secretary would provide information on beneficiary liability for items and services under hospital OPPS and ASC payment systems. $6 million would be transferred to implement this subsection. Telehealth involves using electronic technologies for healthcare support. Telehealth, utilizing electronic technologies for healthcare support, is covered under Medicare Part B for specific services provided through live videoconferencing. The facility where the patient is located is the \"originating site,\" while the practitioner's location is the \"distant site.\" CMS pays the practitioner at the distant site for the telehealth service and also provides a separate facility fee. Under Social Security Act Section 1834(m)(4)(C), only certain providers and suppliers in health professional shortage areas or non-Metropolitan Statistical Areas can serve as telehealth originating sites. Section 4012 mandates evaluations by CMS and MedPAC on telehealth, including identifying Medicare beneficiaries who would benefit most from expanded services. The expansion of telehealth services under Medicare Parts A and B is being examined by CMS and MedPAC. They are evaluating high-volume Medicare services suitable for telehealth reimbursement and identifying barriers to expansion. Congress also supports expanding eligible telehealth \"originating sites.\" The Medicare Improvements for Patient and Providers Act established funds for improvements in the original Medicare fee-for-service program, including adjustments to payments for services. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 modified a fund to make $140 million available, with a proposed increase to $270 million. States have flexibility in setting Medicaid payment rates, but there are federal upper payment limits for certain providers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) sets an upper payment limit for durable medical equipment (DME) under Medicaid, effective from January 1, 2018. Medicare and Medicaid anti-fraud provisions include penalties for misconduct in federal health programs. The HHS OIG can impose civil monetary penalties on individuals or entities for misconduct in federal health programs, such as presenting false claims or providing unnecessary services. Payments to physicians to reduce services are also prohibited under the Social Security Act Section 1128A. The Social Security Act Section 1128A prohibits payments to physicians to reduce services and imposes monetary penalties for false claims. Exclusion from federal health programs is mandatory for certain offenses, such as criminal acts related to healthcare delivery or abuse of patients. The HHS OIG has the authority to exclude entities or individuals from federal health programs under various circumstances. Section 5003 of the Social Security Act amends Section 1128A to include new subsections imposing penalties for improper conduct related to grants, contracts, or agreements funded by HHS. This includes penalties for knowingly presenting false claims. Individuals who knowingly make false claims in applications for HHS-funded grants or contracts may be subject to penalties of up to $50,000 per false statement. Additionally, they may face assessments of up to three times the amount of the false claim in lieu of damages to the United States or a state agency. Individuals who knowingly make false claims in applications for HHS-funded grants or contracts may be subject to penalties of up to $50,000 per false statement. They are also liable for assessments of up to three times the total amount of the funds obligated to the HHS Secretary in lieu of damages sustained by the United States or a specified state agency. Individuals who fail to grant timely access, upon reasonable request, related to an HHS-funded grant, contract, or agreement may be subject to penalties of up to $50,000 for each false record or statement, or $10,000 for each day of non-compliance. Additionally, those found to have made false or fraudulent claims may face assessments of up to three times the total amount of funds obligated to the HHS Secretary. Failure to grant timely access to HHS OIG for audits, investigations, or other functions related to HHS grants may result in CMPs of up to $15,000 per day. The HHS Secretary can also exclude individuals involved in improper conduct from federal health care programs. Social Security Act Sections 1128A apply to these penalties. Section 5003 defines terms related to Social Security Act Section 1128A(o) and (p), including Department as HHS, Material as influencing money or property, and Other agreement as various types of agreements. Program beneficiary is defined in relation to grants, contracts, or agreements. In the case of grants, contracts, or agreements for providing benefits or assistance, a program beneficiary is an individual who applies for or receives such benefits. Recipient includes sub-recipients or subcontractors, and a specified state agency administers HHS-funded grants. A specified claim under Social Security Act Section 1128A refers to any application or demand under a grant, contract, or agreement. 1128A refers to any application, request, or demand for money or property under a grant, contract, or agreement, not classified as a claim. It must be presented to HHS or a specified state agency, or made to a contractor, grantee, or recipient if the money or property is to be used on HHS's behalf. The term obligation in Social Security Act Section 1128A(o) refers to a duty arising from various relationships or overpayment retention. Section 5003 mandates amendments to include \"specified claims\" in certain sections of the Act. Medicare Part B covers certain outpatient prescription drugs and biologicals, including those administered incident to physician services, immunosuppressive drugs post-organ transplant, erythropoietin for anemia in end-stage renal disease patients, oral anti-cancer drugs, and drugs administered through DME. Providers purchase these drugs and are reimbursed by Medicare at 106% of the volume weighted average. Medicare Part B reimburses outpatient clinics for Part B drugs and biologicals at 106% of the drug's average sales price (ASP) billed under the same code. Drugs administered through DME, like infusion pumps, are reimbursed at 95% of the drug's average wholesale price (AWP) as of October 1, 2003. AWP is a manufacturer's suggested wholesale price published in drug pricing compendia. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 established a competitive acquisition program for certain DME products. Payment for DME items in competitive bidding areas is based on supplier bids. The program includes Medicare Part B drugs administered through DME. The DME competitive acquisition program began in nine metropolitan areas in January 2011 and has expanded to 100 metropolitan areas. HHS OIG reports have shown that Medicare paid DME suppliers substantially more for some drugs furnished through DME under the Medicare Part B drug reimbursement methodology based on AWP. Medicare paid DME suppliers significantly more for some drugs furnished through DME than the actual cost of purchasing those drugs. A 2015 OIG study found that drug acquisition costs often exceeded the Medicare payment rate. Starting in 2017, Medicare is required to reimburse DME suppliers for Part B infusion drugs based on the average sales price of drugs in the same billing code. Prior to the Cures Act, state Medicaid programs had to notify HHS Secretary of provider sanctions. States were required to terminate providers if HHS Secretary or another state Medicaid program did so for cause. Non-cause terminations like inactivity or failure to renew license were not required to be reported to HHS Secretary. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act required CMS to establish a process for notifying state Medicaid programs of provider terminations. This was done through an Internet portal and later the Termination Notification Database, allowing states to report terminated providers voluntarily. The Termination Notification Database allows states to report provider terminations voluntarily. However, reports in March 2014 and August 2015 found shortcomings in the data, including providers terminated for reasons other than cause. States were not required to enroll providers employed by Medicaid managed care entities before the passage of the Cures Act. Beginning on July 1, 2018, state Medicaid programs must report provider terminations to the CMS administrator or HHS Secretary within 30 days. Information required includes the terminated provider's name, type, practice specialty, date of birth, and national provider identification. Beginning on July 1, 2018, state Medicaid programs must report provider terminations to the CMS administrator or HHS Secretary within 30 days. Required information includes the provider's date of birth, Social Security number, national provider identification number, state license or certification number, termination reason, termination notice, effective date of termination, and any other information requested by the HHS Secretary. The termination notice effective date is defined as the later of the specified termination date or when all appeal rights have been exhausted. States must also include a provision in Medicaid and CHIP managed care contracts by July 1, 2018, to facilitate this reporting process. Beginning on July 1, 2018, states must include a provision in Medicaid and CHIP managed care contracts to terminate providers from their networks if they are terminated from Medicare or any state Medicaid or CHIP program. The HHS Secretary will prohibit payment to states for Medicaid expenditures for terminated fee-for-service providers, and also prohibit payments for managed care expenditures incurred by the state for services provided by terminated providers. Starting July 1, 2018, the HHS Secretary will not reimburse states for services provided by managed care entities unless the state's contract complies with Section 5005, which requires termination of providers from the network if they were terminated from Medicare or other Medicaid programs. States must establish uniform terminology for provider terminations by July 1, 2017, and require providers to enroll with identifying information by January 1, 2017 for fee-for-service and managed care entities. Section 5005 requires Medicaid providers to submit identifying information, including name, specialty, and license number. Providers must enroll by January 1, 2017, and states must terminate providers if they were terminated by Medicare or other Medicaid programs. States must comply with these requirements for reimbursement starting July 1, 2018. Section 5005 requires Medicaid providers to submit identifying information and mandates states to terminate providers who were terminated by Medicare or other Medicaid programs. The Secretary must limit federal matching payments to states if they fail to implement this requirement in managed care contracts. The HHS OIG is required to submit a report to Congress by March 31, 2020, assessing the termination of providers and federal financial participation violations. The curr_chunk discusses the assessment of state contracts with Medicaid managed care entities to comply with the new requirement of barring terminated providers from participation in Medicaid and CHIP networks. It also evaluates the enrollment of providers in Medicaid and waivers as required by Section 5005, emphasizing the importance of provider directories in ensuring access to covered services for eligible individuals. States have discretion in communicating available care sources under their fee-for-service Medicaid programs to beneficiaries. Under new regulations, state Medicaid programs must publish FFS provider directories annually, including participating physicians' contact information and specialty. The directories must also indicate if providers in a PCCM system are accepting new Medicaid patients. Medicaid managed care requires provider directories to cover a wider range of providers and more information, available on the managed care entity's website. Federal law does not mandate FFS provider directories but requires them for managed care services. The state FFS provider directories must indicate if providers are accepting new Medicaid patients and their cultural and linguistic capabilities. Section 5006 aims to align Medicaid FFS and managed care programs. State legislation may be required for states to amend their Medicaid state plan for directory publication compliance by January 1, 2017. The Cures Act allows providers to publish their directories before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the close of the legislative session. Medicaid exempts certain trusts from being counted as assets for eligibility, including special needs trusts for individuals under 65 with disabilities. Special needs trusts are established by parents, grandparents, legal guardians, or a court for non-elderly disabled individuals to supplement Medicaid benefits and maintain eligibility. When the beneficiary passes away, the state receives any remaining trust proceeds equal to the amount paid for medical assistance. Section 5007 corrects language related to special needs and pooled trusts under Medicaid for individuals under 65 with disabilities. Section 5007 allows non-elderly individuals with disabilities to establish special needs trusts exempt from asset counting and transfer rules. Medicaid requires drug manufacturers to enter rebate agreements for drugs sold to Medicaid agencies, with most manufacturers participating in the program. States have the option to not cover certain drugs or restrict their use. Section 5008 of the Cures Act prohibits states from receiving federal financial participation for drugs used for cosmetic purposes and hair growth, except when medically necessary. States can choose to cover statutorily excluded drugs, but are prohibited from receiving FFP for drugs like sexual or erectile dysfunction drugs, unless medically necessary for other purposes. The Prevention and Public Health Fund, established by Section 4002 of the ACA, administers funds for public health initiatives. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) established by the ACA, with a permanent annual appropriation, had its funding amended by the Cures Act. The amendment decreased the total PPHF appropriation for FY2018 through FY2024 by $3.5 billion. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized by Congress in response to rising oil prices and shortages caused by the OAPEC oil embargo. The SPR can hold up to 1 billion barrels of oil but currently holds 695 million barrels. The embargo also led to the creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA) to help countries develop emergency energy response plans. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in response to oil price increases and shortages due to the OAPEC oil embargo. It currently holds 695 million barrels of oil, representing 149 days of net import coverage. The President can authorize an SPR drawdown in case of severe oil supply interruptions nationally or internationally. Section 5010 directs the Secretary of Energy to sell a total of 25 million barrels of crude oil from the SPR during FY2017 to FY2019, with resulting revenue deposited in the Treasury's general fund. The amendment to EPCA Section 161(h)(2) sets the minimum holding levels of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at 450 million barrels, down from 500 million barrels. ACA Section 1323 allows U.S. territories to choose to establish a health insurance exchange by October 1, 2013, with financial assistance options. Section 5011 rescinds $464 million from unobligated amounts of the $1 billion appropriation for territories opting for an exchange. Medicare Part B covers durable medical equipment when medically necessary and prescribed by a physician. Medicare covers durable medical equipment (DME) prescribed by a physician for medical purposes, with specific criteria for coverage. Infusion pumps are considered DME, and the drugs infused are covered supplies necessary for their functioning. Medicare covers durable medical equipment (DME) like infusion pumps for medical purposes, but does not include coverage for personnel to assist with the infusion. Medicare Part B is required to cover intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for primary immune deficiency diseases in the home, but does not cover the items and services necessary for in-home administration of IVIG. The Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2012 requires a demonstration project to evaluate payment for in-home IVIG administration services. The IVIG demonstration project started in August 2014 and will end in September 2017. Suppliers must comply with Medicare quality standards to receive payments under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B suppliers must meet quality and participation requirements, including state licensing and accreditation. Section 5012 introduces a new Medicare home infusion therapy benefit starting January 1, 2021. Home infusion therapy involves providing specific items and services in the home under physician-prescribed plans. Home infusion therapy services include nursing, training, remote monitoring, and drugs. Qualified suppliers must be licensed, accredited, and meet Secretary's requirements. Applicable providers are physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Home infusion therapy services involve administering drugs intravenously or subcutaneously in a patient's home through a DME pump. The physician must inform the patient of infusion therapy options before starting treatment. Payment for this service is determined on a per-day basis and varies based on the type of therapy and nursing utilization. The payment for home infusion therapy services is determined on a per-day basis, varying by type of therapy, nursing utilization, and geographic wage index. Payments are adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index and nationwide economic productivity. The Secretary can make adjustments for outliers in a budget-neutral manner and consider costs of providing infusion therapy and payments for similar services under Medicare Part A or Medicare Advantage. Section 5012 of the Medicare Advantage program allows the Secretary to designate accreditation organizations for home infusion therapy suppliers based on factors like timely reviews, rural area capacities, reasonable fees, and other relevant considerations. The Secretary can modify the list of designated organizations as needed. The Secretary can modify the list of accreditation organizations for home infusion therapy suppliers. If an organization is removed, accredited suppliers will still be considered accredited. Suppliers accredited before January 1, 2021, by a designated organization will be considered accredited as of January 1, 2023, to avoid re-accreditation.
