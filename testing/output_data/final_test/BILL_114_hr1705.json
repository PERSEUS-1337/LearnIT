Title II focuses on wet weather management with technology-based controls, water quality-based standards, and waste water management techniques for peak wet weather. The \"Clean Water Affordability Act of 2015\" amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include integrated permits for publicly owned permittees, such as treatment works and municipal separate storm sewer systems. The Administrator is required to establish a comprehensive planning approach for these permittees. The \"Clean Water Affordability Act of 2015\" amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include integrated permits for publicly owned permittees, prioritizing obligations based on financial capability and environmental benefits. The \"Clean Water Affordability Act of 2015\" amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include integrated permits for publicly owned permittees, allowing for innovative approaches to meet obligations and accounting for changes in obligations such as new treatment approaches, regulatory requirements, and financial capability. The duration of permits is also addressed in the amendment. The \"Clean Water Affordability Act of 2015\" allows for integrated permits for publicly owned permittees, with the possibility of permits lasting between 5 to 25 years if the permittee has an approved integrated plan. SEC. 102. UPDATING OF GUIDANCE. In this section, definitions for terms like Administrator, affordability, financial capability, and guidance are provided by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Administrator will update the guidance on financial capability assessment and schedule development within a year of the Act's enactment to meet specified criteria. The guidance on financial capability assessment will be updated by the Administrator to focus on local economic conditions, regional systems, site-specific factors, and not rely solely on prescriptive formulas. The guidance on financial capability assessment will consider local economic conditions, regional systems, and site-specific factors, rather than relying solely on a single measure like median household income. It should also take into account the economic outlook of a community and essential community investments related to water quality improvements in the development of implementation schedules. Implementation schedules for water quality-related improvements should consider mitigating adverse impacts on distressed populations, reflect local financial conditions, and allow up to 30 years for implementation in cases of high financial burden. The implementation schedules for water quality-related improvements should consider mitigating adverse impacts on distressed populations, reflect local financial conditions, and allow up to 30 years for implementation in cases of high financial burden. Local financial capability evaluation should consider various factors that may vary across regions and localities. The residential indicator for economic concerns in a community should be revised to include costs for essential utilities, local community-imposed costs, impacts on communities with different economic conditions, industrial and population trends, and recognition of regional systems. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of considering more representative methods for determining affordability, such as shelter costs and essential utility payments. It also emphasizes the need to take into account low-income ratepayer percentages and impacts on program delivery related to water quality infrastructure market. The updated guidance should allow for reconsideration and modification of financial capability determinations and implementation schedules if all parties agree that changes are needed or if the economic status of the community has changed since the plan was approved. The Administrator must apply these criteria. Upon completion of updating guidance, the Administrator will apply the criteria to determine affordability, financial capability, and economic impact for programs under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The updated guidance will be published in the Federal Register and submitted to relevant committees. SEC. 103. CAPITALIZATION GRANT AGREEMENTS. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require states to use at least 15 percent of capitalization grants for assisting small municipalities with water projects. TITLE II--WET WEATHER MANAGEMENT\n\nSEC. 201. TECHNOLOGY-BASED CONTROLS FOR PEAK WET WEATHER MANAGEMENT. Title II of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act introduces technology-based controls for peak wet weather management. Amendments are made to Section 301 regarding the applicability and modification of effluent limitations during peak wet weather conditions. The Administrator, in conjunction with the State, may issue permits to modify discharge requirements for publicly owned treatment works during periods of peak wet weather. The Administrator must approve the applicant's peak wet weather management plan, defining the event and outlining management practices during peak wet weather events. SEC. 202 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow states to adopt peak wet weather-related water quality standards. The Administrator will develop guidance for states on implementing these standards. SEC. 203 addresses peak wet weather waste water management techniques. Section 304(d) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include guidelines for peak wet weather waste water management practices. The Administrator will publish information for use during peak wet weather events. The guidelines for peak wet weather waste water management practices include options for technologies and management approaches to prevent damage, maximize flow delivery, and provide cost-effective controls during peak wet weather events. The guidelines cover facility and collection system storage methods, operations, maintenance, monitoring, reporting, and alternative treatment technologies for achieving water quality."
