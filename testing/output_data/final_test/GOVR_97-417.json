    "content": "The USDA operated the tobacco price support program from the late 1930s to 2004, using marketing quotas and federal loans to raise and stabilize tobacco prices. Legislation in 1982 imposed an assessment on tobacco marketings to cover program costs, with additional payments made to offset price support losses and declining sales. These actions cost about $1 billion, with Congress providing $852 million in tobacco loss payments from FY2000-FY2003. The tobacco support program, in place from FY1982 to FY2005, cost $1.57 billion in net expenditures. After the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004, a $9.6 billion payment over 10 years compensated tobacco quota owners and farm operators for the loss of future support. This buyout eliminated CCC support program expenditures, with no anticipated future ad hoc assistance to tobacco farmers. FSA administrative expenditures for the buyout were $1.827 million in FY2006, with a zero budget for FY2007. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, provides farmers with subsidized multi-peril insurance on tobacco and other crops to cover production losses from natural calamities. Private companies handle policy sales and servicing with federal reimbursement, and most indemnity losses fall on the government. Premiums have been subsidized since 1980 to encourage participation. Experimental Crop Revenue Coverage is not available for tobacco. Total net federal expenditures for tobacco are zero in FY2007. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service provides voluntary inspection and grading services for tobacco at auction markets and import terminals to ensure quality standards. Federal grading historically assured quality for tobacco held as collateral for CCC price support loans, and inspections guard against illegal pesticide residues. Services have been financed through user fees since 1981. The Agricultural Marketing Service provides inspection and grading services for tobacco, financed through user fees since 1981. AMS inspectors now focus on imported tobacco as most domestic crop is contracted for sale. Market news services are also provided for all major agricultural commodities. Market news services are essential for providing timely and unbiased information on market conditions for farmers and others in the marketing chain. Without taxpayer-funded services, commercial enterprises may collect and sell this information, raising concerns about bias. USDA-funded research on tobacco production and marketing was conducted by ARS and university scientists until annual spending of $6.6 million was terminated. Annual research spending on tobacco by the USDA was terminated under the FY1995 agricultural appropriations law. However, research on medical, biotechnological, food, and industrial uses of tobacco is exempt from this restriction. A special research grant of $329,000 was approved for FY2006 to explore alternative uses of tobacco plant material, with no similar spending expected in FY2007. The federal-state-county extension education program serves as a bridge between agricultural research institutions and farmers, providing information and expert advice through various means such as published materials, seminars, and direct consultation. In FY1997, CSREES spent $680,000 on tobacco-related extension activities, but federal funding was eliminated in FY1998. State and county extension activities related to tobacco are now funded by the states. The Economic Research Service (ERS) analyzes economic data and forecasts market data for tobacco. ERS publishes analytical findings in a Tobacco Situation and Outlook Report and conducts studies on topics like tobacco farming and policy impacts. The Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) collects economic intelligence worldwide for trade negotiators, economists, policymakers, and the business community. The USDA estimates a budget of $205,000 for tobacco data collection in FY2007. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) gathers field-level data to assist farmers in developing marketing plans and alert policy officials of potential shortages or surpluses. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) compiles critical information on various commodities, including tobacco, to alert policy officials of potential shortages or surpluses. Economists consider this data essential for a well-functioning market economy. The estimated cost for tobacco data collection in FY2005 was $231,000, with a similar budget set for FY2007."
