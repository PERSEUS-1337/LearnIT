Congress finds that the United States is developing a new nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missile, the long-range standoff weapon. Secretary of Defense James Mattis will carefully examine the utility of this program within existing nuclear doctrine. The US plans to construct a new fleet of nuclear-capable penetrating long-range strike bombers. The B-21 bomber, armed with the Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile, will have improved range and lethality. The long-range standoff weapon will be a more precise version of its predecessor, potentially making nuclear weapons more usable. Under Secretary of Defense Frank Kendall explained these developments in a 2014 letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee. In 2016, Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert Scher stated that the long-range standoff weapon would allow the US to respond proportionately to a limited nuclear attack. In 2013, UK Defense Secretary Philip Hammond warned of the risks of a cruise-based deterrent. Former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry also discussed the weapon's capabilities in a 2015 article. Cruise missiles, both nuclear and conventional, are considered uniquely destabilizing weapons by Secretary of Defense William J. Perry and former Assistant Secretary of Defense Andrew Weber. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR LONG-RANGE STANDOFF WEAPON. The Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Energy are restricted from spending more than specified amounts on the development of the long-range standoff weapon and the life extension program for the W80-4 warhead until a detailed Nuclear Posture Review is submitted to congressional committees. This review must assess the capabilities of the weapon to hold targets at risk and elude adversary defenses. The Nuclear Posture Review required by the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Energy must assess the capabilities of the long-range standoff weapon to elude adversary defenses and its effects on strategic stability, offensive nuclear weapons capabilities of other countries, response to nuclear stockpile proposals, and the threshold for nuclear weapons use. It should be submitted in unclassified form with a possible classified annex. The Nuclear Posture Review must assess the capabilities of the long-range standoff weapon and its impact on strategic stability. It should be submitted in unclassified form with a possible classified annex. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
