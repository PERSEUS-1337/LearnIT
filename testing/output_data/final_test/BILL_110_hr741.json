    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act of 2007\". Congress finds that Lyme disease is a common bacterial infection transmitted by tick bites. Early detection is crucial as it can lead to serious health issues if untreated. Lyme disease mimics other illnesses, making it often undetected, but can be treated with antibiotics if caught early. If left untreated, it can cause severe heart, neurological, eye, and joint problems. Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all vector-borne infections in the US, but ticks also spread other diseases like ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Studies suggest that actual tick-borne disease cases are 10 times higher than reported. Many patients with persistent symptoms face challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to unreliable testing. Establishment of a Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must establish the Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Committee will advise on interagency coordination, communication, and collaboration with other organizations to address tick-borne diseases. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee will ensure diverse scientific viewpoints in public health policy decisions and advise Federal agencies on priorities related to Lyme and tick-borne diseases. Membership includes appointed individuals from the scientific community. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee includes members from the scientific community, tick-borne disease voluntary organizations, health care providers, and patient representatives. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee includes members from various organizations representing State and local health professionals, ensuring diversity in scientific perspectives. The Secretary designates nonvoting ex officio members from Federal agencies such as the CDC and NIH overseeing tick-borne disease activities. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee includes members from various organizations representing State and local health professionals, ensuring diversity in scientific perspectives. The Secretary designates nonvoting ex officio members from Federal agencies such as the CDC and NIH overseeing tick-borne disease activities. The Committee is co-chaired by the Assistant Secretary of Health and a public co-chairperson elected by appointed members for a 2-year term. Each member serves a 4-year term, and vacancies are filled accordingly. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee members serve 4-year terms and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Meetings are held publicly, with at least two meetings a year and additional meetings as needed. Agenda items can be added by members, and meetings are conducted according to applicable laws and regulations. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2008 through 2011 to cover expenses and per diem costs of the Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee. Voting members cannot be permanent salaried employees. Federal activities related to the diagnosis, surveillance, prevention, and research of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are outlined in Section 4. The Secretary will coordinate Federal programs related to Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, including developing diagnostic tests. The activities include improving diagnostic tools for Lyme disease, enhancing utilization of current tests, and evaluating new diagnostic methods. Surveillance and reporting are also important for accurately determining disease prevalence and developing a data collection system. The activities include improving diagnostic tools for Lyme disease, enhancing utilization of current tests, and evaluating new diagnostic methods. Prevention activities involve providing access to peer-reviewed information on Lyme and tick-borne diseases, increasing public education, and evaluating the feasibility of a national reporting system. The activities include expanding education programs, creating a physician education program, and sponsoring scientific conferences on Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. Clinical outcomes research is also part of these activities. Clinical outcomes research for Lyme disease includes establishing epidemiological research objectives to determine the long-term course of illness and determining the effectiveness of different treatment modalities. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2012 for research, prevention, and educational activities for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. SEC. 5. REPORTS ON LYME AND OTHER TICK-BORNE DISEASES. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on activities related to Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, including significant developments, assessments, and recommendations for further research and education. The annual reports to Congress on Lyme and other tick-borne diseases include research gaps in diagnosis and treatment, evaluation of treatment guidelines, progress in diagnostic tools, and promotion of public awareness and physician education initiatives."
