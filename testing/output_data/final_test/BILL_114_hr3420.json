    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Weatherization Enhancement, and Local Energy Efficiency Investment and Accountability Act.\" It includes sections on reauthorizing the weatherization assistance program, grants to eligible organizations, quality assurance program, and state energy programs. Congress recognizes the effectiveness and bipartisan support for the State Energy Program (SEP) and Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income Persons (WAP) in addressing national energy needs over the years. The State Energy Program (SEP) was established in 1975 to support energy efficiency, renewable energy, economic development, and energy policy. It is governed by various energy acts such as the Energy Conservation and Production Act, State Energy Efficiency Programs Improvement Act, Energy Policy Acts of 1992 and 2005, and Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) was created in 1976 to help low-income families during the oil embargo and has since become the largest residential energy conservation program in the United States, with over 7.1 million homes weatherized. Federal laboratory studies show that for every dollar invested in the State Energy Program (SEP), over $7 is saved in energy costs and nearly $11 in non-Federal funds is leveraged. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) has weatherized over 7.1 million homes, saving 35% in energy consumption and $437 annually in energy costs per home. It has created jobs in construction and supply chain sectors, providing a $2.51 return in energy savings for every Federal dollar spent. Additionally, WAP serves as a foundation for energy efficiency standards and workforce training. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) has reduced carbon dioxide emissions, decreased national energy consumption, and increased energy efficiency opportunities through innovative programs and partnerships with nonprofit organizations. Improved monitoring and reporting of the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) has led to benefits and expanding independent verification of efficiency work will support long-term goals. Reports have identified State-level deficiencies in monitoring efforts that can be addressed to ensure WAP funds are used effectively. The WAP has evolved with improvements in efficiency technology, including advanced home energy audits in the 1990s, leading to great returns on investment. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) has evolved with improvements in efficiency technology and a performance-based approach. It should continue to utilize advances in technology and the professional workforce. The Weatherization Assistance Program is reauthorized with $450,000,000 allocated for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020. Grants are provided to eligible housing and nonprofit organizations. The section aims to expand energy efficiency retrofits for low-income homes through new partnerships, promote innovation, assist organizations in replicating successful programs, and ensure sustainability of retrofit projects. The section defines a \"covered organization\" as a tax-exempt organization with a track record of improving energy efficiency in low-income homes. The Secretary will award grants to these organizations through a competitive process for this purpose. Factors considered for grants include the organization's experience and success in retrofitting homes. In awarding grants under this section, the Secretary considers factors such as the number of low-income homes already worked on and projected to work on, the applicant's qualifications and past performance with Federal funds, the diversity of locations and housing types served, and the amount of non-Federal funds secured. The Secretary considers factors such as the applicant's ability to replicate and sustain the energy retrofit project, along with other relevant criteria when soliciting proposals from covered organizations for grants under this section. The Secretary may require specific information for grant applications. Grants must be awarded within 90 days of the proposal deadline. Eligible uses of grant funds include energy audits, retrofit activities, training, maintenance information for homeowners, and data collection for program monitoring. The grant program allows for verification activities, grant management, and other necessary materials as determined by the Secretary. The maximum grant amount is $5,000,000, and guidelines will be issued within 60 days of enactment to establish criteria for expenditures and energy savings ratios. The Secretary will review and evaluate criteria for weatherization training programs, energy audits, project monitoring, liability insurance, and recordkeeping requirements for reporting data on retrofitted homes to the Department of Energy. The Secretary will review and evaluate covered organizations receiving grants, ensure compliance with state and local laws, submit annual reports on energy and cost savings, and allocate funds for program implementation. The Secretary will allocate different percentages of the amount based on availability: 2% if less than $225,000,000, 5% if $225,000,000 or more but less than $260,000,000, 10% if $260,000,000 or more but less than $400,000,000, and 20% if $400,000,000 or more is available. SEC. 103. QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. Section 415 of the Energy Conservation and Production Act is amended to include a Quality Assurance Program for contractors carrying out weatherization. Contractors must be accredited by specific organizations or equivalent state certification programs to be eligible for funds. Nonprofit organizations receiving grants under section 414C must use a certified crew chief to supervise work funded by the grant. Volunteers working for these organizations do not need certification unless they are directly handling skilled labor tasks. Effective October 1, 2016, the Secretary must ensure that all retrofits receiving weatherization assistance meet minimum efficiency and quality standards. Random inspections of 10% of dwelling units must be conducted by a third party to ensure compliance. The standards set must meet or exceed industry norms. The Secretary must ensure that all retrofits receiving weatherization assistance meet industry standards for home performance work. SEC. 201 of TITLE II amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to reauthorize State Energy Programs with funding of $75,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 through 2020."
