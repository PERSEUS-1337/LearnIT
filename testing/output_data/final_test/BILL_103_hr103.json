    "content": "The \"Fair and Competitive Election Act\" is the short title of the legislation. It includes a limitation on contributions to House of Representatives elections from individuals who are not local residents. The \"Fair and Competitive Election Act\" limits contributions to House of Representatives elections from non-local residents. Candidates must refund excess contributions exceeding the limit by 5 percent or less. The \"Fair and Competitive Election Act\" imposes penalties on candidates who accept contributions exceeding the limit by more than 5 percent. Contributions exceeding the limit by 10 percent or more result in higher penalties and a civil penalty determined by the Commission. An individual cannot be considered a resident of more than one congressional district. SEC. 3. REDUCTION IN LIMITATION AMOUNT FOR NONPARTY MULTICANDIDATE POLITICAL COMMITTEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES. No nonparty multicandidate political committee can exceed $1,000 in contributions to candidates. Technical amendment states this limit, except as provided in subsection (j).\n\nSEC. 4. BAN ON SOFT MONEY. Title III of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to include a ban on soft money contributions. \"Limitations and reporting requirements for payments towards mixed political activities.\" \"Sec. 323 imposes limitations and reporting requirements on payments for mixed political activities by national or state political party committees. These payments must be made from an account subject to the Act's requirements. Mixed political activities include voter registration, get-out-the-vote drives, and general political advertising aimed at influencing federal elections.\" Repeal of Building Fund Exception to the Definition of the Term \"Contribution\" under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 by amending Section 301(8)(B) to remove clause (viii) and redesignate clauses (ix) through (xiv) as clauses (viii) through (xiii), respectively. Transition rule regarding excess funds of House of Representatives candidates. A candidate running for Congress with campaign accounts exceeding the contribution limit must deposit the excess funds into a separate account. These funds can be used for lawful purposes other than the candidate's election campaign. Excess funds are those exceeding twice the amount raised from local individual residents after December 31, 1992. Candidates can transfer excess funds until the end of the 1994 pre-primary report period. A candidate can transfer excess funds from a separate account to their campaign account if the majority of the funds raised were from local individual residents after December 31, 1992. However, no transfers can be made after the end of the 1994 pre-primary report period. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on the date of enactment."
