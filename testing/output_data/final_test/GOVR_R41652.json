In 2010, the EU accounted for 17.5% of US merchandise trade in goods and 31.0% of US services exports. European companies also made up 63% of foreign direct investment in the US. In 2009, European companies accounted for $1.5 trillion, or 63%, of total foreign direct investment in the United States, while U.S. companies accounted for $1.7 trillion, or about 50%, of total foreign investment in Europe. These investments support 4 million workers on both sides of the Atlantic. The U.S.-EU trade and investment relationship is the largest and most important in the world, with active flows of merchandise trade, services trade, and income. The United States and the EU have a strong economic relationship, with $1,537.4 billion flowing between them in 2010. They account for 50% of the world's GDP and 40% of global trade flows. Their cooperation has been crucial in making the global trading system more efficient, but their interdependence also poses risks, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis. The U.S. economy is recovering from a recession, while EU members are struggling with sovereign debt crises. Concerns arise about how this may impact U.S. exports, as the Obama Administration aims to double exports by 2015. Trade disputes between the U.S. and EU are not uncommon, but efforts are being made to resolve major conflicts, such as those involving aerospace manufacturers and bio-engineered food products. The Airbus-Boeing dispute involves allegations of unfair subsidization and is being adjudicated by the World Trade Organization. Agricultural-based disputes stem from different regulatory approaches and social preferences. U.S.-EU trade relations involve competition in setting global trade rules and securing trade agreements to support jobs and foreign policy interests. EU rushed to negotiate a free trade agreement with South Korea after the U.S.-South agreement. The U.S. and EU are working to reduce trade barriers and increase cooperation to boost economic growth and create jobs. Stakeholders emphasize the importance of closer cooperation to address remaining tariff and non-tariff barriers. This is crucial as global economic power shifts to emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil. The U.S. and EU are focusing on reducing trade barriers and increasing cooperation to boost economic growth and create jobs. Emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil are becoming key players in the global economy, leading to a need for greater U.S.-EU collaboration. This was highlighted at the EU-United States Summit meeting where a High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth was established to enhance U.S.-EU trade and investment for job creation, economic growth, and international competitiveness. The working group established at the EU-United States Summit will provide an interim report in June 2012 and a final report by the end of 2012 with recommendations for enhancing U.S.-EU trade. The 112th Congress faces various issues affecting the U.S.-EU economic relationship, including efforts to deepen economic ties and joint U.S.-EU initiatives. The U.S.-EU High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth was established to strengthen the global economy. Congressional committees may have legislative or oversight responsibilities related to trade, economic, regulatory, and foreign policy matters. Proposals for deepening transatlantic economic ties include reducing regulatory barriers, negotiating a zero tariff agreement, and creating a barrier-free investment environment. These proposals hold the potential for economic gains. Since the mid-1990s, U.S. and European multinational companies have identified divergent regulatory frameworks as barriers to transatlantic commerce. Redundant standards and certification procedures are seen as more costly than traditional trade barriers like tariffs. Domestic regulations add to the cost of doing business on both sides of the Atlantic. Reducing regulatory policies and standards between the United States and EU aims to benefit companies by cutting costs, speeding up market entry, and enhancing competitiveness. A 2009 study projected potential gains of $158 billion in annual GDP for the EU and a $53 billion increase for the US, with sectors like motor vehicles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and electrical goods standing to benefit. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established in April 2007 at the U.S.-EU Summit to address regulatory barriers in sectors like electrical goods, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, financial services, and insurance. Led by minister-level appointees, the TEC aims to foster regulatory cooperation, reduce trade burdens, and cover issues such as investment, innovation, and intellectual property rights. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established in April 2007 at the U.S.-EU Summit to create an integrated transatlantic market. It aims to address regulatory barriers in various sectors and involve legislators and stakeholders in the regulatory process. The TEC was used to resolve long-standing trade disputes, including the EU's ban on poultry imports. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established in April 2007 to address regulatory barriers in various sectors and resolve trade disputes, such as the EU's ban on poultry imports. Efforts to harmonize regulations proved difficult initially, but in late 2010, the focus shifted to aligning regulations in emerging technologies like nanotechnology and electric cars. The TEC agreed to develop compatible approaches for regulating new sectors to prevent future trade barriers. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) aims to prevent trade disputes by aligning regulations in innovative sectors like electronic health records, energy-saving products, and electric vehicles. A new Innovation Action Plan was launched to promote innovation and commercialization of emerging technologies, with a focus on specific and time-bound work plans. However, challenges remain due to differences in regulatory approaches between the two sides. The TEC aims to align regulations in innovative sectors to prevent trade disputes. A joint High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth was established to strengthen the U.S.-EU trade relationship. Regulatory cooperation is emphasized to avoid new barriers to trade and investment, focusing on product standards and regulations over tariff barriers. The U.S. and EU aim to eliminate remaining tariffs on transatlantic trade through bilateral negotiations to generate economic benefits and reduce costs for companies. Despite low average tariff levels, there is interest in removing all tariffs to re-energize trade relations. One study estimated significant trade and welfare benefits for both sides from full elimination of tariffs on U.S.-EU merchandise trade. Potential gains include up to $69 billion increase in EU exports to the U.S. and up to $53 billion increase in U.S. exports to the EU. GDP could increase by $58 billion to $85 billion for the EU and $59 billion to $82 billion for the U.S. These gains are higher than in most preferential free trade agreements. Critics argue that a transatlantic zero-tariff agreement between the United States and EU could undermine the multilateral system by being preferential and discriminatory. They believe it may not cover \"substantially all trade\" as required by the WTO, especially due to opposition in agricultural sectors. Critics fear it would signal a lack of leadership in the multilateral system and hinder efforts like the Doha Round. Supporters argue that a zero-tariff agreement between the US and EU could cover most trade while exempting only a few sensitive agricultural products. They believe such an agreement could provide leverage to influence emerging economies in the Doha Round negotiations. However, no proposals have been introduced in Congress to extend the President's tariff-cutting authority for such negotiations. Foreign investment has surpassed trade as the main component of U.S.-EU economic relations, accounting for over 60% of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) and 75% of outward FDI. Europe and the United States are the most profitable regions for each other's multinational corporations, making up half of total global affiliate earnings. Despite open climates for foreign investment, some restrictions persist. European companies face hurdles in investing in the U.S., including restrictions on foreign ownership in shipping. European companies face hurdles in investing in the U.S. due to restrictions on foreign ownership in shipping, energy, and communications sectors, as well as the review process by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The EU's position on investment restrictions is more complex, requiring national treatment for foreign investors in most sectors. The EU's position on investment restrictions is complex, with member states imposing more restrictive policies on foreign investors. The Lisbon Treaty gave sole competence for investment to the EU, but the definition of foreign direct investment remains unclear. If a broad definition is agreed upon, the EU will have greater authority in negotiating investment agreements and setting investment rules. The EU may have greater authority on investment issues and could enter into a major negotiation to showcase its new competence. Calls for a U.S.-EU investment agreement have been made to create a barrier-free climate for bilateral investment. The agreement could be modeled on current bilateral investment treaties with a dispute resolution process and include standards for corporate governance and transparency. It could also address new issues like e-commerce, competition policy, and limits on local investment incentives. Foreign investors would benefit once the accord is in place. Foreign investors could benefit from a U.S.-EU investment agreement that allows investment in all sectors except for national security concerns. Harmonizing national security exceptions may be challenging due to diverse attitudes towards foreign investment in Europe. The United States and Europe historically led the global economy, and decisions made by them were often adopted worldwide. Developing an EU-wide approach to foreign investment may be difficult given the differences in attitudes across Europe. The United States and the EU, while historically central to the global economy, now face challenges from other growing countries. This shift in economic power highlights the need for continued cooperation between the US and EU to maintain competitiveness and uphold shared values in the global economy. Cooperation is already seen in various areas such as raw materials access and financial market governance. Special roles played by the US and EU in shaping the post-WWII global trade framework are emphasized. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Development Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which began in November 2001, has been ongoing for 11 years, making it the longest-running negotiation in the postwar era. A Doha agreement is believed to be necessary to boost global trade, create jobs, and maintain the credibility of the multilateral process, despite persistent differences between developed and developing countries on key issues. The United States and the EU have similar interests in encouraging developing countries to open their markets for services and goods, while protecting their own agricultural sectors. Developing countries seek reductions in U.S. and EU agricultural tariffs and subsidies, non-reciprocal market access for manufacturing, and protection for their services industries. Some fear increased competition from China rather than the U.S. or EU. Despite shared interests, the U.S. and EU had differences over a draft agreement in 2008. The U.S. pushed for more concessions from emerging economies like China, Brazil, and India without much EU support. Both sides are urged to work together to press for concessions in opening emerging markets further. The EU negotiators are hesitant to push for more concessions from developing countries, fearing it may require further EU concessions on agriculture. If a more ambitious Doha agreement is not reached by the end of 2012, it could be the first failure of a multilateral trade round postwar. The impact on the WTO's credibility and the need for alternative approaches to liberalize trade on a multilateral basis would then arise. China's trade with the United States and the EU has grown significantly over the past three decades, making it a major trade partner for both. The US and EU have large trade deficits with China, which have contributed to their overall merchandise deficits. China's emergence as a major economy and top exporter has been supported by open markets in the US and Europe. China's trade deficit with the US and EU is a significant portion of their overall deficits. China's trade surpluses and interventionist policies have led to growing trade friction, including issues with currency appreciation, intellectual property rights enforcement, and industrial policies favoring domestic firms over foreign companies. China's interventionist policies have become more discriminatory towards foreign companies, making it difficult to export and do business in China. US and EU trade officials address these issues through high-level dialogues and bringing disputes to the World Trade Organization when China does not comply with its obligations. Enhanced U.S.-EU cooperation could increase successful outcomes through dialogue and WTO litigation regarding China's trade practices. U.S. officials have felt European counterparts were less vocal in expressing concerns, relying on the U.S. to address issues. The EU faces challenges in forming a unified position on trading with China due to varying member state experiences. A fragmented US-EU approach may benefit China by playing them against each other. Both the US and EU are increasingly willing to pursue WTO cases against China. Co-complainant cases can enhance the profile of the case and keep China engaged in the dispute resolution process. China has shown a new willingness to accept WTO panel decisions since 2006, aiming to be seen as playing by the rules. Closer U.S.-EU cooperation in addressing trade issues with China may not cover all policies that disadvantage American and European companies. Cooperation may focus on encouraging reform in China to become a more responsible global stakeholder. The 2008 global recession was caused by trade imbalances driven by skewed consumption and savings patterns. Countries like China and Germany had large surpluses, which were recycled back to the United States to finance high consumption levels. Policies are needed to correct these imbalances for more balanced growth in the future. Policies are crucial for global economic recovery and to prevent protectionism. Countries with large deficits like the US need to reduce spending and increase savings. Surplus countries like Germany and China must boost domestic demand and imports to sustain growth. This requires increasing consumption, investment, and government spending. At a November 2010 Summit in Seoul, leaders of the G-20 agreed to address trade imbalances that pose risks to global economic growth. The US consuming too much and countries like China and Germany consuming too little were deemed unsustainable. China and Germany resisted US proposals to limit surplus countries, criticizing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy instead. The G-20 Summit in Seoul highlighted conflicts over global economic management, with a focus on U.S.-China trade imbalances and U.S.-German macroeconomic policy disagreements. German insistence on fiscal austerity challenges traditional assumptions and aligns Germany and China against the United States on this issue. German policymakers, led by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, reject the need to trim the country's export surpluses. They advocate for fiscal austerity and tighter monetary policies globally, including within the Eurozone, to address economic challenges. Germany envisions a Eurozone modeled after its own principles of fiscal responsibility and competitiveness. Eurozone members, including Germany and the Netherlands, are urged to restore faith in managing public finances to support global demand. However, pursuing austere fiscal policies may lead to a weaker euro and slower growth in Europe, potentially increasing trade and current account surplus with the rest of the world. The European trade surplus with the rest of the world, along with Asian surpluses, could impact U.S. trade deficits. U.S.-EU economic relations are mutually beneficial, prompting proposals to deepen ties and enhance cooperation. A High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth will assess ways to reduce trade barriers and enhance regulatory cooperation. The 112th Congress will monitor efforts to deepen U.S.-EU trade and economic ties, which play a crucial role in growth and job creation on both sides of the Atlantic. The success of such endeavors may hinge on the support of various stakeholders and sustained political backing."
