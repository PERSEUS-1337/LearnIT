    "content": "The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) has regulated water quality since 1974, with the EPA issuing regulations for over 90 contaminants. States oversee public water system compliance, with the 1996 amendments authorizing a Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) to help finance improvements for compliance and health risks. EPA grants to states annually to capitalize the program. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes EPA grants to states for a Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) to improve water quality and address health risks. States must match 20% of the grant and prioritize projects that address serious health risks and ensure compliance. Funding comes from federal grants, state matches, loan repayments, and other sources. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program, modeled after the Clean Water Act State Revolving Fund (CWSRF), aims to provide ongoing funding for water infrastructure projects. Eligible projects include treatment facilities, distribution systems, and infrastructure replacements to maintain compliance and protect public health. DWSRF funds can be used for preconstruction activities but not for operation and maintenance or growth-related projects. Approximately 50,000 community water systems are eligible for DWSRF assistance. Public water systems eligible for DWSRF assistance include around 50,000 community water systems and 17,500 not-for-profit noncommunity water systems. States cannot provide assistance to systems lacking compliance capacity or in significant noncompliance with SDWA requirements. Federal agency-owned systems are ineligible. Some states prohibit privately owned utilities from receiving DWSRF assistance. EPA distributes funds based on needs surveys, ensuring each state receives at least 1%. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) authorizes EPA to reserve funds for specific purposes, including grants to Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages for water infrastructure projects. Congress has authorized EPA to set aside up to $20.0 million for these grants in FY2017. Additionally, EPA is directed to allot grants to other territories using a portion of the funds available for grants to states. EPA is also required to set aside funds for monitoring unregulated contaminants in small and medium systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act allows EPA to reserve funds for specific purposes, including grants to Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages for water infrastructure projects. Congress has authorized up to $20.0 million for these grants in FY2017. EPA is also directed to allot grants to other territories using a portion of the funds available for grants to states. Additionally, funds are set aside for monitoring unregulated contaminants in small and medium systems. EPA may reserve up to $30.0 million annually for operator training and certification costs, with a $15.0 million cap for technical assistance to small systems. The act emphasizes enhancing compliance, especially among smaller systems, and allows states flexibility in tailoring their DWSRF programs to address state priorities. States are required to make at least 15% of their annual allotment available for loans. The Safe Drinking Water Act allows states to reserve funds for loan assistance to systems serving 10,000 or fewer persons. States can use up to 30% of their DWSRF grants for additional assistance to disadvantaged communities. Congress has authorized states to reserve funds for administering the DWSRF program, with increased amounts allowed under the WIIN Act. The WIIN Act, enacted in 2016, allows states to use DWSRF funds for various purposes without the need for state matching funds. States can allocate up to 10% for programs like water system supervision and operator certification. An additional 2% can be used for technical assistance to smaller systems. States also have the option to use up to 15% for land acquisition or source water protection loans. The 1996 amendments to the SDWA added capacity development and operator certification requirements, allowing states to use DWSRF funds for activities such as land acquisition, conservation easements, source water protection loans, and wellhead protection programs. Congress has not separately appropriated funds for these activities, giving states the flexibility to use DWSRF resources. The 1996 SDWA amendments added capacity development and operator certification requirements for new systems. States were required to adopt programs for training operators of water systems. Congress designed the DWSRF program to provide implementation flexibility and allowed transfers between DWSRF and CWSRF programs. EPA recommended continuing to authorize transfers between the SRF programs. Congress authorized transfers between the SRF programs to address water infrastructure needs. The DWSRF program was established in the 1996 SDWA amendments with annual appropriations ranging from $599.0 million to $1.0 billion. The program authority has no expiration date, and annual appropriations have been provided since FY2000. For FY2000 through FY2009, annual appropriations for the DWSRF program ranged from $820 million to $850 million. In FY2009, Congress appropriated $829.0 million for the program through regular appropriations. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided an additional $2.0 billion for infrastructure projects through the DWSRF program, totaling $2.83 billion for FY2009. For FY2010, Congress appropriated $1.39 billion for the DWSRF. In FY2011, the program was funded at $965.0 million after an across-the-board rescission of 0.2%. For FY2012, Congress appropriated $919.4 million after applying an across-the-board rescission of 0.16% and applied Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements to DWSRF program funding. For FY2013, the President requested $850.0 million for the DWSRF program. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), provided full-year continuing appropriations for Interior, EPA, and related agencies through September 30, 2013. EPA allocated $861.3 million for the program for FY2013 after sequestration and a 0.2% rescission. Additional SRF funds were appropriated in the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2) for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. In FY2014, the President requested $817.0 million for EPA, but received $906.9 million. Congress appropriated $906.9 million again in FY2015. For FY2016, the President requested $1.18 billion for the DWSRF program, but Congress provided $863.2 million. In FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $1.02 billion, and Congress allocated $863.23 million. An additional $100 million was included in P.L. 114-254 for Flint's lead water issue. In FY2018, President Trump requested $863.0 million, but Congress provided $1,163.2 million. For FY2017, Congress allocated $863.23 million for the DWSRF program, with an additional $100 million for Flint. Cumulative appropriations for the program reached $20.03 billion by June 2017, with a total investment of $36.96 billion and over $35.38 billion in assistance provided through more than 14,090 projects. The DWSRF program provides assistance for water system projects, with over 14,090 projects completed. The program aims to create a sustainable funding source by providing capitalization grants to states. EPA assesses capital improvement needs every four years and distributes funds based on the most recent needs survey. Eligible systems include community water systems and facilities for Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages. The EPA issued the 2015 Drinking Water Needs Survey and Assessment, estimating that public water systems need $472.6 billion for infrastructure improvements over 20 years to comply with SDWA regulations and provide safe drinking water. This represents a 10% increase from the 2011 estimate, with water transmission and distribution projects showing the largest increase in needs. The 20-year needs estimates for DWSRF-eligible projects by category include transmission and distribution, treatment, source, storage, and other. The largest category is installation and rehabilitation of transmission and distribution systems, accounting for $312.6 billion (66.2%) of total needs. Water treatment needs follow at $83.0 billion (17.6%), water storage at $47.6 billion (10.1%), and source projects at $21.8 billion (4.6%). Security-related needs were not specifically outlined in the 2015 assessment. In the 2011 survey, EPA estimated a 20-year need of $235.9 million for security-related projects, with total drinking water infrastructure needs for states totaling $463.6 billion. The needs were broken down by system size and ownership, with large community water systems needing $174.4 billion, medium systems needing $210.6 billion, and small systems needing $64.5 billion. The total drinking water infrastructure needs for states totaled $463.6 billion in the 2011 survey. Large community water systems needed $174.4 billion, medium systems needed $210.6 billion, and small systems needed $64.5 billion. Additionally, there were specific needs for American Indian and Alaska Native village water systems, as well as certain U.S. territories. Regulatory costs accounted for $57.6 billion of the total needs, while nonregulatory costs made up $415.0 billion. EPA estimated an additional $4.9 million would be needed for systems to comply with regulations. The funding needs for drinking water infrastructure involve upgrading treatment technologies and transmission infrastructure. Projects to address infrastructure problems may be eligible for funding to mitigate public health risks. EPA noted that the total needs estimate may be conservative due to stringent documentation criteria and limited evaluation of security needs. The EPA presents drinking water infrastructure needs by state, with each state guaranteed at least 1% of available funds. A 2012 study projected a nationwide investment of $1 trillion over 25 years to keep up with population growth. An analysis estimated 6.1 million lead service lines nationwide. The AWWA notes that there may be 6.1 million lead service lines nationwide, with an estimated cost of $30.0 billion for their removal. Water systems have identified needs for replacing approximately 1.4 million lead service lines over a 20-year period, totaling $4.2 billion in 2015 dollars. EPA has not specifically requested data on lead service lines from water systems. The estimated cost of replacing 1.4 million lead service lines is $4.2 billion in 2015 dollars. Federal spending on water infrastructure is a small portion of total government spending, with the federal share at 4% and state/local at 94%. Competition for DWSRF funding is high due to other SDWA mandates. The DWSRF program aims to generate sustainable funding for drinking water projects, but also includes set-asides for other priorities like compliance assurance and technical assistance. States can use up to 31% of grants for set-asides and 30% for loan subsidies to disadvantaged communities, but this may slow the capitalization of state funds. States are concerned about eroding funds and the impact on program effectiveness. The DWSRF program's potential is diminished if Congress uses it to fund other SDWA requirements instead of providing separate appropriations. Recent appropriations acts have added policy directives like additional subsidization requirements for disadvantaged systems, Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, and Buy American provisions. States are mandated to use a portion of their federal grants to provide additional subsidies to borrowers, allowing them to aid communities in need and incentivize specific projects. The DWSRF program relies on federal support to maintain its benefits and grow the fund. Communities face challenges in addressing drinking water infrastructure needs beyond what the program covers, such as future growth, rehabilitation, and maintenance. Outdated infrastructure poses a long-term threat to water safety, with costs often exceeding SDWA compliance expenses. EPA's assessment shows that only 12% of the 20-year estimated need is related to SDWA regulations. 12% of the 20-year estimated need is directly related to compliance with SDWA regulations. Questions remain about the federal role in water infrastructure financing, deficit reduction impacts, and the challenges faced by small communities in affording DWSRF financing. Other issues include the gap between funding and estimated needs, growing compliance costs, and the broader infrastructure maintenance needs of cities. EPA, states, and stakeholders continue to navigate limited resources and debates over federal funding for water infrastructure. In response to limited resources and debates over federal funding for water infrastructure, EPA, states, and communities are exploring alternative management and financing strategies. These include public-private partnerships, asset management improvements, and full-cost pricing for water services to enhance financial sustainability. However, challenges persist for poorer communities, small water systems, and those with declining populations, leading to interest in new infrastructure financing options and increased federal assistance. Deficit reduction pressures impact DWSRF appropriations considerations. The 113th Congress faced pressures on DWSRF appropriations due to statutory spending caps. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 included the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, authorizing a pilot loan guarantee program to promote private investment in water infrastructure projects. Eligible projects include SRF-eligible projects and a wide range of water resource development projects. WIFIA is a program that provides funding for large water infrastructure projects with costs of at least $20.0 million. It is not focused on regulatory compliance like SRF programs, making it more available for other large-scale projects. Projects serving areas with a population of 25,000 or fewer individuals must have a total cost of at least $5.0 million to be eligible. Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements apply to projects financed under WIFIA. Additionally, all iron and steel used in a project must be produced in the United States, unless it would increase costs by more than 25%. WIFIA was authorized to be appropriated $20.0 million each for FY2015 and $25.0 million each for FY2016. The EPA Administrator allocated funding for the WIFIA program, starting at $20.0 million for FY2015 and increasing annually to $50.0 million for FY2019. Congress provided $2.2 million for staff and program development in FY2015 and FY2016. The President's FY2016 budget noted the challenge of establishing a new federal loan program. In FY2017, $20.0 million was requested for WIFIA financing for water infrastructure projects. The program aims to accelerate investment by providing credit assistance to significant projects. EPA estimated a potential loan capacity of nearly $1 billion with $15 million in credit subsidy. In FY2017, Congress allocated $30 million for the WIFIA program, with $20 million for loan guarantees for infrastructure projects. For FY2018, the President requested $20 million, and Congress provided $63 million, including $8 million for administrative costs. The detection of elevated lead levels in drinking water in Flint, MI, and elsewhere raised awareness of the challenges in addressing the nation's drinking water infrastructure. The 114th Congress focused on funding levels for the DWSRF program and EPA efforts to implement WIFIA. Various bills were introduced to establish new water infrastructure funding sources and provide assistance to Flint for lead contamination. Legislation was also offered to amend the tax code to promote private sector investment in water infrastructure. The cap for private activity bonds (PABs) does not apply to bonds for drinking water or wastewater facilities, providing a financing tool for private sector investment in public projects. Federal law limits state and local governments' use of PABs for water infrastructure projects. The Water Resources Development Act of 2016 included provisions for water infrastructure and response to the Flint water crisis. The House-passed bill excluded EPA provisions and proposed water infrastructure assistance for communities with lead contamination. Congress did not hold a formal conference on these bills. The WIIN Act (P.L. 114-322) was enacted on December 16, 2016, incorporating provisions from S. 2848 and H.R. 5303 to address water resources, drought, and drinking water issues. Title II of the act authorized $100 million in funding to help Flint address lead contamination in the water system. Congress appropriated the funding in P.L. 114-254 to assist Flint, making revisions to the DWSRF program to ensure funds are used for water system projects meeting specific requirements. The WIIN Act of 2016 amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to require all iron and steel products used in water system projects to be produced in the US. It also established new grant programs for compliance assistance and lead reduction projects, with $60 million authorized annually for FY2017-FY2021. Additionally, the act mandated EPA to create a voluntary program for testing lead in drinking water at schools and child care programs. The 115th Congress is addressing drinking water infrastructure challenges by introducing bills to increase federal investment and promote improved public water system asset management. Grants are available for testing costs, with $20 million authorized annually for FY2017-FY2021. Various bills aim to expand DWSRF eligibilities and funding authority to assist communities in making improvements to drinking water infrastructure. In the first session of the 115th Congress, H.R. 3387, the Drinking Water System Improvement Act of 2017, was favorably reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The Drinking Water System Improvement Act of 2017 proposes changes to the DWSRF program, increased appropriations, and improvements to public water systems, SDWA compliance, consumer confidence, and drinking water infrastructure quality. It includes funding for lead in school drinking water and assistance for disadvantaged communities. The House passed America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which combines elements of WRDA 2018 and America's Water Act. Title II of America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA) authorizes appropriations for SDWA programs for shorter periods compared to H.R. 3387. For example, DWSRF capitalization grants would be authorized at $4.4 billion over three years instead of five years. Grants for states and tribes to oversee water systems and enforce SDWA regulations would be reauthorized at $125 million for each of FY2020 and FY2021. Title II of AWIA would increase DWSRF funding for disadvantaged communities, extend loan repayment periods, allow funds for facility replacements, require lead service line assessments, mandate the use of American iron and steel, apply Davis-Bacon wage requirements, and expand funds for source water protection activities. It would also authorize states to assess consolidation options for system owners. Title II of AWIA would rewrite and broaden SDWA antiterrorism provisions, require risk assessments for community water systems serving over 3,300 people, mandate emergency response plans, and provide grants for these activities. It would also require large systems to provide biannual consumer confidence reports, improve compliance monitoring data accuracy, and allocate funds to reduce lead exposure in school drinking water. AWIA Title II authorizes funding for lead testing in schools and child care programs, grants to replace pre-1988 school water fountains, and $100 million for DWSRF capitalization grants for disaster recovery. It also includes provisions for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects at Indian reservations in the Upper Mississippi River region. The AWIA Title IV, Subtitle B focuses on infrastructure projects at Indian reservations in the Upper Mississippi River and Upper Rio Grande basins. It aims to make WIFIA a permanent program with $50 million in appropriations for FY2020 and FY2021. Special rules would allow states to finance up to 100% of project costs using WIFIA assistance. Additionally, $5 million in appropriations would be authorized for WIFIA assistance to state finance authorities in years with at least $50 million in WIFIA appropriations. Subtitle A of AWIA Title IV includes amendments to the CWA, authorizing $225 million for FY2019 and FY2020 for sewer overflow control and stormwater management grants. It also allows EPA to provide grants to nonprofit organizations for technical assistance to rural, small, and tribal-owned treatment works. Nonprofits can receive CWSRF assistance to help low-income households with wastewater treatment systems. Subtitle A of AWIA Title IV authorizes funds for sewer overflow control and stormwater management grants, as well as grants for technical assistance to rural, small, and tribal-owned treatment works. H.R. 3387, the Drinking Water System Improvement Act of 2017, would amend the DWSRF program by authorizing $8 billion for DWSRF capitalization grants over five years, allowing funds to be used for replacing or rehabilitating aging treatment facilities, and increasing subsidization for disadvantaged communities. H.R. 3387, the Drinking Water System Improvement Act of 2017, would amend the DWSRF program by authorizing $8 billion for DWSRF capitalization grants over five years. It would require a percentage of funds to be used for specific purposes, extend requirements for American iron and steel use, and apply Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements. The bill would also require needs surveys to assess costs for lead service line replacement, renew states' authority to assess source water protection areas, and direct EPA to provide best practices for administering DWSRFs. Additionally, it would expand water system reporting to consumers, promote partnerships, and assess consolidation options for struggling systems. The Drinking Water System Improvement Act of 2017 aims to enhance water system infrastructure by authorizing funds for states and tribes to oversee water systems, expand contaminant monitoring, encourage asset management plans, assess risks and resiliency, improve compliance monitoring data, and provide grants for school drinking water fountains. Additionally, it requires prompt notification of hazardous substances releases to state agencies. The Drinking Water System Improvement Act of 2017 requires prompt notification of hazardous substances releases to state agencies. H.R. 3387 was reported favorably by the Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 27, 2017. S. 2800, America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, includes provisions related to EPA and SRF, such as using U.S.-produced iron and steel in projects receiving DWSRF assistance and authorizing states to use DWSRF funds for source water protection plans. On May 22, 2018, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee ordered S. 2800 to be reported favorably. S. 3021, as passed by the House, includes water resource and infrastructure measures from S. 2800. H.R. 904 aims to standardize Buy American requirements and use U.S.-manufactured iron and steel for projects receiving DWSRF assistance. H.R. 939 expands the SDWA provision for U.S.-manufactured iron and steel in DWSRF projects. H.R. 1068 is a broad SDWA reauthorization bill. H.R. 1068, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 2017, is a comprehensive reauthorization bill that includes amendments to the DWSRF program. It introduces various changes such as adding Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, making the Buy American iron and steel requirement permanent, directing states to prioritize funding for projects that improve water system health and compliance with SDWA, and increasing subsidization for disadvantaged communities. The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 2017, H.R. 1068, proposes various changes to the DWSRF program, including increasing funding for insular areas, authorizing appropriations of $21.17 billion over five years, allowing EPA to assist water systems affected by new regulations, and expanding eligible uses of funds for aging water systems and sustainable energy projects. Additionally, the bill would raise the authorized funding level for lead reduction projects to $100 million annually. H.R. 1068 proposes grant programs for replacing school lead service lines and water fountains, increasing water system resiliency, and developing contaminant monitoring technologies. It also sets deadlines for EPA to issue revised regulations for lead, perchlorate, perfluorinated compounds, and microcystin toxin. H.R. 1071 would reauthorize the DWSRF program with $21.17 billion over five years. The DWSRF program would receive $21.17 billion over five years, with a focus on assisting disadvantaged communities and lead reduction projects. H.R. 1647 aims to establish a voluntary product labeling system for clean water contributions. H.R. 1653, the Drinking Water Affordability Act, proposes extending DWSRF loan amortization periods, increasing funds for disadvantaged communities, reauthorizing state authority for source water protection, directing EPA to review best practices for fund administration, and exempting water systems from federal requirements if equivalent state requirements are met. The Sustainable Water Infrastructure Investment Act of 2017/2018 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exempt private activity bonds for drinking water and sewage facilities. The Securing Required Funding for Water Infrastructure Now Act would authorize EPA to provide financial assistance to support eligible wastewater and drinking water projects. The SRF WIN bills would authorize EPA to provide secured loans at subsidized interest rates for eligible states with limited SRF funds or affected by a major disaster. The loans would be capped and support 100% of project costs with waived application fees. $200 million in appropriations would be authorized annually from FY2019 to FY2023. H.R. 5609, the Water Affordability, Transparency, Equity, and Reliability Act of 2018, would establish a trust fund to support EPA's Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Funds (SRFs) and activities. It would also direct EPA to report on water affordability nationwide, discriminatory practices of water and sewer service providers, and water system regionalization. Additionally, the bill authorizes the use of Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) funds to purchase privately owned community water systems, requires states to use at least 50% of their capitalization grants to provide additional subsidization to disadvantaged communities, and authorizes a grant program for repairing or replacing lead-contaminated school drinking water coolers. H.R. 6653, the Innovative Materials for America's Growth and Infrastructure Newly Expanded Act of 2018, aims to promote the use of innovative materials in transportation and water infrastructure. It includes a provision for EPA to establish a grant program for designing and installing water systems with innovative materials to reduce costs and extend service life. The bill allocates $65 million annually for this program from FY2019 to FY2023. H.R. 6727 / S. 3012, the Water Technology Acceleration Act, authorizes EPA to implement a grant program for innovative water technologies addressing water issues. States can offer additional funding for projects using these technologies. S. 181 mandates GAO to identify federal infrastructure programs with domestic content preferences. No federal funds can be used for projects lacking domestic content preferences unless all materials are domestically produced. The Made in America Water Infrastructure Act, S. 880, aims to require the use of U.S.-manufactured iron and steel in water projects receiving DWSRF assistance. The Clean Safe Reliable Water Infrastructure Act, S. 1137, includes provisions for robust appropriations for DWSRF and CWSRF, increasing set-aside authority for source water protection plans, and applying the Brooks Act to DWSRF-assisted contracts. Additionally, the bill authorizes EPA's WaterSense Program and proposes $18 billion in appropriations over five years. S. 2727 would establish a grant program for water infrastructure projects, while S. 3121 would amend provisions to ensure open competition in procurement transactions for projects receiving SRF assistance. Similar revisions would be made to WIFIA."
