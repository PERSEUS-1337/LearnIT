    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1997\". The Congress recognizes that unintentional damage to underground facilities during excavation can cause disruptions in vital public services and lead to accidents. Excavation without prior notification or inaccurate marking of facilities can result in fatalities, injuries, and harm to the environment. A coordinated national effort is needed to enhance protection of the public and the environment from the consequences of underground facility damage. A coordinated national effort is needed to improve one-call notification programs and the effectiveness of one-call notification systems for excavations. Establishment of One-Call Program under Chapter 61 of Title 49, US Code includes purposes, definitions, minimum standards for State programs, compliance, best practices review, grants to States, and authorization of appropriations. The purposes of this chapter under Section 6101 are to enhance public safety, protect the environment, minimize risks to excavators, and prevent disruption of vital public services by reducing damage to underground facilities during excavation through State one-call notification programs meeting minimum standards. A one-call notification system receives excavation notifications to prevent damage to underground facilities. State one-call notification programs establish requirements for these systems at the state level. The term 'State' refers to a State, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Transportation. \"Sec. 6103. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR STATE ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION PROGRAMS\" Minimum standards for a State one-call notification program include appropriate participation by underground facility operators and excavators, as well as flexible enforcement under State law. States must assess risks to public safety, the environment, excavators, and public services related to damage to underground facilities and activities of excavators. The program should also address implementation. The State one-call notification program must consider risk ranking, cost-benefit relationship, and allow for voluntary participation. Penalties for violations by excavators or facilities should be appropriate and commensurate with the seriousness of the violation. The State one-call notification program may impose increased penalties for repeat damage to underground facilities due to failure to use the notification system or provide timely marking. Penalties may be reduced or waived if damage is promptly reported, and equitable relief and citation of violations are also options. \"Sec. 6104. COMPLIANCE WITH MINIMUM STANDARDS\" Each State must submit a grant application within 2 years of the enactment of the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1997 to qualify for a grant under section 6106. The Secretary will review the State's one-call notification program to determine if it meets the minimum standards set forth in section 6103 for grant qualification. The Secretary may consult with the State to expedite compliance. The Secretary may consult with the State regarding the effectiveness of its one-call notification program. The application process for State programs must provide sufficient information for evaluation by the Secretary. State applications and Secretary actions under this section are public. The Comprehensive One-call Notification Act of 1997 allows states to maintain alternative notification programs that offer equivalent or greater protection than the minimum federal standards. Within 3 years of the Act's enactment, the Secretary must report on state adoption of federal standards or alternative programs, and assess the overall effectiveness of state notification programs. The Secretary must report on the effectiveness of the State's one-call notification program, impact of state decisions on participation in notification systems, areas needing improvement, and include recommendations if necessary. If the chapter's purposes are achieved, no further reports are required. \"Sec. 6105. REVIEW OF ONE-CALL SYSTEM BEST PRACTICES\" - The Secretary must report on the effectiveness of the State's one-call notification program, impact of state decisions on participation in notification systems, areas needing improvement, and include recommendations if necessary. If the chapter's purposes are achieved, no further reports are required. The Secretary will conduct a study on damage prevention practices of existing one-call notification systems to determine the most effective methods in preventing damage to underground facilities and protecting the public, environment, excavators, and public services. The study will involve consultation with various stakeholders. The study will focus on methods used by one-call notification systems to promote awareness, receive information from excavators and facility owners, verify effectiveness through standards, assess mapping accuracy, prevent intentional damage, and address the needs of stakeholders. The study will assess how one-call notification systems address rapid response to urgent excavation needs, accidents due to marking errors, personnel safety, relevant damage prevention programs, and the effectiveness of penalties in ensuring compliance with program requirements. The Secretary will publish a report within one year of the enactment of the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1997, identifying successful practices in preventing damage to underground facilities and providing efficient service to excavators and operators. States and program operators are encouraged to adopt these practices. The Secretary will assess the availability of timely information before conducting the study. If information is readily available, the Secretary is not required to conduct the study. \"6106. GRANTS TO STATES\" The Secretary may provide financial assistance to States to improve one-call notification systems, communication links, location capabilities, record retention, public education, participation, and compliance/enforcement under the State program. The Secretary considers State commitment to enhancing one-call notification programs, including legislative and regulatory actions post-1997. States can allocate funds to one-call notification systems that adopt best practices identified under section 6105. Authorization of appropriations for grants to States under section 6106 is limited to $1,000,000 in fiscal year 1999 and $5,000,000 in fiscal year 2000. Additional funding is authorized for administration purposes in fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000. Funding must come from general revenues and not from specific sources outlined in section 60301. Chapter 61 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by removing references to section 60114 and updating related sections. Chapter 61 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by updating subsections in section 60125. Chapter 61 of title 49, United States Code, was amended by updating subsections in section 60125. The bill was passed by the Senate on November 9, 1997, with attestation by Secretary Gary Sisco."
