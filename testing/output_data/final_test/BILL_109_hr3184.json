    "content": "SECTION 1. SMALL QUANTITIES PROTOCOL. Congress finds that 87 countries are signatories to the Small Quantities Protocol, originally intended to conserve safeguards resources. However, in light of terrorism and illicit nuclear activities, the Protocol may hinder timely detection by the IAEA. Saudi Arabia, a non-nuclear member of the NPT, is under scrutiny for its nuclear technology interest. As a signatory to the Small Quantities Protocol, it can possess up to ten tons of natural uranium without reporting to the IAEA. The Small Quantities Protocol allows countries to possess limited amounts of uranium and plutonium without reporting to the IAEA. This protocol also allows for secret nuclear facility development for up to six months, making it challenging for the IAEA to evaluate a country's nuclear program. The Additional Protocol to the Safeguards Agreements empowers the IAEA to gather extensive information on a country's nuclear activities and provides broader access for inspectors to nuclear facilities. It enhances safeguards effectiveness and addresses concerns about access rights. Congress declares that the US should use diplomatic, political, and economic means to persuade countries with a Small Quantities Protocol to renounce it and adopt the Additional Protocol. The President must ensure US allies or recipients of US assistance with a Small Quantities Protocol also sign, ratify, and implement the Additional Protocol. The US urges countries with a Small Quantities Protocol to adopt the Additional Protocol and grants immediate access to IAEA inspectors. If a country with a Small Quantities Protocol does not meet requirements, the President will prohibit certain assistance. The US prohibits certain assistance to countries that do not meet requirements, including assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act, Arms Export Control Act, defense articles and services, and dual-use goods or technology. The US prohibits certain assistance to countries that do not meet requirements, including assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act, Arms Export Control Act, defense articles and services, and dual-use goods or technology. Dual-use goods or technology are items designed for civil purposes but can also be used for military or proliferation purposes. The President can waive the limitation on assistance to a country for one fiscal year if it is vital to national security and the country has complied with requirements. The President shall direct the US Representative to the IAEA to ensure changes to the Small Quantities Protocol, rescind it, require the Additional Protocol for Member States, and impose strong inspections for nuclear efforts. Non-compliant states will be ineligible for nuclear assistance. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to enforce penalties on Member States under investigation, including limiting voting rights, technical assistance, and hosting meetings. The President will enforce penalties on Member States under investigation, including limiting voting rights, technical assistance, and hosting meetings. Penalties will be terminated when the investigation concludes and the State is no longer in breach. The President must submit reports on progress and penalties imposed every 90 days after the Act's enactment. The curr_chunk provides a list of countries with a Small Quantities Protocol with the IAEA, detailing their cooperation level with safeguards inspections, implementation of the Additional Protocol, assistance received from the IAEA and Member States. It also includes a description of the US strategy to ensure compliance with requirements by allies and recipients of US assistance."
