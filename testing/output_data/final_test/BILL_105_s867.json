    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Violent Juvenile Criminal Records Act of 1997\". Congress finds that there has been a significant increase in juvenile crime, especially serious and violent offenses. Many of these offenses are committed by individuals whose past criminal record as juveniles is not disclosed to law enforcement agencies. Due to the mobility of juvenile offenders, officials in different states often struggle to access prior offense records. The inaccessibility of records indicating past violent offenses committed by juvenile offenders poses a threat to public safety officers, increases risks to students at schools, and hinders judicial officials from making informed decisions to protect innocent citizens. SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act to include Incentive Grants for State and Local Criminal Records Systems targeting violent criminal gangs. The Attorney General will make grants to States and local governments to establish programs for obtaining fingerprints and photographs of juveniles arrested for specific offenses. The Attorney General provides grants to establish criminal history records systems for juveniles arrested for violent, drug, property crimes, and illegal possession offenses. The Attorney General provides grants to establish criminal history records systems for juveniles involved in violent criminal activities, including illegal possession of firearms and participation in violent gangs. These records are maintained at the State agency and submitted to the FBI for access similar to adult criminal histories. When a criminal offense is reported, a criminal history for the individual is submitted to a State repository for juvenile and adult records. This helps in developing and updating criminal information systems to include information on adults involved in violent criminal activities. Maintaining these records at the appropriate State agency is crucial for intelligence sharing. The chief executive officer of a State or unit of local government must submit an application to request a grant under this part. The application must be in the form required by the Attorney General, through the Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, who will consult with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Attorney General may award formula grants to States for programs meeting specified purposes, with the option for local government participation. Discretionary grants can also be awarded to States or local units. The Attorney General may award a grant under section 2503(b) to a State or unit of local government that will use the assistance to carry out a program meeting specified purposes. \"SEC. 2503. ALLOCATION OF GRANTS.\" Formula Grants: 90 percent of appropriations for this part each fiscal year will be used for grants to eligible States based on a formula. Each State receives a minimum allocation, with the remaining funds distributed based on population. Discretionary Grants are also available. The Attorney General allocates 10 percent of funds for discretionary grants to States and local governments that meet specified requirements. States receiving grants can contract with entities for activities related to the grant's purpose. \"Appropriations for activities authorized in this part may be made from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. The table of contents of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to include Part Y for Incentive Grants for State and Local Criminal Records Systems, with a focus on funding sources.\" Authorization of Appropriations for Part Y:\n- $50,000,000 for fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002."
