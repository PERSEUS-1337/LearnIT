    "content": "The purpose of the Federal regulatory system is to protect individuals from reprisal for disclosing information related to violations, abuse of authority, mismanagement, waste of resources, discriminatory enforcement, public health risks, personal favoritism, and political coercion by any agency or its employees. SEC. 2. COVERAGE. This Act applies to Federal and State agencies exercising authority under Federal or State law. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED REGULATORY PRACTICES. For the purposes of this title, a \"prohibited regulatory practice\" refers to any action described in subsection (b). No Agency employee with regulatory authority shall take, recommend, or approve any regulatory action in response to a disclosure of information indicating violation of laws, abuse of authority, or mismanagement. The prohibited regulatory practices include mismanagement, waste of resources, inconsistent enforcement, endangerment of public health, personal favoritism, and coercion for political purposes by any agency or its employees. An action is considered to be influenced by the disclosure of information if it was a contributing factor to the decision taken. SEC. 4 allows a person to assert a defense in any agency action if a prohibited regulatory practice has occurred. If proven, the person may still need to comply with obligations but no additional penalties will be imposed. SEC. 5 addresses enforcement. SEC. 5 addresses enforcement of prohibited regulatory practices, allowing for civil penalties of up to $25,000 per practice. The President will establish procedures for enforcement. SEC. 6 allows for citizen suits. Any person harmed by a prohibited regulatory practice can file a civil action against the responsible party. The action can be brought in the district where the practice occurred or where the injury happened. The district court has jurisdiction to restrain the party from engaging in the practice, cancel penalties resulting from it, and rescind any settlements related to it. The district court can order the issuance of permits or licenses that were denied due to regulatory practices. It can also order the responsible party to pay damages for harm caused by the practice, including property damage, loss of profits, compliance costs, business value loss, and legal fees. The district court can order the payment of punitive damages up to $25,000 for each prohibited regulatory practice, with each day of continuing practice considered a separate violation. The Special Counsel established by section 1211 of title 5, United States Code, can investigate prohibited regulatory practices upon request. The Special Counsel has the same power to investigate these practices as it does for prohibited personnel practices under section 1212 of title 5, United States Code."
