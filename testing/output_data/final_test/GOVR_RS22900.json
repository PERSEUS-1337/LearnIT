    "content": "Title II of P.L. 480, administered by USAID, is the main U.S. international food aid program, providing humanitarian donations of U.S. agricultural commodities for emergency food needs or development projects. Other smaller food aid programs, like Food for Progress and the McGovern-Dole program, are administered by USDA. The 2008 farm bill made changes to the Food for Peace Act, shifting focus from export market development to promoting food security. Key issues addressed included policy objectives, funding levels, and using local/regional commodity purchases for more efficient food crisis response. The 2008 farm bill amended the Title II program to address food deficits from manmade and natural disasters, aligning the U.S. definition of disaster with UN agencies. It added promotion of food security and environmental practices to commodity donations, requiring USAID to brief congressional committees before responding to disasters caused by governmental policies. The bill also urged the President to seek higher levels of food aid from other donors in international negotiations. The 2008 farm bill extended authorization of P.L. 480 programs through FY2012, with an annual authorization level for Title II set at $2.5 billion. This reflects Congress's concern about how Doha Round trade negotiations could impact U.S. food aid policy. The 2008 farm bill authorizes $500 million more annually for Title II food aid programs, with a range of funds available for administrative expenses increased to 7.5% to 13%. Additionally, $4.5 million is allocated for FY2009-FY2011 to improve food aid quality. The new farm bill extends the requirement for a minimum level of 2.5 million metric tons of commodities for distribution via Title II, with a portion allocated for non-emergency projects. However, this mandated volume for development food aid is often not met, with more funds being allocated to emergency relief in recent years. The 2008 farm bill includes a \"safe box\" provision for funding non-emergency development projects under Title II, with a funding level starting at $375 million in FY2009 and ending at $450 million in FY2012. The safe box ensures a set level of funds for implementing organizations but is objected by the Administration for limiting flexibility in responding to emergency food needs. The President can waive the mandated funding level under certain criteria. The 2008 farm bill includes a provision for a pilot project allowing the use of up to $300 million of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchase and distribution of food during a food security crisis. The project, with $60 million in mandatory funding, will be conducted by the Secretary of Agriculture from FY2009 to FY2012. The President can waive the funding level requirements under certain conditions. The 2008 farm bill allows for a pilot project using up to $300 million of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchase and distribution of food during a crisis. Field-based projects funded with grants to various organizations will be evaluated by a third party starting in 2011. The new farm bill extends the authority for the Food Aid Consultative Group (FACG) until 2012, requiring representation from the maritime transportation sector. The Micronutrient Fortification Program is reauthorized to fortify food aid commodities with essential nutrients. The farm bill authorizes the use of up to $22 million annually for monitoring and assessment of non-emergency food aid programs, with funds allocated for upgrading information technology systems. This provision addresses criticism of inadequate monitoring by USAID due to factors like limited staff. The USAID Administrator can use funds to employ contractors as non-emergency food aid monitors. The farm bill increases funding for stockpiling and rapid transportation of shelf-stable foods. It also reauthorizes prepositioning of commodities overseas and increases funding for prepositioning. Critics question the cost effectiveness of these programs. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes the Farmer-to-Farmer program with a floor level of $10 million in annual funding through 2012. It also increases funding for specific regions like sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin. The bill focuses on providing long-term, low interest loans for U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries, emphasizing food security over market development. The 2008 farm bill renames Title I of P.L. 480 to Economic Assistance and Food Security, focusing on the Food for Progress Program (FFP) which provides commodities to developing countries. The bill sets a minimum of 400,000 MT to be provided under the FFP program, with a cap of $40 million of Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds for transportation. In FY2007, 342,000 MT were shipped under FFP. The 2008 farm bill extends the McGovern-Dole food aid program through 2012, requiring a project in Malawi. The program provides commodities and assistance for education programs in developing countries. There is debate in Congress about funding levels, with some advocating for mandatory funding and an increase to $300 million by 2012. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes the McGovern-Dole food aid program through 2012, with the USDA as its permanent home. Funding remains discretionary with no increase, but $84 million in mandatory money is authorized for FY2009. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust holds cash reserves of about $294 million for unanticipated food aid needs. The BEHT, with $294 million in cash reserves, is used for emergency food aid as determined by USAID. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes the BEHT through FY2012, removing the cap on commodities held and allowing investment in low-risk securities to maximize value. The new law replaces \"replenish\" with \"reimburse\" to clarify that cash can be held in the trust."
