    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Mother's Day Centennial Commemorative Coin Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that Anna Jarvis, founder of modern Mother's Day, was born in Webster, West Virginia in 1864. She dedicated her life to honoring her mother, Anna Reeves Jarvis, leading to the official proclamation of Mother's Day in 1908. Governor William Glasscock issued the first Mother's Day Proclamation in 1910, and in 1914, the Sixty-Third Congress designated the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day. The Sixty-Third Congress designated the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day and encouraged displaying the American flag as a public expression of love for mothers. President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation in 1914 for government officials and the American people to display the flag on Mother's Day. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $1 coins with specific specifications, including weight, diameter, and metal composition. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of coins minted under this Act commemorates the 100th anniversary of Mother's Day.
