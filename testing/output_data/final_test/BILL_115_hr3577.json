    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Results Through Innovation Act of 2017\" and includes provisions for targeted employment and training projects. The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 is amended to establish a program for targeted employment and training projects to increase employment and earnings for households receiving nutrition assistance benefits. The program aims to remove barriers to employment and training, support a holistic approach for households, explore alternative models for providing services, and target hard-to-serve populations like homeless individuals and those recently incarcerated. Eligibility requirements apply. Eligibility requirements for applicants to receive a grant under clause (i) include submitting a separate application with specified terms and conditions, proposing a project that meets certain requirements, and providing services to hard-to-serve populations. The project must provide services or benefits authorized under section 6(d)(4) or 20, or other services designed to remove barriers for hard-to-serve populations. Members of households in the supplemental nutrition assistance program who are employed or in an allowable employment and training activity. Members of households in the supplemental nutrition assistance program who were previously in employment and training can be employed for up to 180 days after receiving training services. Members of households in the supplemental nutrition assistance program can gain employment within 90 days after exceeding the income limit for program eligibility. Household members of individuals in certain categories may receive benefits or services necessary for supporting employment or training activities. The project provides technical assistance for expanding proven approaches and allows voluntary participation in employment and training programs for households without cash assistance recipients under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act. The project, funded under the Social Security Act, allows State agencies to carry out activities directly or through government or nonprofit entities. The State agency can use up to 5% of the grant for project administration. Selection for grants is based on competitive criteria. When considering applications for grants, the Secretary evaluates the capacity and experience of the State agency or entity proposed to carry out the project. The project aims to achieve specific goals in providing effective employment and training programs. Title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) focuses on projects for low-skill individuals, considering replication in other states, outcome measurement capacity, diverse rural and urban implementation, and expanding project numbers. Priority is given to projects with proven results from pilot projects and other successful programs that show increased employment and earnings. Performance reports are required for grants. States receiving grants must measure and report project performance, provide a cost-benefit analysis, and fulfill reporting requirements. The Secretary shall submit an annual report to the Committees on Agriculture describing outcomes measured by each State operating a project. Funding authorization for the project includes $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, $350,000,000 for fiscal year 2020, and $300,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2021 and 2022. Funding authorization for the project includes $400,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2023 and 2024, $500,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2025 and 2026, and $600,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2027 and beyond. States must use these funds to supplement, not replace, Federal funding. States must use funds to supplement, not supplant, Federal or non-Federal funds for current employment and training activities and services."
