    "content": "The Act titled \"Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act\" aims to establish a nationwide policy for backcountry aviation issues on Federal lands managed by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture. Aircraft landing strips play a crucial role in emergency situations and provide access to individuals who may otherwise be unable to enjoy national parks and forests. They are essential for search and rescue operations, firefighting, ecological management, research, and aerial mapping. SEC. 3. PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF ACTIONS AFFECTING AIRCRAFT LANDING STRIPS. The Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture cannot permanently close or declare unserviceable any aircraft landing strip on Federal land without approval from the State's aviation department, notice in the Federal Register, a 90-day public comment period, and consideration of received comments. The Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture must consider input from the State's aviation department before closing any aircraft landing strip on Federal land. Within two years, they must establish a national policy for managing backcountry aviation issues on Federal land. The policy required by the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture must state that the Federal Aviation Administration has sole authority over aviation and airspace in the United States. They must also seek and consider comments from State governments and the public. Additionally, the Secretaries must consult with State aviation departments and interested parties to ensure that aircraft landing strips on Federal land are maintained in a manner consistent with resource values. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture may enter cooperative agreements for aircraft landing strip maintenance on Federal land. Closure or neglect of landing strips cannot be a condition for Federal property acquisitions. The Act does not authorize new landing strips and defines \"permanently close\" as a long-term closure. The Act applies to established aircraft landing strips on Federal lands and actions that are not final at the enactment date. It does not affect FAA authority over aviation or airspace."
