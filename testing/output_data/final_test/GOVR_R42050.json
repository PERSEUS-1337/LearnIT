    "content": "Sequestration is a process of automatic spending reductions established by various acts to enforce deficit targets and limits on discretionary spending. It was reestablished in 2010 and tied to new statutory limits on discretionary spending under the Budget Control Act of 2011. Sequestration was triggered by the Joint Committee's failure to meet its goal and was delayed until March 1, 2013. It involves a uniform percentage reduction in budgetary resources for all programs, projects, and activities within a budget account. Certain exemptions and special rules apply to certain programs and activities. The report provides an overview of exemptions and special rules related to sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Statutory PAYGO Act. Sequestration is tied to budget goals, and certain exemptions and rules apply to programs and activities. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Statutory PAYGO Act have exemptions and special rules related to sequestration. Consult CRS reports for more information on budget enforcement procedures and potential impacts. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) was enacted to reduce the federal budget deficit through sequestration of discretionary and/or mandatory spending. It has exemptions and special rules related to sequestration. Refer to CRS reports for more information on budget enforcement procedures and potential impacts. Title I of the Budget Control Act of 2011 established discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. If Congress exceeds these limits, sequestration would automatically reduce the excess amount. Initially, spending limits were divided into \"security\" and \"nonsecurity\" categories, but later merged into a single limit. Title IV created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which had to propose legislation by January 15, 2012. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated legislation by January 15, 2012 to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion, leading to automatic spending cuts over FY2013-FY2021. These cuts include sequestration of mandatory and discretionary spending, with reductions split between security (Department of Defense) and nonsecurity (VA, DHS, State) categories. The security-nonsecurity distinction is crucial as sequestration is imposed within these categories. If Congress appropriates more than allowed for either category in a year, the excess spending is canceled in the breached category. Security was broadly defined under Title I, with spending divided between the two categories for FY2012 and FY2013. However, due to the failure of the Joint Committee, security is now defined more narrowly, and the separate categories remain in effect through FY2021. Automatic budget enforcement procedures were triggered when the Committee failed to develop legislation for the specified deficit reduction by the BCA deadline. The automatic budget enforcement procedures under the law were triggered for FY2013, with sequestration originally scheduled for January 2, 2013, but delayed to March 1, 2013. The sequester was reduced by $24 billion, requiring a cancellation of $85 billion in budgetary resources, divided between defense and nondefense. President Obama signed the sequestration order on March 1, 2013, following the failure of the Joint Committee process under the BCA. OMB calculated that in order to cancel the requisite $85 billion, annualized spending levels for each nonexempt account must be reduced by specific percentages. The effective reductions are approximately 13% for nonexempt defense spending and 9% for nonexempt nondefense spending in FY2013. The OMB calculated reductions in spending levels for FY2013 to cancel $85 billion, with approximately 13% for nonexempt defense spending and 9% for nonexempt nondefense spending. The methodology used by OMB for sequestration is detailed in their report, including budget accounts subject to sequestration and the corresponding reductions. The OMB issued a report to Congress on automatic spending reductions for FY2014 under the terms of the BCA. $109 billion in spending must be reduced in FY2014, divided equally between defense and nondefense. Sequestration will occur through lowering discretionary spending limits and sequestration of nonexempt mandatory spending. In FY2014, reductions totaling $109 billion will be achieved by lowering discretionary spending limits by $91 billion and sequestering $18 billion in nonexempt mandatory spending. Sequestration percentages for FY2014 are estimated at 2% for nonexempt Medicare spending, 7.2% for nonexempt nondefense mandatory spending, and 9.8% for nonexempt defense mandatory spending. Sequestration will primarily impact nondefense spending as defense spending is largely discretionary. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 established a budget enforcement mechanism to prevent legislation increasing the deficit. OMB tracks costs and savings from enacted legislation to determine if a sequestration is needed based on certain criteria. The Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010 established a budget enforcement mechanism to prevent deficit-increasing legislation. OMB tracks costs and savings to determine if a sequestration is necessary. Certain costs and savings are excluded from Statutory PAYGO, and specific rules apply to sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. The impact of sequestration on programs may vary depending on the triggering provision. Under a sequestration, nonexempt programs, projects, and activities are reduced by a uniform percentage. Factors affecting the process include budgetary resources subject to sequestration and statutory requirements. Certain programs are exempt from sequestration, and special rules apply. Recent amendments have been made, but an actual sequestration has not occurred since the early 1990s. Interpretation and application of these provisions remain uncertain. The provisions of the Budget Control Act (BCA) and Statutory PAYGO remain uncertain in how they will be interpreted and applied during sequestration. OMB plays a key role in determining the execution and impact of automatic spending reductions. OMB's reports in March and September 2012 provided information on budget accounts subject to sequestration and classifications of budgetary resources. Readers are advised to refer to these reports for more specific details. The September 2012 OMB report on sequestration percentages and amounts is outdated due to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Section 255 lists exempt programs, mostly mandatory with some discretionary, notably those by the VA. Specific budget accounts are provided for precise identification of exempted programs. The law provides a list of exempt programs from sequestration, but there is no definitive list of programs subject to sequestration. OMB's actions and interpretations determine the impact on programs. Exempt programs include Social Security benefits, VA programs, certain World War II veteran benefits, net interest, refundable tax credits, unobligated balances for nondefense programs, and military personnel accounts at the President's discretion. Certain budget accounts and activities may be exempt from sequestration, such as those funded by private donations or voluntary contributions, advances to trust funds, specified federal retirement and disability accounts, prior legal obligations, low-income programs, and certain federal trust accounts. The Competitiveness/Smart Grant Program, Child Care and Development Fund, Child Nutrition Programs, Children's Health Insurance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Family Support Programs, Federal Pell Grants, Medicaid, Foster Care and Permanency Programs, SNAP, SSI, Medicare Part D subsidies, economic recovery programs, and split-treatment programs are exempt from sequestration. The Troubled Asset Relief Program has exemptions for certain programs like Federal Aid-Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, and Grants-in-Aid for Airports. Section 256 establishes special rules for sequestration of certain programs. The interpretation of the law's provisions by OMB determines the effect of sequestration on each program. Special sequestration rules apply to various programs including student loans, Medicare, health centers, veterans' medical care, Child Support Enforcement, federal pay, administrative expenses, Unemployment Compensation, and Commodity Credit Corporation. Federal student loans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program have specific rules during sequestration, such as increased origination fees. Loan origination fees are calculated as a proportion of the loan principal borrowed. The origination fee for federal student loans under the Direct Loan program helps offset loan subsidies costs. Four types of loans are available: Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, Direct PLUS, and Direct Consolidation Loans. The origination fee for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans is 1%, for PLUS Loans is 4%, and no fee for Consolidation Loans. During sequestration, origination fees may increase by a uniform percentage amount. The origination fee on federal student loans will increase by 5.1% for nonexempt nondefense mandatory programs due to sequestration. The Department of Education will implement the fee increase for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2013. Medicare, established in 1965, provides insurance to Americans aged 65 and older and certain disabled individuals. Medicare enrollment has grown from 19 million in 1966 to 52 million beneficiaries in FY2013, with an estimated increase to 69 million by 2023. Medicare consists of two parts: Part A covers inpatient care, skilled nursing facilities, home health care, and hospice services, while Parts B and D cover physician services, outpatient care, home health care, and prescription drugs. Medicare is administered by CMS under HHS, with estimated gross outlays of $592 billion in FY2013. In FY2013, Medicare's gross outlays are estimated to reach $592 billion, with 99% being mandatory spending for benefit payments. Spending on Medicare benefits is projected to increase to about $1 trillion in FY2023. About 0.5% of mandatory outlays are used for administrative purposes, while a small portion of $6 billion is discretionary for program management activities. The BCA limits Medicare spending reductions to 2% under sequestration, with OMB calculating the uniform percentage for all nonexempt programs. If the percentage is less than 2%, it applies to all accounts, including Medicare. If greater, Medicare faces a 2% cut while other programs see the higher reduction. Under sequestration, Medicare's benefit spending will be reduced by about $90 billion over nine years, with a 2% limit on cuts. Beneficiaries will not see changes in coverage, and certain Medicare programs are exempt from reductions. Under sequestration, certain Medicare programs like Part D low-income subsidies, Part D catastrophic subsidy, and Qualified Individual premiums are exempt from cuts. Provider payments for services are reduced by 2%, but beneficiary cost-sharing amounts are not affected. Under sequestration, Medicare provider payments for inpatient services are reduced by 2% upon discharge. For services paid on a reasonable cost basis, the reduction applies to payments incurred during each cost reporting period. Part B services under assignment are considered payment in full. Parts C and D monthly payments to private plans are reduced uniformly by up to 2%. Medicare Advantage Organizations and Prescription Drug Plan sponsors cannot modify current arrangements. Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and Prescription Drug Plan sponsors cannot adjust benefit structures or cost-sharing to offset lower payments from sequestration. CMS guidelines address payment adjustments for contracted and non-contracted providers under Parts C and D. Contracted providers' payments are governed by their contracts, while non-contracted providers must accept fee-for-service amounts as payment in full. Sequestration reductions cannot be considered in payment calculations according to Section 256(d) of BBEDCA. The Secretary cannot consider sequestration reductions when calculating adjustments to Medicare payment rates, including Part C and Part D growth percentages. The budgetary baseline for implementing sequestration has special implications for Medicare, with projections incorporating constraints on Medicare spending starting in 2014. Medicare spending would be constrained by the sustainable growth rate (SGR) mechanism starting in 2014, with fees for physicians' services set to be reduced by about 24%. Congress has historically prevented these cuts, but it would cost at least $139 billion over 10 years to eliminate them. Concerns exist that provider payment reductions under sequestration could lead to providers turning away Medicare patients, potentially shifting costs to other payers or beneficiaries. There are concerns that reduced Medicare payments could lead to increased costs for private payers or beneficiaries. Administrative functions like fraud and abuse oversight could also face funding reductions, potentially impacting program costs and quality of care. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) provides grants for primary care to underserved populations, including the homeless and residents of public housing. The Health Centers Consolidation Act of 1996 combined various health center programs under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. Section 256(e) of BBEDCA limits funding reductions for community and migrant health centers to 2% under sequestration. The special rule for community and migrant health centers under the Public Health Service Act limits funding reductions to 2% under sequestration for mandatory health center funds allocated specifically for these centers. The remaining funds are subject to the full sequestration amount. The Indian Health Service in HHS provides comprehensive medical and environmental services. The Indian Health Service (IHS) in HHS provides medical and environmental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. IHS is funded by discretionary budget accounts and receives reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. Sequestration can only reduce funding for IHS accounts by 2% per fiscal year. The special rule applies to IHS mandatory funds for the diabetes program, making the discretionary appropriation fully sequestrable. OMB exempts reimbursements and rent from sequestration. VA's VHA operates the largest integrated health care system for veterans, with eligibility based on various factors. Section 256(e) of BBEDCA allows a 2% reduction in VA budget authority. Section 256(e) of BBEDCA allows a 2% reduction in VA budget authority for medical care. However, Section 255 of BBEDCA exempts all VA programs, including medical care, from sequestration. OMB confirmed VA's exemption from sequestration in a letter and report. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, a federal-state program administered by HHS, seeks to obtain child support from noncustodial parents. The program is exempt from sequestration, with the federal government reimbursing states for 66% of expenditures and providing incentive payments for effective CSE programs. The CSE program expenditures may be reduced by lowering the federal matching rate, as stated in Section 255. Military and federal pay systems are subject to reduction under sequestration, but employee pay rates under the GS may not be reduced. The conference agreement prohibits the reduction of pay rates for civilian employees and members of the uniformed services under sequestration orders. Scheduled pay increases cannot be reduced, and federal pay is considered as part of administrative expenses. The conferees recommend program managers to explore alternative cost-saving measures before resorting to personnel furloughs. An administrative furlough may result in a temporary pay cut for employees due to budget constraints. Additionally, an OMB Memorandum advises against issuing discretionary monetary awards to federal employees unless legally required. The OMB advises against issuing discretionary monetary awards to federal employees unless legally required due to budget constraints and sequestration rules. Federal administrative expenses for SSI are discretionary and not subject to sequestration under automatic reduction provisions. Federal payments to state and local governments for administrative costs are exempt if the program is exempt under Section 255. Certain unemployment compensation payments are not covered by this exemption. Section 256(i) of BBEDCA exempts federal loans for state unemployment benefits and regular UC from sequestration. This exemption also applies to UCFE and UCX. However, administrative grants and the federal share of the EB program are not exempt. States must continue to pay their share of EB payments and can adjust benefits based on federal reductions. The temporary emergency unemployment compensation (EUC08) benefit is ending at the end of 2013 and will be subject to sequestration. The U.S. Department of Labor detailed how the sequester reductions will affect administrative grants and unemployment benefits. Reductions to UI expenditures will start around March 31, 2013, with no recovery of benefits already paid. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds mandatory spending for farm commodity support and conservation programs, with borrowing authority up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has borrowing authority of up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury, with spending authorized by the 2008 farm bill. Sequestration affects CCC-funded programs, including commodity loan contracts and other support mechanisms. Loan contracts entered into before the sequestration order are not reduced, but contracts after the order are. The CCC's primary duties are not restricted by sequestration, but the loan program is no longer the primary outlay. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has borrowing authority of up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury, with spending authorized by the 2008 farm bill. Sequestration affects CCC-funded programs, including commodity loan contracts and other support mechanisms. Loan contracts entered into before the sequestration order are not reduced, but contracts after the order are. The CCC's primary duties are not restricted by sequestration, but the loan program is no longer the primary outlay. Payments, MILC program, conservation programs, and other farm bill programs using CCC funds are impacted by sequestration. Federal crop insurance program outlays are not funded under the CCC and have their own mandatory funding mechanism exempt from sequestration. The Department of Veterans Affairs programs, net interest payments, refundable income tax credits, non-defense unobligated balances, and optional exemption of military personnel from reductions under any order issued under this part. The President has the authority to exempt military personnel accounts from sequestration or reduce the percentage of cuts. The President must notify Congress before exercising this authority. Certain budget accounts and activities, such as those funded by private donations or voluntary payments, are exempt from reduction under any order issued.
