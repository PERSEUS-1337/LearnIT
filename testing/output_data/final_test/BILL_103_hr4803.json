    "content": "The Fair Pay Act of 1994, also known as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, includes findings related to labor standards. The Fair Pay Act of 1994 acknowledges wage differentials based on sex, race, and national origin in Government employment and industries engaged in commerce. These differentials depress wages, hinder labor utilization, cause disputes, burden commerce, and constitute unfair competition. Discrimination in hiring and promotion is also recognized. Discrimination in hiring and promotion has contributed to a segregated workforce, with many women and people of color working in occupations dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national origin. Studies have shown that jobs dominated by women were paid less than equivalent mixed and male-dominated jobs, with a significant percentage of female-dominated jobs paying less than the average of all equivalent jobs. The wage differential between white and non-white workers in Minnesota was found to be 75 percent unexplained, possibly due to discrimination. Laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibit discrimination in compensation based on sex, race, color, religion, national origin, and the Supreme Court has ruled that this applies to all jobs. Discrimination in compensation extends to jobs not considered \"equal work\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Lower court decisions show the need for further clarification to align with the Gunther decision. Barriers to ending discrimination based on sex, race, and national origin persist despite laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act and Civil Rights Act. SEC. 3. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUIVALENT JOBS. Amendment to Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 206) prohibits employer discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin in wage payments. Exceptions include seniority, merit, or productivity-based systems. Employers cannot reduce wages to comply. Labor organizations are also covered by this provision. Labor organizations representing employees must not cause discrimination against an employee. Any withheld amounts owed to an employee in violation of the discrimination rule will be considered unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation. The term \"labor organization\" refers to any organization dealing with employers on labor-related matters. The term \"equivalent jobs\" refers to dissimilar jobs with equivalent requirements in terms of skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. Section 13(a) is amended to include sections 6(d) and 6(g). SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS. Section 15(a) (29 U.S.C. 215(a)) is amended to include protections against discrimination for individuals who oppose unlawful acts, make charges, testify, or participate in investigations. It also prohibits discrimination against employees who inquire about or discuss wages. The amendment to Section 15(a) (29 U.S.C. 215(a)) provides protections against discrimination for individuals who oppose unlawful acts, make charges, testify, or participate in investigations, including discussing wages. The amendment also prohibits discrimination if an employee exercises or encourages any right granted by section 6(g). SEC. 5. REMEDIES.\n\nAmends Section 16 (29 U.S.C. 216) to allow expert fees in actions for violation of section 6(g) and permits class actions. Modifies subsection (b) to include additional sections and clarifies exceptions for class actions under subsection (f).\n\nSEC. 6. RECORDS. Section 11(c) (29 U.S.C. 211(c)) is amended to require employers subject to section 6(g) to preserve records documenting wage calculations and submit reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as prescribed. Annual reports must be filed with the Commission. Employers subject to section 6(g) must submit reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission detailing wage or salary rates by classification, position, and demographics without individual names. The information must be made available to all employees and will be public. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may publish information obtained for statistical purposes and allow inspection of reports filed with it. Copies of reports can be provided to individuals upon payment. The Commission will issue rules regarding these regulations. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has the authority to issue rules and regulations for reporting requirements to prevent circumvention or evasion. Simplified reports may be prescribed for employers with small sizes to reduce burden. SEC. 7. RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will conduct studies and provide information on wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin to help implement section 6(g) provisions. This includes research, education, and technical assistance to address and eliminate such discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will take steps to correct conditions leading to section 6(g) by publishing findings, sponsoring educational programs, and providing technical assistance to promote compliance. Their annual report to Congress will include an evaluation on these efforts. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will provide an evaluation on the implementation of section 6(g) in their annual report to Congress. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE: The amendments made by this Act will take effect one year after its enactment."
