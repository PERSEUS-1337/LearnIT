President Assad used sarin gas and artillery, killing over 1,000 people in East Ghouta and Moadamiya al-Sham. Pro-government forces have attacked Syrian civilians. Government forces in Syria have attacked civilian populations using murder, torture, assault, and rape as war tactics.

International rules of war require distinguishing between civilians and combatants and ensuring medical neutrality for unhindered access to medical care. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. Congress strongly condemns ongoing violence, use of chemical weapons, and human rights violations in Syria, supports democratic change, urges halting attacks on civilians, and calls for accountability for war crimes.
