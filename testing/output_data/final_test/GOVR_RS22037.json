    "content": "The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) has regulated water quality since 1974, with the EPA issuing regulations for over 90 contaminants. States oversee compliance with the federal program, and the 1996 amendments established the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) to help finance improvements for public water systems. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program authorizes EPA grants to states for water infrastructure funding. States match 20% of the grant and develop plans for fund use. Funding can be used for public water systems to comply with SDWA and improve health protection. The program is modeled after the Clean Water Act State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) for wastewater projects. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) was established in 1987 to replace a construction grants program. It provides assistance for projects such as treatment facilities, distribution systems, and storage facilities to maintain compliance and public health goals. Eligible systems include community and noncommunity water systems, but funds cannot be used for operation and maintenance or growth-related projects. States cannot provide assistance to systems lacking compliance capacity or in significant noncompliance with SDWA requirements. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) provides assistance for projects to maintain compliance with SDWA requirements. Federal agency-owned systems are not eligible, and some states may exclude privately owned utilities from receiving DWSRF assistance. EPA distributes funds among states based on needs surveys, with each state receiving at least 1% of available funds. Additionally, a portion of the total appropriation is reserved for U.S. territories. For FY2016, EPA reserved $20.0 million for grants to Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages for water infrastructure projects. The SDWA also directs EPA to set aside $2.0 million for monitoring unregulated contaminants in small and medium systems. EPA may reserve up to $30.0 million annually for operator training and certification costs, but has not done so since FY2003. Additionally, EPA can reserve up to 2% with a $15.0 million cap for technical assistance to small systems, although funding has been appropriated separately under Section 1442(e). The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) includes provisions for states to tailor their Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) programs to address state priorities. States must allocate at least 15% of their annual allotment for loan assistance to systems serving 10,000 or fewer people. States can also use up to 30% of their DWSRF grants to provide additional assistance to disadvantaged communities. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act) allows states to reserve a portion of their DWSRF grants for administration costs and other SDWA mandates. States can set aside up to 10% for various purposes such as public water system supervision programs, technical assistance, state capacity development strategies, and operator certification programs. The WIIN Act also removed the requirement for states to match expenditures with state funds for these purposes. Additionally, states can use an extra 2% of funds for technical assistance. States may use up to 15% of DWSRF funds for various purposes such as loans for land acquisition, source water protection measures, technical assistance, and wellhead protection programs. Separate funding authority exists for activities like wellhead protection. Congress has not provided separate appropriations for these activities. The 1996 amendments added capacity development and operator certification to promote public water system compliance. The 1996 amendments added capacity development and operator certification requirements to promote public water system compliance. States were required to establish programs to ensure new systems have the capacity to meet requirements and assist existing systems in compliance. Congress designed the DWSRF program to give states flexibility in implementation. States could use up to 15% of funds for various purposes like source water protection. The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) amendments allowed states to transfer funds between the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) and Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) to address water infrastructure needs. Congress established the DWSRF program with appropriations totaling $9.6 billion from FY1994 to FY2003. EPA recommended continued flexibility for states to transfer funds, which was made permanent in P.L. 109-54. The DWSRF program was established with $9.6 billion in appropriations from FY1994 to FY2003. Although the authorization expired in 2003, Congress has continued to provide annual appropriations. Annual appropriations ranged from $820 million to $850 million from FY2000 to FY2009. In FY2009, Congress appropriated $829.0 million, with an additional $2.0 billion from the ARRA. In FY2010, Congress allocated $1.39 billion, and in FY2011, the President requested $1.29 billion. The DWSRF program received varying funding levels over the years. In FY2011, the President requested $1.29 billion, but funding was reduced to $965.0 million. For FY2012, the President requested $999.0 million, but Congress appropriated $919.4 million. In FY2013, the President requested $850.0 million. Congress approved a six-month CR in September 2012 to fund government agencies through March 27, 2013. In FY2013, EPA allocated $861.3 million for the program after sequestration and a rescission. Additional SRF funds were appropriated in the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 for drinking water and wastewater projects in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. For FY2014, the President requested $817.0 million, and EPA received $906.9 million. The request was reduced to $757.0 million for FY2015. For FY2016, the President requested $1.18 billion for the DWSRF program, and Congress appropriated $863.2 million. In FY2017, President Obama requested $1.020 billion, with the House passing $1.07 billion and the Senate recommending $1.02 billion. The DWSRF program has been funded for FY2017 at FY2016 levels with slight reductions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 includes $863.23 million for DWSRF capitalization grants. The President has requested $863 million for FY2018. The DWSRF program received $863 million for FY2018, with cumulative net federal contributions totaling $19.07 billion from 1997 to June 2016. The program has provided over $32.48 billion in assistance, funding more than 13,183 projects, with 9,139 completed. The revolving fund program aims to create a sustainable funding source for states over time. EPA assesses capital improvement needs of water systems every four years to distribute DWSRF funds among states. The 2011 Drinking Water Needs Survey indicates $384.2 billion is needed for infrastructure improvements over 20 years to achieve regulatory compliance. Eligible systems include community and nontransient, noncommunity water systems. EPA collaborates with Indian Health Service and tribes to assess needs for drinking water treatment facilities. The EPA reports that $384.2 billion is needed for infrastructure improvements over 20 years to achieve regulatory compliance for safe tap water. This amount is similar to previous estimates adjusted to 2011 dollars. Most of the funding needed is for nonregulatory costs, with only 10.9% attributable to SDWA regulations. Regulatory funding needs involve treatment technology upgrades, while nonregulatory needs focus on installation and replacement. The 2011 needs survey estimated $384.2 billion is needed for infrastructure improvements over 20 years to achieve regulatory compliance for safe tap water. The largest category of needs is installation and rehabilitation of transmission and distribution systems, accounting for $247.5 billion (64.4%) of total needs. Water treatment needs account for $72.5 billion (18.9%), water storage for $39.5 billion (10.3%), and source projects for obtaining safe water supplies. The survey estimated $376.0 billion is needed for drinking water infrastructure improvements over 20 years. This includes $20.5 billion for source projects and $235.9 million for security needs. Large community water systems account for $145.1 billion of the total need. The survey estimated $376.0 billion is needed for drinking water infrastructure improvements over 20 years. This includes funding for large, medium, small, and not-for-profit systems, as well as American Indian and Alaska Native village water system needs. Additionally, an extra $4.9 million may be required for systems to comply with regulations. EPA noted that the total needs estimate may be conservative due to stringent documentation criteria and incomplete understanding of security needs by some systems. The survey estimated $376.0 billion is needed for drinking water infrastructure improvements over 20 years, with an additional $4.9 million required for compliance with regulations. A 2012 study projected a nationwide investment of at least $1 trillion over the next 25 years to keep up with population growth. The AWWA estimates there may be 6.1 million lead service lines nationwide, with removal potentially requiring an additional $30.0 billion in infrastructure funding. The federal/state program helps public water systems finance infrastructure projects to comply with SDWA requirements and protect public health. Despite significant funding from Congress since 1997, there is still a substantial gap between financing needs and available funds. The 2011 needs survey identified a $19.2 billion annual investment need for the next 20 years, with increasing needs as infrastructure ages. Eligible projects for funding include those required for SDWA compliance and nonregulatory projects to meet health protection objectives. The DWSRF program, funded by federal and state governments, aims to finance infrastructure projects for drinking water compliance. Despite significant funding, a gap in financing needs persists. Federal spending on water utilities is minimal compared to state and local expenditures. Competition for DWSRF funding is high due to various SDWA mandates. The program balances the objective of creating a perpetual funding source for water projects with the challenge of meeting competing needs. The DWSRF program aims to provide perpetual funding for drinking water projects. Congress authorized set-asides for other program priorities, allowing states to use up to 31% of grants for these activities. However, using funds for set-asides could deplete state funds and slow capitalization. Concerns arise when Congress relies on DWSRF to fund other SDWA requirements, diminishing the program's potential. The DWSRF program faces challenges with added policy directives from Congress, such as subsidization requirements for disadvantaged systems, Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, and Buy American provisions. Communities also struggle with addressing infrastructure needs beyond the scope of the program, including future growth, rehabilitation, and maintenance. Outdated infrastructure poses a long-term threat to drinking water safety. The DWSRF program addresses water infrastructure needs, but does not cover all categories or noncommunity systems. It is a key tool in federal, state, and local initiatives to ensure water supply safety. The aging water infrastructure and budget constraints raise questions about federal financing and deficit reduction impacts. Persistent water infrastructure issues include funding gaps, compliance costs with SDWA standards, affordability of financing for small communities, and the overall need for infrastructure maintenance and upgrades. Despite legislative interest, budget constraints and debates over federal funding roles have hindered efforts to enact new water infrastructure financing legislation. The EPA, states, and communities are focusing on alternative management and financing strategies for water infrastructure to promote financial self-reliance. This includes public-private partnerships, asset management improvements, and full-cost pricing for water services. However, these approaches may not fully meet the needs of poorer communities and small water systems. Interest remains in exploring new financing options like an infrastructure bank and expanding federal assistance due to deficit reduction pressures. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121, H.R. 3080) established the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) as a pilot loan guarantee program to promote private investment in water infrastructure projects. Eligible projects include those with costs of at least $20.0 million and aim to complement existing State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs. WIFIA is a loan guarantee program for water infrastructure projects with costs of at least $20.0 million. It is not focused on regulatory compliance like SRF programs and is available for large-scale projects. Projects serving areas with a population of 25,000 or fewer must cost at least $5.0 million and follow Davis-Bacon wage requirements. WIFIA funds require the use of American-made iron and steel, unless it increases costs by more than 25%. Funding for WIFIA increased annually from $20.0 million in FY2015 to $50.0 million. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriation Act, 2015 did not appropriate funds for project financing but provided EPA with $2.2 million for implementing the WIFIA program. H.R. 2084 aimed to establish a national infrastructure bank for guaranteeing debt on various projects. The Flint, MI water crisis raised awareness of the nation's water infrastructure challenges. The 114th Congress focused on funding levels for the DWSRF program and EPA's efforts to implement WIFIA. Efforts were made in the 114th Congress to establish new funding sources for water infrastructure, including grants, a trust fund, and tax code revisions to promote private sector investment. Legislation was introduced to provide funding assistance to Flint for lead contamination in drinking water and to increase water infrastructure funding nationwide. Proposals included amending the tax code to exempt private activity bonds for water facilities. Federal law limitations on state bond caps were also addressed. The federal law imposes state bond caps, limiting the use of PABs for water infrastructure projects. Congress allocated funds for the WIFIA program in FY2015 and FY2016, but no project funds were provided. The President's FY2016 budget requested $20.0 million for EPA to provide WIFIA financing for water projects. EPA aims to accelerate investment in water infrastructure by offering credit assistance to significant projects. The House-passed Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 recommended $50.0 million for the WIFIA program, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $30.0 million for FY2017. Congress provided $20.0 million for EPA to begin providing loan guarantees for infrastructure projects under WIFIA in P.L. 114-254. Additionally, Congress provided another $10 million for WIFIA for FY2017 in P.L. 115-31. The President requested $1.186 billion for the DWSRF program for FY2016. The DWSRF program funding for FY2016 was $863.2 million, with a request of $1.02 billion for FY2017. H.R. 5538 proposed $1.07 billion for FY2017, while S. 3068 included $1.02 billion as requested. The program has been funded for FY2017 at FY2016 levels under continuing resolutions. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act of 2016, incorporated various provisions related to water infrastructure, including addressing lead contamination in water systems like the one in Flint, MI. The Act authorized funding for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) and emergency assistance to help communities with water system issues. Congress appropriated the funding authorized in the Act. The WIIN Act of 2016 allocated funds to assist Flint, MI with lead contamination in the water system. It made revisions to the DWSRF program, requiring iron and steel products used in water projects to be made in the US. The act also established new grant programs for compliance assistance and lead reduction projects, with $60 million authorized per year for FY2017-FY2021. The WIIN Act of 2016 did not reauthorize appropriations for the DWSRF program but established a voluntary program for testing lead in drinking water at schools and child care programs. States or local education agencies can apply for grants to cover testing costs, with $20 million authorized per year for FY2017-FY2021. The 115th Congress is working on bills to increase federal investment in water infrastructure and promote improved water system asset management and SDWA compliance capacity. Budget constraints and debates over federal funding for municipal infrastructure remain significant factors in the deliberations. President Obama had requested $1.02 billion for the DWSRF. President Obama requested $1.02 billion for the DWSRF program for FY2017, but Congress appropriated $863.23 million. For FY2018, the President requested $863.0 million for DWSRF and $20.0 million for WIFIA. Legislation introduced in the 115th Congress includes H.R. 904, which standardizes Buy American requirements for projects receiving DWSRF assistance, and H.R. 939, which expands SDWA provisions for drinking water. The Drinking Water Extension Act of 2017 aims to make permanent the requirement for U.S. manufactured iron and steel in projects receiving DWSRF assistance. H.R. 1068, Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 2017, includes amendments to the DWSRF program such as adding Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements and directing states to prioritize projects that improve water system health and compliance with SDWA. The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 2017, H.R. 1068, propose several changes to the DWSRF program, including requiring states to allocate 6% of grants to disadvantaged communities, allowing the transfer of funds between DWSRF and CWSRF, increasing funding for insular areas, authorizing $21.17 billion in appropriations over five years, providing grants to water systems affected by new regulations, and expanding eligible uses of funds for water system improvements and sustainable energy projects. H.R. 1068 proposes increasing funding for lead reduction projects to $100 million annually, creating grant programs for school lead service line replacement and water system resiliency, and establishing deadlines for new EPA regulations. H.R. 1071 would reauthorize the DWSRF program with a focus on assisting disadvantaged communities. H.R. 1071 would reauthorize the DWSRF program with a focus on assisting disadvantaged communities, authorize $21.17 billion over five years, revise eligible activities, and prioritize funding for compliance projects. H.R. 1647 proposes a voluntary product labeling system for clean water contributions, with a fee of 3 cents per unit. H.R. 1653, the Drinking Water Affordability Act, aims to extend DWSRF loan periods, increase funds for disadvantaged communities, reauthorize state use of funds for source water protection, exempt water systems from federal requirements, review best practices for fund administration, and report to Congress. H.R. 1673, the Water Affordability, Transparency, Equity, and Reliability Act of 2017, aims to establish a trust fund for EPA and USDA, report on water affordability and discriminatory practices, authorize DWSRF funds for purchasing community water systems, and require states to use at least 50% of funds for disadvantaged communities. The Sustainable Water Infrastructure Investment Act of 2017 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exempt private activity bonds for drinking water and sewage facilities from volume cap restrictions. Additionally, S. 181 would require a report on federal public works programs with domestic content preference requirements. The Made in America Water Infrastructure Act, S. 880, aims to expand and make permanent the requirement for the use of U.S. manufactured iron and steel in projects receiving DWSRF assistance. It would also apply American iron and steel requirements to maintenance projects. The Clean Safe Reliable Water Infrastructure Act, S. 1137, includes a sense of Congress that appropriations for the DWSRF and CWSRF should be robust. The bill, S. 1401, would increase DWSRF set-aside authority for state water protection plans, apply 40 U.S.C. Chapter 11 to DWSRF-assisted contracts for larger communities, authorize EPA's WaterSense Program, and provide grants for combined sewer overflow under CWA Section 221. It also addresses lead in drinking water in schools and day care facilities."
