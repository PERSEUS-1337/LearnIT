The Senate finds that the Medicaid program is crucial for providing essential healthcare and long-term care services to low-income individuals, including children, pregnant women, seniors, and those with disabilities. It is a federal guarantee ensuring access to necessary medical services, especially for long-term care. Medicaid also covers personal care and supportive services not typically provided by private insurance or Medicare, benefiting individuals with specific medical needs. The Medicaid program supports individuals with various medical needs, including spinal cord injuries, developmental disabilities, and mental illnesses, allowing them to stay in the community and maintain independence. It supplements Medicare for low-income elderly or disabled beneficiaries, covering premiums, co-insurance, and nursing home care costs. Additionally, it provides health insurance for over a quarter of America's children and is the largest purchaser of maternity care, funding more than a third of all births. Medicaid provides comprehensive benefits for children, including coverage for necessary medical care such as screenings, treatments, immunizations, eyeglasses, dental care, and hearing aids. It also ensures access to regular health examinations and preventive interventions for both physical and mental conditions. The Medicaid program is crucial for women's health care, providing coverage for mental and physical disabilities, breast and cervical cancer treatment, and serving as the largest payment source for mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and special needs children. The Medicaid program is a critical source of funding for health care services, including for children in foster care and in schools. It is the largest revenue source for safety net hospitals, health centers, and nursing homes, ensuring access to care for all Americans and helping to reduce the number of uninsured individuals. Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures allows for growth in funding as State spending increases to meet unmet needs. The Medicaid program helps offset the decline in private coverage during recessions by enrolling millions of Americans. However, many individuals below the Federal poverty level are ineligible due to strict income rules. For example, a working parent in a family of three must earn less than $224 per week to qualify. Title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the House of Representatives could disqualify low-income pregnant women and children from Medicaid eligibility based on strict income rules, potentially affecting many beneficiaries, including children and those with special health needs. The House of Representatives' budget reconciliation bill includes measures that could significantly impact Medicaid beneficiaries, particularly low-income individuals, by increasing cost-sharing, limiting benefits, and restricting eligibility for long-term care services. These changes account for $30.1 billion of the total $45.3 billion in projected Medicaid spending reductions over 10 years. Research shows that higher cost-sharing can make essential health services unaffordable, leading to deteriorating health outcomes for children and adults. The Senate's S. 1932 bill includes significant cuts to Medicaid but does not directly limit beneficiary access to services. However, it would still result in a $14.2 billion net cut over 10 years, less than a third of the cuts in the House's budget reconciliation bill. The proposed changes to Medicaid could limit access to services for disabled individuals, elderly individuals, those with chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes, individuals with mental illnesses, and other beneficiaries. This could also threaten the Federal guarantee of health insurance coverage provided by the Medicaid program, impacting the entire healthcare system in the United States."
