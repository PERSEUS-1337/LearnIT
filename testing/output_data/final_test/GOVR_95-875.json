Calls for metric conversion in the US have been ongoing since the 1960s, with certain segments of society already embracing metric units. Congress passed the Metric Study Act of 1968 to study the feasibility of metric conversion. The Department of Commerce conducted a study on metric conversion in the US, concluding it was beneficial due to technology and international trade. The Metric Conversion Act was passed in 1975, creating a Metric Board for voluntary conversion. Public opposition led to the Board's abolition in 1982. Congress later pushed for metric conversion in the late 1980s to enhance US industrial competitiveness. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 required federal agencies to use the metric system in their activities, with exceptions for impracticality or inefficiency. Executive Order 12770 in 1991 further mandated agencies to develop metric conversion plans. After Executive Order 12770 in 1991, federal agencies were slow to respond to the metric conversion mandate. A 1990 GAO report found lack of commitment, but compliance improved later. A 1993 House Committee report showed progress with 29 out of 36 agencies reporting metric activities to Congress. A 1994 GAO report noted ongoing preparations for metric conversion but highlighted limitations in federal procurement and business activities. The Metric Program at the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) oversees federal metric procurement and conversion progress. Agencies vary in their metric readiness, budget constraints, and leadership support. The federal government is involved in metric conversion activities, such as proposed conversion of federal highways, construction projects in metric units, and labeling consumer products with dual units. Opposition from the private sector or the public often hinders these efforts, with the Secretary of Agriculture granting exemptions for projects affecting individual farmers. The Federal Highway Administration announced a metric conversion policy for highway construction plans, specifications, and estimates by September 30, 1996. State highway agencies are working with FHWA and AASHTO to meet the conversion requirements. The President signed the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, which delays the requirement for states to use the metric system in federal highway projects until September 30, 2000. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to indefinitely remove the federal mandate for metric conversion in highway projects. The FHWA announced a solicitation for public comments on transitioning highway sign legends to metric units. Bills in Congress aimed to prohibit federal funds for metric conversion of signs. Appropriation bills for FY1994, FY1995, and FY1996 specifically prohibited funds for metric sign conversion. FHWA decided not to require metric signs until at least after 1996. The FHWA decided not to require metric signs until at least after 1996 due to possible future congressional restrictions on funding for metric signs. The National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 prohibits the use of federal or state funds for metric conversion of highway signs. A Battelle study estimated the cost of metric highway sign conversion to range from $15.6 million to $826 million. Legislation in the 104th Congress aimed to limit metric conversion activities in the federal government. The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 directed the ACIR to study federal mandates, including metric conversion requirements for federal highway construction. The ACIR recommended repealing mandates for state and local governments to convert to metric on a Federal timetable to receive Federal aid. Metric proponents objected to these findings. Metric proponents have objected to the ACIR findings, stating that most states have already implemented metric conversion, the construction community is increasingly accepting the metric system, and conversion costs are a small percentage of federal highway funds. Legislation in the 104th Congress aimed to amend the Metric Conversion Act, with the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 repealing the requirement for federal agencies to report on metric conversion activities. Another amendment in Department of Commerce dismantling legislation sought to repeal a provision of the Metric Conversion Act. The 104th Congress passed a bill (P.L. 104-289) to address federal agency requirements for businesses to convert modular construction products to hard metric specifications for federal construction contracts. This bill aimed to repeal provisions of the Metric Conversion Act, including the requirement for federal agencies to use the metric system in their activities and the abolition of the Metric Program at NIST. The Savings in Construction Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-289) allows for a physical change in product dimensions to conform to rounded metric units. It applies to concrete masonry units and recessed lighting fixtures, prohibiting federal agencies from specifying hard metric dimensions unless certain criteria are met. In response to industry complaints, executive agencies must designate a metrication ombudsman for construction contracts. Legislation in the 105th Congress focuses on federal highway construction metrication issues, with bills aiming to indefinitely prohibit FHWA from requiring states to convert projects to metric units. Proponents argue against the federal mandate for metric conversion due to costs. Opponents of H.R. 813 argue that removing the federal mandate for metric conversion would create confusion in the highway construction industry and reverse the progress made by states in converting to the metric system. States have already spent nearly $71 million on converting plans, specifications, and computer programs to metric units."
