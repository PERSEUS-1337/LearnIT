    "content": "The No Child Left Behind Act amended the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, administered by the Department of Education. Grants are awarded for programs promoting school safety and preventing drug abuse. It is one of many federal programs targeting substance abuse and violence prevention in schools. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act program, administered by ED, HHS, and DOJ, received $568.8 million in FY2006. In FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million, but the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended higher amounts. The program is currently operating at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. For reauthorization and appropriations information, refer to CRS Report RL33870. In response to concerns about drug abuse and violence in schools, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which was later expanded to address school violence. In 1994, about 3 million violent crimes and thefts occurred annually in or near schools, with almost 16,000 incidents per school day. A survey showed that violence in public schools was increasing, making schools appear less safe than in previous years. In response to concerns about drug abuse and violence in schools, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 was passed, later expanded to address school violence. By 1994, physical conflict, weapon possession, and drug use rates among school-aged youth were reported as moderate to serious problems. President Clinton signed the Improving America's School Act into law, reauthorizing ESEA and creating SDFSCA to deter violence, promote school safety, and discourage drug use in schools. Funding was authorized for federal, state, and local programs to assist schools. Funding was authorized for federal, state, and local programs to assist schools in providing a disciplined learning environment free of violence and drug use. The report discusses the SDFSC program, school crime, and student safety data. The aim is to create indicators of school crime and safety nationwide. The Indicators Study gathers data from various sources including national surveys of students, teachers, and principals, as well as data from federal agencies like the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source has its own sample design and method of collecting information. In the 2004-2005 school year, 54.9 million students were enrolled in elementary and secondary schools. Violent crime victimization rates for 12- to 18-year-old students at school decreased from 73 to 55 occurrences. Despite the decline, violence, theft, drugs, and weapons remained issues in schools. 28 youth ages 5 to 18 were victims of school-associated violent deaths, including 21 homicides and 7 suicides. During the 2004-05 school year, 36% of 9th-12th grade students were in a fight, with 14% on school property. 28% of 12-18 year olds reported being bullied in the last six months, with males more likely to be injured. 24% reported sustaining injuries from bullying. 24% of students reported gangs in schools, more in urban areas. In 2004, 1.4 million nonfatal crimes occurred at school, with 33 thefts per 1,000 students. The study found that thefts at school were more common than away from school, with 33 thefts per 1,000 students at school. Additionally, in 2005, a small percentage of students reported drinking alcohol or using drugs on school property. Some students also admitted to carrying weapons at school, with Hispanic students more likely to report being threatened or injured with a weapon compared to white students. The Indicators Study highlighted the safety concerns in schools, noting that any crime or violence can disrupt the educational process and affect students, bystanders, and the community. In 2005, students were more afraid of being harmed at school than away from school, but fear decreased as grade levels increased. Safety perceptions varied based on race, grade level, and school location. Black and Hispanic students had higher percentages of fearing attack at school. In 2005, black and Hispanic students had higher fear levels of harm at school or on the way to and from school compared to white students. Students in lower grades were generally more fearful than those in higher grades. Urban school students were more likely to fear attack than suburban or rural school students. Additionally, public school students were more fearful than those in private schools. 11% of students experienced hate-related language at school, and 38% reported seeing hate-related graffiti. In 2005, females reported more gender-related hate words than males, while males reported more race and ethnicity-related hate words. Blacks, Hispanics, and students of other races reported more race-related hate words than white students. Urban school students were more likely to be called hate-related words than suburban or rural school students. Public school students were more likely to report being called hate-related words and to see hate-related graffiti. Teachers reported fewer threats of injury from students in the 2003-04 school year compared to 1993-94. In 2003-04, teachers were less likely to report being physically attacked than in 1993-94. Between 1993-94 and 2003-04, teachers in central city schools were more likely to be threatened with injury or physically attacked than those in urban fringe areas or rural schools. Male teachers were more likely to be threatened with injury, while female teachers were more likely to be physically attacked. Secondary school teachers were more likely to be threatened with injury by a student than elementary school teachers. Kenneth Trump, President of NSSSS, criticized the decline in school crime data as misleading and outdated. He highlighted the lack of mandatory school crime reporting laws in the US, stating that the true extent of school crimes is unknown. Unlike the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, school crime data is not based on actual reported crimes. Kenneth Trump, President of NSSSS, criticized the lack of mandatory school crime reporting laws in the US, stating that school crime data is based on limited research studies and surveys. A 2003 survey of 728 school resource officers found that over 87% believed school crimes were under-reported to police, with 61% attributing this to the fear of being labeled \"persistently dangerous.\" Additionally, over 88% of respondents felt that Congress should pass a law requiring nationwide reporting of school crimes. Survey respondents overwhelmingly support a law mandating nationwide school crime reporting for elementary and secondary schools. Violent school deaths are rare, with less than 1% of homicides and suicides occurring on school property or during school-related events. The Indicators Study emphasizes that while violent deaths in schools are tragic, they are infrequent and have far-reaching effects. The 2006 Indicators Study is the most recent federal research on violent school-related deaths. A study in 1996 by CDC, ED, NSSC, and DOJ identified 105 school-related deaths over two academic years. The researchers defined school-associated deaths as homicides or suicides on school campuses in the US. The 2006 Indicators Study found that less than 1% of all homicides among school-aged children occurred on school grounds or while traveling to and from school. 65% of school-related deaths were students, 11% were teachers or staff, and 23% were community members on school property. 83% of victims were male, with 23% of fatal injuries inside the school, 36% outdoors on school property, and 35% off-campus. Deaths occurred in 25 states in schools and communities of all sizes. The December 5, 2001 issue of JAMA presented an update on school-associated violent deaths in the United States from 1994-1999. A total of 253 school-related deaths occurred in 220 events during this period, including homicides, suicides, and other incidents on school campuses or while traveling to or from school. The CDC reported on school-associated violent deaths, noting trends such as troubled teens giving signals before incidents. The rate of these events has decreased, but multiple-victim events have increased. Over 50% of incidents occur during school transition times. Homicide perpetrators often show previous suicidal behaviors. The CDC reported on school-associated violent deaths, noting trends such as troubled teens giving signals before incidents. Homicide perpetrators were more likely than victims to have expressed previous suicidal behaviors or had a history of criminal charges, been gang members, associated with high-risk peers, or used alcohol or drugs weekly. Among students, homicide perpetrators were twice as likely as victims to have been bullied by peers. The rate of school-associated violent deaths was over twice as high for male students. Researchers concluded that while such deaths are rare, they occur often enough to identify possible risk factors that could help schools respond to the problem. For seven years from 1992 to 1999, researchers analyzed school-related violent deaths among middle, junior, and senior high school students. There were 209 incidents of homicide or suicide, with an average of 0.14 school-related homicides per school day and 0.03 suicides per school day. Homicide rates were highest at the beginning of fall and spring semesters, while suicide rates were higher in the spring semester. The CDC researchers found that suicide rates were higher in the spring semester compared to the fall semester, with no significant variation within semesters. They suggest that high school-related homicide rates peak at the beginning of each semester due to conflicts escalating after breaks and the stress of adjusting to new schedules and classmates. Schools should consider implementing programs to ease student adjustment during these times. The researchers caution that incidents identified in the study were based on news media reports, potentially leading to underreporting of events like suicides. CDC released findings on firearms used in violent student deaths from 1992 to 1999. The CDC found that most weapons used in school-related violent deaths were obtained from the perpetrator's home, friends, or relatives. They emphasized the importance of safe firearm storage and suggested measures to prevent such incidents, including reducing crowding, increasing supervision, and taking threats seriously. The CDC emphasizes the importance of preventing school-related violent deaths by addressing potential conflicts, taking threats and talk of suicide seriously, promoting prevention programs for bullying, and ensuring school security plans are enforced. They also provide resources for youth violence prevention. The CDC's Best Practices of Youth Violence Prevention sourcebook focuses on effective violence prevention practices in areas like parents and families, home visitation, conflict resolution skills, and mentoring. Blueprints for Violence Prevention, launched in 1996, recognized eleven programs for reducing youth violent crime. Youth Violence: A Report of the Surgeon General summarizes research on youth violence trends and prevention strategies. Early Warning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools offers research-based practices for school safety. A Guide to Safe Schools provides research-based practices to identify warning signs early and prevent, intervene, and respond to crises. Based on the work of an independent panel of experts, NSSSS President Trump monitors school-related deaths and crisis incidents from various sources. NSSSS research on school-related violent deaths uses the CDC's definition but also includes other non-accidental fatal injuries. NSSSS data collected from 1999-2007 shows 232 school-related violent deaths, with a peak of 49 deaths in the 2003-2004 school year. NSSSS President Trump noted a significant increase in incidents, including shootings, stabbings, suicides, and murder-suicides. The rise in school violence-related deaths was more than double the previous two school terms combined. Trump believed the sharp increase in school violence-related deaths was due to complacency. The Columbine High School shooting in 1999, where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher, sparked concerns about school safety. Trump emphasized the need for ongoing school safety measures, as many emergency plans adopted after Columbine were now inactive. Staff members were assigned to safety committees, but many programs were no longer active due to political pressure. The number of school-related violent deaths decreased in the 2004-2006 school years, but there has been a recent increase in such incidents in the 2006-2007 school year. Experts are puzzled by the reasons for these occurrences, with 20 violent deaths reported as of January 19, 2007, including shootings, suicides, murder-suicides, and stabbing deaths. Multiple high-profile school shootings occurred within days of each other in September and October 2006. The frequency of student-perpetrated school rampages resulting in multiple victimizations increased dramatically after 1994, with a rise in incidents from 0.53 to 3.27 per year. This trend reflected a pattern of multiple-victim attacks at schools across the nation from 1995-2001. CCSVC investigated lethal school violence and school rampages, noting a small number of incidents. The increase in such events in the 1990s may be attributed to media reporting. CCSVC believed that media coverage of school shootings became more prevalent in the late 1990s, leading to increased awareness of these incidents. CCSVC collected data on school-associated violent incidents from 1992 to 2001, noting an increase in multiple-victim, student-perpetrated school violence incidents from 1974 to 2001. Their data showed 19 incidents from 1974 to 1993 and 26 incidents from 1995 to 2001. The Committee's definition for listing such occurrences included multiple fatalities. Since 2001-2002, there have been 38 multiple-victim school-related violent incidents resulting in 40 fatalities and 110 non-fatal violent acts. In Colorado and Pennsylvania, 16 female students were traumatized and six killed by adult male assailants who then committed suicide. Experts suggest the Pennsylvania incident may have been influenced by media attention. Experts suggest that the Pennsylvania incident may have been a case of copycat violence influenced by media attention. Criminologist James Fox believes that media coverage plays a role in fostering copycat behavior, especially when attackers' personalities are exposed to public analysis. Similarities between the Colorado and Pennsylvania shootings include the targeting of girls as victims. Katherine S. Newman, a Harvard professor, notes that the publicity surrounding shooters can turn them into celebrities and potentially inspire more attacks. Katherine S. Newman, a researcher on school shootings since the 1970s, has observed a pattern where girls are predominantly the victims. Incidents in rural areas are more common, with revenge being a significant motive. Cheryl Meyer, a psychology professor, also highlights the role of revenge in school shootings, especially in small towns where past grievances can linger. The early 2006-2007 school violence incidents and school lockdowns prompted a national review of school safety issues. President Bush called for a conference on school safety in October 2006, convened by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Education Secretary Margaret Spellings. The purpose was to discuss best practices for keeping schools safe learning environments. President Trump noted that the discussions did not introduce new ideas, as the best practices discussed were already well established in the school safety profession. The best practices for school safety have been established since the Columbine tragedy. Trump and NSSSS called for a bipartisan task force to implement recommendations, including a K-12 school crime reporting mandate and revising the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program. Responsibilities for school security and emergency planning should be moved from ED to DOJ, while drug and alcohol prevention programs should remain under ED. Funding cuts for these projects should be restored. Restore funding for Emergency Response and Crisis Management Program, increase funds for K-12 school emergency preparedness, transfer responsibility to DOJ for school security and policing initiatives, fund COPS in Schools program, enhance training for school resource officers and administrators on violence prevention and emergency preparedness, and allow K-12 schools to apply for DHS funding for security against terrorist attacks. Congress should ensure that K-12 schools are classified as government facilities by DHS and included in National Critical Infrastructure programs. ED Secretary Margaret Spellings addressed school safety concerns on the White House online site \"Ask the White House,\" mentioning the importance of comprehensive crisis plans involving students, parents, law enforcement, and community groups to prevent violence in schools. The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research conducts the Monitoring the Future study to track youth behavior. Students can help keep schools safe by reporting threats, speaking out against bullying, and being a peer mentor. It is important for everyone to remain aware of warning signs of violence and report them immediately. The Monitoring the Future study by the University of Michigan surveys high school seniors, 8th and 10th graders annually on behavior, attitudes, and substance use. In 2006, 48,460 students in 410 schools were surveyed on drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, showing a decline in illicit drug use and alcohol consumption. The largest drop was seen in 8th graders. The 8th graders have shown a significant drop in illicit drug use since the late 1990s, but their progress seems to be slowing down. Older teens are also decreasing their drug use, reflecting a cohort effect. In 2006, high rates of prescription painkiller and sedative abuse were reported among 12th graders, with OxyContin use increasing among younger grades but slightly declining among seniors. In 2006, there was a concern about the use of OxyContin among youth due to its addictive potential. Vicodin use slightly increased among all three grades, while sedative use showed a steady increase among 12th graders until 2005, with a decline in 2006. Prescription-type drugs have become a more important part of the country's drug problem, as illegal drug use has declined. Marijuana remains the most widely used drug. Researchers found that amphetamines were the only prescribed psychotherapeutic drug not showing an increase in teen use. A new study in 2006 focused on over-the-counter cough and cold medications used for getting high, with street names like \"DXM\" and \"skittles.\" About one in 25 8th graders and one in 14 high school seniors reported using these drugs. Due to their over-the-counter availability, many students may not fully understand the risks involved. In 2006, 12th graders showed a decline in alcohol use, while cigarette smoking rates decreased among all grade levels. Marijuana use declined among 10th and 12th graders in 2003. In 2004, there was a modest decline in illicit drug use among 10th and 12th graders, with a significant drop in marijuana use. This decrease was attributed to an increase in the perception of marijuana as dangerous among students. However, in 2005, only 12th graders continued to perceive marijuana as risky. By 2006, marijuana use had decreased for the fifth consecutive year among 10th and 12th graders. In 2001, there was an increase in students believing ecstasy was dangerous, leading to a slowdown in usage. This trend continued in 2002 and 2003, with a sharp decline in ecstasy use as perceived dangers increased. Johnston noted a significant drop in illicit drug use among 8th graders since the late 1990s. Since 2002, there has been a significant decrease in ecstasy use among 10th and 12th graders, with smaller declines in 2004. In 2005, only 12th graders showed further decline, while in 2006, there was a slight increase in ecstasy use among 12th graders. The perception of great risk associated with ecstasy experimentation contributed to the decrease in usage. Teens have increasingly disapproved of ecstasy use since 2000, with fewer students believing the drug is readily available. In 2006, researchers found no significant decline in the use of various drugs among students, including LSD, cocaine, heroin, and steroids. There was a reduction in the proportion of students who believed that using ecstasy was dangerous, which could lead to a resurgence in its use. Use of illicit drugs other than marijuana had either declined or remained steady since 2000. Steroid use among 8th and 10th graders declined in 2004 but remained steady in 2005. LSD use decreased in all three grade levels since 1996, with a sharp decline in 2002 and 2003. However, there was little change in LSD use in 2004 and 2005, keeping it at historic low levels. Perceived LSD availability dropped considerably since 2001, raising concerns about a potential new epidemic of use among young people. In 2005, crack cocaine use remained steady for 8th and 12th graders and slightly declined for 10th graders. In 2006, only 10th graders showed a further decline in drug use, with a slight decrease in the belief of the risks involved. Cocaine powder use varied among different grade levels in 2005 and showed little decline in 2006. The perceived risk of trying crack cocaine among 8th graders declined in 2006 after holding steady in previous years. In 2006, there was a decline in the belief of great risk associated with crack cocaine use among 12th graders, but an increase in perceived risk for occasional use. Inhalant use significantly increased among 8th graders in 2003, likely due to the affordability and accessibility of inhalant products. This trend continued in 2004 and also increased among 10th and 12th graders for the first time in recent years. Researchers noted an increase in inhalant use among 12th graders, possibly reflecting a cohort effect. Perceived dangers of inhalant use declined among 8th and 10th graders over the past four years. Johnston emphasized the need for more attention to this drug class in prevention programs. In 2006, there was no significant decline in inhalant use at any grade level. Figure 1 shows drug usage levels from 1992 to 2006. Significant declines in teen alcohol use were observed in 2002, with drops in alcohol consumption among students in all three grades. In 2005, there were significant declines in alcohol use among 8th and 10th graders, with decreases in the proportion of students who got drunk in the past year and past 30 days. Heavy drinking slightly declined across all grade levels, but none reached statistical significance. Alcohol use among 8th and 10th graders remained steady in 2004, while there were drops in alcohol use indicators for all grades. However, alcohol use increased among 12th graders in 2004, prompting further observation for potential trends. In 2005, alcohol use declined in all three grades, with heavy drinking slightly decreasing among all grade levels. There was a modest decrease in binge drinking among 8th and 10th graders, but no decline among 12th graders. All grades showed an increase in perceived health risks and disapproval of binge drinking. Only 12th graders had a further decline in alcohol use prevalence in 2006, suggesting a possible end to the decline for younger students. Survey results in 2006 showed high prevalence rates of teen drunkenness, with a slight decline from previous peaks. The use of flavored alcoholic beverages among teens also decreased, indicating a trend of declining use rather than expansion. Alcohol use among teens has declined, with a decrease in the belief that alcohol is readily available. Cigarette smoking has also decreased since 1998. Johnston and his team noted that these reductions have led to longer lives and fewer serious illnesses. In 2003 and 2004, the decline in cigarette smoking slowed, with 8th graders no longer showing a decrease. Despite overall declines in smoking among teens, substantial numbers of teen smokers remained, with 25% of 12th graders, 16% of 10th graders, and 9% of 8th graders reporting smoking in the past 30 days. However, the proportion of current smokers had decreased by half among 8th and 10th graders and by one-third among 12th graders since the mid-1990s peak levels. In 2005, about half of all 10th and 12th graders strongly dislike being near smokers, and 75-80% prefer to date nonsmokers. There is a high social price for teen smokers, in addition to health risks and difficulty quitting. MTF researchers noted a decline in daily smoking among teens after years of improvement. After years of improvement, daily smoking among teens in their early to mid-teens has plateaued in 2006, with no further declines among 8th and 10th graders. However, there was a decline in half-pack-a-day cigarette use among 12th graders, who showed the greatest decreases. Overall, there was a small, continuing decline in 30-day smoking prevalence across all grades, with a significant decrease from the peak in the mid-1990s. Lifetime cigarette usage among students has also decreased significantly since 1996. Researchers expect the decline to continue among 12th graders as younger cohorts move up in grade levels. Researchers noted a leveling off in the decline of teen cigarette smoking, attributing it to reduced anti-tobacco advertising campaigns post-Tobacco Settlement. They believe the campaigns led to less favorable attitudes towards smoking, but with the decline in national anti-smoking ad campaigns, teen smoking reduction has slowed down. The proportion of students who believed smoking was dangerous has leveled off among 10th graders and begun to drop among 8th graders. Perceived risk of cigarette smoking is declining among 8th and 10th graders, leading to a halt in the reduction of youth smoking rates. Disapproval of cigarette smoking is still rising among teens, but the decline in perceived risk is a concerning trend. The MTF study introduced new questions about the use of specialty cigarettes from India and Indonesia among teens. The use of these cigarettes dropped significantly over the years, leading researchers to conclude that they were short-term fads that did not become health hazards. U.S. tobacco companies also introduced their own flavored cigarettes. In 2003, use of smokeless tobacco among teens declined significantly, with a 50% decrease in 30-day prevalence among 8th graders between 1994 and 2003. However, smokeless tobacco use leveled off in 2006 among 8th and 10th graders, with only 12th graders showing a further decrease. Boys accounted for most smokeless tobacco use, with one in 9 males in 12th grade using the product in 2006. In 2006, one in 9 males in 12th grade had used smokeless tobacco. Analysts believed that the decline in teen use between 1995 and 2004 was due to the perception of the product being dangerous. However, this belief slightly turned around in 2005. Teens were deterred from using smokeless tobacco after learning about the risks of mouth and throat cancer. The perception of great risk declined among 10th graders in the MTF 2004 survey, but 8th and 10th graders disapproved of its use. In 2006, MTF survey data showed a rise in disapproval among young people towards using smokeless tobacco, following an increase in perceived risk. 8th and 10th graders believed using the product could be harmful to health, while 12th graders saw it as a great risk. Disapproval declined among 8th graders but remained steady for 10th graders. 12th graders were not asked about their attitude towards using the product. MTF researchers found that smokeless tobacco use was more prevalent among boys in rural areas, with higher rates in the South and North Central regions compared to the Northeast and West. Usage was also higher in non-metropolitan areas and among White youths, with a negative correlation to parental education levels. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, administered by the Department of Education, provides grants for state and national programs promoting school safety and preventing drug abuse. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act provides grants for state programs promoting school safety and preventing drug abuse. State grants are administered through a formula grant program, with funds reserved for outlying areas, Indian youth programs, and Native Hawaiians. State grant funds are distributed to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Funds may be redistributed if not used within two years. National program funds cannot be increased unless state grant funding is at least 10% more than the previous year. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act removed the limitation provision. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act removed the limitation provision for state grant funds distribution. Up to 20% of the allotted funds can be used by the Governor for prevention programs, with the remainder administered by the State Educational Agency. The Governor can use up to 3% for administrative costs. Grants are awarded based on the quality of proposed programs to support drug and violence prevention activities. The Governor awards grants for violence prevention activities, prioritizing programs for children and youth not served by SEAs and LEAs. Special consideration is given to comprehensive approaches that include mental health services. Funds must be used for programs that prevent and reduce violence related to prejudice. The Governor awards grants for violence prevention activities, prioritizing programs for children and youth not served by SEAs and LEAs. Special consideration is given to comprehensive approaches that include mental health services. Funds must be used for planning, developing, and implementing capacity-building, training, and technical assistance for drug and violence prevention programs. The funds are required to support LEA-funded activities, align with state purposes, and focus on drug and violence prevention projects. Activities may include identifying, developing, evaluating, and disseminating prevention programs, providing training and technical assistance, and offering financial assistance to increase resources in areas serving low-income children. SEAs can use up to 3% for administration, with at least 93% subgranted to LEAs for prevention and education programs. 60% of funds are based on the amount LEAs received under ESEA. LEAs receive funds based on ESEA Title I, Part A allocations and school enrollments. They must use funds for comprehensive programs promoting a safe, drug-free environment, academic success, and violence prevention. Programs should involve parental engagement, community partnerships, and coordination with government agencies. LEAs can allocate up to 2% for administrative costs. The State must maintain a reporting system to provide information on truancy rates, violence, and drug-related offenses in schools. Data collected includes incident reports and surveys from students and teachers. A report must be submitted to the Secretary of Education. The state must submit a report to the Secretary of Education every two years on the implementation and effectiveness of its drug and violence prevention programs. To receive funding, the state must provide a comprehensive plan on how the funds will be used to support safe and drug-free schools, comply with effectiveness principles, and promote a safe learning environment. The state must ensure that its drug and violence prevention program is developed in consultation with appropriate officials and complies with various requirements. Local education agencies must submit applications for funding that have been developed through consultation with various stakeholders and ensure compliance with program guidelines. The funded activities and programs must comply with effectiveness principles, promote safe learning environments, and include a detailed plan for drug and violence prevention. LEAs can use funds for various related activities, but there are limitations on certain uses, such as acquiring security equipment, reporting crimes on school property, developing security plans, supporting safe passage activities, and hiring/training staff. The funded activities and programs must comply with effectiveness principles, promote safe learning environments, and include a detailed plan for drug and violence prevention. Not more than 40% of LEA funds may be used for specific activities, with limitations on certain uses like acquiring security equipment and hiring/training staff. A 1997 study found that districts often did not use proven prevention approaches for drug and violence programs. The Principles of Effectiveness were established by the ED to improve drug and violence prevention programs by requiring grant recipients to use funds for research-based programs. These principles mandate that programs be based on objective data, have clear goals, and be implemented efficiently. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative, funded under National Programs since FY1999, aims to create safe and drug-free school environments for students by assisting school districts and communities in implementing community-wide projects. The Secretary reserves funds annually for the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative, which aims to create safe schools and promote healthy childhood development. Collaborative efforts with DOJ's OJJDP include funding grants for mentorship programs to help at-risk youth avoid substance abuse and violence. Federal activities involve consulting with various agencies to administer programs targeting violence and drug use prevention. The ED Secretary administers programs to prevent violence and drug use among students, promoting safety and discipline. Up to $2,000,000 is reserved for evaluating the impact of these programs every two years. The evaluation assesses compliance, reduction in drug/alcohol/tobacco use, decrease in school violence, and effectiveness of training programs. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects data on illegal drug use and violence in schools through incident reports and surveys. The Secretary is required to submit biennial reports to the President and Congress on the impact evaluation findings, including data on drug use and violence prevalence in schools. The Education Department (ED) awarded a contract for an independent impact evaluation of violence and drug prevention programs in schools, estimated to take five years to complete. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects data on crime and violence in schools, but not on drug use, as other surveys fulfill this requirement. In FY1999, the National Coordinator Initiative was created under national programs allowing LEAs to recruit, hire, and train persons to serve as SDFSC program coordinators in middle schools to address drug prevention and school safety issues. The initiative expanded coverage for national coordinators to serve in all schools with notable drug and safety problems, responsible for assessing and administering the SDFSC state grant program. Funding for the National Coordinator initiative was terminated. The Secretary may award competitive grants to LEAs for new programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools. Grants may include resources and start-up assistance from SAMSHA. Up to 25% of funds can be awarded to low-income and rural SEAs. LEAs must submit an application describing activities that include proven strategies to reduce underage drinking. The Secretary may award competitive grants to eligible entities, such as LEAs and non-profit community-based groups, for mentoring programs in middle schools to assist children with the greatest need in transitioning to secondary school. Mentors will help at-risk students succeed academically. The program defines a child with the greatest need as at risk of educational failure, dropping out of school, or involvement in criminal activities. Mentors are responsible adults or students who work with these children. Grants are available for up to three years for mentoring programs linking children in high-need areas with trained mentors who have undergone background checks. Mentors are expected to achieve goals such as providing guidance, fostering responsibility, and discouraging harmful behavior in children with the greatest need. Priority is given to entities serving children in high-need or high-crime areas, providing quality mentor training, and planning school-based mentoring programs. The Gun-Free Schools Act, part of the SDFSCA, requires states to have laws expelling students who bring weapons to school. LEAs must refer students who bring weapons to school to the criminal justice system to receive funds under the SDFSCA. The Performance Assessment Rating Tool (PART) was used in 2004 to evaluate federal programs, including the SDFSC State Grants component. The SDFSC State Grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" by PART in 2004 due to a lack of demonstrated program effectiveness and thin distribution of state grant funds. The Administration plans to terminate the state grants program in FY2007. ED is using national survey data to assess teen drug use and violence and evaluating the impact of interventions and research-based programs.
