    "content": "In 2003, the 108th Congress is expected to face early challenges in foreign, defense, and trade policy as the global campaign against terrorism continues and a possible war with Iraq looms. Congressional actions are likely to reflect the changes in America post-9/11, with new priorities including shifting policy and resources accordingly. The new priorities post-9/11 include building a new structure for homeland security, continuing the worldwide campaign against terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda, and intensifying efforts to remove weapons of mass destruction from rogue governments. Al Qaeda is regrouping in Pakistan, posing new threats despite initial successes in Afghanistan. The concern is the threat of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the hands of \"rogue\" governments, who may use them against the United States and its allies or supply them to terrorist organizations. North Korea, Iran, and Iraq are identified as an \"axis of evil\" by President Bush. North Korea admitted to having a nuclear weapons program in violation of international agreements, leading to a potential international crisis. Many countries are becoming wary of how U.S. military power might be used. Countries are increasingly concerned about the unchecked use of U.S. military power and its unilateral decision-making, especially with the shift in focus from Al Qaeda to Iraq and the doctrine of preemption. Close allies in Europe and Asia are questioning the U.S.'s self-interest-driven actions and lack of consultation before making decisions. Some U.S. allies are concerned about the U.S. downgrading long-standing alliances in favor of short-term coalitions. International grievances include complaints about U.S. opposition to the International Criminal Court, rejection of environmental agreements, and withdrawal from treaties. Congress is facing new challenges related to U.S. alliances, especially as it considers accepting new NATO members. There is worry that mounting allied differences could cause further strain. Some observers are concerned that increasing U.S.-allied differences could erode relations, with voices questioning the need for formal alliances. Close association with U.S. policy is seen as making some countries more vulnerable to threats. There are minority views that allies are an impediment to U.S. freedom of action, while others argue for defining U.S. interests in terms of shared allied interests. Many argue that strong alliances are crucial for U.S. political, economic, and military strength. Congress is facing issues with U.S. assistance in conflict areas like Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and possibly Iraq. The controversial question of \"nation-building\" and post-conflict peacekeeping is being debated, with some suggesting leaving such efforts to other countries. The United States is reducing its forces in the Balkans, but experts warn against complete withdrawal. The United States is reducing its forces in the Balkans, but experts warn against complete withdrawal. Congress will likely review U.S. foreign aid priorities after 9/11 and consider the President's new foreign aid initiative, the Millennium Challenge Account, which aims to increase assistance to developing countries with good performance records. Poverty is seen as a root cause of terrorism, HIV/AIDS spread, and instability worldwide. Congressional challenges also include oversight of U.S. foreign policy towards rising powers like China. The global economy has profoundly changed international relations, impacting domestic policy like never before. Congress focuses on fighting HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases in Africa and Asia, while also addressing transnational issues such as international crime, drugs, environmental problems, and human rights concerns. Globalization brings benefits like increased productivity and economic growth, but also challenges that may require congressional attention. The 108th Congress will face decisions on free trade agreements and U.S. defense policy in 2003, amidst global economic dislocations and financial uncertainties. Some believe in strong U.S. leadership in multilateral frameworks, while others are wary of international organizations. Since 9/11, the Department of Defense has shifted its focus to waging war against terrorist forces worldwide and preparing for a potential conflict with Iraq. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasizes a technology-driven approach to military affairs, prioritizing lightness, mobility, and technological sophistication over traditional measures like firepower and force size. The Administration is focused on modernizing the armed forces, fighting a major war with Iraq if necessary, and maintaining efforts against terrorism without significantly increasing the size of the active duty armed forces. There are doubts and opposition from various sources, but the current military operations are being conducted within existing constraints. The current military effort may not be sustainable without a larger active duty force and increased procurement spending. Defense strategy and resource allocation issues have been overshadowed by the focus on the war on terrorism. Financing necessary defense spending increases during peacetime was already a challenge, and funding for modernization and readiness programs post-hostilities is uncertain due to budget deficits. The feasibility and importance of national missile defense systems are also in question. The United States is facing challenges in determining the size of its conventional forces and allocating defense budget resources. The Administration's willingness to act preemptively against terrorism and WMD threats raises questions about the capabilities of the current military forces. The need for long-range power projection capability is also highlighted. The 108th Congress will be addressing defense issues in an uncertain post-9/11 environment, focusing on the need for increased power projection, intelligence assets, and special operations forces. The significance of international terrorism as a threat to U.S. national security has been underscored, leading to questions about costs and priorities in counterterrorism policy. The 108th Congress will address the allocation of resources between homeland security and national security in counterterrorism policy. This includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security's activities versus foreign operations of various departments and agencies. Another key issue is the balance between forward defense measures and protecting the U.S. homeland from terrorist attacks. The Administration's counterterror effort is a major issue, with questions about targeting terrorist groups widely or focusing on Al Qaeda. The potential effects of military intervention in Iraq are also debated, with concerns about creating backlash, fueling terrorism, or diverting attention from fighting Al Qaeda. Congressional oversight is crucial in evaluating policy tools for combating international terrorism. The use of various policy tools in combating international terrorism, including covert actions and disrupting terrorist financing, may have diplomatic and political consequences. Addressing changes in guidelines for activities like recruitment of informants could be a legislative priority. Minimizing external costs, such as negative perceptions abroad, and focusing on nation-building strategies to address root causes of terrorism are important considerations in crafting a comprehensive counterterrorism policy. The Congress and the Bush Administration are working to prevent terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda or other groups. The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan has weakened Al Qaeda, but there are differing opinions on the possibility of another catastrophic attack. Recent attacks, including one on an oil tanker off the coast of Yemen and another in Bali, Indonesia, have raised concerns about Al Qaeda regrouping for new major attacks. Investigators are looking into attacks in November 2002 in Kenya and an audio threat from Osama bin Laden, confirming he is still alive. CIA Director George Tenet warned of a threat environment similar to pre-9/11. The Administration has made recent arrests of alleged Al Qaeda operatives. The Administration has confirmed recent major arrests of alleged Al Qaeda operatives, including capturing key organizer for the Persian Gulf region in November 2002. The effort against Al Qaeda is worldwide and multifaceted, involving diplomatic, financial, and military actions. U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan focus on supporting the government and preventing it from becoming a base for terrorist groups. Options may include using armed unmanned U.S. aircraft for targeted strikes. The United States is intensifying intelligence activities in western Pakistan to locate Osama bin Laden. There are efforts to pressure Saudi Arabia to crack down on financial donations to terrorist groups. Congress is actively overseeing the campaign against Al Qaeda and may review Administration efforts to strengthen the anti-terrorism coalition. The war on terrorism is placing significant demands on intelligence agencies, requiring new approaches and emphasis on human intelligence and language skills. The statutes and regulations governing intelligence collection were not written to support current counterterrorist efforts. The war on terrorism is placing demands on intelligence agencies, requiring new approaches and emphasis on human intelligence and language skills. Changes have been made since September 11, 2001, with Congress considering further modifications. There are complex issues regarding the balance between security and civil liberties as intelligence and law enforcement agencies collaborate. Intelligence for counterterrorism has budgetary implications and may require additional resources or fund transfers. Large-scale military operations in Afghanistan have ended, with small unit operations continuing to search for Taliban/Al-Qaeda supporters and their arms caches. U.S. troops and the International Security Assistance Force encounter sporadic firefights. The major decision facing Administration officials and congressional oversight committees is the role of the U.S. military in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Most agree that international troops must stay, with the U.S. military playing a leading role due to the weak central government and dominance of warlords. The ISAF operates only in Kabul, leaving U.S. forces to mediate Afghan disputes. In late 2002, a policy shift was announced by DOD officials. In late 2002, the Department of Defense announced that U.S. Central Command will send teams of combat soldiers, civil affairs specialists, and Afghan government troops to stabilize outlying areas in Afghanistan. The size and scope of these operations have not been disclosed, and the duration of U.S. forces' presence in Afghanistan remains uncertain. Additionally, DOD began training missions in the Philippines, Georgia, and Yemen to combat terrorists in remote regions. The United States has signed agreements with the Philippines, Georgia, and Yemen to provide training and support in combating terrorism. This includes improving military capabilities in Georgia to deal with rebel forces from Chechnya, assisting Yemen in anti-terrorism efforts, and working with the Philippines against the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group. These activities strain the limited resources of the Special Operations Command. The United States has signed agreements with the Philippines, Georgia, and Yemen to provide training and support in combating terrorism. This strains the limited resources of the Special Operations Command. Secretary Rumsfeld plans to increase DOD's covert operations against terrorists worldwide, potentially competing with CIA operations. Since 9/11, the Department of Defense has received $30 billion for various activities related to the war on terrorism, including military operations in Afghanistan. An additional $9 billion was provided in the FY2003 Defense Appropriations Act for munitions, UAVs, intelligence systems, reserve mobilization costs, and special pay for personnel. DOD also requested an extra $10 billion for FY2003. The Department of Defense requested $10 billion in FY2003 for unspecified military operations, but the funds were not provided in the regular Defense Appropriations Act. It is believed that ongoing costs in Afghanistan and preparations for a potential war with Iraq are being financed through supplemental appropriations or regular FY2003 funding. The Administration is expected to request additional funding in the future. The 108th Congress will address funding and oversight issues for transitional and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. Security, governance, and economic reconstruction are key focus areas. The main challenge is the lack of security due to ongoing fighting among former commanders. The Pentagon plans to expand the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan for local security and reconstruction, moving away from relying solely on the Afghan national army or ISAF. U.S. forces will now provide more robust security and reconstruction assistance outside Kabul. Congress will oversee developments in Afghanistan through funding and oversight. USAID reports significant U.S. government assistance to Afghanistan for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 authorizes $3.3 billion for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance through FY2006. Congress will maintain oversight on burdensharing and the international community recognizes the need for significant aid in the reconstruction effort. The international community recognizes the need for significant aid in the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan, with estimates of $15-$30 billion over the next decade. Afghan officials have complained about the slow pace of pledged funds, citing a lack of absorptive capacity. Funding distribution methods, whether through U.N. agencies or international organizations directly, are also being scrutinized. The Bush Administration has identified Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq as a potential threat due to its defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions on weapons of mass destruction. President Bush has warned of military action if Iraq does not fully cooperate with disarmament efforts. Reports of a U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf indicate a likely war if Iraq does not comply. The U.N. is conducting disarmament efforts in Iraq under Resolution 1441, with inspections by UNMOVIC. The Security Council may be divided on the evaluation of Iraq's cooperation. The U.S. and Britain may view any Iraqi non-cooperation as evidence of hiding WMD capabilities. France's stance on the matter remains uncertain. The Bush Administration's decision to confront Iraq under a U.N. umbrella has led to muted declarations of regime change as the ultimate goal, despite ongoing recruitment of an Iraqi opposition force. The outcome of Council deliberations on Iraq's cooperation with inspections could determine authorization of military action. The Iraq Liberation Act provided funding for a force to destabilize Saddam Hussein. President Bush authorized the use of armed forces to enforce U.N. resolutions on Iraq. Congress has held hearings on the possibility of war against Iraq and may play a role in international debates on Iraqi compliance. The Department of Defense has not officially released information on war planning against Iraq, but significant news leaks suggest varying military options. A \"heavy\" option could involve 250,000 troops and air and ground forces, while a \"lite\" option would rely on special operations. Cooperation from other nations in the region is crucial for staging areas and airbases. The \"lite\" option for military action against Iraq involves special operations forces working with indigenous opposition forces to target key military assets, including Republican Guard units and WMD capabilities. This approach assumes that the regular Iraqi army may defect to the opposition. The chosen plan combines elements of both \"heavy\" and \"lite\" options, focusing on diverse unit attacks and close coordination between air and ground forces, with around 80,000 U.S. troops involved. Indigenous forces may play a limited role, with CIA teams and special operations units assisting in gaining support. The potential military action against Iraq may involve CIA teams and special operations units to gain cooperation and isolate key Iraqi leadership. Concerns exist about stretching U.S. military resources due to other commitments like Afghanistan and the war on terrorism. A coalition similar to Desert Storm in 1991 may not be feasible, limiting options for U.S. planners. Cooperation from Persian Gulf states and Turkey is crucial, as Iraqi armed forces are significantly degraded. The Iraqi armed forces are significantly degraded from their 1991 levels, but there is a possibility of strong Republican Guard resistance in urban areas and Iraq's use of chemical and/or biological weapons. The Department of Defense has not provided estimates of the potential costs of a war with Iraq. The ongoing mobilization of military forces for a conflict in Iraq is presumably being funded using regular FY2003 appropriations with the expectation of reimbursement through a FY2003 supplemental. In September 2002, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the costs of two campaign options for a potential conflict with Iraq involving 370,000 troops on the ground or 270,000 troops in the air. The estimated cost of a three-month war would be between $32 billion and $47 billion, with additional occupation costs ranging from $12 billion to $48 billion. The House Budget Committee also prepared an estimate based on the costs of the Persian Gulf War of 1991. The House Budget Committee estimated the costs of the Persian Gulf War of 1991, ranging from $31 billion to $60 billion for a conflict lasting 30 to 60 days with varying troop numbers. Interest costs to finance the war could total an additional $17 to $33 billion over 10 years. Including interest, the total cost for a 60-day war with 250,000 troops could be about $93 billion over 10 years, aligning with the estimate made by Lawrence Lindsey. On December 30, 2002, OMB Director Mitch Daniels downplayed Lawrence Lindsey's estimate of the cost of a war with Iraq, suggesting it could be $50 billion to $60 billion. The Congressional Budget Office and House Budget Committee only considered direct budgetary effects, while William Nordhaus of Yale University estimated total economic costs, including a possible recession, destruction of Iraqi oil fields, and the cost of a lengthy occupation, ranging from $120 billion to $1.6 trillion. A war in Iraq could cost between $120 billion to $1.6 trillion. The outcome of the conflict could have significant political and diplomatic implications for U.S. interests in the Middle East, affecting relationships with Arab countries and the Arab-Israeli peace process. The success of a U.S. military campaign and the establishment of a new Iraqi government are crucial factors that could impact U.S. interests in the region. If the conflict results in a prolonged urban war with high civilian casualties and instability, Arab regimes like Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia may face challenges. Arab regimes in Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia may face civil unrest, media restrictions, and arrests of opponents due to potential war aftermath. Heightened repression could lead to anti-U.S. sentiments, impacting regional perceptions. Refugee flows from Iraq could further destabilize the region. If a regime change in Iraq is achieved without war or minimal casualties, it could mitigate these risks. A regime change in Iraq without war or with minimal casualties could improve the US image as a liberator in the Middle East. It may lead to greater political freedoms in Iraq, promoting democracy and human rights in the region. Congress could shape the outcome through oversight and funding foreign assistance programs for long-term objectives in Iraq. The Administration may request new funds from Congress for post-war scenarios in Iraq, including aid for refugees and coalition partners in the Middle East. Congress may be asked to authorize a specific assistance program for Iraq, potentially using Iraqi oil resources for long-term development programs. North Korea's decision to restart nuclear installations at Yongbyon creates a major arms control and foreign policy problem for the United States. Pyongyang's motive appears to be to pressure the Bush Administration for negotiations on a non-aggression pact or a new nuclear agreement. This move raises concerns about a potential breakout of North Korea's nuclear capabilities. The Yongbyon facilities reopening in 2003 signaled North Korea's potential to openly produce nuclear weapons, violating the 1994 Agreed Framework. This agreement required North Korea to suspend nuclear operations and store fuel rods securely. The US-led KEDO was to provide aid in exchange for North Korea's compliance with IAEA safeguards. The Agreed Framework specified North Korea's obligations regarding nuclear activities, including abiding by IAEA safeguards and the 1991 denuclearization agreement with South Korea. There is a reported \"secret minute\" prohibiting North Korea from building new nuclear facilities. The Bush Administration accelerated the construction of LWRs but also pressured North Korea to comply with IAEA obligations or face suspension of the project. Post-9/11, demands were made for North Korea to dismantle weapons of mass destruction and cease weapon proliferation. The Bush Administration demanded that North Korea dismantle its weapons of mass destruction, stop proliferating weapons, and withdraw troops from the Korean demilitarized zone. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly presented evidence of North Korea's secret nuclear weapons program based on uranium enrichment. North Korea admitted to the program, surprising the Administration. In 1998, North Korea admitted to possessing nuclear weapons and asserted their right to do so. The Bush Administration formulated a policy of \"containment and isolation\" if North Korea did not end the secret nuclear program. This policy included refusing to negotiate new agreements, assembling an international coalition to pressure North Korea, suspending fuel oil shipments, and warning of future economic sanctions. North Korea surprised Administration officials by announcing the re-opening of Yongbyon facilities, including restarting nuclear reactor and plutonium reprocessing plant. They also planned to move stored fuel rods for producing nuclear weapons-grade plutonium, which could lead to the production of atomic bombs in a few months. This nuclear breakout would put significant pressure on international relations. North Korea's re-opening of Yongbyon facilities, including restarting nuclear activities, could lead to the production of atomic bombs. The Bush Administration is considering economic sanctions and international cooperation to address this threat, but facing resistance from China, Russia, and South Korea. South Korea, China, and Russia support the U.S. position on North Korea's nuclear policies but criticize economic sanctions. South Korea's stance is influenced by public criticism of U.S. troops and the election of President Roh Moo-hyun. Congress approved funding for KEDO operations until FY 2002, with a decision on funding for FY 2003 pending. The 108th Congress faces challenges related to defending against WMD attacks and preventing further proliferation globally, particularly in countries like Russia, China, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, India, and Pakistan. The Bush Administration and others consider preemptively eliminating WMD capabilities in the context of Iraq and the war on terrorism post-9/11. Increased concerns about the nexus between WMD and terrorism have influenced strategy and tactics for combating terrorism. The 108th Congress will focus on key issues related to the threat of WMD use, preemption policies, and defending against possible WMD attacks. Congress will assess and fund programs to enhance detection of WMD-related materials at home and abroad, as well as oversee funding for cutting off terrorist access to WMD. The 108th Congress will review the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, focusing on funding for non-proliferation assistance to Russia, priority projects, Russia's cooperation, and assistance to nations outside the former Soviet bloc. The Russian Debt Swap for Nonproliferation Act will also be a key area of oversight. The 108th Congress will face issues related to proliferation of WMD capabilities from Russia, China, and North Korea, including sales of missiles and missile technologies to Iran and Pakistan. Concerns also include destabilizing missile deployments and potential missile testing if the Agreed Framework with North Korea fails. Other developments of interest are the International Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation and potential sales of missile defense systems to volatile regions like South Asia. The proliferation of WMD capabilities from states like Pakistan and North Korea raises concerns about nonproliferation regimes. Recent reports of Pakistan providing technology to North Korea highlight the complexity of balancing assistance in the war on terrorism with proliferation concerns. The Bush Administration may need to waive sanctions on Pakistan under the Symington amendment, while North Korea presents challenges across the board. North Korea's admission of a uranium enrichment program in 2002 led to the suspension of heavy oil shipments by the Bush Administration. The situation worsened when North Korea reactivated its nuclear facilities. The 107th Congress funded the agreement but may review it in the future. The Administration is urging North Korea to end missile deployments and weapons programs. The Congress authorized military force against Iraq. The 107th Congress authorized President Bush to use military force against Iraq to enforce compliance with U.N. resolutions on WMD programs. The 108th Congress may debate inspection results and ways to protect against WMD use. Legislation for foreign policy authorization and budgetary matters will be considered in the first session. The 108th Congress will address foreign policy authorization and budgetary matters, including the resolution for FY2003 funding and FY2004 international affairs appropriations. Legislation for the Department of State and foreign operations appropriations will be a focus, along with a new foreign aid initiative - the Millennium Challenge Account. The Congress will also work on enacting the eleven FY2003 appropriation bills that stalled in the previous year. The 108th Congress will address foreign policy authorization and budgetary matters, including FY2003 funding and FY2004 international affairs appropriations. There will be a focus on State Department programs, foreign assistance activities, and the Millennium Challenge Account. Congressional leaders aim to resolve appropriation issues by the end of January, with potential use of supplemental appropriation bills for targeted funding. The 108th Congress will address foreign policy authorization and budgetary matters, including FY2003 funding and FY2004 international affairs appropriations. Lawmakers will be asked to authorize and fund the Millennium Challenge Account, a new U.S. foreign aid initiative. Critics argue that poor accountability and U.S. strategic interests have hindered the success of foreign aid efforts. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is a new U.S. foreign aid initiative based on promoting development in the world's poorest nations through economic and democratic principles. It aims to increase U.S. economic aid by $5 billion over three years and focus on countries with good governance, economic freedom, and investments in people. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) proposes a significant increase in foreign aid spending through the creation of a new independent government entity, the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Corporation would be overseen by a review board chaired by the Secretary of State and staffed by about 100 individuals from various government agencies and NGOs. Key questions for Congress include whether MCA criteria will ensure success, how to support needs in non-performing nations, and if the selection process will identify the best performers. The United States has significantly increased spending on international HIV/AIDS programs since 2000. The 108th Congress is expected to be active in the area of HIV/AIDS and global health. According to UNAIDS, there are 42 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, with the majority in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia and the Pacific, there are 7.2 million HIV positive people, with the highest numbers in India and China. Eastern Europe and Central Asia have the fastest-growing HIV infection rates, with Russia seeing a significant increase in cases. Latin America and the Caribbean have an estimated 1.9 million people living with HIV/AIDS. In the Middle East and North Africa, there are approximately 550,000 people living with HIV/AIDS. The Bush Administration plans to increase international HIV/AIDS program funding to $1.32 billion in FY2003 from $360 million in FY2000. Both the Senate and House passed versions of a bill to authorize increased HIV/AIDS spending, with the Senate calling for $2.65 billion and the House report calling for $1.29 billion. President Bush proposed adding $200 million for the International Mother to Child Transmission (MTCT) Initiative in FY2003. The United States is a major donor to global HIV/AIDS initiatives, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Global Fund has received $2.1 billion in pledges, with the US pledging $500 million. Congress has appropriated $300 million to date. Some may advocate for increased US funding to the Global Fund in the 108th session. In the 108th Congress, there may be debates on increasing US funding to the Global Fund for humanitarian assistance, with bipartisan support. Key areas of concern include potential emergencies in Iraq, refugee issues in North Korea, and ongoing humanitarian crises. The humanitarian emergency in Iraq, refugee issues in North Korea, and ongoing humanitarian concerns in Afghanistan are key areas of concern. Implications of a possible war in Iraq include population movements and the need for humanitarian assistance. UN agencies provide the bulk of aid in Iraq, with over 60 percent of the population relying on food shipments or government rations. The type and implementation of humanitarian assistance, aid priorities, and the role of donors are of congressional interest. Congress is concerned about tens of thousands of North Koreans living illegally in China, with many seeking asylum in foreign embassies, mostly to South Korea. China has allowed some asylum-seekers to go to South Korea but has cracked down on the overall North Korean migrant population, sending thousands back to North Korea. China considers North Korean border-crossers as economic migrants, not political refugees, leading to reports of detention, torture, forced labor, and execution upon their return to North Korea. In the 107th Congress, measures condemning China's actions were introduced but not passed. Population movements continue in and out of Afghanistan, with an estimated 3 million Afghan refugees mainly in Iran and Pakistan. Approximately 750,000 internally displaced persons remain, despite nearly two million refugees being repatriated in 2002. Despite nearly two million refugees being repatriated in 2002, there is still a considerable number of people requiring relocation assistance. Many refugees are forced to seek help within or outside Afghanistan due to lack of sustainable livelihood. Successful resettlement hinges on a sound economic reconstruction strategy, with concerns about budget constraints affecting assistance levels and potentially leading to repeat migration of refugees. Congress is expected to monitor progress on reconstruction and the role of U.S. forces in the effort. Congress is likely to consider burden sharing with other donor countries in supporting reconstruction efforts, including providing disaster assistance through non-governmental agencies. The role of the military in post-emergency transition and reconstruction is evolving, with potential controversy over the use of Department of Defense funds and personnel. U.S. population assistance and family planning programs overseas have been a consistent point of debate in annual Foreign Operations appropriations discussions. The ongoing debate in annual Foreign Operations appropriations is whether the U.S. should fund the UNFPA due to concerns about its program in China. The Kemp-Kasten amendment bars U.S. funds to organizations involved in coercive abortion or sterilization. The Clinton Administration restored funding to UNFPA with a different interpretation of Kemp-Kasten. Congress appropriated $34 million for UNFPA in FY2002, but the White House placed a hold on the funds for review. In January 2002, the White House placed a hold on $34 million in funds for UNFPA pending a review of its activities in China. Despite a State Department team's conclusion that UNFPA does not knowingly support coercive practices, Secretary of State Powell decided to withhold the funds on July 22. Congressional critics oppose this decision and support legislation to fund UNFPA in FY2003. The Senate-reported FY2003 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill (S. 2779) included legislation to reverse the executive's decision to suspend UNFPA funds. The bill modified the Kemp-Kasten language to set a more rigorous test for determining eligibility for U.S. support. S. 2779 appropriated $50 million for UNFPA in FY2003. The House-reported companion measure (H.R. 5410) earmarked $25 million for UNFPA with the condition that UNFPA not fund the State Planned-Birth Commission or its regional affiliates in China. In 2003, Congress will consider legislation to authorize U.S. participation in the thirteenth replenishment of the World Bank's concessional aid facility, the International Development Association (IDA). The State Planned-Birth Commission in China is a key issue in the legislation that will be re-introduced in the 108th Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee's stance on changes to the Kemp-Kasten language proposed in S. 2779 is uncertain. Congressional supporters of UNFPA are expected to push for similar legislation related to the FY2003 appropriation and the FY2004 Foreign Operations bill. In 2003, Congress will consider legislation to authorize U.S. participation in the thirteenth replenishment of the World Bank's concessional aid facility, the International Development Association (IDA 13). The U.S. contribution would be $2.85 billion over 3 years, 20.1% of the total. Legislation authorizing U.S. participation in the IDA 13 and African Development Fund (AfDF) replenishments was deferred until the 108th Congress. The central issue in dispute was President Bush's proposal for IDA to provide half of its aid as grants rather than low-cost loans. The IDA 13 agreement includes provisions for grants, with the President's goal compromised at 18%-to-21%. The controversy over grants overshadows other aspects of the plan, which aim to increase IDA effectiveness, promote poverty reduction, and implement new monitoring procedures. Changes are also made to the World Bank's country strategy process and IDA's global and regional goals, with a focus on capacity building. The IDA 13 agreement focuses on grants, capacity building, governance improvement, and combatting corruption. Economic sanctions are considered as an option to combat threats to the United States. The Congress and the President use economic sanctions to combat threats like terrorism, weapons proliferation, and conflicts with countries like Iraq. Enlisting Pakistan's cooperation after 9/11 required exemptions from sanctions. Despite concerns, frontline states in Central and South Asia received substantial U.S. aid in the war against terrorism. The 108th Congress may need to prioritize between weapons proliferation and terrorism in shaping U.S. law. Pakistan's foreign aid is tied to democratic rule and anti-terrorism efforts, but reports suggest technology transfer to North Korea. This could trigger economic sanctions under U.S. law. The 108th Congress may consider imposing sanctions on countries involved in technology and material transfers to South Asia, including Pakistan and North Korea. Efforts to renew the Export Administration Act of 1979 for fighting terrorism have faced controversy since 1994. The Export Administration Act of 1979 has faced controversy since 1994 and needs serious attention. Recent reports suggest third countries like Ukraine and China may have provided radar technology to Iraq, triggering potential punitive measures from the United States. Congress is likely to focus on policy issues in European security, the Balkans, and weapons proliferation. During the 108th Congress, policy issues in European security, the Balkans, and Russia will be closely monitored. NATO is evolving post-Cold War, with uncertainties. The Senate will evaluate new candidates for the military alliance's capabilities. The Balkans remain unstable, with U.S. peacekeeping forces active. The Administration aims to reduce U.S. forces in the Balkans, considering global deployment. Russia, despite military weaknesses, is of interest to U.S. policymakers. Despite Russia's military weakness, it remains of interest to U.S. policymakers due to its political influence, geographic reach, and potential for future engagement in regions concerning Washington. Congress debates balancing the opportunity to secure Russia as a friend against addressing Moscow's human rights violations and proliferation record. NATO's role in combating new threats like terrorism and WMD proliferation is being evaluated by Congress. President Bush called for allies to contribute to developing technologies for fighting terrorism at NATO's Prague summit in 2002. NATO's importance to the United States may depend on allies' acceptance of new initiatives considered at Prague, including the potential membership of 7 European countries. The Senate is expected to debate the qualifications of these states in early 2004, which may lead to discussions on NATO's mission in fighting terrorism and curbing WMD. The debate over NATO's future revolves around the long-standing issue of burden-sharing, with Congress emphasizing the need for allies to increase defense budgets and take on responsibilities beyond Europe. The return of the burdensharing issue is a challenge for the US in persuading allies to upgrade defense capabilities and engage in regions like the Middle East. The US has invested heavily in promoting stability and democracy in the Balkans since 1991. The US has invested in promoting stability and democracy in the Balkans since 1991. The 108th Congress will debate aid for reconstruction in Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, and other countries in the region, urging European countries to share the burden. In October 2002, U.S. officials found evidence of Bosnian Serb and Yugoslav firms selling military equipment to Iraq. Aid to Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia may be conditioned on halting arms sales and cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal. Congress is monitoring the region's progress in fighting terrorism, shutting down Al Qaeda cells in Albania and Bosnia. However, organized crime and corruption in the region still enable terrorist activities. Considerations for reducing U.S. troop deployments in the Balkans may be discussed by Congress. The Bush Administration has gradually reduced U.S. troop levels in the Balkans, with about 1,900 troops in Bosnia and 4,300 in Kosovo. U.S.-Russian relations improved after September 11, 2001, focusing on cooperation against terrorism and Putin's integration policy with the West. Bilateral cooperation increased, but differences remain on some issues. The 108th Congress is expected to address Russian issues related to international security, trade, and political and economic developments. Key topics include the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions, WMD proliferation from Russia, and funding for threat reduction efforts. The 108th Congress will address Russian issues such as nuclear transfers to Iran, trade relations, energy cooperation, and the Chechen conflict. Congress has previously conditioned assistance to Russia on changes in behavior regarding these issues. The 108th Congress will focus on Russian issues such as nuclear transfers to Iran, trade relations, energy cooperation, and the Chechen conflict. It may also monitor Russian developments in areas like economic reform, legal reform, and human rights. In Latin America, the focus will be on counter-narcotics efforts, trade issues, and threats to democracy and stability. The 108th Congress will focus on Latin America's counter-narcotics efforts, trade issues, and threats to democracy and stability. This includes foreign assistance in combating drug trafficking and terrorist groups, trade negotiations with Chile and Central America, and concerns about democratic order in countries like Argentina, Venezuela, and Cuba. The 108th Congress will focus on Latin America's counter-narcotics efforts, trade issues, and threats to democracy and stability. Haiti's poverty and political instability will be a concern, while U.S.-Mexico bilateral relations will be closely monitored. The Andean Regional Initiative faces challenges in curbing drug trafficking and strengthening democracy in the region. The effectiveness of these efforts will be scrutinized by Congress. The 108th Congress will scrutinize the effectiveness of the Andean Regional Initiative (ARI), which is the Bush Administration's continuation of the \"Plan Colombia\" to combat drug trafficking in Colombia and surrounding countries. The Congress will decide on funding for the President's FY2003 $980 million request for the ARI. The 108th Congress will decide on funding for the President's FY2003 $980 million request for the Andean Regional Initiative (ARI). Major issues include expanding assistance to Colombia, human rights conditions under President Alvaro Uribe, and the effectiveness of U.S.-funded alternative development projects. Cuba remains a key issue for U.S. policy. In the 108th Congress, the main issue for U.S. policy towards Cuba will be how to support political and economic change. Different approaches include maintaining the embargo, lifting some sanctions for constructive engagement, or swiftly normalizing relations by lifting the embargo. Legislative initiatives have reflected these varying viewpoints. In the second session of the 107th Congress, the House approved amendments to ease restrictions on travel, remittances, and sales to Cuba. Congress will likely continue its interest in Cuba in 2003 with various legislative initiatives. U.S. policy towards Haiti in the 108th Congress will focus on promoting democratic development, economic growth, and political stability to address poverty, illegal immigration, and drug trafficking. Almost two years into President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's term, election disputes from 2000 remain unresolved, political turmoil has increased, the economy is in crisis, and human rights conditions have worsened. Major donors, including the United States, have directed aid to Haiti through non-governmental organizations, withholding direct aid to the government until promised reforms are enacted. Critics argue that withholding aid is contributing to Haitian poverty, instability, and illegal migration. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2003 foreign operations appropriations bill would prohibit assistance to Haiti except through regular notification procedures. The House Appropriations Committee's version would not require. The House Appropriations Committee's version (H.R. 5410) includes provisions for food assistance programs to be allocated to Haiti. The 108th Congress is expected to focus on trade, migration, border, and drug trafficking issues with Mexico, the United States' second most important trading partner. Relations between the two countries are warm. Relations between the United States and Mexico were warm, with a focus on trade, migration, border security, and drug trafficking. Efforts were made during the 107th Congress to strengthen border security and immigration policies through various acts. The Department of Homeland Security was established to consolidate relevant agencies. In FY2002, Congress mandated stringent safety inspections on Mexican trucks for NAFTA access to U.S. highways. In FY2003, the annual drug certification process was permanently modified. Several South American nations faced political and economic crises, challenging U.S. policy in the region. In the 108th Congress, oversight will focus on hemispheric freetrade, U.S. interests, and policy responses. Ecuador saw a coup in 2000 followed by \"free and fair\" elections in 2002. Venezuela faced political tensions with demands for a referendum on President Chavez's rule. Argentina's democratic system was also highlighted. Argentina's democratic system has been under stress since social protests over the deteriorating economy led to the resignation of a President in December 2001. The current administration is struggling with economic challenges, leading to an early presidential election in April 2003. Concerns about economic instability spreading to neighboring countries like Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil have also been raised. In the Middle East, policy challenges are expected to be key foreign policy concerns in the 108th Congress, particularly focusing on the confrontation between Israel. In the 108th Congress, key concerns include the confrontation between Israel and the Palestinians, Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs, the war on terrorism in the Middle East, and regional stability. Congressional hearings may address U.S. public diplomacy efforts, regional support for extremism, and reactions to U.S. policy in the Middle East. U.S. interests in the region, including Persian Gulf security, will also be important. President Clinton's failed attempt to reach a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians at Camp David in July 2000 led to an uprising by the Palestinians in September 2000. The violence and peace process failure may have influenced the election of Ariel Sharon as Prime Minister of Israel in February 2001. Sharon has refused to resume negotiations with the Palestinians until violence ceases. Israeli forces have regained control of territories previously ruled by Palestinians. Since the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the US has aligned with Israel in the fight against terrorism. President Bush urged Palestinians to elect leaders free from terror and build a democracy. He supported the creation of a Palestinian state once terrorism is addressed, with a final settlement within three years based on UN resolutions and Israeli withdrawal to secure borders. Secretary of State Powell has worked with international counterparts to develop a comprehensive action plan for Israeli-Syrian peace talks. Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000, but conflicts persist with Lebanese Hizballah. Congress continues to provide foreign aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Israel received $2.85 billion in U.S. assistance in FY2002. During FY2002, $72 million was allocated to the Israel-occupied West Bank and Gaza for Palestinians. U.S. aid is delivered through non-governmental and international organizations, not to the Palestinian Authority or the Palestine Liberation Organization. Congress has supported moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and focused on anti-Israeli terrorism post-Palestinian uprising. Congress demanded PA action against terrorists in resolutions and called for suspending relations with Yasir Arafat if necessary. In response to Palestinian actions, Congress called for sanctions and expressed solidarity with Israel. Legislation in the 107th Congress aimed to restrict PLO representatives in the US. The House-passed Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for 2003 included a provision withholding funds for a Palestinian state unless certain conditions were met. The Administration requested over $1 billion in Development Assistance for Africa in FY2003. The House and Senate bills during the 107th Congress did not specify amounts for Africa but provided more funding for programs than the Administration had originally requested. This suggested that the Administration's spending target for Africa would have been met if foreign operations expenditures had been appropriated. The 108th Congress may need to reassess levels of terrorism-related security assistance for Africa, as concerns about famine in southern Africa and Ethiopia persist. The Administration is proposing a new federal organization, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, to administer a proposed increase of $5 billion in foreign economic aid over three years starting in FY2004, benefiting several African nations. Congress may need to reassess levels of terrorism-related security assistance for Africa due to the presence of international terrorist groups in the region. The Administration's FY2003 request for military assistance to Africa remained stable, with a focus on Foreign Military Financing and peacekeeping training. The Department of Defense and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2002 provided $14 million for this purpose. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2002 provided $14 million for HIV-related U.S. military training and humanitarian assistance in African nations, aiming to prevent the growth of terrorist groups and extremism by addressing poverty and social conditions. This complements broader U.S. efforts like the Millennium Challenge Account and the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance within USAID. The 107th Congress focused on resolving African conflicts and promoting peace in countries emerging from war, with programs like ACOTA and the Sudan Peace Act. Sudan and Angola were key areas of interest, with efforts to support peace processes and humanitarian assistance. The 107th Congress focused on resolving African conflicts and promoting peace in countries emerging from war, with programs like ACOTA and the Sudan Peace Act. Urging the Angolan government to use oil wealth for funding needs and reforms for transparency, accountability, and democratization. Concerns about civil conflicts in Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Burundi. Monitoring political violence in Zimbabwe and election processes in Nigeria and Kenya. HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa raising concerns about stability. In 2002, millions of Africans were HIV-positive, with high infection rates in southern Africa. AIDS-related economic losses were contributing to famines in the region. Concerns were raised about the impact of AIDS in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria. The 107th Congress increased spending for AIDS programs in Africa. The 107th Congress increased spending for AIDS programs in Africa, mainly through global AIDS programs of USAID and CDC. The Administration's FY2003 request includes proposed increases for bilateral AIDS spending and for a contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. There are calls for increased U.S. funding for AIDS prevention, care, and treatment in Africa, while some believe current spending levels are adequate. President Bush planned to visit Africa in early 2003. President Bush's planned visit to Africa in early 2003 may draw attention to AIDS in Africa and lead to new efforts to combat the epidemic. Congress is closely monitoring the implementation of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and may explore further measures to increase U.S.-African trade. The Administration's intention to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the South African Customs Union (SACU) has been notified to Congress. Some policymakers are looking to enhance the role of African oil producers in maintaining U.S. energy security. U.S. investment in Africa is primarily focused on the oil sector, which is increasingly seen as strategically valuable. Some analysts increasingly view African oil as strategically valuable to the United States due to its high quality. The policy issue for the 108th Congress regarding Asia is how to pursue U.S. interests in a region with diverse countries in terms of military strength, economic development, and political systems. The challenges include reducing terrorism threats and minimizing the risk of war in hot spots like Pakistan. The policy issues for the 108th Congress in Asia include reducing terrorism threats, minimizing the risk of war in hot spots like Pakistan, containing weapons of mass destruction, promoting economic growth and trade relations, and pressuring countries to improve human rights and democratic institutions. The 108th Congress faces key policy issues in Asia, including promoting human rights in China amidst economic changes. The Chinese Communist Party deals with disaffected citizens and religious movements like Falun Gong. Taiwan also experiences labor protests due to economic challenges and debates on investment in China. The 108th Congress will consider Economic Support Fund levels for rule-of-law, democracy, and Tibet programs in China in FY 2004-05. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China will monitor the PRC's compliance with international human rights standards and progress toward a rule of law. During the 108th Congress, the PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan will face political challenges. The PRC replaced senior leaders, raising uncertainty about future policy preferences. In Taiwan, President Chen Shui-bian will run for re-election in 2004, with the central issue being Taiwan's political future. Domestic divisions are likely to impact decisions on political independence or integration with the PRC. In Taiwan, domestic divisions may lead to continued political fractiousness and pressure on U.S. officials to support the country. In Hong Kong, there are concerns about enacting an \"anti-sedition law\" that could restrict free expression and trigger U.S. policy responses under the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. Congress is also concerned about security issues in U.S. policy toward China, including cooperation in weapons non-proliferation and peace in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Congress has oversight over laws on sanctions, military exchanges, and defense assistance for Taiwan. Options for Congress include holding hearings on policy towards China and Taiwan, revising sanctions laws, and reviewing advanced arms sales to Taiwan. U.S. economic relations with China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are of interest to Congress. The one year anniversary of the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is marked by mixed compliance with obligations, particularly in agricultural products and services. There are ongoing trade disputes that Members urge the Bush Administration to address. Congress is debating resource allocation for monitoring China's WTO compliance and expressing concerns over Taiwan's economic dependence on Mainland China. Taiwan's largest export market is now the PRC, replacing the United States. The policy issue with Pakistan involves handling relations with a Muslim, nuclear-armed state while searching for Al Qaeda, preventing nuclear war in Kashmir, supporting democracy and human rights, and improving relations with India. The US views Pakistan as an important ally in the global anti-terror coalition but is concerned about undemocratic practices and nuclear proliferation. Congress addresses Pakistan issues through foreign assistance authorizations and operations. The US addresses issues with Pakistan through various means such as foreign assistance authorizations, sanctions, and arms sales waivers. Legislation was introduced in the 107th Congress to restrict aid to Pakistan due to concerns about the military's role in governing the country. There were also allegations of Pakistan being involved in delivering uranium enrichment materials to North Korea. The US may halt non-humanitarian aid to Pakistan under the Symington Amendment if deliveries of weapons or technologies to North Korea are confirmed. Other concerns include debt forgiveness, cross-border infiltration into Indian Kashmir, anti-terrorism cooperation, economic reforms, and the rise of Islamist politicians in Pakistan. In contrast, the policy issue with India is how to enhance U.S.-Indian relations in the post-Cold War era, with President Bush waiving nuclear weapons-related restrictions on aid to India after its support for U.S. anti-terror operations. The US has concerns about aid to India due to ongoing security cooperation, joint military exercises, and defense trade. The dispute over Kashmir with Pakistan remains a concern for regional stability and US interests. Congress also worries about human rights, religious freedom, bilateral trade, and economic reforms in India. Congress will primarily oversee and fund U.S. efforts to combat radical Islamist terrorist groups in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia, known to have ties to Al Qaeda. The region has seen violent plots against U.S. and Western targets since 9/11, including the 2002 Bali bombing. The Bush Administration has increased intelligence cooperation to address the threat. The Bush Administration has increased intelligence cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, deployed troops to the southern Philippines, and signed a multilateral counterterrorism agreement. Some Southeast Asian governments are ambivalent about the increased American military presence due to political sensitivity. Congress is involved in the anti-terrorist campaign through the appropriations process. In the anti-terrorist campaign, Congress considers funding levels and conditions for U.S. assistance to the Philippines and Indonesia. The Bush Administration requested over $90 million for the Philippines in FY2003. Indonesia received $12 million in FY2002 for anti-terrorism police training. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are relaxing restrictions on aid to Indonesia's military in the FY2003 foreign operations appropriations bill. The FY2004 requests for anti-terrorism assistance to Indonesia and the Philippines may increase. Congress will oversee efforts to strengthen economic ties with countries in the region, including finalizing a free trade agreement with Singapore and negotiating with Australia. Congress will also review Vietnam's normal trade relations status. Defense will be a major focus in the 108th Congress due to the war on terrorism and a possible conflict with Iraq. Congress may consider supplemental appropriations for these conflicts and an unallocated contingency fund for future military operations. One key issue is whether to allow concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans disability benefits, with differing opinions between military retirees and veterans service organizations. Veterans service organizations are pushing for broader benefits, opposed by the White House on budgetary grounds. Other issues include defense spending priorities, military transformation, homeland security, privatizing defense jobs, acquisition reform, and military base closures planned for 2005. Congress will address these issues in the budget resolution and defense bills. Missile defense and development of new nuclear weapons are also topics of debate. The Administration requested a significant increase in defense spending, with Congress approving most of it but denying $10 billion for a contingency fund. The FY2003 budget for national defense saw a substantial increase, with projections for more modest increases in the following years. However, funding for weapons acquisition remains a point of contention. The Navy requested only five new ships in FY2003, but 8 to 10 are needed annually to maintain a fleet of 300 ships. The budget for weapons procurement is projected to increase from $72 billion in FY2003 to nearly $100 billion by FY2007. However, funding for weapons modernization is tight due to new weapons in production. Congress has debated priorities among service acquisition plans, with constraints on funding due to rapid growth in other budget areas, including personnel costs. Personnel costs have increased significantly due to annual pay raises, pay table reform, housing allowances, and retirement benefits. Meanwhile, operation and maintenance funding has also grown above inflation rates. These increased costs account for two-thirds of the projected increase in defense spending between FY2000 and FY2007. Defense transformation, a priority for funding new initiatives, is a key element in the budget debate. Some in Congress advocate for increasing active duty end-strength to meet high demands, especially in the global campaign against terrorism. However, increasing defense spending beyond the proposed budget could worsen the budget deficit, with competing demands on the federal treasury. Defense transformation involves significant changes in military weapons, operations, and organization in response to major shifts. The Bush Administration and supporters believe in the necessity of defense transformation to address 21st-century challenges. This includes significant changes in military weapons, operations, and organization prompted by technological advancements. The Department of Defense has established an Office of Force Transformation, with Congress also showing interest in the process due to its potential impact on defense programs and budgets. The Bush Administration and supporters advocate defense transformation for 21st-century challenges, involving changes in military weapons and operations. Congress plays a role in assessing the need for transformation and deciding on defense budgets. Key questions for Congress include the necessity of transformation, adequacy of the Administration's plan, and alternative proposals. The Bush Administration and supporters advocate defense transformation for 21st-century challenges, involving changes in military weapons and operations. Congress plays a role in assessing the need for transformation and deciding on defense budgets. Key questions for Congress include the necessity of transformation, adequacy of the Administration's plan, and alternative proposals. Congress has several options on defense transformation, including agreeing or disagreeing with its necessity, approving, modifying, or rejecting funding requests, and establishing policy goals and reporting requirements to shape defense transformation. The Bush Administration and supporters advocate defense transformation for 21st-century challenges, involving changes in military weapons and operations. Congress plays a role in assessing the need for transformation and deciding on defense budgets. Key questions for Congress include the necessity of transformation, adequacy of the Administration's plan, and alternative proposals. Congress has several options on defense transformation, including agreeing or disagreeing with its necessity, approving, modifying, or rejecting funding requests, and establishing policy goals and reporting requirements to shape defense transformation. Development and procurement of weapons systems for U.S. Armed Forces are important activities that Congress ultimately determines through annual defense authorization and appropriations bills and oversight. DOD is currently emphasizing research and development for \"transformational\" systems, while also continuing research and development and procurement for replacing and upgrading current \"legacy\" force equipment and for more rapid introduction of \"interim\" forces with transformational capabilities. The overall balance of acquisitions is crucial to provide a capable force when required, with a focus on Army transformation. The Army's transformation efforts focus on the Future Combat Systems (FCS), a high-risk R&D concept aiming for initial production in FY2008. Congress will review the almost billion-dollar annual funding for the FCS and the development of an indirect fires component to replace the canceled Crusader howitzer. Additionally, funds are allocated for Stryker armored vehicles for Interim Brigade Combat Teams. The Army is exploring alternative systems to comply with the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel landmines. The Army is seeking alternative systems to comply with the Ottawa Treaty banning landmines. Congress will need to decide on the balance of expenditures for U.S. ground combat preparedness. Key issues for the 108th Congress regarding naval weapons acquisition include the adequacy of the Navy's planned size and funding for ship and aircraft procurement. The Navy is exploring new funding mechanisms for ship procurement, including split funding and advance appropriations. Congress is evaluating the implications of these methods on the full funding policy and oversight of DOD weapon acquisition programs. Cost overruns on previous ship procurements are being addressed, and the Administration's plans for aircraft carriers, DD(X) destroyers, and Littoral Combat Ships are under scrutiny. The Air Force's top modernization priority is the F/A-22 Raptor, facing cost and schedule concerns due to a congressional cost cap. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, with a $233 billion estimated cost, involves multiple variants to meet Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy requirements, with eight allied countries participating in its development. The JSF program is being developed to meet Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy needs, with eight allied countries involved. Aerial refueling and long-range bomber aircraft modernization are key issues. The Air Force's KC-135 fleet needs replacement, and leasing Boeing 767 aircraft was proposed but controversial. Lack of funding for long-range bombers despite their recent achievements will likely be debated in the 108th Congress. The Army's major aviation program is the RAH-66 Comanche helicopter. The RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter program was restructured in 2002, cutting the number of aircraft in half and reducing production costs. The Army is debating the need for an armed reconnaissance helicopter and the appropriate mix of Comanches, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and UAVs. The Marine Corps' priority is the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, which has faced difficulties and fatal accidents. The maturity of the Osprey's tilt-rotor technology is being questioned. The Osprey tilt-rotor technology's maturity is being questioned in relation to the 458 aircraft, $46 billion program. The 108th Congress is facing increasing overseas military commitments, with deployments to various regions since the end of World War II. The U.S. military has mobilized reservists for anti-terrorism operations and potential war with Iraq, despite a decline in manpower. Over 130,000 reservists have been activated, with the possibility of needing another 250,000 for a war with Iraq. This has led to increased overseas deployments and frequent tours without families for many military personnel. The U.S. military has mobilized reservists for anti-terrorism operations and potential war with Iraq, leading to increased overseas deployments and frequent tours without families for many military personnel. Some occupational specialties or units, especially in the reserves, are more affected by these conditions. Concerns have been raised about a potential mismatch between military manpower and the increased scale of U.S. military operations worldwide. The U.S. military is facing concerns about a potential mismatch between military manpower and the requirements of current operations, which could lead to recruiting and retention issues in the future. Proposals have been made to increase active duty strength, but the Administration and DOD are opposed due to budgetary reasons. DOD plans to reduce the number of reservists on active duty to save money and increase the proportion of \"high-demand\" units in the active duty force. The FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act provided a new benefit for military retirees with disabilities. Reducing manpower pressures by decreasing personnel in peacekeeping operations is also being considered. The FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act introduced a new benefit for 30,000 military retirees with combat-related disabilities. This resolved a dispute between the Administration and Congress regarding concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA disability benefits. The 108th Congress may revisit the issue of concurrent receipt and abortion laws in the Department of Defense. The transformation of U.S. defense capabilities has implications for intelligence agencies, with a growing need for real-time locating data and communication systems. Resources must balance providing intelligence to operating forces with supporting national-level policymakers, including those addressing international terrorism. The U.S. military's focus on expeditionary warfare overseas has shifted with the heightened concern about large-scale terrorism, leading to efforts to involve DOD more closely with federal, state, and local agencies. The establishment of the position of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence may result in administrative changes within DOD and affect the relationship of defense intelligence agencies to the Director of Central Intelligence. Efforts to involve DOD in homeland security activities are underway, with the establishment of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DOD resources can be used to deter and respond to terrorist acts, but the focus remains on overseas military operations to avoid draining resources. Coordination between DOD and DHS is still being determined. The legislation creating DHS (P.L. 107-296) does not address the extent of cooperation between DOD and DHS, with details on NORTHCOM remaining scarce. The intelligence capabilities within DOD, including various agencies, are crucial national assets. Cooperation between DOD and DHS will be vital for DHS's intelligence analysis efforts. The act establishing DHS includes a threat assessment office reliant on DOD intelligence, balancing the need for terrorist intelligence with traditional geopolitical intelligence. The Department of Defense's involvement in providing intelligence support to DHS raises questions about DOD's role in domestic law enforcement, considering the Posse Comitatus Act. DOD has the largest and most diverse personnel assets in the Federal Government, including active duty, reserve forces, and National Guard units. The National Guard's role in homeland security is a topic of discussion, with some believing it is well-suited for local and community contingencies due to its traditional state militia role. The National Guard's potential expansion in homeland security is debated, with concerns about its ability to recruit and retain soldiers if its focus shifts primarily to local and domestic missions. The Department of Defense remains a key resource for responding to CBRN incidents, despite expectations for civilian authorities to improve capabilities in the future. The Department of Defense (DOD) plays a crucial role in responding to CBRN incidents, with ongoing reliance on DOD assets. DOD's research and development for homeland security mainly focuses on chemical-biological defense, with a significant budget allocation for biodefense. Acquisition process reforms have been initiated by DOD to enhance defense procurement procedures. The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented changes in defense acquisition to be more responsive to evolving threats and technology. Congressional committees have expressed concerns about the new procedures and receiving adequate information for oversight. DOD is using evolutionary acquisition with spiral development to develop new weapon systems in incremental phases. The Department of Defense (DOD) is using spiral development in the second phase of weapon system development to refine operational requirements through interaction between developers, testers, and users. This process introduces more uncertainty compared to traditional methods, leading to challenges in reporting to Congress. Congressional provisions in the FY2003 Defense Authorization Act mandate reports on DOD's use of evolutionary acquisition and spiral development for major acquisition programs to ensure accountability in weapons testing. The 108th Congress is expected to examine defense outsourcing initiatives and may face challenges in oversight of DOD acquisition processes, including concerns about accountability, technical difficulties, and cost overruns in expensive weapon programs. The 108th Congress is expected to review defense outsourcing initiatives and may encounter increased demands for oversight of DOD competitive sourcing policies. The Department of Defense aims to reduce infrastructure costs to fund future military modernization through competitive sourcing. OMB Circular A-76 determines whether private sector or federal government employees should perform commercial activities, aligning with the Bush Administration's Management Agenda. The Federal Activities and Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act, along with OMB Circular A-76, are management tools used to compete federal jobs. The Administration aims to compete about 425,000 federal jobs, with OMB directing agencies to compete a percentage of commercial jobs by specific deadlines. OMB recently revised Circular A-76 to support competitive sourcing goals, with the revision currently in the evaluation period. The proposed Circular A-76 is in a \"comment evaluation\" period with key highlights including a presumption of commercial activities, shorter competition timelines, and the use of \"best value\" in awarding defense contracts. Implementation of the revised circular would impact defense competitive sourcing policy, conflicting with Title 10, U.S.C. Section 2462 which requires contracts to be awarded based on low cost. The United States Army also announced a major outsourcing initiative targeting two-thirds of jobs. The United States Army's new initiative, \"The Third Wave,\" aims to outsource approximately 214,000 jobs, affecting up to 160,000 civilians and up to 60,000 military personnel. This initiative includes base operation activities like logistics, training, information management, and public works, as part of the base realignment and closure process. The Secretary of Defense directed the start of the 2005 base closure implementation process, emphasizing the need for new force structures and base structures to maximize operational capacity and efficiency. Opportunities for greater joint activity and consolidation of laboratories were highlighted, with final recommendations to be submitted to the new Commission in May 2005. The new BRAC law replicates the 1990 base closing statute. Key milestones for the 2005 round include the Secretary of Defense publishing draft selection criteria in December 2003, final criteria in February 2004, and sending a list of recommended base closures in May 2005. The BRAC Commission sends its recommendations to the President in September 2005, who certifies them in November 2005. The 108th Congress is likely to monitor the ongoing BRAC process, with a major focus on efforts to prevent \"base encroachment\". Members may be concerned about military installations in their districts and states. The Trade Act of 2002 ended eight years of debate over trade promotion authority. The 108th Congress is expected to have a busy trade agenda, with the Bush Administration seeking approval for free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. Congress will evaluate how these agreements impact various interests and the progress of broader trade negotiations like the FTAA and the Doha Development Agenda. The 108th Congress is expected to address trade issues, including free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. Controversy surrounds agreements like the FTAA and the Doha Development Agenda, as well as efforts to re-authorize the Export Administration Act and ensure U.S. laws comply with WTO rules to avoid sanctions on exports. The Bush Administration is negotiating unprecedented trade deals. The Bush Administration is negotiating multiple trade agreements, including bilateral agreements with Chile and Singapore, and plans to start negotiations with Morocco, Central America, the South African Customs Union, and Australia. Additionally, a new trade effort with ASEAN countries has been announced. The Bush Administration is negotiating multiple trade agreements, including bilateral agreements with ASEAN countries committed to economic openness and reforms. Negotiations for broader agreements like the FTAA and WTO Doha Development Agenda are ongoing. The 108th Congress will need to decide on approving free trade agreements and monitor negotiations. Key policy questions include whether the agreements serve U.S. interests, if the Administration is fulfilling its obligations, and if the agreements are supportive of the multilateral agenda in the Doha Development Agenda. In deciding on bilateral free trade agreements, Members of Congress consider potential costs and benefits to constituents and the U.S. economy. Concerns may focus on how agreements impact exporters, import-competing industries, consumers, and workers. Some agreements open new markets for U.S. exporters without reducing import protection, while others may create competition for sectors like textiles and apparel. Committees like the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees may question the Administration's FTA strategy. The Administration's FTA strategy raises questions about partner selection, economic criteria, and impact on broader trade agreements. Critics argue bilateral FTAs offer limited benefits and could hinder regional/global deals. Public reception to FTAs like NAFTA has been cool. The Bush Administration sees FTAs as supporting foreign policy goals and as stepping stones to larger agreements. The Administration views bilateral FTAs as stepping stones for larger regional and global trade agreements. Congressional Role in Trade Agreements is crucial as Congress decides on implementing changes from trade agreements into domestic law. In 2002, the Trade Act of 2002 was passed by the 107th Congress. The Trade Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210) granted the President Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to submit trade agreements to Congress for approval under special procedures. TPA increases the likelihood of Congress approving trade agreements as negotiated, bolstering U.S. trade negotiators' leverage and credibility. Congress could consider responses if the executive branch does not follow the trade legislation provisions. The Trade Act of 2002 granted the President Trade Promotion Authority to submit trade agreements to Congress for approval under special procedures. Congress could consider responses if the executive branch does not follow the trade legislation provisions, such as withdrawing expedited procedures for implementing legislation for trade agreements reached in WTO negotiations. Implementing legislation for the Chile and Singapore FTA agreements is likely to be submitted to Congress this year, with other bilateral agreements possibly submitted in 2004. The 108th Congress will play a crucial role in the last phase of negotiations for the FTAA and Doha Agenda. The Trade Act of 2002 granted the President Trade Promotion Authority to submit trade agreements to Congress for approval under special procedures. Some Members might participate as observers at negotiating meetings. The U.S.-Singapore FTA negotiations are expected to be completed in late 2002, with the agreement eliminating tariffs on goods, covering trade in services, and protecting intellectual property rights. The FTA is anticipated to be signed in early 2003 and sent to Congress for approval. The agreement includes environmental and labor clauses similar to the U.S.-Jordan FTA. The Bush Administration has negotiated a free trade agreement with Singapore, addressing issues such as textiles, capital flows, and electronic commerce. The agreement includes provisions for intellectual property protection, environment, labor, transparency, customs cooperation, and transshipments. Singapore is a major trading country with a population of 4.4 million. Additionally, the United States and Chile announced negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement in 2000. The United States and Chile negotiated a bilateral free trade agreement that includes duty-free trade for 87% of consumer and industrial goods immediately, with tariffs on farm goods and luxury tax on automobiles to be eliminated within four years. Other provisions cover investment, services trade, dispute resolution, and transparency. Under the Trade Act of 2002, President Bush is required to give Congress a 90-day notice of his intention to sign the agreement with Chile. The Bush Administration also notified Congress of its intent to negotiate a free trade agreement with Morocco in 2002, aiming to promote more tolerant, open, and prosperous Muslim societies while supporting U.S. economic objectives. The Bush Administration notified Congress of its intent to negotiate a free trade agreement with Morocco in 2002, aiming to support U.S. economic objectives. This includes allowing U.S. agricultural products to compete against European products and providing preferences for textile and apparel exports to the United States. Negotiations are scheduled to start in late January and conclude in 2003. Morocco has a population of just over 31 million. Prime Minister John Howard raised the issue of beginning negotiations for a free trade agreement with President Bush. The U.S. had concerns about Australian sanitary and phytosanitary controls hindering agricultural exports. While the U.S. business community supported the negotiations, American agricultural groups were skeptical. Australia is a medium-sized economy that exports wheat, wool, and meat among other items, with a population of 19.5 million. On January 16, 2002, President Bush announced the exploration of a free trade agreement with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) negotiations began in January 2003, with optimism for a year-end agreement. The challenge lies in the five republics reaching a unified position before negotiating with the United States. The Central American countries are currently eligible for benefits under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. An FTA with the United States could further reduce trade barriers, make benefits permanent, and promote U.S. foreign investment. Proponents believe it would support U.S. exports, lower import costs, and advance the Free Trade Area of the Americas. Critics argue that Central America only represents 1% of U.S. trade and the FTA may have a limited impact on the U.S. economy. The United States Trade Representative notified Congress about talks to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) composed of South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland. The agreement aims to integrate smaller states into decision-making and promote economic integration within SACU. Economic integration within SACU is driven by the dominance of South Africa, accounting for 87% of the population and 92% of the GDP. U.S. exports to SACU in 2001 totaled $3.1 billion, while imports from SACU were $4.8 billion. Potential obstacles to an FTA with SACU include competition issues in telecommunications and government procurement, U.S. textile tariffs, and intellectual property rights concerning access to HIV/AIDS medicines. The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) is a regional trade concept involving 34 nations in the Western Hemisphere aiming to reduce trade barriers. Negotiations began in 1998, with a draft agreement adopted in 2001 and a second draft in 2002. The final agreement was scheduled for adoption by January 2005. The negotiating schedule aims for a final agreement by January 2005, with key achievements from the Quito trade ministerial including Brazil and the US co-chairing the TNC, establishment of the HCP, release of the second draft of the FTAA agreement, timeline for market access negotiations, and completion of chair rotations. Upcoming meetings include the TNC in Trinidad and Tobago in April 2003 and the eighth FTAA ministerial in Miami, Florida in the fourth quarter of 2003. Negotiations on agriculture are critical for most members, with a deadline set for January 2005 by the WTO. Brazil and the US face challenges as co-Chairs of the TNC, with differences on issues like steel and agriculture. Complications include economic and social challenges in Latin America, such as the financial crisis in Argentina and political instability in Venezuela and Colombia. The WTO Doha Development Agenda was launched after trade ministers from 142 member countries met in Doha, Qatar to decide on new multilateral trade negotiations. The agenda includes ongoing talks on agriculture and services, industrial tariffs, intellectual property, and issues important to developing countries. The negotiations aim to address challenges in the global trade environment. Trade ministers at Doha agreed to conduct negotiations under the Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) involving all WTO members. The TNC has met four times in 2002 and set deadlines for agreements on agriculture, services, and dispute settlement. Interim decisions will be made at the next ministerial meeting in Cancun in 2003, with a final trade agreement deadline of January 1, 2005. Successful multilateral negotiations are expected to bring significant benefits. The University of Michigan study projected over $600 billion in economic benefits from a one-third reduction of trade barriers. Policymakers are considering bilateral or regional agreements for easier negotiations. Efforts are ongoing in the 108th Congress to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 for export controls on sensitive dual-use goods and technologies. Efforts to renew the Export Administration Act of 1979 have been complicated by tensions between national security and commercial concerns. Some argue that current export controls harm U.S. businesses by imposing cumbersome licensing processes, while others believe the controls are not strong enough to prevent the spread of dual-use technologies to adversaries. Congressional interest in EAA reform has increased due to concerns about the effectiveness of export controls in combating terrorism and unauthorized transfers of sensitive items to restricted nations like China. The Export Administration Act of 1979 has faced challenges in renewal due to conflicting views on national security and commercial interests. Efforts to reauthorize the Act have been ongoing, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. In the 107th Congress, competing versions of the Act emerged, with the Senate passing S. 149 and the House amending H.R. 2581 to grant additional authority to the Department of Defense in blocking license applications and tightening criteria for decontrol of certain items. The Export Administration Act of 1979 has faced challenges in renewal, with conflicting views on national security and commercial interests. In the 107th Congress, the Senate passed S. 149 tightening criteria for decontrol of certain items. Negotiations to reconcile differences between versions of the legislation continued without success. The 108th Congress may address reauthorization and other export control issues. The 108th Congress may address issues such as export controls on high-performance computers, licensing authority for commercial communications satellites, and regulation of \"deemed exports.\" There are disputes with the WTO over U.S. laws violating trade obligations, which could lead to retaliation on U.S. exports. The threat involves a WTO ruling that a U.S. export tax benefit, the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI), is an illegal subsidy. The EU has been granted the right to impose 100% tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. exports to Europe. This could potentially lead to a transatlantic trade war and impact global trade negotiations. Other cases of foreign retaliation against U.S. exports are also possible due to WTO dispute panel rulings. In 1916, private right of action and criminal penalties against dumping, a copyright dispute violating royalty rights of EU musicians, and a trademark dispute involving Cuban rum were discussed. Critics claim WTO rulings infringe on U.S. sovereignty by undermining domestic trade remedy laws. Bush Administration officials are concerned about panel rulings legislating new obligations. Some Members are considering legislation to review WTO decisions, while others may propose changes in the dispute settlement process. Supporters of WTO dispute resolution are also mentioned. Legislation was proposed in the 107th Congress to settle disputes related to the WTO, including the ETI dispute. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas introduced legislation (H.R. 5095) to repeal the ETI and replace it with tax benefits for companies with overseas operations. The EU is urging the United States to amend or repeal the ETI in a WTO-consistent manner. Three bills were introduced to repeal the 1916 Antidumping statute, but none were acted on. The U.S. received extensions from the EU and Japan to comply with the ETI, with the EU warning of resuming retaliation procedures in the WTO if the U.S. fails to act. The EU warned the U.S. to repeal the law or face WTO retaliation. The U.S. paid $3.3 million to the EU for music licensing legislation. Congress allocated $50 million for WTO dispute settlements but hasn't used it. The U.S. violated WTO rules with the Byrd Amendment. The U.S. appealed the WTO panel's decision. The United States may need to comply with WTO rulings on the ETI export subsidy case, which could lead to legislative issues in Congress. Compliance plans may need to be submitted to the WTO by the first half of 2003. The 108th Congress may reconsider legislation to bring the U.S. into compliance with DSB recommendations."
