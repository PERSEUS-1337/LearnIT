    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nurturing Special Kids Act of 2002\". Congress finds that in 2000, there were 70.4 million children under 18 in the US, making up 26% of the population. By 2020, children are expected to comprise 24% of the population. There are 11.4 million infants and toddlers, 12 million preschool-age children in the US. Additionally, children with disabilities are served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Child health often varies by family income, with low-income families facing greater challenges. Children from low-income families are more likely to have disabilities or special needs, with higher rates of activity limitations compared to children from higher-income families. Children under age 5 in low-income families have a higher rate of activity limitations compared to higher-income families. Child care costs can exceed $4,000 per year per child, making it a significant expense for working families. Forty-five percent of mothers with an infant who has a disability or special needs do not work outside the home due to challenges in finding affordable child care. Mothers of children with disabilities struggle to reenter the workforce due to challenges in finding affordable child care. Only a small percentage of eligible children receive assistance through child care programs. Parents using paid child care for children with emotional or behavioral disabilities face difficulties in making child care arrangements. The national shortage of child care options for children with disabilities or special needs has led to parents having to quit or reduce work hours to care for their children's health. In Florida, a survey found that 40% of families have a member who does not work due to caring for a child with disabilities. The shortage of specialized child care for children with disabilities or special needs is a major factor causing parents to quit or reduce work hours. A survey found that 33% of parents had a family member turn down a job, and 20% had a family member work fewer hours to care for a child with special needs. Research shows that early support for these children reduces the need for special education later in life. Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 amended to include activities to improve child care quality for children with disabilities or special needs. The term 'child with a disability or other special needs' is defined as a child eligible for early intervention services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or a child with special health care needs.

The State must assist eligible child care providers in complying with the Disabilities Act of 1990, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by providing training, technical assistance, and resources. Additionally, the State must coordinate training and services for children with disabilities or special needs. The State must provide training, technical assistance, and resources to child care providers to comply with disability laws. Coordination of services for children with disabilities or special needs is also required. SEC. 5. Grants and loans for certain child care programs are amended under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. The section defines a child with a disability or special needs and an inclusive child care program. It also mentions grants and loans for projects that increase inclusive child care programs.
