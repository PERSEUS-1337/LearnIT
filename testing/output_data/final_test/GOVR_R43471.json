    "content": "Although SSDI and UI provide income support to eligible individuals, they serve separate populations. SSDI offers long-term benefits to disabled individuals who worked in jobs covered by Social Security, while UI provides temporary benefits to involuntarily unemployed workers. Some proposals in Congress aim to prevent or reduce concurrent receipt of SSDI and UI benefits, with proponents arguing it is \"double dipping\" and opponents stating it is consistent under the law. The report discusses SSDI and UI benefits, concurrent eligibility, legislative proposals in Congress, and potential implementation issues. SSDI, part of the OASDI program, provides long-term benefits to disabled individuals, while UI offers temporary benefits to the involuntarily unemployed. Some proposals aim to prevent concurrent receipt of both benefits, citing it as \"double dipping.\" SSDI is a social insurance program that provides benefits to insured workers under the full retirement age who meet the statutory test of disability. In June 2015, 10.9 million individuals received SSDI benefits, including disabled workers, spouses, and children of disabled workers. To qualify for SSDI, workers must be insured and statutorily disabled. To qualify for SSDI benefits, individuals must have worked in covered employment for a quarter of their adult lives before becoming disabled and for at least 5 of the past 10 years immediately before the onset of disability. Younger workers may qualify with less work experience based on their age. In 2014, SSDI provided disability insurance to over 151 million workers. To meet the disability criteria, an insured worker must be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable impairment expected to last at least one year. The SGA earnings limit in 2015 is $1,090 per month for most workers and $1,820 per month for statutorily blind individuals. Disability determinations involve a five-step evaluation process considering medical records, age, education, and work experience. To qualify for SSDI benefits, individuals must have a severe impairment that prevents them from substantial work. Cash benefits start five months after disability onset, based on career-average earnings. Benefits are adjusted for inflation and may be offset by other disability benefits. In June 2015, average monthly benefits were $1,165 for disabled workers. In FY2014, SSDI paid out $141 billion in benefits. In FY2014, SSDI paid out $141 billion in benefits to disabled workers and their dependents. Disabled workers are eligible for Medicare after 24 months of entitlement to cash benefits. Medicare spending per disabled beneficiary averaged about $9,900 in 2012. Social Security (OASDI) is financed through two trust funds, including the Federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund. The Federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund finances benefits for disabled workers and their dependents, while the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund pays for benefits of retired workers, dependents, and survivors of deceased workers. Trust funds are separate accounts in the U.S. Treasury and cannot borrow from each other. Income for the trust funds mainly comes from payroll and self-employment taxes under FICA and SECA. FICA taxes are split between employees and employers, while SECA taxes are paid fully by self-employed individuals. The FICA tax rate is 6.2% for employees and employers each, with 0.9% going to the DI trust fund and 5.3% to the OASI trust fund. The Social Security payroll taxes are allocated to the DI trust fund and the OASI trust fund. Net payroll tax revenues credited to the DI trust fund totaled $109 billion in FY2014. The trust funds also receive income from the taxation of Social Security benefits, interest earned on assets, and reimbursements from the General Fund of the Treasury. All trust fund balances are invested in U.S. government bonds. The DI trust fund is projected to be depleted in 2016, with only 81% of scheduled SSDI benefits being payable. Unemployment Insurance (UI) provides temporary income support to eligible workers who lose their jobs. The UC program, authorized under Title III of the Social Security Act, offers partial wage replacement for up to 26 weeks. Federal laws and regulations outline UC benefit coverage and eligibility criteria. The Unemployment Insurance (UI) program offers temporary income support to eligible workers who lose their jobs. Each state determines the specifics of UC benefits, resulting in essentially 53 different programs. UC benefits may be extended through the Extended Benefit (EB) program at the state level, providing up to an additional 13 or 20 weeks of benefits after regular unemployment benefits are exhausted. The temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program, which expired in 2013, provided additional benefits of up to 47 weeks depending on state economic conditions. Eligibility for UC is based on qualified wages and employment in covered industries. To be eligible for Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits, workers must have earned a certain amount of wages and worked for a specific period in the 12-month base period prior to unemployment. States have varying methods to determine monetary eligibility. Workers must have lost their job through no fault of their own, be actively seeking work, and be available to maintain eligibility. UC benefits are based on wages earned during the base period, with most states replacing about half of the claimant's average weekly wage up to a maximum amount. Some earnings during unemployment are disregarded to encourage short-term or part-time work while searching for a permanent position. The Unemployment Insurance (UI) program provides short-term benefits to workers who have lost their job through no fault of their own. The weekly benefit amount is based on wages earned during the base period, with most states replacing about half of the claimant's average weekly wage up to a maximum amount. States spent $36 billion on regular UC benefits in FY2014, funded by federal and state payroll taxes. The program encourages part-time work while searching for a permanent position. In FY2014, $5.5 billion in FUTA taxes and $47 billion in SUTA taxes were collected. State tax rates are based on experience rating, with higher UC benefits leading to higher employer tax rates. The EB program is funded equally by the federal government and states. The EB program is funded 50% by the federal government and 50% by the states, with temporary 100% federal funding through December 31, 2013. Individuals eligible for both SSDI and UI benefits must meet specific criteria. Disability-insured workers must have a severe impairment preventing them from earning above the SGA limit, while unemployed workers must be actively seeking work to be eligible for UI. Individuals who are statutorily disabled under federal law but meet state UC earnings thresholds may be eligible for benefits. Individuals eligible for both SSDI and UI benefits may receive them concurrently if they meet specific criteria. While federal law does not prohibit this, states have the discretion to deny or reduce UI benefits for those receiving SSDI. For example, Wisconsin prohibits concurrent receipt, while Minnesota offsets UI benefits for certain individuals with SSDI. Disabled-worker beneficiaries may be affected by these state regulations. Disabled-worker beneficiaries may be eligible for both SSDI and UI benefits concurrently, subject to state regulations. An individual receiving UI may qualify for SSDI benefits before or after their UI benefits start, as long as they meet eligibility criteria. The receipt of unemployment benefits does not necessarily impact credibility for disability benefits. Eligibility for disability benefits requires the inability to sustain full-time work, while availability for some work is sufficient for unemployment benefits under Oregon law. Under Oregon law, individuals can claim both unemployment benefits and disability benefits under the Social Security Act concurrently. This strategy allows them to maintain income support during the waiting period for SSDI benefits. SSDI beneficiaries with earnings below the SGA limit who are involuntarily terminated from their employment may be eligible for UI benefits if they meet state-specific earnings thresholds. This situation typically involves individuals with limited capacity to work, often in part-time roles. SSDI beneficiaries with limited capacity for work, often in part-time roles, may be eligible for UI benefits if they cannot sustain full-time work activities and have earnings below the SGA threshold. Less than 15% of SSDI beneficiaries had any annual earnings from paid employment in 2013. SSDI beneficiaries can be eligible for UI based on monthly earnings above the SGA limit if they participated in an approved work incentive like a trial work period (TWP). During the TWP, beneficiaries can earn any amount for up to 9 months within a 60-month rolling period without having their benefits reduced. After the TWP, beneficiaries enter a 36-month re-entitlement period called the extended period of eligibility (EPE), where benefits can be reinstated for months with work activity below the SGA threshold. In July 2012, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on overlapping SSDI and UI benefits. GAO found that in FY2010, 117,000 individuals received more than $850 million in concurrent benefit payments from the SSDI and UI programs. These individuals represented about 1% of the beneficiaries in each program, with cash payments totaling more than $281 million from SSDI and more than $575 million from UI. The GAO found that some individuals received earnings while receiving both SSDI and UI benefits, indicating possible improper payments. However, the SSA stated that their review of selected cases showed no improper payments due to concurrent receipt of benefits. The SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary estimates that in 2015, about 0.34% of disabled-worker beneficiaries received both SSDI and UI benefits concurrently. This amounted to approximately 30,000 individuals in June 2015. Additionally, an average of about 25,000 individuals were in the five-month waiting period for SSDI benefits while receiving UI benefits. The number of concurrent or near-concurrent recipients is projected to decrease in the future. The decrease in concurrent SSDI and UI recipients is mainly due to the improving economy post-recession. Stronger economy leads to more job opportunities for individuals with disabilities, reducing the need for long-term support like SSDI. As the economy recovers, fewer individuals with disabilities will apply for both UI and SSDI benefits. The declining number of concurrent beneficiaries of UI and SSDI is attributed to the improving economy post-recession. Workers with disabilities gradually reduce employment as their capacity to work declines, leading to a delay in transitioning to SSDI after a job loss. Most SSDI applicants do not receive UI benefits, as they generally do not qualify if they voluntarily quit their job. During normal economic conditions, the potential overlapping period of entitlement to both UI and SSDI is short, typically up to 26 weeks. However, during adverse economic conditions like a recession, the duration of UI benefits is extended, creating a longer potential overlapping period. With the expiration of UI extensions, the maximum duration of UI benefits has declined, reducing the potential overlapping period. The reduction in the potential overlapping period of entitlement to both UI and SSDI benefits has been influenced by states shortening the maximum duration of regular UC to 20 weeks or less. Proponents argue that receiving both benefits is duplicative and akin to \"double dipping,\" as both programs are meant to replace lost earnings. The GAO's 2012 report highlighted the issue of concurrent cash benefit payments being redundant for individuals eligible for both programs. Opponents argue that concurrent receipt of SSDI and UI benefits is consistent, while proponents suggest legislation to require offsetting DI benefits for any UI benefits received. They view receiving both benefits as contradictory, labeling it a \"loophole\" that may reduce SSDI benefits for disabled workers. Opponents argue that denying or offsetting SSDI benefits for individuals receiving UI discourages disabled-worker beneficiaries from returning to work. They believe it is unfair to discriminate against individuals with disabilities who have paid into both programs and meet eligibility requirements. Opponents argue that proposals in the 114th Congress aim to deny or limit overlapping SSDI and UI benefits, with approaches including treating UI payments as engaging in SGA for SSDI eligibility, suspending SSDI benefits for months with UI payments, or reducing SSDI benefits dollar for dollar by the amount of UI payments. The 2012 GAO report estimated the average quarterly amount of overlapping benefits to be about $3,300. The President's FY2016 budget proposes reducing SSDI benefits dollar for dollar by the amount of UI payments, resulting in savings to the SSDI program. Some individuals may choose to forgo UI payments to maintain receipt of SSDI benefits, leading to savings for the UI programs as well. These proposals are projected to increase spending on means-tested programs like SSI and decrease revenues from the taxation of benefits. Similar proposals were introduced in the 113th Congress. H.R. 918 and S. 499, titled the Social Security Disability Insurance and Unemployment Benefits Double Dip Elimination Act, were introduced to amend the Social Security Act regarding UI benefits affecting SSDI eligibility for applicants after January 1, 2016. This change would impact disabled workers differently, potentially preventing some from meeting SSDI eligibility criteria. The eligibility criteria for SSDI benefits require a five-month waiting period for cash benefits to begin. Claimants receiving UI benefits under H.R. 918 and S. 499 may not meet the definition of disability, delaying entitlement to SSDI for disabled workers. Months of UI receipt would not count towards the waiting period, potentially affecting SSDI eligibility for applicants after January 1, 2016. The TWP allows disabled-worker beneficiaries to test their ability to work without losing benefits. UI receipt would be deemed as \"services rendered\" and count towards the TWP, potentially causing some beneficiaries to exit sooner. Receiving UI payment after the 36-month EPE would result in termination from the SSDI program. The bill H.R. 918 would reduce Social Security benefit payments by $5.7 billion and UI payments by $1.2 billion over 2015-2024. S. 343, the Reducing Overlapping Payments Act, aims to suspend SSDI benefits if a disabled-worker beneficiary receives UI payments. The Reducing Overlapping Payments Act aims to suspend SSDI benefits if a disabled-worker beneficiary receives UI payments. OACT estimated that implementing a similar bill in 2014 would have reduced SSDI benefit payments by $2.9 billion and UI payments by $2.0 billion over 2014-2023. The President's FY2016 budget proposes offsetting SSDI benefits dollar for dollar for any month UI payments are received, potentially reducing SSDI outlays by $1.65 billion for FY2016-FY2025. The proposal aims to reduce SSDI payments by $1.65 billion for FY2016 through FY2025 and UI outlays by $0.51 billion over the same period. The Social Security Act requires SSDI payments to be reduced if combined disability benefits exceed 80% of the worker's average earnings. Administering the WC/PDB offset has been challenging for SSA, with criticism from GAO and SSA's Office of the Inspector General. One potential difficulty in implementing proposals to reduce SSDI payments is the increased complexity of administering SSDI, leading to improper payments. Improper payments include overpayments and underpayments due to errors, waste, fraud, and abuse. Improper payments, including overpayments and underpayments, can result from errors, waste, fraud, and abuse. The complexity of programs with intricate payment criteria increases the risk of improper payments. Factors contributing to overpayments in cases like the WC offset include verification errors, inaccurate payment data, and miscalculations. Failure to verify receipt of UI for SSDI applicants and beneficiaries could lead to improper payments under proposed changes. In FY2013, errors related to non-verification of other income accounted for 26% of improper payments in the Social Security program. The dollar-for-dollar offset proposal would complicate administrating SSDI by requiring verification and determination of UI payments for each month of concurrent entitlement, potentially leading to underpayments or overpayments due to data reliability issues or benefit miscalculations. In FY2013, errors related to non-verification of other income accounted for 26% of improper payments in the Social Security program. The SSA's reliance on individuals to report their WC benefits has led to significant payment errors in the DI program. Limited access to necessary data from states, local governments, and private insurers has hindered efforts to verify WC payment data independently. To reduce improper payments, SSA needs a reliable method to verify state UI payment information for SSDI applicants and beneficiaries. The SSA needs a reliable method to verify state UI payment information for SSDI applicants and beneficiaries by matching administrative data with UI payment information from the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), a database administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This database is used to assist state child support agencies in locating noncustodial parents and enforcing child support orders. Access to the NDNH database is restricted to authorized persons under federal law. The SSA needs to access NDNH data to verify UI payment information for SSDI recipients. Current agreement with OCSE allows limited access, but a new agreement may be needed to verify UI for all SSDI beneficiaries. The lag between UI and SSDI benefit payments poses a challenge for accurate verification. The lag between UI and SSDI benefit payments may lead to improper SSA payments. One solution is for states to submit UI data monthly. Accuracy issues in NDNH data may also impact SSA's ability to verify beneficiary information. Incomplete data reporting led to SSA staff spending more time verifying names and SSNs, affecting other administrative tasks. While non-verifiable records didn't affect SSA's ability to detect improper payments in the SSI program, resources used for verification could reduce potential savings from proposals limiting concurrent receipt. Some states already reduce UI benefits for individuals receiving SSDI benefits, potentially leading to a \"double offset\" if proposals in the report are enacted. Lawmakers reestablished the WC offset in 1965, creating exceptions for states that reduce WC benefits for individuals receiving SSDI. SSA recognizes reverse offset plans in 17 states to prevent dual-eligible individuals from having benefits denied or reduced. A similar reverse offset provision could be created for SSDI and UI recipients to avoid benefit reductions. A reverse offset provision could be established for SSDI and UI recipients, similar to the one for WC/PDB, allowing states to deny or reduce UI benefits for individuals receiving SSDI. GAO recommended revoking the provision that allows states to reduce WC benefits for SSDI recipients due to reduced offset savings to the DI trust fund and inequities in benefits for disabled workers. The GAO report highlighted inequities in benefits for disabled workers due to the reverse offset provision, leading Congress to limit it in 1981. Implementing a reverse UI offset for SSDI recipients could have similar issues as the reverse WC offset, potentially reducing savings to the DI trust fund. This would essentially use federal dollars meant for the DI trust fund to subsidize state accounts in the UTF. The reverse UI offset for SSDI recipients could redirect federal dollars from the DI trust fund to state accounts in the UTF. This may create variations in benefits across states for dual-eligible individuals, depending on whether states choose to offset UI benefits for SSDI recipients. To ensure uniformity in reverse UI offset criteria for dual-eligible individuals, SSA could require states to adhere to pre-established criteria as a condition for plan approval. Variation in after-tax income across states could result from differences in how UI and SSDI benefits are treated for federal income tax purposes. The taxation of Social Security benefits depends on provisional income thresholds. Around half of beneficiaries pay tax on benefits, with SSDI recipients less likely to be taxed due to lower income. Concurrent SSDI and UI recipients are subject to federal income tax on their benefits. If states implement approved reverse offset plans, dual-eligible individuals may face federal taxation on only one type of benefit or a reduced amount of combined benefits. This could lead to varying federal income tax amounts for similar dual-eligible individuals nationwide. One solution could be to standardize federal tax treatment for affected dual-eligible individuals, similar to the provision for Social Security benefits in 1983."
