    "content": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a Department of Defense agency with military and civilian responsibilities. The Corps provides engineering, construction, and environmental management services for Department of Defense agencies. It also plans, constructs, operates, and maintains water resources projects under its civil works program. The Corps operates as a military organization with a civilian workforce and is overseen by a military Chief of Engineers. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil responsibilities include creating navigable channels and flood control projects, which involve river deepening, channel widening, lock expansion, dam operations, and dredged material disposal. These projects serve multiple purposes such as water supply, recreation, and hydropower. In recent years, the Corps has taken on additional tasks like environmental restoration, infrastructure development, disaster relief, and remediation of nuclear sites. Environmental restoration activities focus on wetlands restoration and mitigation for Corps facilities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for creating navigable channels, flood control projects, and environmental infrastructure like municipal water facilities. They issue permits for private actions affecting wetlands and waters of the United States. The Corps follows a two-phase planning process to determine federal investment in water resources projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires congressional authority to initiate water resource development projects. This involves study authorization and appropriations, typically through a resolution or a Water Resources Development Act. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts studies authorized by survey resolutions to guide decisions on construction projects. Non-federal entities like state or local agencies can join as sponsors. The Chief of Engineers may approve a project based on the Chief's Report, which Congress uses to authorize projects. Federal funds for construction are sought through annual appropriations acts. Funds for project construction can be sought through Energy and Water Development Appropriations bills. Cost-sharing for Corps projects has been debated for decades, with WRDA 1986 increasing local cost-share requirements. Reconnaissance studies are a federal expense, while local sponsors pay 50% for feasibility studies. The division of federal and non-federal financial responsibilities for construction and O&M varies by project purpose. In most cases, cost-sharing for pre-construction planning and engineering is determined using construction requirements. Federal funding for water resources development projects has declined over the years, with the Corps' construction account funding dropping significantly. The agency's civil works budget has also decreased, leading to contentious issues over funding for the civil works program. The Corps' civil works program funding has been a contentious issue between the Administration and Congress, with final appropriations typically exceeding requests. The Corps has strong congressional support due to water resource benefits and its historical evolution into civil and military building. In the 19th Century, Congress directed the Corps to engage in flood control for the lower Mississippi River, leading to the modern era of federal flood control with the Flood Control Act of 1936. The Corps' involvement in flood control expanded in the 1920s with the incorporation of hydropower into projects. The Flood Control Acts of 1944 and 1950 increased the agency's role in multi-purpose projects and emergency operations. The Water Supply Act of 1958 allowed the Corps to include storage for water supply in reservoir projects at local cost. Construction of major water works declined in the late 1960s due to changing priorities, costs, and completed projects. In the 1970s, Congress authorized no major water projects and passed laws to protect the environment, requiring the Corps to consider environmental impacts and consult with other federal agencies. Executive orders aimed to reduce flood losses and environmental damage by recognizing the value of wetlands. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986 transformed Corps water project planning and funding, giving more control to local stakeholders. Subsequent WRDAs in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1996, 1999, and 2000 continued to shape Corps' responsibilities, including environmental protection and contamination cleanup. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1992 and 1996 expanded the Corps' authority for environmental restoration projects, including the use of dredged material for habitat creation. WRDA 2000 approved a multi-billion dollar restoration program for the Florida Everglades, marking a significant shift in the Corps' environmental responsibilities."
