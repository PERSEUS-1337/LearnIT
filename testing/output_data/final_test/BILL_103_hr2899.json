    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Violent and Repeat Offender Accountability Act of 1993\". The Congress acknowledges the Federal Government's role in assisting States with reducing violent crime, recognizes the effectiveness of Federal legislation like RICO and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, emphasizes that most violent crimes fall under State and local jurisdiction, highlights the significant increase in violent crimes nationwide, and notes the ongoing challenges despite State and local efforts. The increased Federal role in combating violent crime is due to the lack of effective tools for State and local governments to prosecute offenders. A more uniform and punitive sentencing system for violent criminals could reduce the need for direct Federal involvement in criminal matters. The Act aims to reduce Federal involvement in criminal matters traditionally handled by State and local governments by encouraging each State to adopt more effective sentencing systems to combat violent crime. The United States Sentencing Guidelines have been effective in achieving a uniform and punitive criminal sentencing system at the Federal level. Each State is required to analyze its sentencing system to combat violent crime more effectively. The Act aims to reduce Federal involvement in criminal matters by encouraging States to create more effective sentencing systems for violent offenders and provide funding for necessary changes, including increasing correctional facility capacity. The Act defines \"State\" as any State of the United States and establishes State sentencing reviews. Each State must review its criminal sentencing laws to be eligible for funds under this Act. Within one year of enactment, each State must submit a report to the Attorney General detailing its sentencing system, including analysis of statutory schemes for various offenses. This analysis should cover minimum and maximum sentences for each offense and the basis for distinguishing between different degrees of the same offense. The curr_chunk discusses factors to consider in sentencing, analysis of sentences imposed, time served for convictions, and practices related to probation and parole. The curr_chunk provides an analysis of various aspects of State sentencing systems, including restitution orders, pretrial detention of dangerous offenders, victims' rights, and post-conviction relief procedures. The curr_chunk analyzes State law on adult sentencing for juvenile offenders and State prison capacity constraints on sentencing and release decisions. The curr_chunk focuses on State sentencing systems. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for State sentencing systems under the Act, including the need for a plan evaluating the criminal sentencing system and creating a system that complies with the Act's requirements. States must also report any changes to their sentencing system to the Attorney General, including provisions for pretrial detention of dangerous criminals and mandatory minimum prison sentences for violent offenders. The curr_chunk outlines the sentencing guidelines for violent offenders, including mandatory life sentences for third or subsequent convictions of violent crimes, truth in sentencing provisions limiting early release, and state provisions guaranteeing victims' rights. The curr_chunk emphasizes the guarantee of victims' rights, including being informed, present, and heard in all critical stages of the criminal case, as well as provisions for restitution enforcement in cases involving economic loss.
