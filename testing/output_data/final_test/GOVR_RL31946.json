    "content": "The report focuses on the potential implications of the Iraq war on defense programs of interest to Congress for FY2004 and subsequent fiscal years. It does not cover broader defense policy issues or post-war efforts in Iraq. The report on the Iraq war's implications for defense programs does not make recommendations like traditional \"lessons learned\" reports. It notes that information is incomplete and subject to change, with many details of the war still unknown. The report on the Iraq war acknowledges that information is incomplete and subject to change, with many details still unknown. It cautions against overlearning lessons from the war, as each conflict is unique and early information may be inaccurate. The report on the Iraq war cautions against overlearning lessons from the conflict, as each war is unique and details may change. Lessons from one conflict may not necessarily apply to the next due to various factors that can differ between wars. The Iraq war report warns against overlearning lessons from the conflict, as each war is unique and details may vary. Observers from other countries also derive lessons from U.S. military operations, which can be used by potential adversaries to improve their ability to counter U.S. forces in future conflicts. For example, Serbia learned from the 1991 Persian Gulf war on how to counter U.S. air power, applying these lessons successfully in Kosovo in 1999. Lessons from U.S. military operations can be devalued by potential adversaries who learn from them. It is important to consider the motives of sources offering lessons from wars, as they may have a stake in influencing policy decisions. The report discusses defense program issues affected by the Iraq war, with a focus on the administration's vision for defense transformation. Observers saw the conflict as a test of the military's ability to adapt to new technologies and security threats. The Iraq war validated the U.S. military's vision for defense transformation, strengthening Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's authority. This could lead to increased defense spending on transformational programs, impacting Congress. The Administration may shift towards defense programs judged as transformational, impacting revenues and employment. The theme of transformation could be used to justify legislative proposals affecting DoD, potentially changing Congress' oversight role. An example is the \"Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act,\" allowing DoD to set its own policies for civil service employees. The Administration's Transformation Vision for DoD focuses on shifting military planning towards speed, agility, precision firepower, information technology, joint operations, and effects-based warfare. This vision aims to move away from massed forces, sheer firepower, and attrition-style warfare. The Administration's transformation vision for the Department of Defense emphasizes shifting military planning towards speed, agility, precision firepower, information technology, joint operations, and effects-based warfare. This approach aims to apply military power more rapidly and flexibly, outpace enemy decision-making, counter asymmetric threats, and achieve combat goals with fewer forces and lower costs. Additionally, the vision includes proposals for streamlining business practices to accelerate the fielding of new weapons and generate savings for investment. Advocates of defense programs debate whether they are transformational or legacy, with transformational programs aligning with the administration's vision. Key areas include precision-guided weapons, mobile Army forces, special operations, unmanned vehicles, Navy ships, space systems, missile defense, counterterrorism forces, and integrated C4ISR systems. Defense programs are categorized as transformational or legacy based on their alignment with the administration's vision. Transformational programs include precision-guided weapons, mobile Army forces, special operations, unmanned vehicles, Navy ships, space systems, missile defense, counterterrorism forces, and integrated C4ISR systems. The Administration prioritized transformational programs in its defense budget, investing over $24 billion in acquisition funding for these programs. Some argue that the administration focuses too much on legacy programs and not enough on transformational programs in its defense budget plans. This includes concerns about funding for manned tactical aircraft over upgrading or replacing long-range bombers and acquiring unmanned vehicles. The conflict in Iraq tested elements of the administration's transformation vision, such as reliance on precision-guided weapons, special operations forces, unmanned vehicles, and advanced C4ISR systems. The Iraq war tested the Administration's transformation vision with the use of advanced C4ISR systems, reduced reliance on ground forces, and an effects-based war plan shaped by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. Supporters argue that the quick victory with low casualties validated the use of precision-guided air-delivered weapons. The Iraq war featured successful use of precision-guided air-delivered weapons, special operations forces, unmanned vehicles, joint operations, and advanced C4ISR systems. The strategy focused on effects-based operations against key leadership and command-and-control targets, reducing the need for large ground forces. Turkey's refusal to allow the Army's 4th Infantry Division to invade from the north and the decision to start the war before the division could be redeployed to Kuwait led to a smaller invasion force. The speed and precision of the U.S.-led war effort limited Iraq's ability to coordinate effectively. The U.S.-led war effort significantly reduced Iraq's ability to mount a coordinated response, leading to scattered and ineffective Iraqi defensive efforts. Lighter and more air-mobile Army forces would have been useful for establishing a more significant U.S. ground presence in northern Iraq. Critics argue that the military force used in the war was largely a result of decisions made prior to the Bush administration, only partially incorporating the transformation plan. The administration's transformation plan for a fully transformed force included more unmanned vehicles, a completely networked C4ISR environment, and lighter, more mobile Army forces. The war in Iraq did not provide a pure test of this vision due to the ineptitude of Iraq's military in mounting a defense. It is unclear if the war truly tested the Administration's transformation plan, as a more traditional U.S.-led war effort or a different transformation plan might have also succeeded. The invasion force in the Iraq war was larger than initially proposed, which introduced greater risk into the war plan. Heavy armored ground forces, not part of the Administration's transformation plan, proved valuable in breaking through Iraqi defenses and urban combat operations. The heavy armored ground forces used in the Iraq war were effective in breaking through Iraqi defenses and urban combat operations. They were invulnerable to light arms and helped uncover hidden Iraqi fighters. The war did not provide a major test for certain elements of the Administration's transformation plan, as Iraqi military capabilities were limited. The Iraq war did not significantly test the Administration's programs for transforming U.S. naval forces due to limited naval capabilities. A potential intermediate view acknowledges the success of the war effort but notes that the U.S. force used was only a partial fulfillment of the transformation plan. Iraqi military ineptness played a significant role, and the war may offer mixed evidence on the Administration's plan for transforming Army forces. Other elements of the Administration's transformation plans were not significantly tested. The Iraq war may have not fully validated the Administration's transformation vision, leading to potential implications for asymmetric military threats. The war showcased the capabilities of U.S. military forces, potentially prompting other countries to focus on developing asymmetric means to counter the United States. This could include terrorism, nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, cyberwarfare, and anti-access/area-denial weapons. The success of the U.S.-led war effort may strengthen the need for U.S. defense transformation to focus on countering asymmetric threats. Concerns were raised about the size of U.S. military forces before the Iraq war, with some arguing they were insufficient for the administration's strategy. The administration's military strategy, known as the 1-4-2-1 strategy, aimed to maintain sufficient forces for national security. The 1-4-2-1 military strategy aims to maintain U.S. forces for protecting the domestic population, allies, and friends, swiftly defeating attacks in two theaters, and decisively defeating adversaries in major combat operations. Prior to the Iraq war, concerns were raised about the size of U.S. forces and their ability to carry out the 1-4-2-1 military strategy. Observers pointed to operational tempo, reserve forces activated since 9/11, gaps in Navy ship deployments, and the relationship of active air wings, divisions, and ships to potential requirements for fighting two regional wars. Some observers raised concerns about the potential strain on U.S. forces if they had to fight two regional wars simultaneously. They worried that engaging in a war with Iraq could deplete resources needed for the global war on terrorism or for deterring aggression from North Korea. Specific forces at risk of being in short supply included special operations forces, certain aircraft types, infantry vehicles, combat-support troops, and Army support gear. These concerns persisted as the Iraq war commenced. The duties of active-duty U.S. forces included war-on-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere, regional-deterrence operations, and homeland-defense operations. The Army deployed several divisions and independent combat units to Iraq and Afghanistan, stationed divisions in Germany and Korea. The Air Force had a high percentage of cargo aircraft in use. The Air Force deployed a high percentage of cargo aircraft, tankers, and specialized aircraft to Iraq. The Marine Corps had 67% of its operating forces in Iraq and elsewhere, with 80% forward-deployed or stationed. The Navy also had active operations at sea. The Navy deployed a significant portion of its ships, including aircraft carriers and amphibious ships. Admiral William Fallon noted the strain on Navy resources due to increased deployments. Special Operations Forces were heavily committed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations. Military Sealift Command's ships also supported the Iraq war. During the Iraq war, Navy ships, including aircraft carriers and amphibious ships, were deployed. Special Operations Forces were heavily involved in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military Sealift Command's ships also supported the war. Supporters argue that U.S. military forces were able to augment their presence in Korea and the Western Pacific during the conflict. Marine and Army forces were available for potential conflicts in Korea. The U.S. military forces, including the 1st Cavalry Division in Texas, the 2nd Infantry Division in Washington, and the 10th Mountain Division in New York, along with independent combat units, achieved a quick and cost-effective victory in the Iraq war. Future conflicts may require fewer U.S. forces due to technological advancements. Post-war peacekeeping needs in Iraq can be partially met by allied forces. Skeptics argue that the U.S. military may not be adequately sized to execute the 1-4-2-1 strategy due to reduced capabilities after the Iraq war. Transporting ground forces to Korea quickly could be challenging, given the heavy commitment of assets to Iraq. Future adversaries may not be as inept as Iraq, posing potential challenges for U.S. forces. The Iraq war may lead to larger U.S. forces needed for future regional conflicts. The Air Force had to make exceptions to meet overseas demands, resulting in longer deployments for some personnel. The post-war demand includes maintaining tens of thousands of Army soldiers in Iraq for peacekeeping, adding to existing demands in Afghanistan and other locations. The Iraq war may lead to increased need for U.S. forces in future conflicts, with potential use of reserve forces for extended periods. The strategy aims to win two major regional conflicts that occur in overlapping time frames, not simultaneously. The strategy aims to win two major regional conflicts that occur in overlapping time frames, not simultaneously. The assumption is that certain U.S. forces needed in the early stages of a conflict can be rotated from the first conflict to the second. If this assumption is incorrect, the ability to prosecute the second conflict successfully could be reduced. The Iraq war and the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula provide a potential case study for reviewing planning assumptions and risks. The Iraq war highlighted the uncertainty of U.S. access to foreign bases during conflicts, leading to restrictions on their use. In Afghanistan, limited air bases were available, with operations conducted discreetly and mainly at night due to restrictions. Sea-based forces, including carrier-based Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, played a significant role in U.S. military operations in Afghanistan due to limited air bases and operations conducted mainly at night. In the Iraq war, Turkey's denial of U.S. ground forces and aircraft the use of bases forced significant alterations to the war plan, leading to the redeployment of the Army's 4th Infantry Division to Kuwait. The 4th Infantry Division was redeployed to Kuwait, resulting in a smaller U.S. ground presence in northern Iraq. This included a few hundred U.S. special operations forces and 2,000 personnel from the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade. Turkey's refusal to allow its air bases for U.S. aircraft complicated air operations during the war. The reduction of Navy aircraft flying into Iraq from carriers in the Eastern Mediterranean was due to Air Force tankers needing to refuel from distant bases in Eastern Europe. U.S. war plans were further complicated by Saudi Arabia and Jordan's unwillingness to allow their bases and territory to be used by U.S. forces. There was uncertainty about Saudi Arabia's cooperation leading up to the war. During the war, uncertainty surrounded Saudi Arabia's cooperation with the United States, leading to the construction of a substitute air operations command center in Qatar. Closure of certain flight paths over Turkey and Saudi Arabia for Navy Tomahawk cruise missiles complicated U.S. planning for subsequent attacks. Analysts suggest restructuring defense programs to address uncertainties about access to foreign bases. Analysts suggest restructuring U.S. defense programs to focus on forces less dependent on foreign bases, such as aircraft with long ranges and sea-based forces. This includes aircraft that can operate from distant bases, sea-based forces like the Navy and Marine Corps, and long-range weapons like cruise missiles and directed-energy weapons. Advocates of long-range aircraft and naval forces emphasize their independence from land bases. The concept of sea basing, or enhanced networked sea basing, involves launching military operations directly from ships at sea. Navy and Marine Corps officials began discussing this approach around the time of the war in Afghanistan. The sea basing concept, proposed by Navy and Marine Corps officials, could be expanded into a joint concept involving Army or Air Force units staged from bases at sea. DoD officials have shown interest in restructuring U.S. forces according to this concept, which could impact ship, aircraft, and weapon acquisition programs. Some argue that overseas base access concerns have been exaggerated, citing successful operations in Iraq and Afghanistan where sufficient base access was secured, including capturing air bases in both countries. In the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Iraq allowed the U.S.-led coalition to build up forces without challenge. In the Iraq war, Iraq once again allowed U.S. and British forces to build up forces. Observers argue that the base-access issue has been exaggerated and that DoD should maintain its current mix of long- and short-range capabilities. A significant defense-program debate going into the Iraq war was influenced by the war. The debate going into the Iraq war concerns the future size and composition of the active-duty Army, including the number of divisions, upgrading of tanks, and shifting to a mix of combat forces. The Army's Transformation Plan aims to maintain 10 active-duty divisions but change the composition towards a more mobile combat force. The Army's Transformation Plan aims to keep 10 active-duty divisions but shift towards a mix with fewer heavily armored units like the M1 Abrams tank and more mobile combat units. This plan was prompted by the Army's need to rapidly deploy ground combat forces to distant conflicts, highlighted by past events such as the 1999 operation in Kosovo and the Army's response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The Army's Transformation Plan involves creating 6 new mobile combat brigades known as Stryker Brigades, built around the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle. These brigades will serve as the core of the Army's \"Interim\" transformation force. The next step is to develop more technologically advanced combat units based on the Future Combat System (FCS) for eventual succession to the Stryker Brigades. The Army's Transformation Plan involves creating new combat brigades like the Stryker Brigades and the Future Combat System (FCS) units. The FCS-equipped unit is set to enter service in FY2008, forming the Army's longer-term \"Objective\" transformation force. Funding has been reduced for programs related to the current \"Legacy\" force to support the Interim and Objective forces. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is reportedly dissatisfied with the Army's transformation efforts, considering them not aggressive enough and rumored to be interested in reducing the total number of Army active-duty divisions. OSD expressed interest in reducing the number of Army active-duty divisions from 10 to 8 and Stryker Brigades from 6 to 4 to allocate more funding for the Objective force. Tension between OSD and Army's senior leadership over the future size and composition of the active-duty Army has been reported. Some believe OSD's preference for air power over ground power influences their views on Army transformation efforts. The tepid support for the Army's transformation plan initiated in 1999 during the Clinton Administration has sparked significant debate among military analysts. Supporters argue that maintaining 10 active-duty divisions is necessary for carrying out the national military strategy, while opponents question this figure. Some opponents argue that a 10-division force may be insufficient for the Army's duties, citing the high operational tempo and need to mobilize reserve personnel since 9/11. Others, including officials within OSD, suggest that advances in technology and changes in doctrine could allow for a reduction to as few as 6 active-duty divisions. Supporters of the Army's plan to shift to lighter forces argue that it will increase mobility and responsiveness. They believe Stryker vehicles can be easily transported by Air Force airlift aircraft, providing superior situational awareness and agility in combat. They argue that lighter vehicles are more effective in maneuvering through difficult terrain and urban areas. Opponents of the Army's plan for lighter forces question the survivability of vehicles like the Stryker in combat. They doubt the technical feasibility of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) to be both highly mobile and offer protection against enemy fire. Army operations in the Iraq War involved active-duty Army, Marine Corps, and British combat units. During the Iraq war, Army units, Marine Corps, and British combat units played a central role. Major Army units included the 3rd Infantry Division, 101st Airborne Division, and 173rd Airborne Brigade. Plans for the 4th Infantry Division were changed due to Turkey's refusal, leading to its redeployment to Kuwait. Additionally, Army special operations forces were heavily involved, showcasing the high capability of U.S. ground forces in conflict. The U.S. and British ground campaign in the Iraq war benefitted from well-trained soldiers, good equipment, effective air support, and superior situational awareness. They achieved tactical surprise at the start of the war by attacking before the 4th Infantry Division deployed to Kuwait and using unexpected routes. The flexible battle plan and rapid maneuvers kept Iraqi forces off-balance. The Iraq war ground engagements saw fierce fighting, with Iraqi forces no match for the Army's M1 tanks and M2 Bradley fighting vehicles. Post-war implications suggest reducing the Army to less than 10 active-duty divisions is feasible, as demonstrated by the success of a small number of divisions in combat. This aligns with the U.S. defense transformation plan for future conflicts with less reliance on massive ground forces. The United States is considering fighting future conflicts with less reliance on massive ground forces like those assembled for the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Supporters of maintaining at least 10 active-duty Army divisions argue that the original war plan called for using an additional division, Army supply lines were stretched thin, and the contribution of an additional division by a coalition partner cannot be guaranteed in future conflicts. Additionally, the commitment of Army forces for the Iraq war increased the worldwide operational tempo for both active and reserve members. The Iraq war highlighted the importance of heavily armored vehicles in modern warfare, especially in urban combat situations. Advocates argue for funding upgrades to all armored forces to ensure readiness for potential conflicts and reduce technical risks in future development programs like the FCS. The Iraq war emphasized the need for heavily armored vehicles in modern warfare. Advocates push for funding upgrades to all armored forces to enhance readiness and reduce technical risks in future development programs like the FCS. Opponents argue that U.S. armored units are already superior and further upgrades would be unnecessary and wasteful. They suggest relying on a mix of highly upgraded and somewhat less upgraded armored vehicles. Supporters of the Army's plan to shift to lighter and more mobile combat units argue that the success of the relatively small number of heavily armored units in the Iraq war shows the U.S. has enough armored units for future conflicts. They believe lighter units like the Stryker Brigades would have been valuable in establishing a ground presence in northern Iraq and maintaining civil order in Iraqi cities post-war. The effectiveness of the M1 tank in combat operations in Baghdad during the Iraq war has led to debates about the future use of heavy armor in urban combat. Critics argue that future conflicts in cities with narrower roads and shorter lines of sight may make M1 tanks less effective and more vulnerable. They suggest that reducing the number of Army armored units, given the need to be prepared for multiple conflicts, may not be wise. Additionally, they point out that Stryker vehicles could be vulnerable to certain weapons used in urban warfare. The Iraq war highlighted the vulnerability of Stryker vehicles to certain weapons used in urban warfare, leading to debates on the future use of heavy armor in combat. Critics argue against shifting towards more lightly armored units and suggest improving rapid-response capabilities through enhanced airlift and sealift capabilities instead of reducing armored units. The Iraq war raised concerns about the effectiveness of Stryker vehicles in urban warfare, sparking debates on the future of heavy armor. Congress was also discussing various combat aircraft and precision-guided munitions programs, including funding for manned vs. unmanned aircraft, tactical vs. long-ranged bombers, and specific aircraft programs like the F/A-22 fighter and Global Hawk UAVs. The Iraq war saw U.S. and British combat aircraft dominating the air war, with 1,801 aircraft involved in 41,404 sorties. Iraq did not put manned aircraft in the air during the conflict. During the Iraq war, U.S. and British forces conducted 1,500 to 2,000 sorties daily, with 68% of bombs and missiles being precision-guided. Aircraft-delivered precision-guided weapons hit targets 98% of the time, including 802 Tomahawk cruise missiles. During the Iraq war, U.S. and British forces conducted 1,500 to 2,000 daily sorties, with a high success rate for precision-guided weapons. Combat records may be revised downward, as seen with the Tomahawk missile in the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Fixed-wing aircraft armed with precision-guided weapons provided close air support in urban combat operations. U.S. air power decimated key Iraqi Republican Guard divisions, aiding the rapid advance of ground forces towards Baghdad. During the Iraq war, U.S. and British forces conducted daily sorties with high success rates for precision-guided weapons. Networking technology facilitated rapid advances towards Baghdad by ground forces. U.S. and British air operations were supported by specialized combat-support aircraft. A small number of aircraft were lost due to enemy fire, consistent with past military operations. During the Iraq war, the United States utilized various aircraft including Navy E-2C Airborne Early Warning, Air Force E-8 Joint Surveillance, and UAVs for surveillance and combat missions. UAVs played a crucial role in providing continuous surveillance of Iraqi forces and drawing attention away from air defense systems. Unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) armed with weapons were used for ground attacks. The Iraq war has potential implications for the Air Force. The recent Iraq war raised questions about the size and organization of the U.S. Air Force to meet operational demands. Deployment levels increased from 7,000 to 24,000 personnel by December 2002. Continued military operations in various regions suggest this deployment level may persist. In 1999, the Air Force reorganized into 10 Aerospace Expeditionary Forces. In 1999, the Air Force reorganized into 10 Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEFs) to meet worldwide contingency demands. Each AEF includes 175 aircraft and 20,000 personnel, rotating on a 15-month deployment cycle. The Air Force aims to deploy an AEF in 48 hours and up to 5 AEFs within 15 days. However, signs emerged before the Iraq war that the Air Force was being tasked beyond its reorganized force structure's capabilities. The Air Force made exceptions to the AEF deployment schedule to meet overseas demands, embedding personnel and materiel from two on-call air wings in the 10 AEFs. They also deployed indefinitely several aircraft squadrons of various types to augment AEFs 7 and 8 deploying to the Persian Gulf, exceeding the usual 180-day temporary duty limit. The Air Force made exceptions to the AEF deployment schedule to meet overseas demands, embedding personnel and materiel from two on-call air wings in the 10 AEFs. Secretary of the Air Force James Roche issued a waiver allowing Air Force personnel supporting contingency operations to exceed the 180-day limit. This raises questions about the size and organization of the Air Force, including the possibility of increasing end strength and exploring alternatives to meet personnel demands. The recent exceptions to the AEF rotational schedule raise concerns about the effectiveness of the AEF concept. Naval aircraft carriers and sea-based aircraft played a significant role in the Iraq war, with 780 naval aircraft representing 43% of the total aircraft used. They flew 34% of the sorties in the war, and their contribution was even more pronounced in the war in Afghanistan. The Iraq war and Afghanistan war highlighted the importance of aircraft carriers and carrier-based aircraft for U.S. military operations in areas with limited access to land bases. Some argued that air power alone could achieve U.S. war aims, as seen in the Kosovo operation in 1999 and the Afghanistan war in 2001-2002. The debate over the value of air power versus ground forces has been subdued following the Iraq war. The success of U.S. heavy ground forces in the Iraq war has overshadowed arguments for air power. Analysts debate the contributions of air operations and ground forces in destroying Iraq's army, which could impact future conflict strategies and funding decisions. U.S. and British air strikes significantly weakened Iraq's Republican Guard Divisions, making them vulnerable to ground forces. Estimates suggest that the Republican Guard divisions lost half their tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery before engaging U.S. ground forces. Some analysts caution that the effectiveness of air operations in destroying Iraqi ground forces is still being assessed. They note that early assessments of air operations in the 1991 Persian Gulf war were later downgraded. U.S. Army and Marine Corps forces faced stiff resistance from some Iraqi units despite Iraqi ground forces being destroyed by airstrikes. Transporting armor, artillery, ammunition, and fuel long distances is challenging. Some argue for a shift towards relying more on combat aircraft for U.S. ground forces, suggesting increased deployability and lethality. The Marine Corps uses more combat aircraft for fire support compared to large artillery pieces. However, skeptics point out that adverse weather does not affect artillery effectiveness, unlike aircraft. Recent combat experiences in Afghanistan raise questions about the effectiveness of solely relying on combat aircraft over artillery support for ground forces. The military strategy in the Iraq war sparked a debate on the balance between close air support (CAS) missions and strategic bombing. Long-range bombers like B-1, B-52, and B-2 played a significant role in both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars by destroying enemy ground targets with precision-guided and unguided bombs. This debate could influence future decisions on aircraft acquisition for the Department of Defense. The B-1 bomber played a crucial role in the Iraq war by carrying out precision bombing attacks on enemy ground targets, including a building in Baghdad where Saddam Hussein was believed to be located. The bomber was able to loiter over the battlefield for extended periods, making it effective for attacking time-sensitive targets. The performance of long-range bombers in these wars may impact the ongoing debate on funding for bomber programs versus tactical aircraft. The debate over the best mix of long-range bombers and tactical combat aircraft in the Air Force includes questions about bomber modernization funding, early retirements of B-1s, engine replacements for B-52s, and the development of a next-generation bomber. Supporters argue that bomber programs are underfunded compared to tactical aircraft, while opponents believe current plans adequately address bomber force needs. Supporters of bomber modernization argue that the value of bombers in combat operations has increased with precision-guided weapons, reducing the need for in-theater bases. They suggest greater emphasis on bomber programs in DoD planning and budgets. Opponents believe current plans for bomber force modernization are sufficient, citing the effectiveness of long-range bombers in regional conflicts with precision-guided weapons. Supporters of bomber modernization argue that precision-guided weapons have increased the number of targets each bomber can attack in a single sortie. They believe the success of bomber operations in Iraq and Afghanistan shows that current modernization funding is sufficient, and there is no urgent need for a next-generation bomber. Instead, they suggest maintaining the readiness of the planned bomber force and improving precision-guided weapons and targeting systems. Supporters of aircraft modernization programs argue that advancing technologies in air-defense systems require the development of stealthy, agile tactical aircraft like the F/A-22 Raptor, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to ensure U.S. air dominance in future conflicts. They emphasize the need for flexible technologies to counter highly-capable adversaries armed with advanced air-defense systems. Critics of DoD's tactical aircraft modernization program argue that proceeding with all three planned programs, F/A-18E/F, and JSF, may require significant cutbacks in other critical DoD programs. They believe that current U.S. aircraft like the F-15 and F-16 demonstrate U.S. air superiority, making the need for new aircraft questionable. Critics argue that investing in new tactical aircraft designs is less critical for future success in U.S. air operations compared to other air-related technologies like precision-guided weapons and networked air operations. They suggest a shift towards a \"system-of-systems\" approach to optimize investments in future air power capability. The F/A-22 program, as the most capable and expensive aircraft in DoD's tactical aircraft modernization plan, has been a focal point in the debate over the program's merits. Following the Iraq war, critics of the F/A-22 program argue that successful U.S. air operations demonstrate that upgrades to existing tactical combat aircraft can maintain air power dominance until less expensive alternatives are available. They suggest that the F/A-22 program, being costly and high-capability, may not be necessary and could be terminated. Supporters of procuring 276 or more F/A-22s argue that the aircraft's air-to-air capabilities are crucial for future threats from modern enemy fighters and surface-to-air missile systems. The F-22 has been redesigned as the F/A-22 to emphasize its ability to perform air-to-ground strike missions. The need for the Navy to replace its shorter-ranged F/A-18C/D strike fighters with longer-ranged F/A-18E/F and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters has been underscored by valuable air-to-ground strike missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo. Admiral Vernon Clark and others argue that F/A-18E/Fs or F-35s can perform long-range missions with fewer in-flight refuelings, reducing the Navy's need for aerial refueling during missions. During the Iraq war, strike sorties were limited due to a lack of in-flight refueling assets. Plans to replace F/A-18C/Ds with F/A-18E/Fs and F-35s aim to prevent such issues in future operations. The V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft is set to replace aging Marine Corps transport helicopters, offering operational advantages like higher speed for troop transport. Marine forces operated at long distances from shore during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, highlighting the need for faster V-22 helicopters. Supporters argue that the V-22 is essential for deep-inland operations and replacing aging helicopters. However, some observers believe that strict testing is still necessary despite the operational benefits of the V-22. The V-22 program's testing is crucial despite past development issues. Helicopter performance in military operations like Kosovo and Afghanistan has been mixed, emphasizing the need for effective replacements. In Kosovo and Afghanistan, Army helicopter operations lacked coordination with other U.S. forces, reducing effectiveness. In Afghanistan, high elevation posed challenges, and a shortage of MH-47 helicopters led to calls for the V-22 Osprey as a solution. In the Iraq war, AH-64 helicopters faced survivability and maintainability issues during an attack on a Republican Guard division. Observers suggest that lack of coordination with Air Force and Navy aircraft operations contributed to the poor outcome. During the Iraq war, AH-64 helicopters faced survivability and maintainability issues during a raid on Karbala. Army attack helicopters complained about being sidelined in favor of fixed-wing aircraft for close air support missions. This preference may have been influenced by concerns about helicopter survivability after an attack by the 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment. The harsh desert conditions in Iraq posed challenges for keeping helicopters flying, especially the Marine Corps CH-53Es. Maintenance difficulties persisted since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, leading to speculation that the DoD may reduce emphasis on helicopters in its plans and budgets, potentially impacting the Army's RAH-66 Comanche program. The Army's Comanche program, a stealthy reconnaissance helicopter, has been in development for 20 years. In 2002, the program was restructured, cutting the planned procurement in half to 600 helicopters and including the development of companion UAVs. Supporters of reducing the program argue that attack helicopters are vulnerable to ground fire in modern combat, and missions can be performed by fixed-wing aircraft with precision-guided munitions. Supporters of the Comanche program argue that helicopter survivability issues in the Iraq war were due to incorrect tactics, not inherent problems with helicopters. They believe that adjusting tactics and utilizing Comanche's stealth features and UAV support will make it more survivable on the modern battlefield. Additionally, they argue that helicopters will remain effective in responding with agility to enemy maneuvers, which could be crucial in future conflicts. The Iraq war highlighted the importance of specialized combat-support aircraft like the U-2 surveillance plane and the E-8 Joint Surveillance, Targeting, and Reconnaissance System (JSTARS) aircraft. The advanced age of the Marine Corps' heavy-lift helicopters, CH-53s and CH-46s, due to delays in acquiring the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, raised concerns about modernization plans if the V-22 program is further delayed or cancelled. Specialized combat-support aircraft like the U-2, E-8, and EA-6B radar-jamming aircraft are high-demand, low-density assets. Supporters argue for increased funding for modernization and procurement of such aircraft post-Iraq war. Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) gained importance in defense transformation plans after the war in Afghanistan, with expectations of expanding and accelerating DoD's UAV programs post-Iraq war. The DoD's UAV programs, including the Global Hawk and Predator long-range UAV programs, are expected to be accelerated. Concerns about inventory levels of precision-guided munitions during the war in Afghanistan led to increased production rates, reducing concerns for the Iraq war. DoD plans to procure large numbers of JDAMs and other precision-guided weapons in the future. The DoD plans to procure large numbers of JDAMs and other precision-guided weapons in the future. The success of these weapons in the Iraq war may reinforce support for funding these plans. Development and procurement of a 500-pound version of JDAM, as well as the 250-pound Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), are being considered for increased effectiveness in future operations. Supporters argue that bunker-busting weapons could be useful in urban combat operations, especially in destroying underground targets like those in Iraq. The effectiveness of these weapons in the Iraq war may influence future development. Over 40% of Tomahawk land-attack missiles were used in the conflict. The inventory of Tomahawk missiles before the Iraq war was around 1,890 to 2,000 TLAMs, with the most capable version being the Block III. Procurement of new Block IIIs ended in FY1999, and the next version, Block IV or Tactical Tomahawk, began in FY2002. The FY2004-FY2009 plan called for procuring a significant number of Block IVs to replenish the inventory depleted during the Iraq war. Some observers suggest increasing the production of Tomahawk missiles to replenish the low inventory caused by the Iraq war. Special operations forces gained importance in U.S. defense planning after their success in Afghanistan, with plans to enhance their capabilities in the FY2004 defense budget. The FY2004 defense budget proposes increasing U.S. SOF personnel by 1,890 and boosting the non-personnel budget by 48%. Special operations forces played a significant role in the Iraq war, with over 9,000 personnel involved in various operations. The successful use of significant numbers of Special Operations Forces (SOF) in the Iraq war has led to calls for increasing the size and budget of U.S. SOF. Observers believe that the SOF operations in Iraq, like those in Afghanistan, were highly effective and made a large contribution to the U.S.-led war effort. This success has reinforced support for expanding U.S. special operations forces. The U.S. Special Operations Forces are facing challenges in expanding their size due to concerns about maintaining high standards. Over 286,000 reservists have been activated since 9/11 to support the global war on terrorism and the Iraq war. Since 9/11, over 286,000 reservists have been activated to support the global war on terrorism and the Iraq war. The post-9/11 reserve mobilization is the second-largest since World War II, with roughly 220,000 reservists on active duty during the Iraq war. Lessons learned from previous mobilizations have helped streamline the process for activating reservists. The post-9/11 reserve mobilization, the second-largest since World War II, has seen improvements in activation processes. However, issues with reserve force structure and accessibility have been highlighted, including concerns with the Army National Guard's combat divisions and separate brigades. Guard divisions and separate brigades have not been called up for foreign conflicts since the 1960s and Vietnam War, respectively. The Army National Guard's combat divisions and separate brigades have not been mobilized for foreign conflicts since the Vietnam War in 1968. Three Army Guard combat maneuver brigades were activated for the 1991 Persian Gulf War, but they were not deployed with their parent divisions and were only validated as combat-ready after the war ended, sparking controversy over the \"roundout\" concept and the Guard's relationship with the active Army. Since 9/11, Guard divisions and brigades have not been fully activated, but some combat battalions have been mobilized for security purposes in the US and overseas. Despite suggestions to activate Guard units as a strategic reserve, there are no plans to do so according to DoD and the administration. The DoD and administration have not fully activated Guard divisions and brigades since 9/11. Questions arise about their usefulness if not activated for total national mobilization. Some suggest maintaining smaller component units instead of expensive brigades. The role of reserve components has shifted since the Cold War, being activated more frequently post-1989. There are questions about the necessity of maintaining expensive brigade and division headquarters. Since 1990, reservists have been activated more frequently, with 6 involuntary activations and ongoing deployments. Reservists have served 6 to 9 months or up to 2 years, facing financial hardships and family problems. Concerns about recruiting and retention issues have been raised due to the increased frequency and duration of reserve callups. The post-9/11 mobilization has raised concerns about recruiting and retention issues for reserve components. However, data shows that reserve recruiting has been strong, exceeding goals in FY2002. Studies on the impact of mobilization on reserve retention rates have found no significant negative effects, similar to findings for active-component personnel. Deployments, if managed well, can even enhance retention by providing a sense of accomplishment. Some studies suggest that repeated or prolonged mobilization of reservists could negatively impact reserve retention and recruiting. Concerns have been raised that the post-9/11 mobilization may eventually erode reserve recruiting and retention, prompting Congress to consider increasing reserve pay and benefits to maintain attractiveness. The Iraq war highlighted the military's ability to gather and analyze information for rapid decision-making, reflecting the concept of network-centric warfare. This approach, using networking technology to integrate military personnel and equipment, is a key element of defense transformation. Questions arise about increasing reserve pay, modifying force structure, and scaling back missions requiring reserve support. Network-centric warfare (NCW) integrates personnel, vehicles, aircraft, and ships into highly integrated networks for sharing tactical information rapidly. It enhances battlespace awareness, shortens the sensor-to-shooter cycle, enables quick decision-making, and facilitates massing fires on enemy targets. NCW also improves pre-conflict planning and emphasizes the importance of network elements in combat capabilities. Under NCW, the network itself becomes a weapon, with C4ISR programs considered important for achieving NCW. The effectiveness of U.S. forces in the Iraq war was likely due in part to early stages of NCW implementation, particularly in rapid information transmission for attacking time-sensitive targets. The success of U.S. forces in the Iraq war may lead to increased interest in implementing Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) more fully. Investing in NCW could potentially result in reduced investments in traditional military platforms, as improved force effectiveness from NCW may allow military tasks to be performed with fewer platforms. This raises questions about accelerating or expanding C4ISR programs for NCW and adjusting DoD plans and budgets accordingly. Advocates of NCW argue for adjusting DoD plans to prioritize C4ISR programs over traditional combat platforms, as it offers a greater increase in combat capability. Supporters of combat platforms acknowledge the importance of NCW but argue that platforms are essential for creating a network. Next-generation platforms will better utilize networking technology for maximum benefit. A current constraint on achieving NCW is communications bandwidth capacity. The implementation of NCW raises concerns about communications bandwidth capacity, especially for non-line-of-sight systems. The U.S. operations during the Iraq war strained current bandwidth capacity, leading to the need for increased capacity. Efforts to improve bandwidth capacity include investing in satellites that use lasers for data transmission. Another issue is the vulnerability of NCW-related C4ISR systems to cyberwarfare attacks as the dependence on these systems grows. The DoD is facing concerns about the security of NCW-related C4ISR systems against cyberwarfare attacks. There are also questions about the implications of NCW for joint and combined military operations. In the early days of the Iraq war, observers expressed concerns about the participation of U.S. and British forces. Observers expressed concerns about the likelihood of U.S. and British forces participating in urban combat operations during the Iraq war. They feared high casualty rates for invading forces, civilian deaths, and damage to Iraqi infrastructure, especially in Baghdad. Iraqi officials also predicted large enemy casualties in urban fighting. Fighting in urban areas was deemed necessary during the conflict. Urban combat in the Iraq War saw U.S. and British forces engaging in extensive fighting in Iraqi towns and cities, resulting in significant casualties. Despite initial concerns, U.S. forces were able to swiftly take control of Baghdad with innovative tactics and precision-guided munitions. Unmanned air vehicles provided valuable surveillance support in urban areas. Unmanned air vehicles were valuable for surveillance in urban areas during the Iraq War, highlighting the importance of training and equipping U.S. forces for urban combat operations. Programs included training facilities, UAVs, UGVs, Land Warrior program, and Objective Individual Combat Weapon. The Army is developing advanced equipment for individual soldiers, including a next-generation rifle capable of shooting around corners, explosive charges for breaching walls, secure radios, night-vision devices, sensors for detecting enemy sniper fire, precision-guided weapons, and non-lethal weapons. Realistic urban combat training is crucial for reducing casualties among U.S. forces in urban operations. Improved urban training facilities are needed for joint training operations. Smaller UAVs and larger UGVs, like the Marine Corp's Gladiator and Army's MATILDA, are valuable in urban settings. The Iraq war demonstrated the value of heavily armored vehicles like the M1 tank and M2 Bradley in urban combat situations. These vehicles were invulnerable to Iraqi weapons, drawing fire and uncovering hidden fighters. Supporters argue that without them, the Army would not have been able to make bold advances into central Baghdad, rapidly collapsing Iraqi resistance with few casualties. The planned Stryker wheeled combat vehicle is a lighter alternative. The effectiveness of heavily armored vehicles like the M1 tank in urban combat situations during the Iraq war was highlighted. However, future urban combat scenarios in cities with narrower roads and shorter lines of sight could make these vehicles less effective. Lighter vehicles like the Stryker could be useful in reestablishing civil order in Iraqi cities post-major fighting. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, missile defense operations were a significant part of the conflict as Iraq launched around 80 Scud ballistic missiles at various targets. The Patriot PAC-2 missile system was used by U.S. and coalition forces to intercept the Scuds, initially believed to be highly effective but later analysis revealed lower success rates. This raised debates on the system's overall effectiveness in the war. The 1991 Persian Gulf war sparked debates on the effectiveness of missile-defense systems, particularly the Patriot PAC-2 and PAC-3 missiles. Over $3 billion was spent on improving the Patriot system's capabilities to intercept ballistic missiles. In the recent Iraq war, upgraded versions of the Patriot missiles were deployed, with the PAC-3 designed to fly higher and farther than the PAC-2. The PAC-3 uses a hit-to-kill approach, aiming to destroy its target by colliding with it, which has become the primary U.S. technological approach to missile defense. The Patriot system, the only operational U.S. missile defense system, was used in the Iraq war with the PAC-3 version. The success rate of the Patriot, particularly the PAC-3, in targeting Iraqi ballistic missiles was of interest. 9 Iraqi ballistic missiles were targeted, while 6 were not targeted as they posed no harm. Iraq fired shorter-ranged missiles like Al Samoud-2s and Ababil-100s, not Scuds. It is unclear why there were no Scud attacks in the Iraq war. During the Iraq war, the Patriot system successfully intercepted all 9 targeted ballistic missiles, with most intercepts made by PAC-2 missiles and 2 by PAC-3 missiles. One Iraqi cruise missile hit Kuwait City's seawall, evading radar. The Patriot system also had 3 friendly-fire incidents, resulting in the loss of 1 U.S. and 1 British aircraft. Advocates for and against missile defense systems may find support for their perspectives in the performance of missile defense systems during the Iraq war. The ongoing controversy over Patriot performance in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 suggests that the debate over hit-to-kill technology for missile defense will continue. Supporters of the Patriot system argue that the Iraq war highlighted the need for missile defense systems and demonstrated the effectiveness of the Patriot system in defending against short-range ballistic missiles. The successful use of the PAC-3 missile in the Iraq war showed that hit-to-kill technology works and is the preferred method for destroying attacking ballistic missiles. Operations in Western Iraq suggest that efforts to prevent enemy ballistic missiles may contribute to overall missile defense. Skeptics argue that the Iraq war did not validate the effectiveness of the PAC-3 version against the Scud missile, as it has never been used in combat or peacetime tests. They also question whether the success of PAC-3s using hit-to-kill technology can be applied to other missile defense systems designed to intercept intercontinental-range ballistic missiles. The Patriot system's effectiveness against low-flying cruise missiles and friendly-fire incidents are questioned due to operational procedures and the complexity of the electromagnetic battlefield. Friendly fire incidents, known as fratricide, have been a tragic aspect of warfare throughout history. Observers debate whether modern warfare increases or decreases the risk of fratricide. Modern weapons are lethal and can be delivered over long distances, while combat operations are non-linear and involve missions behind enemy lines. This complexity can raise the risk of friendly fire incidents. However, advancements in communication, navigation, and identification systems, as well as self-protection equipment and medical capabilities, aim to reduce miscommunications and casualties. Casualties due to friendly fire were a significant concern following the 1991 Persian Gulf War, with 23% of U.S. combat deaths attributed to friendly fire. This led to a focus on minimizing friendly fire casualties, which remained a concern during the Iraq War. The exact number of friendly fire casualties in the Iraq War has not been officially announced by the Department of Defense. The Iraq war saw a significant rate of friendly fire casualties, with at least 15 coalition deaths attributed to fratricide out of 151 total U.S. combat deaths, indicating a rate of about 10%. An additional 10 incidents with 20 deaths were still under investigation, potentially increasing this rate. This highlights the ongoing susceptibility of modern warfare to equipment malfunctions and human error, prompting a reevaluation of military capabilities in mitigating fratricide since the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The debate continues on whether any level of friendly fire casualties is acceptable, with some arguing it is inevitable while others believe even one death is too many. In the 20th Century, 10% to 30% of casualties were caused by friendly fire, with surface-to-air incidents being widely noted in the Iraq war. A 1993 study estimated that 15% to 20% of casualties in World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam were due to friendly fire. Fratricide occurred in various engagement regimes, with a notable incident involving a PAC-2 Patriot missile mistakenly shooting down a British Tornado aircraft. The text discusses incidents of fratricide during the Iraq war, including a surface-to-air missile mistakenly shooting down a British Tornado aircraft and a Patriot missile shooting down a U.S. Navy F/A-18C fighter. Observers question why the Patriot system engaged aircraft at all, suggesting that instructing it to ignore slower-flying manned aircraft could have prevented these incidents. During the Iraq war, concerns arose about the Patriot air defense system's ability to distinguish between cruise missiles and manned aircraft. Despite Iraq's limited air force, they launched cruise missiles at Kuwait, prompting questions about the Patriot system's response. The incident raised the need for improved funding to enhance the Patriot's capability to differentiate between different types of threats. The Patriot system's ability to distinguish between aircraft and ballistic missiles was compromised by electromagnetic interference on the battlefield during the Iraq war. This confusion led to friendly fire incidents, including the shooting down of a British Tornado. Pilot error may have also played a role in the incident. Training and reducing electromagnetic interference are crucial in designing and using U.S. weapon systems. The friendly fire incident involving a British Tornado and a U.S. jet was caused by human error and technical issues with the IFF beacon. The incident raises questions about the reliability of IFF technologies and the need for better training to prevent such mistakes in the future. The friendly fire incident involving a British Tornado and a U.S. jet was caused by human error and technical issues with the IFF beacon. This incident raises questions about maintaining a \"human-in-the-loop\" in the design and operation of sophisticated weapon systems, as well as the implications for increasing autonomy in military systems. The incident also prompts considerations for the implementation of communication links like Link-16 to reduce fratricide. Several air-to-surface fratricide incidents occurred during the Iraq war, including an A-10 attack on British ground vehicles and mistaken bombings of friendly Kurdish military convoys by U.S. aircraft. These incidents highlight the challenges of air-to-ground fratricide compared to surface-to-air fratricide. Air-to-ground fratricide is a complex issue due to challenges in distinguishing between friendly and enemy personnel and vehicles. Procedural safeguards, such as staying away from suspected enemy targets during friendly aircraft attacks and establishing positive identification with ground controllers, are crucial to prevent such incidents. The British vehicles targeted by a U.S. A-10 were equipped for combat. The British vehicles fired on by a U.S. A-10 had combat identification equipment, but it failed to warn the aircraft. DoD and NATO are working on a project for Coalition Combat Identification to reduce fratricide risk. DoD previously invested in the Battlefield Combat Identification System before canceling it in 2001. Inadequacies in intelligence support for U.S. combat troops were identified, with commanders lacking timely battle-relevant intelligence due to communication issues. Post-Gulf War, efforts were made to improve access to intelligence from various sources. Intelligence plays a crucial role in new operational concepts and military doctrines, emphasizing defense transformation through multiple intelligence collection sources. The Iraq war highlighted the importance of detailed, accurate, and real-time intelligence for U.S. military operations, enabling precision strikes and rapid degradation of Iraqi military capabilities. Defense transformation emphasizes collecting intelligence from multiple sources and sharing it rapidly among U.S. forces. High priority is given to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance programs in DoD budget planning. The Iraq war showcased the significance of real-time intelligence for U.S. military operations, leading to rapid degradation of Iraqi military capabilities. Improved intelligence coordination between ground and air units enabled precision strikes with reduced civilian casualties and minimized damage to infrastructure needed for reconstruction. During the Iraq war, U.S. intelligence agencies provided precise data on Iraqi military installations, utilizing commercial overhead imagery and human intelligence. Human agents identified key bombing targets and made contact with internal opposition forces, aiding the U.S.-led war effort. During the Iraq war, cooperation between U.S. intelligence elements and Iraqi military leaders led to some Iraqi divisions opting out of the conflict. U.S. special operations forces and CIA paramilitary forces worked together to secure oil fields, prevent Iraqi missile attacks, and rescue U.S. prisoners of war. The effectiveness of U.S. intelligence agencies in identifying Iraqi weapons sites remains uncertain, as some searched locations were found empty. Some argue that insufficient intelligence about Iraqi possession of weapons of mass destruction may have led to the military attack during the Iraq war. Observers note that the conflict stretched available intelligence resources, including limited inventories of high-demand platforms like unmanned aerial vehicles. Concerns also exist about the integration of various ethnic groups in Iraq into a democratic polity without prolonged foreign military occupation. The Iraq war validated the use of real-time intelligence for precision strikes on enemy targets, emphasizing the need for improved ISR capabilities such as reconnaissance satellites, UAVs, sensors, and networking software for sharing intelligence data among U.S. forces. The Iraq war highlighted the importance of real-time intelligence for precision strikes, emphasizing the need for improved ISR capabilities like reconnaissance satellites, UAVs, and networking software. Funding for non-ISR programs may need to be adjusted within the DoD budget to prioritize ISR programs like GlobalHawk and Predator UAV. Additionally, the relationship between U.S. military special operations forces and CIA paramilitary forces needs clarification to determine if capabilities are complementary or redundant, potentially leading to reduced expenditures for one group. The Iraq war saw a significant psychological operations effort by special operations forces, aiming to influence the morale and behavior of the adversary's military and civilian population through media. This effort included dropping millions of leaflets and distributing radios with instructions for Arabic-language broadcasts. The term \"psychological operations\" has been replaced by \"information warfare\" by the DoD. The Iraq war featured a substantial psychological operations campaign by special forces to influence the morale and actions of both military and civilian populations. This effort involved distributing leaflets, radios, and utilizing loudspeakers and drones to convey messages urging cooperation with coalition forces and desertion/surrender of Iraqi military personnel. The focus was on emphasizing that the military campaign targeted the government regime, not the people or the nation. The psychological operations campaign in the Iraq war aimed to influence Iraqi military personnel to desert or surrender, avoid using chemical or biological weapons, and prevent sabotage of oilfields. While mass surrenders did not occur on a large scale, some desertions and surrenders did take place following distributed leaflet instructions. The impact on preventing CB weapons use and maintaining a positive attitude towards coalition forces among the civilian population remains uncertain. The U.S. psychological operations effort in the Iraq war faced criticism for its failure to produce significant defections among senior Iraqi military and civilian leaders. Reports also highlighted shortcomings in attacking Iraq's capability to broadcast pro-regime messages and suggested that the decision to accelerate the ground offensive may have undermined the effectiveness of the psychological operations effort. The U.S. psychological operations effort in the Iraq war was criticized for not producing significant defections among senior Iraqi leaders and for shortcomings in attacking Iraq's pro-regime messaging capability. The success of such operations can be affected by various factors, and it may not be reliable to count on them as a substitute for conventional combat power in future conflicts. There were concerns about Iraq using chemical and biological weapons before the war. Prior to the Iraq war, concerns were raised about Iraq using chemical-biological weapons to hinder the U.S.-led invasion by forcing troops to wear protective suits. Despite warnings, no such weapons were used during the conflict. During the Iraq war, concerns about chemical-biological weapons were raised, but no such weapons were found with Iraqi ground forces. U.S. troops wore protective gear as a precaution, and various CB defensive capabilities were deployed, including detectors and decontamination systems. Official assessments will provide a full analysis of the situation. The Iraq war tested enhancements for U.S. airlift capabilities funded after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. No significant problems were reported with the equipment. Enhancements included procuring new C-17 airlift aircraft, modernizing avionics of existing C-5 airlift aircraft, and updating KC-135 tanker aircraft. Congress closely monitors U.S. air mobility capabilities for supporting military operations. The Iraq war tested enhancements for U.S. airlift capabilities, including updating aircraft cockpits and engines, and outfitting KC-135s with refueling systems. Congress is considering issues such as C-17 procurement, C-5 modernization, leasing Boeing 767s for tankers, and modifying CRAF contracts. Observers predicted strain on air mobility resources before the war. The Iraq war tested U.S. air mobility resources, with challenges in flight distances and access to air bases. Airlift operations were largely satisfactory, with the C-17 aircraft performing well. Aerial refueling operations had some issues, despite praise from pilots. Aerial refueling operations in the Iraq theater of operations faced challenges due to limits on foreign basing and overflight rights, the simultaneous air and ground combat operations, and the rapid advance of U.S. ground forces. To improve coverage, Air Force tanker aircraft operated more aggressively, flying closer to hostile territory. This improved support for some U.S. combat aircraft but may have reduced it for others. The improved tanker support for some U.S. combat aircraft in the Iraq theater of operations faced challenges due to limits on foreign basing and overflight rights. Navy aircraft flying from carriers in the Persian Gulf reportedly could not reach Air Force tanker aircraft operating deep inside Iraqi airspace, leading to reduced sorties for Navy aircraft flying into Iraq from carriers in the Eastern Mediterranean. This experience will likely inform congressional debate on the requirements for air mobility aircraft, including the total airlift and aerial refueling capability needed to support current and future U.S. military operations. The current requirements for airlift and aerial refueling aircraft are being questioned in light of potential changes in the future mix of combat aircraft. The total airlift capability needed for U.S. military operations was established before 9/11 and may need to be reevaluated considering recent conflicts. Additionally, there are concerns about the joint modernization efforts for Air Force aerial refueling aircraft and whether they adequately address the needs of the Navy and Marine Corps. The validity of current airlift and aerial refueling requirements post-9/11 is being questioned in light of ongoing conflicts and changing combat aircraft needs. Observers suggest reducing investments in fighters and increasing funding for long-range bombers and UAVs to potentially lower costly airlift and refueling demands. The Iraq war may have implications for specific air mobility program issues, including C-17 procurement. The Air Force completed a multi-year procurement of 120 C-17 airlift aircraft in FY2003 and began a follow-on procurement of 60 additional C-17s. Supporters argue that the war validated the importance of airlift capability and the effectiveness of the C-17 aircraft. The C-17 aircraft is used for airlift, especially for transporting large cargo over long distances to airfields with shorter runways. There is a debate on whether to increase procurement beyond 180 planes, with arguments for increased demand due to Army transformation towards lighter forces and arguments against based on the success of airlift efforts in recent wars. In the future, the United States may require fewer ground forces for wars, leading to a potential reduction in airlift requirements. This could be offset by the use of UAVs and high-speed sealift ships. Modernizing the C-5 fleet and exploring new airlift technologies like airships and wing-in-ground aircraft could help meet future airlift needs. Debate continues on modernizing and re-engineering the C-5 fleet, with a mix of C-17s and C-5s likely needed to meet airlift requirements. Supporters of modernizing and re-engining a majority of the C-5 fleet argue that the United States needs all the airlift volume it can muster, especially after the Iraq war. They believe that keeping as many C-5s in service as possible is crucial as the C-5 has a much larger payload capacity compared to the C-17. Additionally, the C-5 is capable of carrying bulky and irregularly shaped military equipment that other aircraft cannot accommodate. Supporters of modernizing and re-engining a majority of the C-5 fleet argue that it will increase the fleet's readiness rate, ensuring maximum airlift payload volume availability. However, some suggest modernizing fewer C-5s to procure more C-17s for better capability to move payloads directly to combat theaters with limited airfields. The U.S. airlift fleet could argue that modernizing fewer C-5s and acquiring more C-17s would increase overall readiness rates. They also consider leasing Boeing 767s as tankers to address the aging KC-135 fleet. The Air Force is considering options to address the aging KC-135 tanker fleet, including extending service lives, procuring new tanker aircraft, or leasing Boeing 767 airliners. Congress authorized the leasing arrangement in the FY2003 defense budget, with supporters citing cost-effectiveness and opponents raising concerns about violating procurement provisions and long-term costs. Supporters of the leasing arrangement argue that procuring new aircraft is more expensive and less cost-effective. They believe that the shortage of aerial refueling assets in the Iraq war highlights the need for quickly improving U.S. capabilities in this area. Extending the service lives of KC-135s would only provide a short-term fix, while procuring new tankers would require funding that the Air Force cannot afford. The Iraq war and reduced civilian air travel post-9/11 have also impacted orders for new commercial aircraft. The reduced orders for new large commercial aircraft have damaged Boeing's financial health. Supporters argue that a leasing arrangement would help Boeing, a major defense contractor. Opponents question if the Boeing 767 is the best tanker platform, citing factors like range, payload, and fuel dispenser type. An Analysis of Alternatives study is typically conducted to determine the best airframe. Opponents of the leasing arrangement argue that a rigorous, joint Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) should be conducted before deciding on the replacement for air refuelers. They question the need for providing indirect government financial assistance to Boeing and highlight the importance of considering all factors before determining the optimal platform for aerial refueling. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is an arrangement where commercial airlines provide aircraft and crews to the Department of Defense during wartime. Operators can bid on DoD contracts during peacetime in exchange for making their aircraft available. CRAF was mobilized for the Iraq War and the Persian Gulf War, showcasing its importance in augmenting military airlift capabilities. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is a voluntary program that provides aircraft and crews from commercial airlines to the Department of Defense during wartime. Concerns have been raised about financially troubled U.S. airlines being able to afford continued participation in the program. Supporters argue that new deals between DoD and airlines are necessary to ensure the program's success, especially considering the need for CRAF aircraft in future emergencies. Supporters of the current CRAF arrangement argue that steps have been taken to improve airline finances and secure enough civilian aircraft for military needs. Some observers suggest developing new airlift aircraft like high-tech blimps or wing-in-ground effect aircraft to bridge the gap between current airlift capabilities and sealift ships. Congress has been monitoring U.S. sealift capabilities closely due to their critical importance alongside air mobility programs. The Iraq war tested enhancements for U.S. military sealift capabilities funded after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. This included acquiring 19 additional LMSRs for surge sealift, enhancing Maritime Prepositioning Ship squadrons, and improving mobilization readiness of the Ready Reserve Force. During the Iraq War, the Military Sealift Command played a crucial role in transporting combat gear and supplies to support the rapid advance to Baghdad. They moved 16.6 million square feet of equipment for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, delivering materiel three times faster than in the 1991 Gulf War. This was achieved with fewer chartered foreign ships, relying on vast stores of equipment positioned in the region over the last decade. During the Iraq War, the Military Sealift Command played a crucial role in transporting combat gear and supplies to support the rapid advance to Baghdad. Extensive planning and a decade-long investment in ships capable of carrying large loads facilitated the quick delivery of equipment by sea during the conflict. MSC chartered few foreign ships thanks to their \"large organic fleet,\" unlike during the Gulf War. Turkey's denial of access to its ports led to the chartering of non-U.S. ships to keep supplies moving. During the Iraq War, the Military Sealift Command played a crucial role in transporting combat gear and supplies to support the rapid advance to Baghdad. General Richard B. Myers emphasized the importance of logistics capability and the strategic sealift ships in the success of military operations. General John Handy mentioned transportation constraints in airlift and sealift operations. The unavailability of port facilities in Turkey and Saudi Arabia caused a bottleneck at Kuwaiti ports for offloading equipment and supplies from U.S. military sealift ships. Investing in sealift capabilities for moving equipment and supplies without relying on host-nation port facilities could be a solution to potential overseas port limitations in future U.S. conflicts. Arthur Cebrowski suggested the need for improvements in logistics and transportation, including very high-speed sealift ships capable of speeds over 80 knots."
