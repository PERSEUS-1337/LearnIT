REINFORCING EXISTING STANDARD FOR LEGITIMATE USE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow for the legitimate medical purpose of alleviating pain or discomfort, even if it may increase the risk of death. However, intentionally using controlled substances for the purpose of causing death or assisting in causing death is not authorized. Additionally, the Attorney General is required to disregard any state laws permitting assisted suicide or euthanasia when determining the public interest in granting registrations. The Pain Relief Promotion Act of 2000 amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow for the legitimate medical purpose of alleviating pain, but not for intentionally causing death. State laws authorizing assisted suicide or euthanasia are disregarded by the Attorney General when determining public interest in granting registrations. State authorities have the discretion to take action regarding a practitioner's professional license or prescribing privileges. The Pain Relief Promotion Act of 2000 amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow for legitimate medical purposes, with the Attorney General having the authority to issue national standards for pain management. The Act also specifies procedures and burden of proof in cases where the intention is to cause or assist in causing death. The Pain Relief Promotion Act of 2000 amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow for legitimate medical purposes. The Attorney General has the authority to issue national standards for pain management. In cases where a practitioner claims a defense under section 303(i), the burden of proof lies with the Attorney General to show clear and convincing evidence of intent to cause death or assist in causing death by dispensing controlled substances. It is not enough to prove knowledge of the risk of death from the use of controlled substances. SEC. 202. EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. Section 502(a) of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to include educational and training programs for law enforcement personnel on the use of controlled substances in pain management and palliative care. This does not change the roles of the Federal and State governments in regulating the practice.
