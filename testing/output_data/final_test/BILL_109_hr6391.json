    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Emergency Child Care for the Gulf Coast Region Act of 2006\". The Congress finds that reopening child care facilities is crucial for economic recovery, as studies show that without available and affordable child care, worker productivity will decrease. In New Orleans, before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, there were 1,912 day-care slots at 266 licensed centers, but now 80 percent of centers and 75 percent of slots are gone. The National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies reported that between 62 to 94 percent of licensed child care slots in the three coastal counties hardest hit by the hurricanes are no longer available. In Jackson County, Mississippi, one-fourth of licensed child care centers were damaged beyond repair, representing 11 percent of the county's capacity. Another 39 percent of centers needed repairs. The Emergency Child Care Business Incentive Grant Program for the Gulf Coast Region will provide grants to businesses and nonprofit organizations to cover start-up costs for child care services and offer additional services for employees. Eligibility requires submitting an application to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The application for the Emergency Child Care Business Incentive Grant Program must be submitted by a business, nonprofit organization, or consortium as per the Secretary's requirements. It must include assurances of expenditure, strategies for affordable child care services, and equitable access for low- and moderate-income families. The applicant must comply with state and local licensing requirements for child care services and ensure technical assistance is provided only to businesses following these regulations. The applicant must comply with state and local licensing requirements for child care services. If the employees do not require all the child care services, the excess must be made available to families in the community. SEC. 104. SELECTION OF GRANTEES.
