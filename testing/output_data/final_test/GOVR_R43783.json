    "content": "The federal child nutrition programs provide assistance to schools and institutions by offering cash, food, and support for providing meals and snacks to children. These programs aim to improve children's nutrition and support the agriculture economy. Key programs include the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), and Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). The federal child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and Summer Food Service Program, provide financial support and meals to institutions serving children. Eligibility rules and funding vary by program, with greater reimbursement for meals served to low-income individuals. Children receive subsidized meals or snacks at reduced prices or for free. The child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and Summer Food Service Program, have eligibility rules and funding that vary by program. The programs date back to the 1946 enactment of the National School Lunch Act, with additions and amendments over the years. The Special Milk Program was created in 1954 and made permanent in 1970. The Special Milk Program, School Breakfast Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program, and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program were all piloted in different years before being made permanent. These programs are now authorized under federal statutes and overseen by the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Congressional jurisdiction. The child nutrition programs, including the Special Milk Program, School Breakfast Program, and others, are typically overseen by specific congressional committees. These programs are periodically reviewed and reauthorized by Congress. The most recent reauthorization was in 2010 through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. The 114th Congress started but did not finish a 2016 reauthorization. The child nutrition programs, overseen by specific congressional committees, are administered by the USDA-FNS at the federal level. State departments play roles in approving and overseeing local providers to ensure they receive federal support. Millions of children benefit from these programs at the local level. In FY2017, 30.0 million children were part of the National School Lunch Program, the largest program. Child nutrition programs operate through various schools, child care centers, and summer program sites across the U.S. Funding for these programs is mainly provided through annual appropriations acts to meet legal obligations. The level of spending for programs like the National School Lunch Program is determined by the benefit and eligibility criteria in authorizing laws, known as appropriated mandatory spending. If Congress doesn't allocate necessary funds, eligible entities can seek legal recourse. Funding for meal service programs fluctuates based on reimbursement rates and the number of meals served, with federal aid provided in various forms. Federal aid is provided in the form of subsidies for meals served at child care centers and day care homes, with higher rates for meals served to lower-income children. Subsidy rates are indexed annually for inflation, and a portion of aid is provided as USDA-purchased commodity foods for programs like NSLP, CACFP, and SFSP. The child nutrition programs receive federal subsidies for meals served, including USDA-purchased commodity foods. Funding includes entitlement funds, mandatory funding, and discretionary funding for activities like Team Nutrition. Permanent appropriations and transfers also support the programs. Funding for child nutrition programs is supported by permanent appropriations and transfers, including a transfer from USDA's Section 32 program. Federal subsidies do not cover the full cost of meals and snacks, with states, localities, and families helping to cover costs. States may also supplement funding through additional reimbursements or financing arrangements. The curr_chunk provides an overview of different child nutrition programs, including details on meals provided, settings, ages served, and recent program spending. It also lists relevant CRS reports and resources for further information. The USDA-FNS website and Federal Register discuss the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), which provide federal support to schools for serving subsidized meals based on the number of reimbursable meals served. Public and private nonprofit schools and residential child care institutions participate in these programs. The federal government provides support to secondary schools and residential child care institutions that offer free or reduced-price meals to low-income children. Schools receive cash and commodity support based on the number and price of meals served. While federal law does not mandate participation, some states require schools to provide meals through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP). The program is open to public and private schools. The National School Lunch Program is open to public and private schools. Reimbursable meals must comply with federal nutrition standards, which have evolved over time based on nutritional science and children's needs. Meals that meet updated standards are eligible for increased reimbursement. USDA administers the program federally, while state agencies oversee reimbursements. The state departments of education oversee reimbursements for school meals programs through agreements with school food authorities. There is a cost-sharing requirement for the programs, with some states choosing to supplement federal reimbursements. All students can receive meals at participating schools, with eligibility based on household income criteria. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) provide reimbursements to states and schools based on household income eligibility criteria. Three pathways exist for a child to receive free or reduced-price meals: household income eligibility, categorical eligibility, and school-wide free meals under the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). The income eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price meals in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) are based on multipliers of the federal poverty guidelines. Children receive free meals if their household income is at or below 130% of the poverty guidelines, while reduced-price meals are available for those with income above 130% and less than or equal to 185% of the guidelines. Reimbursements for these meals vary based on the subsidy rate. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) provide reimbursements for free and reduced-price meals based on household income. Paid meals receive a small reimbursement, with rates listed in federal tables. Families apply for meal assistance based on income and household size to determine eligibility for different meal programs. The eligibility rules for the SFSP, CACFP, and SMP are affected by the NSLP and SBP. Children can be automatically eligible for free meals if they are in households receiving benefits from SNAP, FDPIR, TANF, Head Start, foster care, migrant, runaway, or homeless. In order to provide free meals to eligible students, some school districts use direct certification to determine categorical eligibility based on SNAP, TANF, and FDPIR participation. This process was mandated by federal law in 2004 to ensure nationwide implementation. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 expanded direct certification for SNAP participants, allowing for a demonstration project to include some Medicaid households. Performance incentive grants were provided for high-performing states, with corrective action planning for low-performing states in direct certification activities. Schools can certify children in SNAP households for free school meals without a separate application through direct certification agreements with SNAP agencies. Direct certification systems match student enrollment lists against SNAP agency records, eliminating the need for action by the child's parents or guardians. This allows schools to utilize SNAP's eligibility certification process, reducing errors in school lunch application procedures. Direct certification also reduces the number of applications households must complete. In the school year 2014-2015, 11.1 million students receiving free meals were directly certified, accounting for 68% of all categorically eligible students. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act authorized the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) for schools to offer free meals to all enrolled students based on direct certification. Over 20,700 schools in more than 3,500 districts participated in CEP in the 2016-2017 school year, an increase from the previous year. Eligible LEAs have until June 30 each year to decide on CEP participation. In the 2016-2017 school year, over 20,700 schools in more than 3,500 districts participated in the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to provide free meals to all students. Schools must have at least 40% of enrolled children identified as categorically eligible for free meals to qualify for CEP. The reimbursement rate for meals is based on the identified student percentage (ISP) multiplied by 1.6, with the remaining meals reimbursed at a lower rate. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) allows schools with at least 40% of students eligible for free meals to receive reimbursement at the free meal rate. Schools with 62.5% or more eligible students receive free meal reimbursement for all meals served. Factors influencing participation include funding benefits, reduced paperwork, and providing more free meals. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandated updates to school meal nutrition standards. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandated updates to school meal nutrition standards, requiring USDA to align school meal patterns with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The law increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new requirements and provided funding for technical assistance. USDA published final regulations in January 2012, which included increased amounts of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free milk in school meals, along with calorie maximums and sodium limits. The nutrition standards largely took effect in SY2012-2013 for lunches and SY2013-2014 for breakfasts. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandated updates to school meal nutrition standards, aligning them with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Final regulations were published in January 2012, with increased fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat milk in school meals. Some schools faced challenges implementing the guidelines, leading to changes in whole grain, sodium, and milk requirements. The final rule for SY2019-2020 onwards was published in December 2018. The Act also authorized USDA to regulate \"competitive foods\" sold in schools, with nutrition guidelines implemented in SY2014-2015. The final rule, published on July 29, 2016, sets nutrition guidelines for non-meal foods and beverages sold during the school day. Foods must meet whole-grain requirements, specific ingredients, and calorie, sodium, and fat limits. Schools have restrictions on beverages they can sell, with exemptions for fundraisers that meet guidelines. Foods brought from home are not limited, only those sold at school during the day. In FY2017, the National School Lunch Program subsidized 4.9 billion lunches to children in close to 96,000 schools and 3,200 residential child care institutions. Average daily participation was 30.0 million students, with 66.7% receiving free lunches and 6.5% receiving reduced-price lunches. Federal school lunch costs totaled approximately $13.6 billion in FY2017. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) provides funding for free and reduced-price lunches, with an additional 6-cent per-lunch reimbursement for schools meeting nutritional guidelines. Schools also receive USDA commodity foods and donations, totaling nearly $1.4 billion in FY2017. The majority of NSLP funding is for lunches, but funds can support breakfast programs as well. The NSLP funding supports lunches during the school day, snacks, and summer meals. The School Breakfast Program provides cash subsidies for breakfasts in schools based on severe need status. In FY2017, over 2.4 billion breakfasts were subsidized in schools and RCCIs, with an average daily participation of 14.7 million children. The School Breakfast Program (SBP) served nearly 3,200 RCCIs with an average daily participation of 14.7 million children. 79.1% received free meals and 5.7% purchased reduced-price meals. Federal school breakfast costs totaled approximately $4.3 billion. Participation in SBP is lower than in NSLP due to reasons like early arrival requirements. Models like Breakfast in the Classroom have been encouraged to increase participation. The School Breakfast Program offers various meal delivery options, including \"grab and go\" carts and serving breakfast later in the day in middle and high schools. Commodity food assistance is not a formal part of SBP funding, but commodities from NSLP can be used for school breakfasts. Federal child nutrition programs provide subsidies and food assistance for schools, child care centers, and after-school programs. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) subsidizes meals and snacks for children, adults, and elderly in various care settings, including early childhood, day care, and after-school programs. Reimbursements are available for children age 12 or under, migrant children age 15 or under, children with disabilities, and adults in care centers. The program serves fewer children and spends less federal funds compared to school meal programs. CACFP provides federal reimbursements for meals and snacks served in child care centers, day care homes, and adult care centers. Child care centers have an average daily attendance of 56 children, day care homes have about 7 children, and adult day care centers care for an average of 48 adults. In FY2017, total CACFP spending exceeded $3.5 billion, with federal reimbursements flowing to providers either directly or through sponsors. Total CACFP spending in FY2017 was over $3.5 billion, covering cash reimbursement, commodity food assistance, and sponsor audits. The program also includes after-school meals and snacks through the \"at-risk after-school\" pathway. USDA updated CACFP's meal patterns for child care centers, day care homes, and preschool meals under NSLP and SBP, effective October 1, 2017. Changes included eliminating juice for infants, promoting breastfeeding, and increasing whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for older children. The new meal patterns in CACFP increased whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, limited sugar, and prohibited frying. Child care centers and adult day care centers can participate in CACFP. In FY2017, over 65,000 child care centers and 2,700 adult care centers participated in CACFP, serving millions of children and adults. Participating centers may receive daily reimbursements for meals and snacks for each participant. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides meals and snacks that meet federal nutrition standards for eligible participants. Eligibility is based on income levels, categorical eligibility programs, and foster child status. Meals and snacks are federally subsidized, with different reimbursement rates for breakfasts, lunches/suppers, and snacks. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides federally subsidized meals and snacks based on income levels. Reimbursement rates are set annually and vary depending on the participant's family income. Unlike school meals, CACFP institutions have discretion in pricing meals and can adjust regular fees to account for federal payments. Independent centers can charge separately for meals/snacks, with limitations on charges for those meeting income tests. CACFP-supported day care homes serve fewer children than centers, with roughly 17% of children in CACFP served through day care homes in FY2017. Approximately 103,000 homes with over 700 sponsors received CACFP support in FY2017. Payments to day care homes are provided for up to two meals and one snack or one meal and two snacks. Day care homes under CACFP must participate through a nonprofit sponsor with over 100 homes. Sponsors receive monthly payments based on the number of homes. Reimbursements for family day care homes vary based on Tier I or Tier II status, with cash reimbursements not tied to household income. Tier I homes are in low-income areas or operated by specific criteria. The HHFKA introduced new ways for family day care homes to qualify for low-income status and receive higher subsidies. Tier I providers serve low-income children and receive higher subsidy rates, while Tier II providers can seek Tier I rates for individual low-income children. Federal rules prohibit separate meal charges in family day care homes. The SFSP program provides meals for children during the summer months through cash reimbursements or federally donated commodity foods. Participating service institutions include schools, local governments, camps, colleges, universities, and private nonprofit organizations. The SFSP program is managed by sponsors who handle food preparation and administrative tasks at sites where meals are served. State agencies oversee sponsors and sites, with nearly 5,500 sponsors and 50,000 food service sites serving around 2.7 million children daily in FY2017. Program costs totaled over $485 million, with various eligibility and meal service options available. The SFSP program offers eligibility and meal service options for sponsors and sites, including open sites serving summer food to all community children based on area eligibility measures. Closed/enrolled sites provide free meals to enrolled children, with subsidies for summer camps based on household eligibility for free or reduced-price school meals. Other specified programs receive subsidies as well. The SFSP program provides subsidies for summer sponsors to serve meals and snacks to children, with operating cost subsidies and payments for administrative costs. Reimbursement rates vary based on location and meal preparation method. The Seamless Summer Option is another program option for providing meals during summer months. The Seamless Summer Option, part of NSLP or SBP programs, provides meals to students during summer at various sites. Schools are the only eligible sponsors, but can operate the program at other sites. Reimbursement rates are the same as NSLP/SBP rates. USDA-FNS has operated Summer EBT projects in limited states, providing electronic food benefits to eligible households. Summer EBT programs provide $30 or $60 per month through WIC or SNAP EBT cards as a supplement to Summer Food Service Program meals. These programs have shown significant impacts on reducing child food insecurity and improving nutritional intake. Funding for Summer EBT projects has been provided annually since 2011, with the most recent funding of $28 million in FY2018. The FY2018 appropriations law provided $28 million for Summer EBT programs, which served over 209,000 children in 2016. Schools can participate in the Special Milk Program to provide milk to children for free or at a subsidized price. In FY2017, institutions receive federal reimbursement for milk sold and provided free to eligible children. Over 41 million half-pints were subsidized, with 9.5% served free. Federal expenditures for this program were approximately $8.3 million. States also receive formula grants for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, providing funds for schools to distribute snacks regardless of family income. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) provides funding to states for schools to distribute snacks to all children, with a focus on those from low-income families. Funding is distributed based on a formula, with a set amount of $150 million for the 2011-2012 school year. States select participating schools and set grant amounts between $50 and $75 per student. The program is funded by a mandatory transfer of funds from USDA's Section 32 program, totaling approximately $184 million in FY2017. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) was permanently authorized and funded by the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004. The program has been amended by omnibus farm bill laws, with the 2008 farm bill expanding mandatory funding and allowing all states to participate. The 2014 farm bill included a pilot project testing frozen, dried, and canned fruits and vegetables, with the evaluation published in 2017. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) was expanded in the 2014 farm bill with a pilot project testing different forms of fruits and vegetables. Proposals to expand the program have been introduced in Congress. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provide federal support for after-school snacks, with NSLP offering reimbursements for snacks in low-income areas. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides assistance for after-school food through traditional CACFP and the CACFP At-Risk Afterschool program. Approximately 206 million snacks were served in FY2017 through CACFP, compared to nearly 4.9 billion lunches. The At-Risk After-School meals program was expanded under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, allowing centers in eligible areas to provide free snacks and suppers. In FY2017, the At-Risk Afterschool program served approximately 242.6 million free meals and snacks to over 1.7 million children daily. Federal child nutrition laws support various programs and initiatives, including State Administrative Expenses funding to help cover administrative costs for child nutrition programs. States receive federal grants equal to about 2% of child nutrition reimbursements, with the majority allocated based on program spending and 15% allocated under a discretionary formula for CACFP, commodity distribution, and Administrative Review efforts. In FY2017, states received federal grants for State Administrative Expenses to cover administrative costs for child nutrition programs, including CACFP, commodity distribution, and Administrative Review efforts. States have flexibility in allocating federal administrative expense payments among child nutrition initiatives. Team Nutrition, a USDA-FNS program, supports school meals initiatives focused on nutrition education and food content in schools, offering training grants to state agencies for implementing nutrition requirements and Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Farm-to-school programs aim to increase fruit and vegetable consumption among students, support local farmers, and provide nutrition education. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act established mandatory funding for competitive farm-to-school grants to promote healthy school environments. The FY2018 appropriations law provided $5 million in discretionary funding for farm-to-school grants to support schools and nonprofit entities in establishing programs that improve access to locally produced foods. Grants can be used for training, operations, equipment purchases, school gardens, partnerships, and program implementation. USDA's Office of Community Food Systems offers additional resources on farm-to-school issues. Additionally, USDA-FNS conducts periodic on-site evaluations to improve management and identify problems in the National School Lunch Program. The USDA-FNS and state agencies conduct various child nutrition program support activities with dedicated funding, including the Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN) receiving $5 million annually for technical assistance. USDA-FNS also provides food safety education training and conducts studies, training, and oversight for payment accuracy. Appendix B lists reimbursement rates for Child Nutrition Programs, adjusted for inflation annually according to program laws. New rates are announced in the Federal Register each year."
