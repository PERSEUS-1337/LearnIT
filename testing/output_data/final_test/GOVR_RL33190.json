    "content": "The controversy surrounding DREs and possible misperceptions in the debate can be categorized into questions about DREs themselves, paper audit trails, and recounts/audits. Issues with DREs were a minor concern during the 2004 and 2006 elections, with media reports highlighting various voting process difficulties. In 2004 and 2006, media reports highlighted malfunctions with DREs in Franklin County, Ohio, Carteret County, North Carolina, and Sarasota County, Florida. Glitches and procedural problems were reported in other states as well. Vote flipping and ballot total discrepancies were significant issues reported in 2006. In Florida's 13th congressional district, there was a discrepancy in ballot totals, likely due to faulty ballot design. A survey found that in 2004, 1.9 million voters cast provisional ballots nationwide, with different rules for counting them in each state. In Ohio, 22% of provisional ballots were not counted. In the 2004 election, 22% of provisional ballots in Ohio were not counted, totaling nearly 34,000 ballots. A survey of 761 local election officials reported that 26% of absentee ballots for military and overseas voters were not returned or disqualified. Long lines also hindered voters, with some waiting hours to cast their ballots. In the 2004 election, long lines impeded the voting process, leading to many voters abandoning lines without voting. Problems with voter registration and polling-place administration were commonly reported. The Election Incident Reporting System recorded 42,841 complaints about the 2004 election, with 11% related to voting machines. Optical scan systems, using paper ballots, were a major alternative to DREs in 2006, with almost half of voters using them. The difficulties reported in 2004 and 2006 were mainly related to electronic voting systems, specifically DREs. Media reports often confuse DREs with other systems, leading to public confusion. DREs have not undergone thorough scientific scrutiny and testing due to proprietary nature and confidentiality agreements with manufacturers. Testing is done as part of certification processes, but detailed results are not publicly available. The lack of detailed public results from federal and state certification processes for electronic voting systems, particularly DREs, has led to limited information availability. Some studies have focused on DREs made by manufacturers like Diebold, with HAVA establishing procedures involving NIST and the science community. This may increase scientists' involvement in studying DREs and election administration, exemplified by initiatives like the Voting Technology Project by the California Institute. The Voting Technology Project by the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with the involvement of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Research Council in election reform issues, have highlighted security vulnerabilities in DREs. These vulnerabilities stem from the reliance on a computer for voting, making it theoretically possible for hidden code to manipulate votes. Hidden computer code in DREs can manipulate votes by recording different votes from what the voter sees or changing totals after recording. Unlike optical scan or punchcard systems, DREs do not preserve the voter's ballot for independent verification. DREs, like lever machines, have hidden vulnerabilities that could result in lost or changed votes. The controversy lies in whether these vulnerabilities pose a significant risk in practice and what the appropriate response should be. Some claim that DRE design prevents vote manipulation, while others argue for more safeguards. Some argue that appropriate security measures can prevent tampering with DREs, while critics believe only a permanent paper ballot or independent verification can ensure election integrity. Experts acknowledge the difficulty of proving complete security but focus on making systems secure enough to minimize tampering risks. No confirmed reports of compromised elections due to security flaws have been reported. In 2004, there were no substantiated reports of compromised elections due to security flaws involving computer hacking. DRE malfunctions were mostly attributed to human errors, not security issues. One notable malfunction in Carteret County, North Carolina, resulted in the loss of 4,500 votes due to a lack of machine capacity oversight. A second election was required due to a close race in one county. In 2004, a rare second election was required in one county due to a close vote. An overcount issue in Franklin County, OH occurred when a laptop transmitted incorrect tallies from a DRE memory cartridge. The error was quickly corrected, attributed to a technical flaw in communication between the memory cartridge and the laptop. Controls were added to prevent future problems. The report discusses security challenges with DREs in Florida, including human interaction issues. Questionable behavior by poll workers and officials has been reported. Security measures should be tailored to each voting system type to prevent tampering and fraud, with concerns raised about the difficulty of detecting tampering with DRE software. Some experts and activists are concerned about the high threshold for investigating election fraud, leading to undetected tampering attempts. DREs have security flaws, particularly the risk of malware implantation by insiders, posing a major concern for election integrity. All voting systems have vulnerabilities, with about 60% susceptible to security issues. The integrity of elections is at risk due to security vulnerabilities in voting systems. DREs and optical scan systems have demonstrated vulnerabilities. DREs are favored due to accessibility requirements, but other threats to election integrity include voter-registration fraud, absentee-ballot fraud, and procedural errors. Most lost votes are due to voter registration, polling place, and usability issues, not security concerns. Experts argue that these flaws are a greater threat to election integrity than DRE security. DREs are diverse, introduced in the 1970s, with varying capabilities and features. Some argue that software attacks are the easiest threat to voting systems. Some DREs have accessibility features for persons with disabilities, while older models are more likely to have problems. Security features and vulnerabilities vary among types and models of DRE, so issues with one system may not apply to others. For example, the DREs that failed in Carteret County, NC were older models with limited computer memory. DREs, like the ones in Carteret County, NC, are computer-based systems subject to vulnerabilities but most issues stem from procedural errors rather than inherent weaknesses. When properly implemented, DREs can outperform older systems. The study found that DREs can significantly reduce the residual vote rate compared to other voting systems. Certification standards are important for security but are not enough on their own. The certification of voting systems under federal standards like VSS or VVSG is crucial for security, but it alone is not sufficient to protect against evolving security threats. The study highlighted that DREs, despite being certified, had security vulnerabilities, indicating the need for ongoing vigilance and updates in security measures. The evolving environment of information technology presents constant threats, making it unrealistic to rely solely on static certification standards to protect voting systems. The VVSG process certifies technology but neglects the importance of procedures and personnel in ensuring security. Balancing different functions and goals in standards often leads to compromises, potentially compromising security. While adding paper ballots is one solution to address vulnerabilities in DREs, alternative methods exist but none are foolproof. The VVPAT method provides a permanent record of votes that can be verified by the voter before casting the ballot. Other security methods like audio recordings and cryptographic techniques also offer voter verification options. However, these methods do not allow for verification after the ballot is cast. The use of cryptographic techniques in voting allows voters to verify that their ballot was counted correctly without compromising secrecy. This method also ensures that no ballots were altered, added, or removed improperly, enhancing transparency in the election process. Other security measures, such as product standards for secure computing, can further mitigate risks. The secret ballot ensures voter privacy, but cryptographic techniques can allow voters to verify their ballot. With VVPAT, voters can review a paper printout of their choices before casting the vote. Discrepancies can only be discovered by election officials after the election. True voter verifiability depends on state and local election laws. True voter verifiability in elections can be achieved without compromising ballot secrecy using cryptographic techniques. This allows voters to confirm their ballots were counted accurately without revealing their choices. Some VVPAT advocates believe paper ballots are more secure than DREs, but this has not been proven. Paper ballots have security advantages like durability and direct inspection, but also weaknesses such as easy manipulation by hand and vulnerability to malware when counted electronically. The evolution of voting security involves an arms race between new technologies to combat fraud and miscreants finding ways to attack them. From voice voting to paper ballots, ticket ballots, Australian secret ballot, and lever machines, each innovation aimed to prevent different types of fraud. Lever machines and DREs are examples of technologies that prevent ballot fraud. The use of voting technology such as lever machines and DREs can help prevent ballot fraud, including chain voting and other classic forms of fraud with paper ballots. However, these systems also have their own vulnerabilities, and recent technological advances have made tampering with paper ballots potentially easier. The evolution of voting systems suggests an ongoing arms race between security measures and fraudulent tactics. The evolution of voting systems indicates an arms race between security measures and fraudulent tactics. VVPAT may have exploitable vulnerabilities, and a simple reliance on technological solutions is unlikely to be successful. Effective security requires a layered approach with procedural and technological safeguards. A threat analysis found vulnerabilities in optical scan systems and DREs, with few jurisdictions implementing effective countermeasures. Random partial recounts and audits are useful but require paper, making them unavailable for DREs without VVPAT. Transparency in voting systems lacks a universally agreed definition. Transparency in elections is crucial for preventing tampering and ensuring integrity. Voter verifiability, often linked to transparency, can be achieved through paper ballots, but ballot secrecy limits their effectiveness. While paper ballots are not essential for transparency, the secret ballot remains important for preventing fraud and coercion in voting. VVPAT is crucial for preventing fraud and coercion in voting by providing transparency. It allows voters to verify their choices without compromising ballot secrecy. However, there is a potential risk of compromising ballot secrecy if the order of voters using a DRE is tracked. Countermeasures can be implemented to address this vulnerability. Possible countermeasures to combat the vulnerability of compromising ballot secrecy include implementing accessible voting machines for voters with disabilities. This is particularly important for absentee or mail-in ballots, which have posed challenges for disabled voters in the past. Accessible voting machines are crucial for voters with disabilities to ensure secrecy and verifiability. However, current DREs with paper audit trails pose challenges for certain disabled voters. Senator Christopher Dodd highlighted the issue of denying disabled individuals the right to verify their ballot due to the reliance on paper. Solving accessibility problems with paper ballots may require additional technology. Paper ballots can be made accessible with additional technology like electronic reading aids. Vote-by-phone, used in some states, produces a printed ballot that can be scanned and read back for verification. The VVPAT system adds complexity to DRE voting and election administration. Testing of VVPAT in public elections has been limited. The VVPAT system adds complexity to DRE voting and election administration. Most states now require all voting systems to produce paper ballots, but there are drawbacks cited by critics such as added cost, lack of data on performance, and technology problems. Reports of jammed printers in 2004 raised concerns, and research suggests voters do not use the paper trail effectively. Implementation issues could cast doubt on VVPAT's ability to serve as the official ballot record for recounts. An election recount is conducted to confirm a close or disputed election result by examining voted ballots. Recounts vary by state and can be triggered by irregularities, evidence of questionable results, or a candidate's formal request. Audits, on the other hand, involve a comprehensive review of the voting process to ensure accuracy, including examining voting machine performance and vote totals. An audit of the election process can review vote totals, chain of custody for voting equipment and ballots, registration lists, and vote-counting procedures. Some suggest using the paper print-out as the official ballot for accuracy, while others argue for using the entire audit trail to resolve discrepancies. Printer-jamming and other issues may also impact the audit process. Some VVPAT proposals suggest hand recounts of paper ballots to ensure accuracy in the event of discrepancies. Recounting entire precincts may be necessary to detect irregularities effectively. The number of ballots recounted should be sufficient to detect inaccuracies and serve as a deterrent to potential issues. Random partial recounts can effectively deter fraud in computer-assisted voting systems. VVPAT proposals often require hand recounts of paper ballots for accuracy, but machines are generally more accurate than humans in counting ballots. Machine accuracy is higher when ballot choices are printed, while humans tend to make more errors in repetitive tasks like counting ballots. Machines may struggle with judging voter intent if markings are unclear or outside machine parameters, leading to miscounts from miscalibration or malware. Most states required paper ballot records by 2006, except Maryland and Georgia. As more states use VVPAT, studies will reveal its effectiveness, cost, and limitations. Misperceptions about DREs could impact policy decisions on requiring VVPAT for all electronic voting machines. Congress could consider proposals to require VVPAT for all electronic voting machines, addressing issues such as lack of information, potential conflicts with HAVA requirements, and voter confidence. One argument for VVPAT is to restore voter confidence in the election process, but there is little evidence that it actually affects voter confidence. Mandating security requirements like VVPAT can lead to innovation, but there is a risk that these requirements may not be effective. Congress should examine the reasons for any decline in voter confidence before enacting legislation on this issue. There is a risk that requirements for VVPAT may hinder other innovative security measures without additional legislation. Congress should ensure that voting system regulations do not impede innovation."
