    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Las Vegas Wash Wetlands Restoration and Lake Mead Water Quality Improvement Act of 2000\". It aims to improve water quality in Lake Mead. The Las Vegas Wash is a vital desert wetland ecosystem fed by treated effluent, urban runoff, and flood events from the Las Vegas Valley. A healthy ecosystem in the Wash would enhance water quality in the Las Vegas Bay, Lake Mead, and the lower Colorado River, crucial habitats for endangered species. Concerns about water quality in Lake Mead include the transmission of contaminants to the Colorado River through the Las Vegas Wash. The Las Vegas Wash wetland, fed by treated effluent and urban runoff, is deteriorating due to various factors like flash floods and polluted groundwater seepage from an industrial complex. This erosion is impacting wildlife habitat and the unique wetland environment. The Las Vegas Wash wetland is experiencing deterioration due to factors like flash floods and polluted groundwater seepage. A committee was formed in 1998 to establish an adaptive management plan for the wetland, which was approved in January 2000 after an extensive public process. The Las Vegas Wash wetland restoration plan was approved by the Southern Nevada Water Authority Board. The plan involves a partnership among Federal, State, and local agencies for the restoration project. The Act aims to recognize the importance of restoring the wetland for water quality in the Colorado River and authorizes funding for Federal agencies to carry out specific tasks. The approved wetland restoration plan involves Federal agencies partnering with State and local agencies for the project in Las Vegas Wash. Funding is authorized for specific tasks to improve water quality in the Colorado River. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
