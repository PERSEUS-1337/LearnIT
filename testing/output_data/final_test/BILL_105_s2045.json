    "content": "The Act titled \"Improved Military Medical Plan Act\" includes certain covered beneficiaries in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The \"Improved Military Medical Plan Act\" allows eligible beneficiaries to enroll in any health benefits plan under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, offering medical care comparable to authorized care. Administering Secretaries will enter into an agreement with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to implement this option. The \"Improved Military Medical Plan Act\" allows eligible beneficiaries, including members of the uniformed services and their dependents entitled to benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, to enroll in FEHBP plans without meeting chapter 89 eligibility criteria. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with administering Secretaries, will determine the areas where beneficiaries must reside for enrollment. The Director, in consultation with administering Secretaries, will select areas where eligible beneficiaries can enroll in FEHBP plans. At least six regions under the TRICARE program, including one with a site of the medicare subvention demonstration project, will be included. Eligible beneficiaries nationwide will have the opportunity to enroll in an FEHBP plan within a year of the required report submission. Enrolment priority is based on the order of submission by beneficiaries. The administering Secretaries will maintain a list of eligible beneficiaries who apply to enroll in an FEHBP plan but cannot due to lack of funds. Beneficiaries on the list can resubmit their application when opportunities for enrollment expand. A 90-day enrollment period will be provided before care availability begins. An eligible beneficiary must continuously participate in a Federal Employees Health Benefits program plan for three years from the start of enrollment. If participation is discontinued before the three-year period ends, reenrollment is not allowed. An eligible beneficiary enrolled in an FEHBP plan can receive care at a military medical treatment facility, with reimbursement by the plan for the treatment cost. The plan may adjust copayments so that receiving care at a military facility does not incur additional costs. Contributions are required for beneficiaries enrolling in an FEHBP plan under this section. The eligible beneficiary enrolled in an FEHBP plan is treated as a Federal Government employee for contribution purposes. The administering Secretary is responsible for government contributions, and beneficiaries must contribute as if they were Federal employees. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management manages the participation of eligible beneficiaries in FEHBP plans. The Director and administering Secretaries ensure no adverse financial impact on Federal employees and annuitants in FEHBP plans. Reporting requirements include an annual report to Congress on healthcare services provided to eligible beneficiaries in the preceding fiscal year. The annual report to Congress includes information on the utilization and costs of healthcare services for eligible beneficiaries in the uniformed services, comparing costs to both beneficiaries and the government. The annual report to Congress includes information on the utilization and costs of healthcare services for eligible beneficiaries in the uniformed services, comparing costs to both beneficiaries and the government. The report also assesses the effects of alternative health care options on cost, access, and utilization rates within the health care system of the uniformed services, as well as comparing TRICARE Standard to the Federal Employees Health Benefits program for medical care coverage similarity. The administering Secretaries will submit a report to Congress within 3 years, assessing the advisability of offering a health care option nationwide or limiting it to current FEHBP plan enrollees. They will also recommend whether to expand the availability of the health care option. The administering Secretaries will assess expanding the health care option to all uniformed services members and dependents, regardless of entitlement to Medicare benefits, or maintaining the current TRICARE Standard option if it offers similar coverage. The Comptroller General will assess the recommendation to expand health care coverage for uniformed services members and dependents under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. The assessment will include estimated costs and recommendations.
