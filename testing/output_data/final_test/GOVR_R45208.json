    "content": "Daylight Saving Time (DST) in the United States is a period between spring and fall when clocks are set one hour ahead of standard time. Congressional interest in the benefits and costs of DST has led to changes in observance. Congress may consider further changes to DST or standard time, as well as examining potential effects. The report includes a history of DST in the US, effects, state actions, and federal legislation in the 115th Congress. The development of standard time zones in the United States was influenced by the creation of railroads. In 1918, Congress passed the Standard Time Act, establishing five time zones including one for Alaska. The act also authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission to set time zone boundaries and implement daylight saving time starting on the last Sunday of March. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 mandated standard time within established time zones and introduced daylight saving time to begin on the last Sunday of March and end on the last Sunday in October. This act was a result of the confusion caused by the lack of nationwide consistency in time observance, leading to the recommendation by the Interstate Commerce Commission for Congress to reexamine the field of standard time. States were given the option to exempt themselves from daylight saving time. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 mandated standard time within time zones and introduced daylight saving time to start on the last Sunday of March and end on the last Sunday in October. States could exempt themselves from DST, but if they observed it, time changes had to align with established dates. The Department of Transportation took over implementation from the ICC in 1966. The Uniform Time Act was amended in 1972 to allow states split between time zones to exempt either the whole state or part of it. Some states and territories do not observe DST. Year-round DST has been temporarily implemented twice in the US. In 1942, Congress enacted a law known as \"War Time\" to institute year-round DST, advancing the standard time by one hour in each time zone until six months after the war. War Time ended in September 1945. During the 1973 oil embargo, the Emergency Daylight Saving Time Energy Conservation Act of 1973 established a trial period of year-round DST from January 1974 to April 1975. Congress made additional changes to DST regulations over the years. Congress has made changes to DST regulations over the years, including starting DST on the first Sunday in April in 1986 and changing it to the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November in 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required a report on the impact of extended DST on energy consumption. Additionally, P.L. 106-564 increased the number of standard time zones in the U.S. to nine, creating Chamorro standard time for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. In 2007, the 110th Congress enacted the America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69), which made changes to the Uniform Time Act regarding Standard Time in the United States, including a change to Idaho's time zone. Support and opposition to extending DST observance focus on economic activity and potential negative effects on golf courses, ski resorts, and schoolchildren's commutes. Studies have been conducted on DST's effects on safety, energy savings, and health. Studies mandated by Congress have evaluated the effects of Daylight Saving Time (DST) on safety, energy savings, and health. The Department of Transportation (DOT) provided an interim evaluation in 1974 and a final report in 1975, which found inconclusive results regarding the benefits or harms of year-round DST. DOT suggested that modest benefits could be realized by shifting to year-round DST in terms of energy conservation, traffic safety, and reduced violent crime. The Department of Transportation (DOT) reported that potential benefits of year-round Daylight Saving Time (DST) would be minimal and difficult to distinguish from seasonal variations and energy price fluctuations. Congress directed the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) to evaluate the DOT study, finding no significant energy savings or differences in traffic fatalities. NBS noted an increase in fatalities among school-age children in the mornings during a specific period but stated that this increase cannot be solely attributed to DST. The Department of Transportation (DOT) found minimal benefits of year-round Daylight Saving Time (DST) with no significant energy savings or differences in traffic fatalities. A study on school-age children fatal accidents in the morning for March and April showed no statistical difference between 1973 and 1974. Congress directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to evaluate potential energy savings from extending DST, which resulted in a report showing minimal electricity and energy savings in 2007. In 2007, extended Daylight Saving Time (DST) in the United States resulted in minimal electricity savings, representing 0.02% of total energy consumption. Northern regions saw larger electricity savings compared to southern regions. Studies have shown conflicting results on the impact of DST on electricity use, with some indicating increased demand in subtropical regions. Several studies have examined potential health effects related to the semiannual changing of the clock per DST. Harrison (2013) found a cumulative effect of sleep loss during the spring and fall transition periods. Jiddou et al. (2013) observed transient increases and decreases in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with transitions to and from DST. A 2015 study suggested that specific subgroups may have a higher risk for AMI during DST. States can exempt themselves from DST but cannot change time zones or alter the length of DST. Under the Standard Time Act of 1918, as amended by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, moving a state or area within a state to a different time zone requires DOT regulation. Requests for time zone changes can only be made by certain political authorities, such as county commissioners or the state governor. The decision to change time zones is based on the area's convenience of commerce and transportation factors. The convenience of commerce is broadly defined to include factors like shipment of goods, broadcast origins, residents' activities, transportation hubs, and economic elements. DOT evaluates requests for time zone changes based on statutory criteria, holds public hearings, reviews comments, and implements changes if requirements are met. States cannot unilaterally change time zones. Several states have proposed legislation to establish permanent DST or permanent standard time since 2015, including Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Washington, and Wyoming. Idaho's proposal would only apply to certain counties if Washington moves to Mountain Standard Time and exempts itself from DST. Louisiana also introduced similar legislation in previous years. In 2015, legislation was introduced in Louisiana, seeking to make DST permanent standard time. New England states like Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island have proposed year-round DST. Some states aim for permanent DST, while others aim for permanent standard time. 17 states, including Alabama, California, Florida, and Washington, have proposed legislation for permanent standard time since 2015. In several states, legislators have proposed permanent DST or permanent standard time legislation. Some states have also introduced bills to study the effects of DST. Florida's H.B. 1013, the Sunshine Protection Act, was approved in 2018 for year-round DST if Congress allows it. Congress is considering changes to DST observance or standard time with four bills introduced in the 115th Congress. In the 115th Congress, four bills have been introduced to make changes to standard time. The Sunshine State Act and the Sunshine Protection Act of 2018 aim to make daylight saving time permanent in Florida and most states by advancing standard time one hour. Congressional interest may focus on the benefits and costs of year-round DST compared to current observance. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce requested updated information on Daylight Saving Time (DST) and standard time to understand the policy factors associated with changing between the two."
