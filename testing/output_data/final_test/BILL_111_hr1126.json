    "content": "The \"Artist-Museum Partnership Act of 2009\" allows for charitable contributions of items created by the taxpayer. The \"Artist-Museum Partnership Act of 2009\" allows for charitable contributions of literary, musical, or artistic compositions with special rules for determining the fair market value of the property contributed. A qualified artistic charitable contribution refers to a donation of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly compositions created by the taxpayer at least 18 months prior to the contribution. The taxpayer must also obtain a qualified appraisal of the fair market value of the property. A qualified artistic charitable contribution requires the taxpayer to attach a copy of the appraisal to their income tax return for the taxable year. The donee organization must be described in subsection (b)(1)(A) and use the property in a way related to its exempt purpose under section 501. The taxpayer must receive a written statement from the donee ensuring compliance with the donation provisions. The written appraisal should show evidence of similar property owned and displayed by qualifying organizations. The increase in the deduction under this section for any taxable year shall not exceed the taxpayer's artistic adjusted gross income for that year and cannot be carried over to the next year. The term 'artistic adjusted gross income' is defined within this paragraph. The term 'artistic adjusted gross income' refers to the portion of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income attributed to income from personal efforts in creating property similar to donated property, and income from teaching or similar activities related to such property. This definition excludes certain contributions like letters or memoranda. The amendment specifies that for qualified artistic charitable contributions, the tangible composition and its copyright are treated as separate properties. This amendment applies to contributions made after the enactment of the Act. Contributions made after the enactment of this Act in taxable years ending after such date."
