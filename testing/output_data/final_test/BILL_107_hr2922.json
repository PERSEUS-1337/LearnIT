    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bulk Cash Smuggling Act of 2001\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. The Congress finds that effective enforcement of currency reporting requirements has led drug dealers and criminals to avoid traditional financial institutions, forcing them to move large quantities of cash through airports and border crossings for smuggling. The transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form is a common method of money laundering and a warning sign of various crimes. Large amounts of currency moved to circumvent reporting laws are equivalent to smuggling goods and contribute to criminal proceeds laundering efforts. The smuggling of bulk cash is a critical part of criminal activity and can be effectively disrupted by confiscating the cash. Current penalties for currency reporting violations are insufficient to deter money laundering, and making bulk cash smuggling itself an offense could allow for the confiscation of the cash as evidence. The Act aims to criminalize bulk cash smuggling, authorize forfeiture of smuggled cash and other property involved, emphasize the seriousness of the offense, and provide guidelines for forfeiture amounts. SEC. 3. BULK CASH SMUGGLING INTO OR OUT OF THE UNITED STATES. Enactment of Bulk Cash Smuggling Offense in the United States involves concealing more than $10,000 in currency to evade reporting requirements and transporting it across borders, leading to a criminal offense. Within the United States, concealing currency on a person or in belongings constitutes a smuggling offense with a penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and forfeiture of any property to the US government. The text discusses the forfeiture of property involved in criminal offenses, governed by the Controlled Substances Act. If the property is unavailable, a personal money judgment may be entered against the defendant. Civil forfeiture applies to property involved in violations or conspiracies. The forfeiture of property involved in criminal offenses under the Controlled Substances Act can be seized and forfeited to the United States. The procedures for seizure and forfeiture are governed by civil forfeiture rules in money laundering cases. Currency or monetary instruments concealed in violation of the law, along with related items used for concealment or transportation, are considered involved in the offense. The currency or monetary instruments involved in criminal offenses can be seized and forfeited to the United States. The court may reduce the forfeiture if it is shown that the funds were from a legitimate source and intended for lawful purposes, and the amount is not grossly disproportional to the offense's gravity. Factors considered include aggravating and mitigating circumstances related to the offense. The gravity of the offense is determined by factors such as the value of currency involved, efforts to conceal transactions, and whether it is part of a pattern of violations. The table of sections for subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to reflect these considerations. SEC. 4. FORFEITURE IN CURRENCY REPORTING CASES. 5331. Bulk cash smuggling into or out of the United States. The court must order the defendant to forfeit all property involved in certain violations of the law, following procedures similar to those in the Controlled Substances Act. Civil forfeiture allows for the seizure of property related to these violations. The court may seize and forfeit property involved in violations or conspiracies, following procedures similar to civil forfeitures in money laundering cases. If the property owner proves by a preponderance of evidence that the currency was from a legitimate source and intended for lawful purposes, the court will reduce the forfeiture to a proportionate amount. \"In determining the amount of forfeiture, the court considers aggravating and mitigating factors related to the offense, including the value of currency involved, efforts to conceal property, and whether the offense is part of a pattern of violations of Federal law.\" Amendments to sections 981(a)(1)(A) and 982(a)(1) of title 18, United States Code, involve striking references to specific sections of title 31. Amendments to sections 981(a)(1)(A) and 982(a)(1) of title 18, United States Code involve interstate currency couriers. Amendment to Section 1957 of title 18, US Code adds a new subsection (g) regarding concealing over $10,000 in currency during interstate transportation for unlawful activities, punishable under subsection (b). Knowledge of currency source or intended use can be proven through willful blindness. For the purposes of this subsection, concealing currency on a person includes hiding it in clothing or containers worn or carried by the individual."
