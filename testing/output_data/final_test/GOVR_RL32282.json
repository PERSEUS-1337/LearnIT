    "content": "Before February 1993, the Clinton Administration refused to send ground forces to UN Protection Force in Bosnia. However, they later adopted a policy to provide troops for overseeing peace implementation. During the 1994 peace negotiations in Dayton, OH, officials laid out the rationale for U.S. participation in a NATO-led peace implementation force for Bosnia. President Clinton emphasized a moral responsibility to end the conflict. The Presidents of Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia signed a peace agreement in Paris on December 14, 1995, to end the Bosnian conflict. The agreement included military elements such as the establishment of IFOR, withdrawal of forces behind cease-fire lines, demilitarized zones, arms reduction negotiations, and NATO sending IFOR troops to enforce the agreement. The IFOR designation changed to Stabilization Force on December 20, 1996. The Stabilization Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR on December 20, 1996, with a mission to deter hostilities, stabilize peace, and support civil implementation plans in Bosnia. NATO authorized SFOR operations, which include maintaining a military presence, preventing hostilities, and operating Joint Military Committees. SFOR's mission includes deterring hostilities, stabilizing peace, supporting civil implementation plans, ensuring force protection, and enforcing compliance with the Dayton Accords. Key tasks include supporting the High Commissioner, implementing arbitration decisions, assisting with elections and the return of displaced persons, and supporting international criminal tribunal efforts. SFOR supports the International Criminal Tribunal, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and International Police Task Force. They detain suspected war criminals and have increased their role in detaining indicted suspects since 1997. Refusal to apprehend suspects earlier led to criticism from the War Crimes Tribunal and human rights advocates. SFOR has played a more active role in detaining indicted suspects since 1997, resulting in over half of those indicted for war crimes currently being in custody. Former Bosnian Serb leaders Karadzic and Mladic remain at large. NATO authorized the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in December 1996 to last until June 1998 due to concerns about the lack of progress in civilian reconstruction and continued ethnic friction in Bosnia. There was little optimism for a viable national state or economy by the end of 1997. The fragile government institutions and ethnic antagonisms in Bosnia require a substantial international military force to prevent further warfare. NATO re-authorized SFOR in March 1998, tying its deployment to specific benchmarks for implementing the Dayton Accords in hopes of encouraging cooperation. Some suggest permanent NATO troop presence in Bosnia due to the region's threat to European security. Some endorse extended SFOR in Bosnia to prevent ethnic warfare and maintain U.S. security interests. NATO's credibility is at stake if peace is not achieved. Concerns in Congress about indefinite military commitment led to provisions in the FY1999 DOD Authorization Act. The FY1999 DOD Authorization Act (P.L. 105-261) established reporting requirements for Bosnia operations, including the potential withdrawal of U.S. ground forces and the possibility of a NATO-led force without U.S. troops. Presidential reports are required every six months on deployment duration, progress on Dayton Accord benchmarks, paramilitary police force status, U.S. mission details, costs, and risks assessment. Costs for nations contributing to IFOR/SFOR operations include their own deployment and operations expenses. Incremental costs for U.S. ground forces in Bosnia since FY1996 have been covered through various funding sources within DOD budget accounts to maintain a balanced budget. The Administration requested emergency appropriations for FY1998/FY1999 funding for Bosnia to raise the cap on defense spending. Congress had previously directed that Bosnia costs be within annual defense spending caps, but the FY1999 DOD Authorization Act granted emergency appropriations status, capping spending for Bosnia operations at $1,858,600,000. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided full supplemental funding for Bosnia operations as an emergency appropriation, capping spending at $1,858,600,000. Funding for Bosnia for FY2000 and FY2001 was provided through the Overseas Contingency Operations Fund. Starting from FY2002, Bosnia and Kosovo operations were funded through individual service budgets, not the Overseas Contingency Fund. Other Bosnia-related operations include Able Sentry, Deny Flight, Sharp Guard, and Provide Promise. The current U.S. SFOR contingent in Bosnia is about 1,800 troops, with forces headquartered in the Tuzla area. British forces are in Gornii Vakuf, French forces in Mostar, and other national contingents are under NATO command in Sarajevo. The full Stabilization Force totals around 12,000 troops. Troop rotations for SFOR are scheduled through May 2005, with National Guard Divisions leading six of the eight 6-month rotations. The full Stabilization Force in Bosnia consists of about 12,000 troops. Pressure to withdraw U.S. troops has increased due to Iraq military operations, with European NATO allies urged to take full responsibility. NATO allies argue that non-U.S. forces make up nearly 80% of SFOR and stress the importance of continued U.S. presence. Discussions in February suggested a one-third reduction in SFOR troops in 2004, with ongoing consultations on U.S. participation. The European Union is expected to take over Bosnian peacekeeping operations in 2005, with a contingent comprising military and police personnel. Kosovo, once an autonomous province of Yugoslavia, has a 90% ethnic Albanian population and holds significance in Serbian nationalist tradition. Yugoslav President Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomous status, leading to armed resistance by the Kosovo Liberation Army and counter-insurgency operations by the Belgrade government in 1998. NATO leaders focused on Kosovo in 1998. In 1998, NATO leaders turned their attention to the Kosovo region due to the flow of refugees and concerns about the conflict spreading to neighboring countries. The North Atlantic Council considered various options to address the violent repression in Kosovo, including preventive deployments, no-fly zones, military intervention, and peacekeeping missions. On September 24, 1998, NATO authorized limited airstrikes in Kosovo, followed by an activation order on October 12. An agreement was negotiated with Serbian leader Milosevic to postpone airstrikes if certain conditions were met, but meaningful negotiations for Kosovar autonomy never occurred due to resistance from both sides. In January 1999, NATO allies authorized airstrikes in Yugoslavia if a peace settlement was not reached by February 20. The Contact Group proposed a peace settlement to restore Kosovo's autonomy within Yugoslavia, but the talks failed as the Serb government did not agree to the Rambouillet Agreement. In March 1999, NATO began airstrikes in Serbia and Kosovo due to escalating violence against ethnic Albanian civilians, without U.N. endorsement. NATO's actions were in response to the violation of the October agreement by Yugoslav Army and paramilitary troops, with additional Serb troops massing at the Kosovo border. NATO initiated airstrikes in Serbia and Kosovo in March 1999 to address violence against ethnic Albanian civilians. Article VII outlined conditions for ending the air campaign, including Serb withdrawal from Kosovo and acceptance of a NATO-led peacekeeping force. G-8 principles agreed upon in May 1999 included an immediate end to violence, deployment of international presences, and substantial self-government for Kosovo. On June 4, 1999, the Yugoslav government accepted the G-8 peace plan, leading to the phased withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo by June 20, 1999. NATO began air operations, known as Operation Allied Force, to target Yugoslav military infrastructure and protect Albanian Kosovars. The United Nations Security Council endorsed the peacekeeping mission under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter on June 10, 1999. NATO conducted air operations targeting Yugoslav military infrastructure to protect Albanian Kosovars. Attacks focused on airfields, air defense, communication centers, and logistical support facilities. Despite flying over 35,000 sorties and launching 23,000 munitions, the air campaign did not stop Serb operations in Kosovo. Critics questioned the decision to rely solely on airpower without using ground forces. NATO leaders believed airpower alone could achieve objectives in Kosovo, despite warnings of potential shortfalls. Critics argued that overemphasis on air power post-Gulf War led to neglect of ground forces. NATO's \"command by committee\" approach hindered effective decision-making and prioritized political considerations over military ones. Target lists, weapons, and forces required approval from all NATO governments, slowing operations. NATO officials defended their actions. NATO officials defended the consensual decision-making process for the air campaign in Kosovo, emphasizing political objectives over military ones. Key leaders recommended examining and streamlining NATO's decision-making processes for future military campaigns, but specific suggestions were not provided. Any changes would need to be accepted by all NATO members. NATO's current structure and procedures were designed for homeland defense against invasion, but out-of-area operations like Allied Force present different challenges. Suggestions for greater delegation of authority to NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe have not been accepted due to the alliance's consensus-based decision-making. Gen. Clarke emphasized the need for a strong political consensus and common military doctrine. Gen. Naumann defended NATO's planned limited operation in Kosovo, contrasting it with President Milosevic's war plans. NATO's air campaign in Kosovo was supported by some for achieving the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo without any combat fatalities. However, critics point out that it did not prevent the temporary expulsion of almost the entire Albanian population. The Department of Defense Joint Staff provided statistics on the 78-day air campaign, including a total of 37,200 sorties with the U.S. conducting 62% of them. On October 14, 2000, Secretary Cohen and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Shelton provided the Senate Armed Services Committee with DOD's initial \"lessons learned\" observations from the NATO air campaign in Kosovo. Issues addressed included disparities in capabilities between the U.S. and allies, complications in command and control structures, and the need for more efficient use of reserve forces. The DOD systems for transportation of forces were strained by evolving requirements. NATO's air defense suppression forces show the need for innovative electronic combat. Success in Kosovo validates plans to increase munitions inventories. Task Force Hawk emphasized the importance of independent force elements. Improvements in UAV mission planning, operator interaction, training, and equipment upgrades would enhance force effectiveness. Humanitarian operations underscored the need for resources like linguists and civil affairs. Humanitarian operations emphasized the importance of resources such as linguists, civil affairs personnel, engineering assets for emergency repairs, detailed maps, and prepositioned stocks. NATO members' efforts to address these concerns remain unclear. Military operations in Iraq highlighted issues like transportation of forces, improved UAV capabilities, and humanitarian/civil operations. Discussions on NATO ground force intervention were widespread during Operation Joint Guardian (KFOR) in Kosovo. The British government started advocating for ground troop deployment towards the end of the air campaign. The British government pushed for ground intervention during the air campaign in Kosovo, but failed to gain alliance-wide support. NATO focused on Operation Joint Guardian for peacekeeping with the acceptance of a Military-Technical Agreement by Yugoslavia. The UN Security Council endorsed the peace plan with resolution S/RES/1244. The UN Security Council passed resolution S/RES/1244 endorsing a peace plan and international security presence in Kosovo. KFOR delayed deployment to synchronize with Serb forces' withdrawal, allowing Russian troops to occupy Pristina airport. High-level U.S.-Russian negotiations led to shared control of the airport and deployment of Russian troops under unified KFOR command. The U.S., German, and French sectors were part of the unified KFOR command with Russian troops. Despite initial tensions, Russian troops were praised for their professionalism. Russia withdrew from KFOR operations in 2003 due to financial constraints. The KFOR Military Technical Agreement with the Belgrade government outlines terms for peace implementation, granting KFOR authority to maintain security and compel removal of forces or weapons if necessary. Failure to comply may result in military action. The KFOR commander has the final authority to interpret the Military Technical Agreement (MTA). Air and Ground Safety Zones extend beyond Kosovo's borders, and Yugoslav forces must withdraw by June 20, 1999, removing all obstacles. NATO reached an agreement with the Kosovo Liberation Army for its disbanding on the same date. The Kosovo Liberation Army agreed to disband in phases and comply with KFOR and U.N. directives. They also agreed to refrain from hostile acts and not carry weapons in specified areas. NATO and U.N. officials created the Kosovo Corps as a civilian force for emergency situations, but some KLA leaders see it as a future Kosovo army, a view rejected by NATO and U.N. officials. The United States is providing about 11% of the almost 22,000 troops stationed with KFOR. DOD has scheduled major unit rotations for KFOR through May 2005. NATO does not provide estimates of the overall cost of Operation Allied Force or each member's contributions. Each nation assumes the full cost of their deployments in support of ongoing KFOR operations. In April 1999, the Clinton Administration requested $6.05 billion for military operations in Kosovo and Southwest Asia. The House approved $14.9 billion in supplemental appropriations, with $10.8 billion defense-related. Actual FY1999 incremental costs for DOD were $3.0 billion. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concern about diverted funds from key military programs due to under-budgeted contingency operations in Kosovo. A provision in DOD's authorizing legislation prohibited the use of funds for military operations in Yugoslavia, but an amendment was introduced to remove this provision on June 9. Skelton introduced an amendment to remove the funding prohibition for military operations in Yugoslavia. The House agreed to remove the provision after receiving notice from President Clinton. A $2 billion supplemental appropriation for Kosovo was included in the FY2001 Military Construction Act. Congress has allocated approximately $2.8 billion for Kosovo operations from FY2002-FY2004. Bosnia and Kosovo operations are now funded through individual service budgets, not the Overseas Contingency Fund. Congressional reaction to military operations in both Bosnia and Kosovo was mixed. If current intentions are carried out, NATO forces, including U.S. troops, will be withdrawn from Bosnia by the end of 2004 and replaced by a European Union force. Monitoring the EU's mission performance and Bosnia's political stability will be the primary concerns. NATO troops may remain in Kosovo until the province's political future is determined. The province's political future in Kosovo may determine the need for NATO troops, including U.S. forces. The European Union could potentially take over peacekeeping duties in Kosovo, but only after evaluating its performance in Bosnia. Legislation has been passed to authorize military activities and appropriations for the Department of Defense in FY2004.
