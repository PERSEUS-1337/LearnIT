    "content": "The \"RFS Reform Act of 2013\" includes amendments to the Clean Air Act related to renewable fuel standards and regulations on gasoline containing more than 10-volume-percent ethanol. The \"RFS Reform Act of 2013\" amends the Clean Air Act to redefine renewable fuel as fuel produced from renewable biomass, used to replace fossil fuel in transportation, and classified as advanced biofuel starting in 2014. It also adjusts the description of fuel in relation to renewable fuel standards. The Clean Air Act is amended to adjust applicable volumes for renewable fuel standards, with changes in numerical values for different categories and years. The Clean Air Act is amended to adjust renewable fuel standards volumes for different categories and years, including changes from 2010 through 2022. The Clean Air Act is amended to adjust renewable fuel standards volumes for different categories and years, including changes from 2010 through 2022. Conforming amendments are made to specify cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel requirements. The Clean Air Act is amended to adjust renewable fuel standards volumes for different categories and years, including changes from 2010 through 2022. Amendments include waivers for advanced biofuels before 2014. SEC. 102. CELLULOSIC BIOFUEL REQUIREMENT BASED ON ACTUAL PRODUCTION. The Clean Air Act is amended to provide estimates of cellulosic biofuel volumes for the following year, based on actual production data. The Energy Information Administration will determine these estimates for each cellulosic biofuel production facility. The Clean Air Act is amended to provide estimates of cellulosic biofuel volumes for the following year, based on actual production data from January 1 to October 31 of the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration will determine the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility during this period. The Clean Air Act requires the Energy Information Administration to estimate the annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility in the current calendar year. This includes determining the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by facilities that start production after January 1. The Clean Air Act mandates the Energy Information Administration to estimate the annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility in the current calendar year, based on the actual volume produced from initial production to October 31. The Clean Air Act requires the Energy Information Administration to estimate the annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility in the current calendar year. This estimation includes the projected volume for the following year based on the total production from all facilities in the current year. The Clean Air Act mandates the Energy Information Administration to estimate annual cellulosic biofuel production volume for each facility. This includes projecting the next year's volume based on current year's total production. Section 211(o)(7)(D)(i) is amended to reduce the applicable volume using the exact volume, shall also reduce, and by the same volume. SEC. 103 amends the Clean Air Act to require a reduction in applicable volume of renewable fuel. SEC. 104 specifies that these amendments apply from 2014 onwards, with regulations to be implemented within a year. TITLE II--GASOLINE CONTAINING GREATER THAN 10-VOLUME-PERCENT ETHANOL\n\nSEC. 201. PROHIBITION OF GASOLINE BLENDS WITH GREATER THAN 10-VOLUME-PERCENT ETHANOL. The EPA Administrator cannot authorize gasoline with over 10% ethanol.\n\nSEC. 202. PROHIBITION OF WAIVERS. Any waiver granted under section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air Act before the date of enactment of this Act allowing gasoline with over 10-volume-percent ethanol for use in vehicles shall be void. This includes specific waivers like the ones granted to Growth Energy for increasing ethanol content to 15 percent. The Administrator decided to increase the allowable ethanol content of gasoline to 15 percent, as stated in the Federal Register on January 26, 2011. SEC. 203. MISFUELING RULE. The rule to mitigate misfueling of vehicles with gasoline containing over 10% ethanol will no longer be effective 60 days after the enactment of this Act."
