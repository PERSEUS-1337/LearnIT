    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new tax credit for first-time homebuyers in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The new tax credit for first-time homebuyers allows for a 10% credit on the purchase price of a principal residence, not exceeding $2,500. The credit is limited to one residence per taxpayer, and for married couples filing jointly, both spouses must be first-time homebuyers to qualify. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers is limited to $2,500 or 10% of the total purchase price of the residence for individuals purchasing a new principal residence together. Each individual must be a first-time homebuyer, and the credit amount will be divided among them as per regulations. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers is limited to $2,500 or 10% of the total purchase price of the residence for individuals purchasing a new principal residence together. The credit allowed in the taxable year of purchase cannot exceed the tax imposed by this chapter, reduced by other allowable credits. Any unused credit can be carried forward for up to 5 years after the purchase year. Fifty percent of the credit is allowed in the year of purchase. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers is limited to $2,500 or 10% of the purchase price of the residence. The credit is split, with fifty percent allowed in the year of purchase and the remaining fifty percent in the following year. Definitions for \"purchase price\" and \"first-time homebuyer\" are provided for clarity. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers is limited to $2,500 or 10% of the purchase price of the residence. An interest in a partnership, S corporation, or trust that owns a residence is not considered for this credit. Special rules apply for certain acquisitions. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers is limited to $2,500 or 10% of the purchase price of the residence. Special rules apply for certain acquisitions, such as when the residence is acquired from a person with a disallowance of losses relationship or when the basis of the residence is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of the previous owner. Recapture rules apply for certain dispositions of property purchased with the credit. If a taxpayer disposes of property purchased with a credit within 36 months of acquiring it as their principal residence, the tax imposed for that year is increased by the amount of the credit. If the taxpayer purchases a new principal residence within the applicable period after the disposition, the tax for the year of purchase is increased by the amount of the credit that could have been claimed. The credit claimed on the purchase of a new residence may be less than the amount claimed by the taxpayer. Exceptions include a disposition due to the death of the owner or destruction of the old residence by a casualty or involuntary conversion. The provisions of this section apply to a principal residence if the taxpayer acquires the residence during 1993 or enters into a binding contract during 1993 to acquire the residence and occupies it before July 1, 1994. Effective January 1, 1993, first-time homebuyers can purchase a principal residence under this section."
