    "content": "The role of prevention in improving healthcare quality through expanded coverage of preventive services is a key topic of discussion. Preventive services can greatly improve patients' health by addressing burdens of disease and premature death from unhealthy behaviors. Chronic diseases burden older Americans and increase costs for Medicare. Without changes in federal law, healthcare spending is projected to rise significantly. The rising costs of federal health insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are projected to increase significantly in the coming years. Stakeholders debate whether expanding coverage or utilization of preventive services would save money for Medicare. While some preventive services may improve patient health and save costs, most add to healthcare expenses. The effectiveness of these services in terms of cost-effectiveness is a topic of ongoing discussion. Preventive measures are cost-effective depending on the intervention and targeted population. Expensive screening tests for the general population may not provide significant clinical benefit. However, interventions for high-risk populations can yield greater value and even save money for the healthcare system. Medicare law covers services for diagnosis and treatment of illness, while legislation is required for coverage of preventive services. Medicare law outlines specific criteria for preventive services, considering factors like screening tests, age, and risk profiles. Congress seeks expert advice to determine the effectiveness and benefits of preventive services for Medicare coverage. Current coverage may not always align with evidence-based recommendations from expert panels like the USPSTF. Administrative authority allows the Secretary of HHS to add coverage for additional preventive services in Medicare. The Medicare program relies on expert advice, like the USPSTF, to determine coverage for preventive services. Recent attention has been on the role of advisory panels in Medicare coverage decisions. Congressional actions have expanded coverage for clinical preventive services under Medicare, including a comprehensive health assessment for new beneficiaries. Administrative authority allows the Secretary of HHS to add coverage for additional preventive services in Medicare. This report discusses how Medicare makes coverage decisions for preventive services, advisory groups like the USPSTF, cost control, utilization, legislative proposals for reform, and a comparison of Medicare coverage with USPSTF recommendations. Medicare is a federal insurance program that pays for covered health care. Medicare is a federal insurance program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, as well as permanently disabled individuals under 65. It covers various health care services including hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and consists of four parts (A through D). Most individuals aged 65 or older are automatically entitled to premium-free Medicare Part A for hospitalizations, while enrollment in Medicare Part B for preventive services is voluntary. Medicare Part B, which covers preventive services, is voluntary and requires a monthly premium. To choose Medicare Advantage (Part C), individuals must have Part A and be enrolled in Part B. Part B includes coverage for preventive services like screenings, vaccinations, and certain tests. Beneficiaries are responsible for an annual deductible and 20% of the costs of covered services. Medicare Advantage (MA, Medicare Part C) offers an alternative way to obtain covered services through private health plans that are paid a per-person amount to provide Medicare covered benefits to enrollees. Participating MA plans must cover all services covered by original Medicare (except hospice), including Part B benefits, but may also offer coverage of additional services and have considerable flexibility in how they apply or waive cost-sharing. MA plans cover some preventive services not covered by original Medicare, with potentially lower cost-sharing for these services. Medicare Advantage plans offer additional preventive services such as dental, vision, and hearing benefits, chiropractic and podiatry benefits, and health education. Historically, Medicare has excluded coverage for routine physical checkups, cosmetic surgeries, hearing aids, eyeglasses, routine foot care, routine dental care, and most immunizations. Preventive services were initially excluded from Medicare coverage when the program was established in 1965. According to the IOM, preventive services were initially excluded from Medicare coverage in 1965 due to not fitting the traditional insurance model. Legislation was required to add coverage of preventive services to Medicare Part B until recently. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 expanded coverage of specified preventive services under Part B. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA, P.L. 110-275) granted the Secretary of HHS limited authority to add coverage for new preventive services administratively starting in 2009. Congress has expanded coverage of existing benefits by increasing eligibility, coverage frequency, and incorporating new screening technologies. Some preventive services have had beneficiary cost-sharing requirements eliminated. The use of preventive service benefits by Medicare beneficiaries is optional. Statutory expansions of Medicare preventive services coverage include the Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE) and health risk appraisal for new Part B enrollees. The Secretary of HHS has administrative authority to add coverage for new preventive services. Medicare does not cover routine physical examinations for asymptomatic beneficiaries. The IPPE benefit was implemented in 2005 and had to be used within six months of enrollment. In 2008, Congress extended eligibility for the Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE) through the first year of enrollment. The IPPE includes a complete patient history, risk factor assessments, functional ability and safety reviews, and a physical examination. The Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE) in 2008 includes patient history, risk assessments, functional ability reviews, and physical examination. Additional services may include end-of-life planning information, education on chronic disease prevention, and tobacco cessation counseling. A written plan for screenings and preventive services is also provided. Some advocate for routine health care visits to coordinate prevention services for Medicare beneficiaries. CMS is currently conducting a Senior Risk Reduction Program demonstration to tailor health promotion programs for Medicare beneficiaries. MIPPA authorized the expansion of Medicare coverage for preventive services in 2009. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) authorized the expansion of Medicare coverage for preventive services in 2009. The Secretary can add coverage for preventive services through the National Coverage Determination (NCD) process if certain conditions are met, including the service being deemed reasonable and necessary, recommended by the USPSTF, and appropriate for Medicare beneficiaries. Cost considerations are also taken into account when determining coverage. The new authority allows the Secretary to extend coverage for preventive services if certain conditions are met, but routine beneficiary cost-sharing requirements would generally apply. The USPSTF strongly recommends HIV screening for at-risk individuals. CMS revised its regulations in 2008 to reflect the statutory change, and in 2009 began a national coverage analysis. In December 2009, CMS decided to cover voluntary annual HIV screening for Medicare beneficiaries with specified risk factors, effective immediately. CMS is also considering coverage analyses for alcoholism, depression screenings, aspirin therapy, and tobacco-cessation counseling. These services may not be consistently provided during a single encounter with a new Medicare patient. Providers may have difficulty providing all required elements of the IPPE and developing a thorough follow-up plan in a single reimbursed visit for Medicare patients with multiple chronic health conditions and behavioral risk factors. Medicare payment eligibility requires items or services to meet specific criteria, including falling within a defined benefit category, being reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or treatment, and not being statutorily excluded from coverage. The Secretary of HHS has the authority to determine what is medically reasonable and necessary, specifying covered items or services and conditions. Medicare coverage decisions for new technologies and procedures are made through National Coverage Determination (NCD) and Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs). Local contractors determine if a claim applies to a covered benefit and if the medical service is reasonable and necessary for Medicare coverage. According to CMS guidelines, a service must be safe, effective, and appropriate in duration and frequency to be considered medically necessary. LCDs are only binding within a contractor's local service area, leading to variations in Medicare coverage across states. The National Coverage Determination (NCD) process is used at the national level to issue policy statements on Medicare coverage for specific medical services. The Coverage and Analysis Group at CMS is responsible for making NCDs, with approximately 300 NCDs issued to date. NCDs can be initiated by external requests or internally by CMS. Under MIPPA, the Secretary can add coverage for preventive services through the NCD process if certain conditions are met. The agency may develop an internal NCD for a Medicare item or service if significant questions about health benefits arise, new evidence suggests policy changes, coverage policies are inconsistent, or program integrity concerns exist. Integrity concerns have been raised regarding existing local or national policies, such as variations in billing practices not related to clinical need. CMS has faced criticism for lack of transparency in its decision-making process for Medicare coverage determinations. Steps have been taken to increase transparency, including publishing coverage decisions on the website and establishing the Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC). Congress mandated requirements to improve the NCD process. Prior to the new authority in MIPPA, legislation was required to add Medicare Part B coverage for a new clinical preventive service. Since 1980, Congress has sought expert advice from federal agencies and the health care community for adding new clinical preventive services to Medicare coverage. Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has noted that the process for introducing new preventive benefits has been ad hoc. The process of adding new preventive benefits to Medicare coverage has been ad hoc, despite expert advice being sought. Various expert panels make recommendations on preventive services, but none provide detailed recommendations for benefits design, which remains the responsibility of Congress and the Secretary of HHS. The USPSTF, administered by the HHS Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, assesses the effectiveness of clinical preventive services. Congress granted explicit authority for the USPSTF in 1999. The USPSTF, established in 1999 under AHRQ, reviews scientific evidence on preventive services, grades them A or B for recommendation, and uses systematic reviews to assess their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The USPSTF is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The USPSTF recommends only services graded A or B for routine use in medical practice. Recent legislation has given the Secretary of HHS authority to expand Medicare coverage of preventive services recommended by the USPSTF. Pending health reform proposals may also authorize the Secretary to modify coverage and cost-sharing requirements based on USPSTF recommendations. Medicare coverage of preventive services for older adults may not always align with USPSTF recommendations. For example, Medicare does not cover certain recommended screenings, such as for sexually-transmitted infections or genetic screening for the \"breast cancer gene.\" There are also discrepancies, such as covering services that the USPSTF recommends against, like Prostate Specific Antigen testing for prostate cancer screening in older men. The USPSTF does not recommend PSA screening in older men due to insufficient evidence. In 2008, they found insufficient evidence to assess benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening in men under 75. They also advised against PSA screening in men aged 75 and older. In 2009, the USPSTF updated recommendations for screening mammography, giving a grade of C for women aged 40-49, no longer routinely recommended but based on individual risk assessments. The USPSTF recommends mammography screening for women aged 50-74 every two years, with insufficient evidence for those 75 and older. They emphasize individualized decision-making due to small benefits and potential harms. Considerations include false positives, unnecessary biopsies, and over-treatment of non-progressing cancers. The USPSTF faced criticism for no longer recommending routine mammography screening for women in their forties, with concerns raised about the revised recommendation being based on cost analysis. HHS Secretary Sebelius clarified that the USPSTF's recommendations do not determine federal policy or coverage of services. The USPSTF updated the language of its recommendation for women under 50 to emphasize provider consultation and individualized decision-making. The USPSTF mammography recommendation raised concerns about cost analysis. The group has not yet incorporated cost-effectiveness into its recommendations, which may lag behind current medical practice trends. The USPSTF's influence in the health care community is due to its rigorous evidentiary process, favoring strong evidence from well-controlled studies. Service delivery mechanisms have not been evaluated by the USPSTF. The USPSTF has not evaluated service delivery mechanisms or the effectiveness of routine physical examinations in improving health outcomes. Clinical trials for prostate cancer screening have not included men age 75 or older, limiting insights for this age group. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is a panel of experts in immunization and related fields, selected by the Secretary of HHS, who review scientific evidence and make recommendations to the Secretary and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding the routine administration of vaccines to children, adolescents, and adults in the U.S. civilian population. The ACIP is administered by CDC. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviews and advises on the use of vaccines in the U.S. civilian population. The ACIP considers cost-effectiveness in its recommendations. Medicare Part B covers influenza, pneumococcus, and hepatitis B vaccinations for older beneficiaries. Medicare Part D covers FDA-licensed vaccines with a prescription. The USPSTF defers to ACIP recommendations for immunizations, but new Medicare coverage for preventive services is limited to USPSTF recommendations. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services reviews population-based interventions and publishes recommendations in an electronic format. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services evaluates various interventions, including those not directly related to Medicare benefits such as alcohol control and seat belt laws. They also study ways to improve the delivery of clinical preventive services covered by Medicare, such as cancer screening, diabetes management, and depression care. The new authority in MIPPA allows the Secretary of HHS to add Medicare coverage for preventive services recommended by the USPSTF. Congress has tasked the NAS or IOM to evaluate the scientific merits of Medicare coverage for preventive services, such as skin cancer screening and medical nutrition therapy. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) advises Congress on Medicare program issues, including coverage recommendations for preventive services like skin cancer screening and medical nutrition therapy. MedPAC was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to examine various healthcare delivery and payment policies. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) advises Congress on Medicare program issues, including coverage recommendations for preventive services like vaccinations for older beneficiaries. MedPAC focuses on diagnostic and treatment services but has recently commented on the importance of including preventive services to promote primary care and improve care coordination. Medicare Part B covers influenza, pneumococcus, and hepatitis B vaccinations for older beneficiaries at high risk. MedPAC recommended that Congress permit coverage of preventive vaccinations under Medicare Part B instead of Part D to address difficulties physicians face in recouping costs for vaccines not covered under Part B. MEDCAC advises CMS on Medicare coverage, evaluating interventions and new technologies. MEDCAC advises CMS on Medicare coverage decisions, particularly regarding new diagnostic and treatment services. While typically not involved in evaluating preventive services, MEDCAC did review computed tomography for colorectal cancer screening in 2009, concluding that evidence was inadequate for coverage under the Social Security Act. MEDCAC reviewed CT colonography for colorectal cancer screening in 2009, finding it noncovered under the Social Security Act. With new authority under MIPPA, MEDCAC may review proposals to expand coverage of preventive services in the future. It is uncertain if expanded coverage of preventive services can reduce costs for Medicare or other payers. Cost analyses for preventive services may not always be cost-saving for payers as screenings are often delivered to a large number of people. The National Commission on Prevention Priorities developed a priority ranking based on under-utilization and cost-effectiveness, with only a few services being cost-saving. The National Commission on Prevention Priorities developed a priority ranking based on under-utilization and cost-effectiveness. Only a few preventive services were found to be cost-saving, including aspirin use for adults at risk of heart attack, tobacco-use screening with counseling, vision screening for adults over 65, and certain immunizations. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) noted that while some preventive services improve quality and outcomes, expanded utilization often leads to higher medical spending overall. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) explained that increased utilization of preventive services can lead to higher costs for payers. They mentioned that some proposals may result in a shift to federal coverage without improving healthcare quality, leading to a net cost for the government. CBO also pointed out that highly effective preventive services, like influenza vaccination, could increase costs for Medicare and Social Security by preventing premature mortality among beneficiaries. In 1987, Congress mandated a demonstration project to assess the cost-effectiveness of covering influenza vaccination for Medicare beneficiaries. The analysis excluded the impact of reduced mortality. Despite potential net costs, effective preventive services like influenza vaccination should be considered for reimbursement based on their value. Congress may need to raise revenues or offset costs in Medicare to expand coverage of prevention activities. Debate exists on whether prevention activities funded through other means could improve health outcomes and control costs in Medicare. CMS is interested in the health status of the \"pre-Medicare\" population for reasons such as promoting behaviors like smoking cessation and proper diet earlier in life. Proper diet and exercise are important earlier in life, rather than starting upon Medicare enrollment. A study suggests that $3 billion in federal spending on health promotion could save Medicare over $5 billion within five years. Congress allocated $650 million for these activities in the ARRA. CBO has not estimated the impact on Medicare due to scorekeeping rules. Expanding Medicare coverage to include preventive services aims to improve quality of care and health status among beneficiaries. However, many Medicare beneficiaries do not receive recommended preventive services like vaccinations and cancer screenings, despite visiting a physician. Less than half of beneficiaries received all five studied preventive services they were entitled to in 2001. A study of 2001 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data found that certain beneficiaries, such as those with lower income and Black race, had lower utilization of preventive services. Beneficiaries were often unaware of their risk for illnesses and the coverage of preventive services by Medicare. Cost sharing was shown to decrease the use of preventive services, including screening mammography. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services recommends reducing out-of-pocket costs to improve mammography utilization. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services recommends patient reminder systems and education to improve cancer screening rates, including mammography. Efforts by executive branch agencies aim to increase utilization of preventive services through education campaigns. The Medicare Initial Preventive Physical Examination allows providers to recommend preventive services. The Medicare Initial Preventive Physical Examination allows providers to recommend preventive services, but it may not ensure optimal utilization. Proposed health reform bills could expand coverage of certain preventive services under Medicare, aligning with USPSTF recommendations. The House is preparing to vote on H.R. 3590 and an accompanying reconciliation bill (H.R. 4872) that would amend the legislation to meet budgetary instructions. If approved, H.R. 3590 will be sent to the President for signing into law, while the reconciliation bill would then go to the Senate. The Senate passed an amended version on December 24, 2009. On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed an amended version of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590), a comprehensive health reform proposal that includes provisions on Medicare coverage of preventive services. CBO has scored most of these proposals as incurring a net cost for the Medicare program. An adopted amendment could impact the implementation of several provisions in the Senate bill. The USPSTF updated its recommendation on mammography for breast cancer screening in November 2009, now recommending routine screening to begin at age 50 instead of 40. The Vitter amendment may affect coverage for screening mammography for women aged 40-49 under health reform bills. Medicare Part B will cover personalized prevention plan services starting in 2011. Medicare Part B will cover personalized prevention plan services starting in 2011, including a comprehensive health risk assessment and various specified elements. Enrolled beneficiaries can receive these services annually without any cost sharing, with the option for personalized prevention plan services each year thereafter. Starting in 2011, Medicare Part B will cover personalized prevention plan services, including a health risk assessment and specified elements. Beneficiaries can receive these services annually without cost sharing, with the option for yearly services thereafter. The bill also includes coverage for colorectal cancer screening and waives beneficiary coinsurance requirements. The proposed amendment to SSA Section 1833 would waive beneficiary coinsurance for most preventive services under Medicare, covering 100% of the costs. This includes services like IPPE, personalized prevention plan services, and preventive services recommended with a grade of A or B by the USPSTF. The deductible would also be waived for these services, except for any additional preventive service covered under the Secretary's administrative authority. Section 4105 authorizes the Secretary to provide evidence-based coverage of preventive services in Medicare starting January 1, 2010. The proposed amendment to SSA Section 1833 would waive beneficiary coinsurance for most preventive services under Medicare, covering 100% of the costs. This includes services like IPPE, personalized prevention plan services, and preventive services recommended with a grade of A or B by the USPSTF. The Secretary would have enhanced authority to modify coverage of preventive services consistent with USPSTF recommendations and withhold payment for services graded D. Section 4003 reauthorizes the USPSTF to review scientific evidence on clinical preventive services. The curr_chunk discusses the development of recommendations for clinical preventive services and the passing of the Affordable Health Care for America Act. It emphasizes the independence of the Task Force members and codifying the existing TFCPS. The curr_chunk discusses proposed legislation on Medicare coverage of preventive services, including waiving cost-sharing for certain services. CBO has scored these proposals as incurring a net cost for the Medicare program. The curr_chunk proposes amendments to Medicare coverage for preventive services, including waiving cost-sharing for colorectal cancer screening and expanding coverage for federally recommended vaccines and preventive services at Federally Qualified Health Centers. The curr_chunk proposes amending SSA Section 1861 to recognize certified diabetes educators as Medicare-certified providers for diabetes self-management training services. It also establishes new task forces under the Public Health Service Act to review evidence on clinical and community preventive services. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of new task forces under the Public Health Service Act to review evidence on clinical and community preventive services for older adults. The task forces would develop recommendations for the use of such services. The curr_chunk provides a table listing preventive services covered under Medicare Part B or recommended by the USPSTF for adults aged 65 and older, with corresponding grades indicating the level of recommendation. The USPSTF recommends against services with Grade D due to no net benefit or harms outweighing benefits. Only services graded A or B are recommended for routine clinical use. Recommendations may not apply to individuals with certain risk factors or clinical considerations."
