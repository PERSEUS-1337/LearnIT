    "title": "AB 786",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. In response to the ongoing drought emergency, California aims to promote water conservation by allowing the use of low water-using plants in landscaping and removing any restrictions that hinder this goal. The section prohibits associations from imposing fines or assessments on owners for reducing watering during a state or local drought emergency. The Civil Code prohibits associations from imposing fines or assessments on owners for reducing watering during a drought emergency. Additionally, the code voids any provision that prohibits the use of low water-using plants or artificial turf in landscaping. The Civil Code prohibits associations from imposing fines or assessments on owners for reducing watering during a drought emergency. It also voids any provision that restricts compliance with water-efficient landscape ordinances or regulations on water use. Associations can still enforce landscaping rules in governing documents that align with these restrictions. A local government has declared a local emergency due to drought. Owners receiving recycled water from a retail water supplier must use it for landscaping irrigation. Owners with water-efficient landscaping measures installed during a state of emergency do not have to remove them afterwards. Section 2.5 of this bill includes amendments to Section 4735 of the Civil Code, contingent on the enactment of both this bill and Assembly Bill 349. If both bills pass and amend Section 4735, this section will only take effect if this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 349. This act is deemed urgent for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety and will come into immediate effect. California is in a state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, leading Governor Brown to issue Executive Order B-29-15 for a 25 percent reduction in urban water consumption. Homeowners have stopped watering their landscaping voluntarily to help with the drought, but some homeowners associations are fining residents who use recycled water instead of potable water. This goes against the state's efforts to conserve water for urban, agricultural, and environmental needs."
