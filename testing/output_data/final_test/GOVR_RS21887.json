    "content": "The EFCA proposed changes to the NLRA to allow certification of a bargaining unit's representative without an election. The NLRB would investigate petitions alleging majority employee support for representation. If confirmed, the designated individual or labor organization would be certified as the representative. This differs from the current process where representation is typically determined through an election conducted by the Board. The NLRB conducts an investigation after a petition is filed alleging employee support for collective bargaining. If at least 30% of employees support representation, a representation hearing is held. If details cannot be resolved voluntarily, an election is directed by the Board. Few employers voluntarily recognize a labor organization as the exclusive representative. In NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that signed authorization cards from a majority of employees could lead to bargaining obligations under Section 8(a)(5) of the NLRA, which states that employers must collectively bargain with representatives chosen by the majority of employees in the unit. The Gissel Court confirmed that signed authorization cards from a majority of employees could trigger a duty to bargain, but employers are not required to accept the cards as proof of majority status and can insist on an election. In Linden Lumber v. NLRB, the Court ruled that a union denied recognition by the employer must invoke the Board's election procedure. Labor organizations argue that employers reject voluntary recognition based on authorization cards to deter unionization. Opponents of the EFCA reject voluntary recognition through authorization cards to prevent union support before elections, citing concerns about coercive tactics. The median time for elections after filing a petition in FY2011 was 38 days, with 91.7% conducted within 56 days. Critics fear unions may use intimidation to gather signatures. The Secret Ballot Protection Act, introduced in the 112th Congress as H.R. 972, emphasized the importance of secret ballots in ensuring a choice free of coercion or intimidation. Additionally, the EFCA proposed union certification without an election and involvement of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service during negotiations after certification. The proposed legislation would allow for mediation and arbitration in labor disputes if parties fail to reach an agreement after a specified period of bargaining. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) would step in to facilitate negotiations and, if necessary, refer the dispute to an arbitration board for a binding decision. The FMCS is directed to intervene in disputes that threaten significant commerce disruptions and to avoid mediating disputes with minor effects on interstate commerce. The EFCA proposed legislation aims to promote prompt negotiation of initial collective bargaining agreements by allowing mediation and arbitration in labor disputes. However, the availability of binding arbitration under the EFCA has discouraged support from the business community, as it could force employers to accept unfavorable terms decided by the arbitration board. This contrasts with existing law where employers have the option to decline such terms. The EFCA proposed legislation would have imposed new penalties for unfair labor practices, such as discrimination against employees to discourage union membership. This could include awarding back pay and liquidated damages. The EFCA proposed legislation aimed to impose penalties for unfair labor practices, including back pay, liquidated damages, and civil penalties for willful and repeated violations. The Board may order a person committing an unfair labor practice to cease and desist, and take affirmative action like reinstatement with back pay. Section 12 of the NLRA imposes penalties for willful interference with the Board's duties, but no specific penalty exists for willful and repeated misconduct described in the EFCA. In 1959, Congress amended the NLRA to address the \"no man's land\" issue for small employers and employees by adding a new subsection (c) to Section 14. This amendment aimed to provide relief for those excluded from NLRA coverage due to low revenue, ensuring they have a remedy for labor disputes. The NLRA was amended in 1959 to address the exclusion of small employers and employees from coverage. Section 14(c) allows the Board to decline jurisdiction over labor disputes not affecting commerce significantly. State agencies or courts can then assert jurisdiction over these disputes. Congress enacted Section 14(c)(1) to endorse the Board's practice of declining jurisdiction over smaller employers in labor disputes. However, Congress also prevented the Board from refusing jurisdiction over employers meeting the standards set in 1959. If the Board declines jurisdiction, state agencies or courts can assert jurisdiction based on specific standards, such as those for retail enterprises. The Board asserts jurisdiction over enterprises with annual gross business volume of at least $500,000 and some business across state lines. For non-retail enterprises, jurisdiction is asserted if there is an inflow or outflow of goods/services across state lines of at least $50,000. The EFCA did not address small employers, leading to concerns about the impact on small businesses due to low financial thresholds in jurisdictional standards. Some argued that many perceived as \"small businesses\" could become subject to the EFCA, while others believed most small businesses are too small to be affected. The EFCA received attention for proposed changes to the NLRA, including expedited election measures. Some past proposals required a specified percentage of employees to sign authorization cards for automatic certification. Senator Paul Simon's Labor Relations Representative Amendment Act suggested an expedited election within 30 days after 60% of employees in a unit signed authorization cards. The Right to Organize Act of 2001 and the National Labor Relations Fair Elections Act proposed expedited election measures based on signed authorization cards from a percentage of employees in an appropriate unit. The former required an election within 14 days after 60% of employees signed cards, while the latter allowed for automatic certification with 75% card signatures or an expedited election with a majority. The National Labor Relations Fair Elections Act proposed expedited elections based on authorization cards, with a timeline of 7-15 days for the election to be held. The Act also set a schedule for all representation elections to occur within 45 days, or 75 days in cases of complexity. Past attempts to amend the NLRA for expedited elections may be relevant if the EFCA is reintroduced in Congress. Opponents argue that the Act undermines the secrecy of the ballot election. Opponents of expedited elections under the NLRA argue that it undermines the secrecy of the ballot election."
