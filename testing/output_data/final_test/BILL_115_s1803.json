The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow the Attorney General to register practitioners for marijuana research, excluding marijuana from schedule I. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow practitioners to conduct marijuana research if authorized and approved by the appropriate federal agencies or the National Institutes of Health. The Attorney General will approve registration for marijuana research if the applicant meets certain criteria and safeguards against diversion. Factors considered include the applicant's experience with controlled substances and conviction record. The Attorney General will approve registration for marijuana research based on criteria such as experience with controlled substances and compliance with laws. The National Institutes of Health will establish a process for researchers to submit and receive approval for research protocols within specific timeframes. The Attorney General will approve marijuana research registration based on criteria such as experience with controlled substances. Researchers must store marijuana securely and comply with security measures to prevent diversion. If an applicant amends or supplements the research protocol, they can renew registration without reapplying unless they change the drug type, source, storage conditions, or increase diversion risk. Notice of any changes must be provided to the Attorney General for renewal. The applicant must notify the Attorney General 30 days before making changes to a research protocol that may increase diversion risk. If no objection is raised within 30 days, the applicant can proceed with the amended protocol. The Attorney General can object if additional security measures are necessary to prevent diversion or abuse. Research on marijuana conducted in accordance with regulations is not restricted by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. If marijuana is listed on a schedule other than schedule I, specific provisions apply.
