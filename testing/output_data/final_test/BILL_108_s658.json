    "content": "The Energy Savings Performance Contracts Amendments Act of 2003, also known as the \"Act\", repeals Section 801(c) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. This Act aims to achieve cost savings from replacement facilities. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include benefits from reduced operation and maintenance costs in energy savings contracts for building replacements. Agencies can consider these savings in annual payments under such contracts. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act allows agencies to include savings from reduced operation and maintenance costs in energy savings contracts for building replacements. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act allows agencies to include savings from reduced operation and maintenance costs in energy savings contracts for building replacements. SEC. 4. ENERGY SAVINGS. Section 804(2) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to define 'energy savings' as a reduction in energy or water costs in federally owned buildings resulting from equipment upgrades, improved operations, or efficient energy use like cogeneration. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for energy savings in federally owned buildings, including the efficient use of water sources and cost reduction in energy for replacement buildings. The curr_chunk amends the definition of an energy savings contract under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to include services for energy or water conservation measures and the construction of new buildings for energy savings. The curr_chunk amends the definition of an energy or water conservation measure under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to include water efficiency improvements, life cycle cost effectiveness, and various water conservation activities. The Secretary of Energy will review the Energy Savings Performance Contract program within 180 days to identify obstacles preventing Federal agencies from fully utilizing it. The review will focus on increasing program flexibility and effectiveness, including audit requirements, accounting for energy use, contracting requirements, and covered energy efficiency services. Findings will be reported to relevant committees, and administrative and regulatory changes will be implemented to enhance program effectiveness within statutory authority. SEC. 805. PILOT PROGRAM FOR ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACT INVESTMENTS IN NON-BUILDING ENERGY SAVINGS PROJECTS. The Secretary of Defense and other Federal agencies are authorized to enter into up to ten energy savings performance contracts for non-building energy efficiency projects. The Secretary of Energy will select the projects to demonstrate the benefits of energy savings performance contracting for various non-building energy improvement projects. The term 'secondary savings' refers to additional energy or cost savings resulting from energy efficiency improvements financed and implemented through energy savings performance contracts. These savings may include reduced fuel delivery needs and logistical support, as well as benefits from electric generation equipment. The Secretary of Energy must report to Congress on the progress and results of the energy efficiency program, including project descriptions, energy and cost savings, secondary savings, benefits, problems, and overall cost-benefit analysis. Recommendations for extending or modifying energy savings performance contracts for non-building projects should also be included. SEC. 9. UTILITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to include equipment and vehicles in utility incentive programs."
