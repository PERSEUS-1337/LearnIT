    "content": "The \"Workforce Development Investment Act of 2017\" allows employers to receive credits for partnering with educational institutions to enhance workforce development and job training for students. The \"Workforce Development Investment Act of 2017\" allows employers to receive credits for partnering with qualified educational institutions. The employer partnering credit is $5,000 for each institution, with a maximum credit of $20,000 for the taxable year. Controlled groups are treated as a single taxpayer. A qualified educational institution includes community colleges, other higher education institutions, and area career and technical education schools. A community college is an institution of higher education that admits students beyond compulsory school age and offers a 2-year program in engineering, mathematics, or the physical or biological sciences to prepare students for technician or semiprofessional roles in various fields. The term 'institution of higher education' is defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, while 'area career and technical education school' is defined in the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, will define 'qualified partnership' within six months of this section's enactment. The employer can collaborate with an educational institution to improve workforce development, provide instruction in the classroom, and offer internships or apprenticeships for students. These activities are subject to rules similar to those in section 52. Additionally, the credit for these activities will be part of the general business credit under Section 38(b) of the Code. The employer can partner with an educational institution to enhance workforce development, provide classroom instruction, and offer internships or apprenticeships for students. This collaboration qualifies for the employer partnering credit under section 45S. Employers can receive a tax credit for engaging in qualified worker training under section 45T of the Internal Revenue Code. This credit applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. The worker training tax credit under section 38 allows employers to claim 50% of job training program expenses for eligible employees, up to $5,000 per employee. Job training program expenses include costs for participation in a qualified training program. The worker training tax credit allows employers to claim 50% of job training program expenses for eligible employees. Eligible employees are those who participate in a qualified training program and meet specific work requirements. The tax credit for terminated employees under the job training program increases the taxpayer's tax by the decrease in credits for prior years if the employee's employment is terminated within 2 years of training, excluding gross misconduct. The tax credit for terminated employees under the job training program is calculated based on the inclusion ratio, which is the ratio of days employed by the employer to the total days in a 2-year period. Controlled groups are treated as a single employer for tax credit purposes. The credit is part of the general business credit. The tax credit for terminated employees under the job training program is amended to include a worker training tax credit determined under section 45T(a) of the tax code. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the tax code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
