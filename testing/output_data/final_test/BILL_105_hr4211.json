Washington. The Congress acknowledges the historical struggle of African-Americans for military participation, citing limited opportunities and racial discrimination in the United States military. By the early 1940s, key leaders in the Army Air Corps doubted African-Americans' ability to become successful military pilots. The Army decided to train African-American pilot cadets at Tuskegee Institute due to pressure from civil rights groups. The institute was chosen for its facilities, instructors, and ideal flying conditions. In 1941, the United States Army Air Corps awarded a contract to Tuskegee Institute to operate a primary flight school at Moton Field, which was designed and constructed by an African-American contractor with assistance from faculty and students. Tuskegee Institute was chosen for its strong interest in aeronautical training for African-American youths and its successful civilian pilot training program. Moton Field, also known as the Primary Flying Field, was the only primary flight training facility for African-American pilot candidates in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. It symbolizes the entrance of African-American pilots into the military, despite segregation policies. Tuskegee Institute played a crucial role in providing leadership and resources for this historic achievement. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American soldiers to successfully complete training and enter the United States Army Air Corps. Over 1,000 aviators were trained as America's first African-American military pilots, with additional African-American men and women serving in various roles within the military. Despite initial hesitation from military leaders, the Tuskegee Airmen eventually saw combat action in North Africa and Europe. Acceptance from United States Army Air Corps units was slow but eventual. The courageous and heroic performance of the Tuskegee Airmen earned them respect and increased combat opportunities. Their success paved the way for desegregation of the military and inspired civil rights advocates during the 1950s and 1960s. The 477th Bombardment Group staged a nonviolent demonstration to desegregate the officer's club at Freeman Field, Indiana, setting a pattern for direct action protests. The purposes of the Act are to benefit and inspire present and future generations to understand the heroic legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen and to commemorate their impact during World War II. The Tuskegee Airmen, African-American pilots in WWII, trained at Moton Field and other facilities. Tuskegee Institute played a key role. Their success led to desegregation of the military post-WWII and influenced civil rights movements in the 1950s and 1960s. The Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site is established as a unit of the National Park System in Alabama, in association with Tuskegee University. The site will consist of approximately 90 acres known as Moton Field in Macon County. Property acquisition details are outlined. The Secretary may acquire real property by donation, exchange, or purchase with donated or appropriated funds, excluding property owned by the State of Alabama, political subdivisions, or Tuskegee University, which can only be acquired by donation. Tuskegee University will donate approximately 35 acres initially for the Tuskegee Airmen National Center, with the rest to be donated later. Personal property associated with the historic site can also be acquired. The Secretary will administer the historic site in accordance with applicable laws. Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site will be the main administrative facility. Tuskegee University will be the primary partner for leadership and management.

The Secretary may consult with Tuskegee University and enter into a cooperative agreement to develop the historic site, including the Tuskegee Airmen National Center. The center will showcase the story of the Tuskegee Airmen at Moton Field with exhibits of period aircraft and equipment. The Tuskegee Airmen National Center, used by the Tuskegee Airmen and Tuskegee University Department of Aviation Science, aims to provide interpretive programs for visitors and continue the tradition of flight training. A report on the partnership needed to develop and operate the center will be prepared within one year. The Tuskegee Airmen National Center, in partnership with Tuskegee University, may enter into a cooperative agreement for development. A general management plan for the historic site must be prepared within 2 fiscal years for approval by Congress.
