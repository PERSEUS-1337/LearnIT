    "content": "Farmers have historically modified plants and animals through crossbreeding and hybridization to improve growth rates, yields, and resistance to pests and diseases. With the advent of recombinant DNA techniques, scientists can now genetically modify organisms by selecting individual genes with desirable traits and inserting them into different organisms for various purposes. The term \"biotechnology\" was coined in 1919 by Hungarian engineer Karl Ereky to describe the science and methods that utilize living organisms to produce products from raw materials. Biotechnology, as defined by the Convention of Biological Diversity, involves using biological systems to modify products or processes. Genetically engineered crop varieties have been adopted by U.S. farmers to lower costs and increase yields since the mid-1990s. Proponents see potential in \"second generation\" GE commodities to shift focus from creating traits for crop production to creating output traits. Biotechnology companies are working on second-generation products with enhanced nutritional qualities for consumers. However, critics argue that promised benefits have not been delivered, and incidents of regulatory noncompliance raise concerns about oversight. Unapproved genetically engineered cotton and rice varieties have been found in commercial samples, prompting further scrutiny. In the southern United States, incidents of unapproved genetically engineered (GE) rice were found in commercial samples, sparking public policy questions about environmental and food safety impacts, global marketplace challenges, and regulatory adequacy. GE crops were planted on 433 million acres worldwide in 2013, showing a 3% annual growth rate since the mid-1990s and comprising 12% of all crop acreage. In 2013, 19 countries planted genetically engineered (GE) crops, with the majority of acreage concentrated in soybeans, corn, cotton, and canola. The United States, Brazil, Argentina, India, and Canada accounted for 90% of global GE crop acreage. In the US, over 60 GE plant varieties were approved for commercial use by 2005, increasing to 82 varieties by 2014. In 2012, 93% of soybean, 94% of upland cotton, and 88% of corn acres were planted with GE seed varieties. Service (Table 2) focuses on the widespread use of genetically engineered (GE) crops in agriculture, particularly herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops like HT soybeans, HT upland cotton, and HT corn. These crops are engineered to resist herbicides like glyphosate, marketed as \"Roundup.\" Newer varieties of HT crops are being developed to combat increasing weed resistance to glyphosate/Roundup. Insect-resistant crops have pesticides genetically engineered into the plants to control pests. Varieties include Bt-engineered cotton and corn. Monsanto is developing stacked trait varieties resistant to insects and glyphosate/Roundup. Other approved crops include flax, papaya, potatoes, and tomatoes. Some genetically engineered crops like FlavrSavr tomato and GE potato varieties were withdrawn due to quality issues. GE wheat, rice, flax, and radicchio have regulatory approval but are not commercially marketed. GE sugar beets, canola, and alfalfa are widely planted. White GE corn is now used in tortilla making despite initial resistance. GE sugar beets faced initial resistance from food companies and industry groups but now constitute nearly 95% of the sugar beet crop. The Center for Food Safety challenged the deregulation of GE sugar beets due to concerns about cross-pollination. APHIS had approved more GE crops between 1987 and 2005. Between 1987 and 2005, APHIS approved over 10,700 field test applications for various GE crop varieties, with corn having the most approvals. By 2013, over 14,200 field trials of GE plants were approved, mainly focusing on insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. Few animal-based GE products are available commercially, with chymosin being a notable exception. Chymosin, a biotechnology-produced enzyme widely used in cheese production, is a notable exception in the field of animal biotechnology. Bovine somatotropin (BST), a naturally occurring protein that can be genetically engineered to increase production, was first approved by the FDA in 1993. Reports indicate that over 30% of U.S. dairy cows are administered BST to boost milk production. Other emerging animal biotechnologies show promise for the future, with the FDA approving the first product from a transgenic animal in 2009 - an anti-clotting protein derived from transgenic goats' milk. The FDA approved the first product from a transgenic animal in 2009 - an anti-clotting protein derived from transgenic goats' milk. In 2010, the FDA began the approval process for a GE salmon developed by AquaBounty, engineered to grow at twice the rate of traditional salmon. The FDA denied approval of a human protein purified from genetically engineered rabbits' milk in 2011. The FDA held a public comment period and hearing on labeling for transgenic salmon in 2011. The GE salmon grows faster and contains a growth hormone from Chinook salmon. FDA officials are undecided on requiring product labeling. Environmental concerns about potential escape of GE salmon into the wild were addressed in a 2012 Environmental Assessment. Around 65%-70% of processed U.S. foods likely contain some GE material, mainly from corn and soybeans. US biotechnology regulations do not mandate segregation or labeling of GE crops and foods. Soy-based and corn-based ingredients, along with canola and cottonseed oil, are commonly used in processed products without requiring labeling for being genetically engineered. GE-produced animals for human consumption are not yet approved, but GE salmon is being reviewed by the FDA for potential approval due to its substantial equivalence to non-GE salmon. Currently, few government-approved GE crops are reaching consumers, but this may change as more GE traits are developed for consumer appeal. For instance, a GE variety of table corn by Monsanto has been commercialized, although consumer acceptance is still uncertain. Some farmers are hesitant to plant GE crop varieties due to customer concerns about safety, but public opposition to GE products in processed food may be decreasing. Biotechnology supporters argue that safety concerns are baseless, as scientific reviews have not found credible evidence against GE crop varieties. Genetically engineered crop varieties have been found safe for human consumption, with new insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant varieties being developed for various crops. Traits like drought tolerance, enhanced photosynthesis, and nitrogen efficiency are also being engineered. In animal agriculture, pigs and cattle have been genetically modified for increased milk output and resistance to bacteria. Other GE products in development include tomatoes for salty soils and herbicide-tolerant turf grasses. Genetically engineered animals and plants are being developed for various purposes, such as faster-growing piglets and cattle resistant to mastitis. Field trials have been approved for a transgenic sunflower with a carp growth hormone for aquaculture feed. GE salmon that grows to market size in half the time is awaiting government approval. Research is ongoing for GE products like oilseeds low in saturated fats, tomatoes with anti-cancer agents, and rice with elevated iron levels. Other potential products include low-calorie sugar. Future biotechnology products could include \"low-calorie\" sugar beets, strawberries and corn with higher sugar content, colored cotton, delayed-ripening produce, naturally decaffeinated coffee, and plants as \"factories\" for pharmaceutical compounds and bioindustrial molecules. Critics note that few of these products have reached the marketplace. Future biotechnology products could include \"bioindustrial\" molecules like plastics and polyurethane, pharmaceuticals, and human organ/tissue replacements. The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, established in 1986, guides federal regulation based on product characteristics rather than production method. This approach aims to ensure the safety of biotechnology research and products. The Obama Administration announced an initiative on July 2, 2015, to update the 1986 framework for regulating biotechnology products. The three lead agencies involved are USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). APHIS regulates the importation, interstate movement, and field testing of genetically engineered (GE) plants and organisms under the Plant Protection Act and also regulates animal biologics. GE plants that are or might be plant pests are considered \"regulated articles\" under APHIS regulations. APHIS authorization is required for import, interstate movement, or environmental release, including field testing. A \"regulated\" plant cannot be introduced into the environment without APHIS authorization through either the permit or notification process. Permits restrict movement and planting to prevent pest risks, while sponsors follow APHIS guidance to ensure safety for agriculture, human health, and the environment. Plant-based pharmaceuticals must be developed under the permit process, while most other GE crops use the expedited notification option. GE crops can be developed under the notification option, a less rigorous procedure than permitting, if the plant species is not a noxious weed. After testing, developers seek \"non-regulated status\" from APHIS for full commercialization. Extensive information on plant biology, genetics, and potential impacts must be provided. APHIS conducts an environmental assessment and public comment periods before granting \"non-regulated status,\" ending federal regulatory oversight. The FDA regulates food, animal feed additives, and drugs, including those from biotechnology, to ensure they are safe and properly labeled. All food and feed manufacturers must meet the same standards, and any food additive, including those from biotechnology, must receive FDA approval before being marketed. However, additives recognized as safe do not need preapproval. FDA encourages sponsors of foods and feeds derived from GE crops to comply with regulations. FDA encourages sponsors of foods and feeds derived from GE crops to participate in its voluntary consultation process. All GE-derived products on the U.S. market have undergone this process, except for one. GE foods must undergo special review under certain conditions, such as unexpected genetic effects or changes in nutrients. FDA published new guidance in June 2006 for developers of new plant varieties intended for food use. The FDA encourages sponsors of foods and feeds derived from GE crops to participate in a voluntary consultation process to provide information about new proteins used in crop development. The FDA released final guidance on regulating GE animals and products under existing statutory authority. GE-derived foods are regulated like non-GE foods unless their nutritional composition differs, in which case they require FDA pre-market approval. The FDA released final guidance on regulating GE animals and products, stating that developers must obtain pre-market approval. A risk assessment in January 2008 found that meat and milk from cloned animals are safe to eat, with similar health risks to conventionally bred animals. Cloning is considered an assisted reproduction technique, not involving gene transfer or alteration through GE. The USDA no longer asks industry to refrain from marketing products of cloned animals and their offspring. EPA registers and approves pesticides, including those genetically engineered into plants. EPA determines a PIP's environmental safety under FIFRA. EPA also establishes safe levels for pesticides in foods under the FFDCA. Pre-commercial regulation involves notifications for small-scale field tests and permits for larger field tests. Manufacturers of PIPs must obtain registration to ensure safe use. The USDA, EPA, and FDA have detailed procedures for monitoring and approving GE crops and foods. The regulatory framework assumes that genetic engineering poses no unique risks, focusing on the product rather than the process. Opposition by consumer groups continues. The existing Coordinated Framework for Biotechnology Regulation established in 1986 is under strain due to new biotechnology developments, opposition by consumer groups, and perceived inadequacies of federal regulation. The Obama Administration issued a memorandum in 2015 to update the framework to address these concerns and ensure it can handle future biotechnology risks. The 2015 memorandum calls for an update to the Coordinated Framework for Biotechnology Regulation to address the complexities of regulating biotechnology products in light of advancements in science and technology. The goal is to clarify agency roles, increase transparency, and promote innovation over the next 12 months. The 2015 memorandum calls for an update to the Coordinated Framework for Biotechnology Regulation to clarify agency responsibilities, increase transparency, and promote innovation. It establishes a Biotechnology Working Group to assess risks associated with future biotechnology products and commission an independent analysis of the biotechnology landscape. The Biotechnology Working Group is reviewing the Coordinated Framework to improve transparency and predictability in regulatory assessment. Any changes to biotechnology regulation would require congressional action. Industry stakeholders support the current framework and argue that current GE crops have not caused harm. Various studies have found no credible evidence that current GE crops have harmed the environment or human health. Scientific reports suggest that GE crops pose no greater risks than conventional varieties and should be assessed case-by-case. Congress generally supports GE products, but some Members have concerns about their regulation. Legislative activity on biotechnology has been subdued, with bills for GE food labeling in recent Congresses. Funding for biotechnology activities at USDA continues through annual appropriations. The USDA primarily funds biotechnology-related research programs, with a budget of $17.4 million for APHIS's BRS in FY2015. Critics question the adequacy of current laws in regulating emerging GE applications, citing gaps in pre-market approval processes. Critics argue for new legislation to enhance regulatory oversight of GE crops due to perceived gaps in approval processes and potential risks to humans and the environment. Concerns also exist regarding herbicide-resistant weeds and increased herbicide use with GE planting. Agricultural organizations express caution about new biotechnology products, citing worries about consumer acceptance and export challenges. The discovery of unapproved GE varieties in U.S. rice and cotton supplies highlights concerns about GMO segregation and labeling, as well as inadvertent mixing of GE with non-GE crops. Legal challenges to deregulating Monsanto's GE alfalfa raised questions about regulatory adequacy. A lawsuit in 2006 alleged that GE alfalfa could lead to herbicide-resistant \"super weeds\" and harm organic dairy and beef production. The GE alfalfa case raised concerns about herbicide resistance, impacting organic dairy and beef production, and risking contamination of natural and organic alfalfa. The issue of coexistence between traditional and GE production methods was highlighted, with potential harm to growers who did not want to adopt GE varieties. The USDA's Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture released a report in late August 2006, addressing biotech adoption and regulation, and highlighting policy issues. The AC21 report highlighted concerns about outdated regulations in the US governing agricultural biotechnology, particularly in relation to transgenic crops and animals. There were differing views on the adequacy of the current FDA regulatory system for ensuring safety and public acceptance. The lack of a clear federal regulatory system for assessing environmental and food safety of transgenic animals before commercialization was also noted. This issue is central to the approval process for GE salmon. Despite differing opinions, all sides agree that future policy should be clear and predictable. The AC21 Group was tasked to develop recommendations on liability and promoting co-existence among traditional, organic, and GE agriculture. The FDA guidance on early food safety evaluations for new plant varieties is seen as the agency's current policy on agricultural biotechnology. The Biotechnology Industry Organization supported the FDA guidance for providing safety assurance. The FDA guidance on low-level presence of GE material in food has received mixed reactions. While some see it as a step towards a science-based policy, critics like the Center for Food Safety argue that it may lead to contamination of the food supply. The policy does not establish acceptable levels of adventitious presence, and in the past, the CFS sued the FDA for not implementing pre-market safety requirements for GE foods. The FDA is reviewing data on GE salmon for final approval under the New Animal Drug approval process. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the regulatory protocol and FDA's environmental expertise. USDA's APHIS has taken steps to improve regulatory oversight under the Plant Protection Act. The USDA's APHIS has consolidated its activities under a new Biotechnology Regulatory Services office, developed a compliance and enforcement unit for GE developers, and published more stringent permit conditions for GE-derived plants. They are also evaluating regulations for GE plants that may pose a noxious weed risk or be used as biological control agents, establishing new categories for field testing based on potential risk levels, and considering strengthening environmental reviews and permit conditions. In December 2005, USDA's Office of Inspector General criticized APHIS's biotech regulation for not keeping pace with the increasing number of genetically engineered tests and field sites. The OIG expressed concerns about weaknesses in the approval and inspection process, stating that APHIS lacked basic information about field test sites. The OIG criticized APHIS for lacking information about approved field test sites and the fate of crops after testing. APHIS did not review containment protocols for notifications. The OIG also noted vague site inspection requirements and weak guidance for containing GE crops and seeds. APHIS responded by stating that most recommendations align with changes already enforced or planned by the Biotechnology Regulatory Service. In 2009, the OIG reported that the department lacked an import control policy for GE animals and that its policy for GE crops could become outdated. In 2011, the OIG criticized APHIS for not having regulations for GE animal and insect research. Court challenges to APHIS's deregulation of GE alfalfa and sugar beets have raised concerns about the agency's environmental review process. APHIS proposed a revision of its regulations in 2008. In October 2008, APHIS proposed regulatory changes for GE organisms, with the public comment period extended to June 2009. A final rule was never published, and in March 2015, the proposed changes were withdrawn. The proposed changes aimed to address concerns about APHIS's regulatory process for GE products. APHIS proposed regulatory changes for GE organisms to address concerns about oversight for GE organisms that do not fit within the plant pest definition but may still cause harm. The proposed regulations would have included oversight based on known risks of parent organisms or traits of the GE organism, and regulating GE seedlings, tubers, cuttings, bulbs, spores, etc. The notification procedure would have been discontinued in favor of the permitting procedure. The proposed regulations by APHIS would establish a new petition procedure for conditional exemptions from permit requirements for GE organisms. The permitting system would be based on risk factors related to plant persistence and potential harm from the GE trait. Remediation authorities for non-compliance with regulations would also be included. The proposed changes by APHIS include remediation authorities for non-compliance with regulations and responses to low-level presence of regulated plant materials in commercial seeds. Over 74,000 comments were received, with mixed reactions. The extension of the comment period was due to controversial proposed changes, such as the scope of regulatory changes and the environmental release of GE crops producing pharmaceutical compounds. Opposition was expressed by biotechnology industry representatives and NGOs to the expansion of APHIS authority to regulate GE organisms posing risks. The industry representatives and advocacy groups criticized the proposed regulations by APHIS for expanding authority over GE organisms and taking a voluntary approach to regulation. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on international trade, the removal of established criteria for regulation, and the inadequate protection of the U.S. food supply from contamination. In March 2009, advocacy groups urged Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to halt approving GE crops until regulatory changes are made. APHIS has not revealed its future plans regarding proposed revisions. Concerns about regulatory procedures may be addressed in the initiative to update the 1986 General Framework for Biotechnology Regulation. The deregulation process for GE plants involves an assessment before full-scale commercialization. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to prepare a detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for major Federal actions significantly affecting the environment. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulates the finding of a significant effect, allowing agencies to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) if an EIS is not required. APHIS has faced challenges regarding the adequacy of its regulatory structure in deregulating GE plants, leading to court challenges. In response, APHIS initiated a pilot project to improve Environmental Assessments (EAs) and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for a more effective deregulation process. The court overturned APHIS's decision to deregulate Monsanto's GE alfalfa due to environmental concerns. Legal injunctions were issued in 2007, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the illegality of the approval in 2009. The lawsuit highlighted the impact on domestic producers and export markets, with Japan and South Korea threatening to stop importing U.S. alfalfa if a GE variety is grown. The court disagreed with USDA's assertion that exports to Japan would not be harmed by the deregulation of GE alfalfa. APHIS announced the draft environmental impact statement for GE alfalfa, with public meetings held in several cities. The final EIS, addressing 135,000 comments, was published in December 2010. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in January 2010, with oral arguments heard in April 2010. On June 21, 2010, the Supreme Court reversed the injunction on planting GE alfalfa, citing procedural overreach by the Ninth Circuit. The final EIS considered a rule for \"partial deregulation\" and Secretary Vilsack announced a policy of \"co-existence\" for conventional, GE, and organic production. In 2011, the Secretary granted full deregulation of GE alfalfa under the Plant Protection Act. Similarly, GE sugar beets were granted deregulated status in 2005, leading to a lawsuit filed by the Center for Food Safety and Earthjustice. Sugar beet seed is primarily grown in Oregon's Willamette Valley. The deregulated status of GE sugar beets in Oregon's Willamette Valley could have significant economic impacts on organic producers of related crops like Swiss chard and table beets due to cross-pollination. A judge's order in September 2009 required APHIS to prepare an EIS, stating that the potential elimination of non-genetically engineered crops could have a significant effect on the environment. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California found no support for APHIS's conclusion of no significant impact on GE sugar beets. In August 2010, the court vacated APHIS's deregulation decision, effectively halting the planting of GE sugar beets, which made up nearly 95% of sugar beets planted in 2009/2010. In 2009/2010, nearly 95% of sugar beets planted were the GE variety, raising concerns about non-GE seed availability for the 2011 planting season. APHIS issued permits for seedling production, which faced legal challenges. The Ninth Circuit Court ultimately ruled in February 2011 that the seedlings did not have to be removed. GE sugar beets were deregulated for root production in July 2012, with full regulated status for sugar beet seed crop production in effect until December 31, 2012. APHIS issued an EA and a FONSI for this action. APHIS requested additional comments on a petition by Syngenta Seeds, Inc. to deregulate Alpha-Amylase Maize Event 3272, a GE corn variety for ethanol production. Concerns include potential impacts on food and feed safety due to lack of scientific data. In February 2011, APHIS deregulated GE ethanol corn, available for planting in 2011 for a small number of growers and by 2012 for large-scale commercial planting. Critics raised concerns about contamination, allergies, and potential damage to food products. Trade groups and companies opposed APHIS's approval, citing worries about engineered protein damaging food products and disrupting exports. APHIS granted a permit in May 2010 to import a genetically engineered cold-tolerant eucalyptus tree for pulp and biofuel production. The permit was issued to ArborGen, LLC, allowing planting and flowering on 28 sites across seven southern states. Lawsuits have been filed by environmental organizations challenging the approval due to concerns about potential environmental impacts and lack of proper evaluation. In 2010, APHIS approved a GE apple called the \"Arctic Apple\" that resists browning. Despite concerns raised by the Northwest Horticultural Society, APHIS deregulated the apple in 2015 after receiving over 175,000 comments against approval. The biotechnology firm is now in consultation with the FDA. Additionally, FDA began the regulatory approval process for a GE salmon called AquAdvantage Atlantic Salmon in August 2010. The FDA has begun the regulatory approval process for a genetically engineered salmon developed by AquaBounty. The salmon grows at twice the rate of traditional salmon and contains genes from the ocean eelpout and Chinook salmon. FDA is considering public comments and potential labeling requirements for the GE salmon, which is the first genetically engineered animal for human consumption. Environmental concerns about the salmon escaping into the wild are also being addressed. The FDA held meetings to discuss the safety of genetically engineered salmon developed by AquaBounty, which grows faster than traditional salmon. The agency presented data supporting the safety of the fish and is reviewing public comments. The Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee is advising FDA officials on whether to approve the salmon and potential labeling requirements. FDA released an Environmental Assessment in 2012, with the comment period ending in 2013. The FDA is evaluating genetically engineered salmon created by AquaBounty under the New Animal Drug Application Process. California passed a law requiring labeling of GE salmon, while some grocery chains have refused to sell it. A coalition is urging the FDA to deny approval. A coalition of organizations and chefs is demanding that the FDA deny approval for genetically engineered salmon by AquaBounty. Environmental concerns include the potential threat to wild salmon populations if the GE salmon were to escape from fish farms. Congressional Members have raised concerns about the FDA's approval process, citing inadequate environmental review and consumer rights being ignored. Members expressed concerns about the safety and potential risks of genetically engineered (GE) salmon, particularly in relation to wild fish populations. AquaBounty's plan to raise the fish in Canada was met with skepticism, as there were worries about the GE fish posing threats to remaining wild Atlantic salmon. Despite assurances of sterility, there were fears that 5% of the fish could remain fertile and mate with wild populations. A coalition of consumer and environmental organizations, along with Congressional Members, opposed the approval of GE salmon. The Center for Food Safety and allied groups submitted numerous comments opposing federal regulatory standards for biotechnology. The U.S. has a different approach to biotechnology regulation compared to other major trading partners like the EU, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and Australia, who have mandatory labeling requirements for genetically modified products. This has led to trade tensions and disruptions in U.S. exports. Despite some GE rice varieties being approved for commercial use, none have been marketed yet. In August 2006, the Secretary of Agriculture announced the presence of \"trace amounts\" of a certain substance. In August 2006, trace amounts of an unapproved variety of GE rice, LLRICE601, were found in U.S. long grain rice samples. Despite reassurances from USDA about no health or safety concerns, the discovery caused disruptions in rice markets. LLRICE601 had not been deregulated by APHIS, unlike other approved Bayer GE rice varieties. The protein in LLRICE601 had been approved for use in other products and had been used safely in various countries. The discovery of trace amounts of unapproved GE rice in U.S. long grain rice samples unsettled rice markets and raised criticisms of U.S. biotechnology regulatory policies. The U.S. rice crop is valued at nearly $2 billion annually, with exports representing over half of production. In 2005, the U.S. was the fourth-leading exporter of rice, with Mexico being the leading buyer. In 2005, the U.S. rice crop faced issues with traces of GE material, leading to price drops and market reactions from the EU and Japan. In 2006, GE material was discovered in U.S. rice exports, with Riceland Foods confirming the presence of the Bayer GE trait in samples collected from various storage locations. The USDA began investigating after being notified by Bayer in July, finding the GE trait in 0.06% of kernels. Consumer and environmental groups criticized USDA for delaying the public announcement of GE material found in rice exports. They called for improved oversight and a moratorium on new field testing permits. Rice farmers from six states filed a lawsuit against Bayer CropScience for negligence in allowing unapproved genetically modified rice. In November 2006, APHIS declared LLRICE601 safe for human consumption and deregulated it. Bayer AG settled for $750 million with U.S. rice farmers in July 2011. Approximately 11,000 farmers in five states will divide the settlement, with eligible farmers receiving $310 per acre for planting rice from 2006 to 2010 and an additional $100 per acre for planting contaminated rice in 2006. Trade concerns arose over the commercialization of glyphosate/Roundup-resistant wheat, with some producers eager to plant the new variety while others feared rejection by foreign customers. A group of U.S. wheat producers petitioned for a more thorough environmental assessment of the Monsanto request, supported by 27 farm, religious, and consumer advocacy organizations. Japanese consumer groups also expressed concerns in March 2004. In early 2004, Japanese consumer groups expressed concerns to U.S. officials about importing U.S. wheat if Monsanto's genetically modified wheat was approved. This led to Monsanto discontinuing its efforts to gain regulatory approval for the modified wheat. Despite withdrawing applications from EPA and APHIS, FDA approved the application in July 2004. Opposition to GE wheat remained strong among U.S. trading partners, but support for planting and exporting GE wheat was growing among some. In 2007, support for planting and exporting GE wheat was growing among some U.S. wheat producers. Wheat grower associations in the United States, Canada, and Australia announced their intention to synchronize commercialization of biotech traits in wheat crops. This sparked opposition from environmental and consumer organizations. Monsanto Canada stated that future GE wheat will have increased drought tolerance, yield, and nitrogen efficiency, with commercialization expected in at least 10 years. Monsanto's research on GE wheat aims to enhance traits like drought tolerance, yield, and nitrogen efficiency, with commercialization expected in 10 years. Field testing of GE wheat by Monsanto led to the discovery of unauthorized varieties in Oregon and Montana, causing trade disruptions with U.S. partners like South Korea and the EU. The U.S., Canada, and Argentina filed a complaint with the WTO against the EU's de facto moratorium on approving new GE crops. The U.S., Canada, and Argentina filed a complaint with the WTO against the EU's moratorium on approving new GE crops. The WTO panel ruled that the moratorium violated WTO rules, even though the EU had lifted it in 2004. EU member states continued to block approved biotech products, leading to ongoing disputes. The WTO ruled that bans on EU-approved GE crops in six member countries violated WTO rules and directed the EU to bring its practices in line with WTO rules by a November 2007 deadline. The EU missed the deadline for compliance with the WTO ruling on GE crops due to individual member states operating their own bans. Some countries like Austria, France, and Greece have prohibited certain GE corn varieties. Spain leads in GE crop cultivation in the EU. The US has temporarily suspended WTO sanctions but remains concerned about EU rules on labeling and tracing GE products discriminating against US exports. The EU's rules on labeling and tracing GE products are seen as discriminatory against U.S. exports. If progress is not made, the issue may go back to the WTO. The U.S. could retaliate by imposing tariffs on EU goods or lifting other WTO agreements. U.S. agricultural interests argue that the EU's labeling and traceability rules are unworkable and unnecessary. The EU defends its mandatory labeling regime for genetically modified (GM) products, while Germany has passed a law holding GM farmers liable for damages to non-GM fields. The differences between the U.S. and the EU on GM products and labeling are a significant point of conflict in T-TIP discussions. The EU's strict regulations on genetically engineered (GE) products, including mandatory labeling and limited approvals for commercial cultivation, have caused tensions in T-TIP discussions. US producers face challenges due to EU's stringent rules and lack of transparency in the approval process for GE crops. This issue could escalate during negotiations. The European Parliament's decision to allow member countries to ban or approve GE crops may complicate T-TIP negotiations on biotechnology policy. The US aims for a common framework for GE approvals, labeling practices consistent with FDA guidelines, and policies in line with Codex Alimentarius Commission Annex. Positions between the US and EU on agricultural biotechnology are becoming more entrenched. Progress in aligning approaches to agricultural biotechnology between the US and EU is uncertain. The differences between the U.S. and EU approaches to agricultural biotechnology revolve around harmonizing regulatory regimes. The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol, an outgrowth of the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, was adopted in 2000 and took effect in 2003. The U.S. is not a party to the CBD or the protocol, but actively participates in negotiations. The protocol allows countries to require prior notifications for biotech seed shipments. The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol, adopted in 2000, requires appropriate labeling and documentation for shipments of products containing LMOs. The United States objected to detailed documentation requirements approved in 2004, citing potential liability damages for harm to the environment or human health from imported GMOs. This could disrupt U.S. exports as consumers are wary of GE foods due to allergenic concerns. Critics of genetically engineered (GE) foods are concerned about potential allergenicity, increased toxicity, and harm to human health. They argue that the FDA relies too heavily on industry-sponsored studies for safety data, lacking transparency and public scrutiny. Some believe additional testing is unnecessary as all foods must meet federal safety standards. In 2004, the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council supported the view that food safety assessment should consider the composition of altered foods. The IOM/NRC recommends assessing food safety based on the composition of altered foods rather than how they were produced. Safety of modified foods should be evaluated case-by-case due to limited ability to predict adverse consequences of genetic changes. Some consumer groups advocate for mandatory labeling of all GE foods to allow informed food choices. The food and biotechnology industries oppose compulsory labeling of genetically engineered (GE) foods, arguing that it could be perceived as a warning label and that scientific evidence supports their safety. They believe mandatory labeling would be costly and unnecessary, suggesting a voluntary system for consumers who prefer GE-free products. In 2012, Californians voted on Proposition 37, which aimed to require labeling of all foods. In fall 2012, Californians voted on Proposition 37, which would have required labeling of all foods containing GE material. Vermont, Connecticut, and Maine also passed mandatory GE labeling laws. On July 23, 2015, the full House passed a voluntary labeling bill, H.R. 1599, to preempt state laws requiring mandatory labeling of GE foods. Opponents of labeling fear costly management changes without a national labeling law. H.R. 1599 would preempt state GE labeling laws, establishing a voluntary national certification program under the federal Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. It aims to stop Vermont's labeling law and repeal Alaska's GE fish labeling requirement. The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015 aims to preempt state GE labeling laws, clarifying that it pertains only to state regulation of GE food products. It preserves current jurisdiction and regulatory authority of FDA and APHIS while adding a new subtitle to strengthen coordination of food safety and agriculture programs. The new subtitle in H.R. 1599 aims to affirm the safety of foods containing GE plant material and continue the voluntary consultation process for GE foods under FDA's 1992 policy guidelines. It would establish a new notification program for GE plants used in foods, requiring FDA approval for safety. Products used as food processing aids or enzymes would not need premarket notification. Additionally, the bill would create a National Genetically Engineered Food Certification Program within USDA to set national labeling standards. The Engineered Food Certification Program under USDA would set national standards for labeling GE and non-GE foods. A \"certifying agent\" would certify whether food products are produced with or without GE technologies, with supply chain controls covering planting, growth, harvesting, processing, and transportation. Livestock products must also be produced without GE technology. Producers seeking certification must submit a food plan outlining their handling and processing procedures. The bill requires entities to submit a food plan for handling and processing procedures, subject to review by USDA and state certifying agents. The Secretary of Agriculture can specify additional label information. Prohibitions include suggesting non-GE products are safer or of higher quality. Products with GE materials must comply with a GE food plan. Labels must be accurate and not misleading, with no claims of superiority over non-GE products. Other provisions include labeling imports. H.R. 1599 requires entities to submit a food plan for handling and processing procedures, with labels needing to be accurate and not misleading. Producers must maintain records subject to USDA review, and FDA is directed to define the term \"natural\" for food labels. USDA can accredit certifying agents for GE and non-GE products, with imports labeled based on USDA standards. The debate over genetically engineered (GE) products is framed as \"sound science\" versus \"politics,\" impacting acceptance in less-developed countries with ties to Europe. Poor countries without strong regulations or scientific infrastructure face conflicts between US \"science-based regulation\" and the EU precautionary principle. Trade relationships with the EU influence acceptance or rejection of GE crops and foods. The acceptance or rejection of GE crops and foods in less-developed countries is influenced by political pressures, trade relationships with trading partners, and ongoing debates about perceived risks in the EU and US. Opposition to GE products, mandatory labeling efforts, and limited expansion of GE agriculture in the EU and US have led biotechnology firms to focus on less-developed countries as their most promising market. The biotechnology industry is looking towards less-developed countries as a promising market for genetically engineered agriculture. These countries may find pest-resistant food crops, improved nutritional quality, and higher yields more appealing than industrial economies. Cotton is currently the major GE crop in less-developed countries, but there is potential for wider acceptance of GE traits in the future. Additionally, as indigenous agricultural expertise grows, genetic engineering for local crops and foods could become more accepted. In Asia, particularly China and India, governments see genetically engineered (GE) varieties as a solution to produce more food for growing populations. China has been researching and planting GE corn, cotton, wheat, soy, tomatoes, and peppers since 1986, with over 10 million acres planted to GE varieties, mostly Upland cotton. As China's urban population expands, they may start planting GE soy and corn, potentially influencing other Asian countries' decisions on accepting GE foods. Critics debate the benefits of biotechnology for food security in developing countries. Critics argue that biotechnology benefits in developing countries are unestablished and pose risks, with concerns over intellectual property rights. Proponents believe GE technology shows promise for sustained agricultural productivity. The debate was highlighted in 2002 when the UN World Food Program appealed for food aid in six southern African countries. The debate over genetically modified corn in U.S. food aid shipments made providing aid to southern African countries difficult and costly. Some countries refused GE corn due to perceived risks. The United States blamed EU policies for these views, maintaining that GE crops are safe to eat. Angola also banned imports of GE food aid despite needing to feed 2 million people. African countries, except South Africa, have limited adoption of biotech crops due to concerns about GE technology concentrating power and resources with multinational corporations. There is fear that this could exploit farmers and limit their rights. The biotechnology industry promotes proprietary seeds for agricultural innovation and environmental benefits. The FAO supports biotechnology for helping the poor in developing countries, but emphasizes the need for regulatory procedures to protect the environment and public health. Some groups criticize GE crops for hidden costs and inadequate examination. The issue of \"mixing\" and adventitious presence of GE material in non-GE material raises questions about liability and sharing responsibility between biotechnology companies and producers. Biotechnology companies may need to share liability with producers for GE material in non-GE crops due to the lack of international standards. This raises questions about responsibility and the confusion it causes consumers. The biotech industry is concerned about the lack of consistent standards for AP thresholds, which is causing confusion among consumers and disrupting trade. The EU regulation sets a tolerance level for non-GM products at 0.9%, with products exceeding this threshold needing to be labeled as GM. U.S. agricultural interests find the EU regulation unworkable and discriminatory, while EU officials argue that their standards are reasonable and consumer-driven. These issues, along with differing approval processes for GE crops in the U.S. and EU, will be significant in future U.S.-EU trade discussions. APHIS is seeking comments on how its regulations should address the LLP question for GE plant material. In response to concerns about the lack of consistent standards for low-level presence (LLP) of regulated genetically engineered (GE) materials in commercial seed or grain, major industry organizations urged the FDA, EPA, and APHIS to establish a policy governing LLP. APHIS published a notice in 2007 describing how it responds to LLP occurrences and proposed criteria under which LLP may not require agency action if it is unlikely to introduce plant pests or noxious weeds. A provision in the 2012 House farm bill would have required USDA to address LLP issues. The 2012 House farm bill did not include a provision for USDA to develop an LLP standard. The environmental impacts of GE plants, including gene flow to wild plants and non-GM crops, are key issues. Concerns about contamination exist with GE alfalfa, sugar beets, and salmon. GE salmon escaping into the wild and breeding with native salmon is a potential threat. The widespread planting of genetically engineered crops resistant to herbicides like glyphosate has led to significant weed resistance issues, prompting the development of newer GE varieties tolerant to potentially more harmful herbicides. A survey found that 49% of U.S. farmers faced herbicide-resistant weeds in 2012, with over 40 million acres affected. This resistance is increasing annually, with 29 species of weeds globally showing some level of resistance. In 2013, 29 weed species worldwide showed resistance to glyphosate, a major issue in Brazil and Argentina. Advocates of biotechnology argue that genetically engineered crops offer environmental benefits by reducing the need for toxic chemicals and soil tillage. Critics warn that genetic engineering poses unpredictable risks to the environment and human health. Critics believe genetically engineered (GE) crops pose unpredictable risks to the environment and human health due to their living nature, making them difficult to control. They fear GE crops could escape into the environment, crossbreed with wild species, and disrupt the natural ecosystem. Critics argue that GE herbicide-tolerant seeds could lead to the creation of \"superweeds\" that out-compete other plants. A 2002 NAS/NRC report found no new distinctions in environmental risks between GE plants and conventionally bred crops, suggesting a need to re-evaluate the potential environmental effects of both. The study concluded that the current regulatory system for biotechnology is more rigorous than oversight for other agricultural products. The 2004 NAS/NRC report highlighted concerns about genetically engineered organisms breeding with wild relatives and escaping into the environment. It recommended using multiple bioconfinement methods to prevent this, calling for more research to improve containment and public confidence in regulation. In 2004, researchers confirmed the spread of GE corn and grass pollen to non-GE crops, raising concerns about containment methods and regulation. GE plants are being developed as \"factories\" for pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds, with field testing conducted between 2004 and 2007 in the United States. No commercialization of these compounds has occurred yet. Plant-based pharmaceuticals, such as vaccines and medicines for various diseases, are being developed as a cost-effective alternative to traditional pharmaceutical production. Field trials for transgenic sunflowers engineered to produce human proinsulin have shown promising results. This new approach poses different environmental and health risks, but proponents believe it could revolutionize the industry. Pharmaceuticals derived from plants offer a new income source for farmers but raise concerns about food supply contamination. In a 2002 incident, GE-altered corn plants meant for pharmaceutical use contaminated soybeans, prompting USDA quarantine. Critics argue for separate evaluation criteria for GE plants producing pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds. Some argue that industrial compounds should be evaluated differently from food crops, especially for biopharm plants. Concerns persist about producing GE plant-made pharmaceuticals in food crops, with calls for strict prevention systems. Suggestions include using non-food crops or banning pharmaceutical crops from agricultural areas. Other concerns include consistency in dosages, quality, and potential environmental issues. APHIS tightened permit conditions in response to these concerns in 2003. APHIS tightened permit conditions for its 2003 field tests of GE plants with pharmaceutical and industrial traits. Changes included increasing minimum distances between traditional corn fields and test sites, doubling fallow zones, restricting crops grown on test sites, using dedicated machinery for pharmaceutical production, and increasing field site inspections and record-keeping requirements. APHIS issued a letter on January 14, 2004, updating guidance on permits for GE plants expressing pharmaceuticals or industrial compounds. These plants are categorized based on their potential for harm, with biopharmed plants falling under a high-risk category. Rice developed by Ventria Bioscience contains human genes and proteins from breast milk and saliva, aiming to treat children with diarrhea in poor countries. Preliminary approval has been granted for commercial production on 3,000 acres. The rice developers have received preliminary approval for growing the rice on 3,000 acres in Kansas to harvest proteins for food products. In 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that APHIS violated environmental laws by approving field trials for pharmaceutical corn in Hawaii. Companies involved were ProdiGene, Monsanto, Hawaii Agriculture Research Center, and Garst Seed. Syngenta and Monsanto stopped planting pharmaceutical crops after the lawsuit. In the coming decade, policy issues regarding the coexistence of traditional and GE-based agricultural production will be a focus for industry, consumer groups, and policymakers. These issues have been a source of conflict in deregulating GE alfalfa and sugar beets. Regulatory issues are increasing in importance as the industry matures and technologies evolve. Some key issues include evolving technologies and regulatory challenges. Some key policy issues in the agricultural industry include evolving technologies like stacked trait varieties, development of GE plant-based industrial and pharmaceutical traits, oversight of second-generation biotechnology traits, transgenic animals and products derived from them, animal welfare concerns, importation of GE products, legal challenges to environmental assessments, and transparency in regulatory issues. The policy issues in the agricultural industry include compliance with regulatory structures, testing and measurement, traceability of GE products, and concerns about herbicide-resistant weeds. Biotechnology companies have developed herbicide-tolerant plant varieties, leading to potential environmental effects and policy implications."
