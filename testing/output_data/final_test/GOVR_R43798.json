    "content": "Following the President's speech, executive branch agencies and the White House announced specific actions on immigration, focusing on border security, unlawfully present population, and future legal immigration. The Administration will implement a new Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Strategy, involving three task forces commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security to enhance border security. The Administration's proposed actions on immigration include increasing border security measures, interdicting illegal entries, and preventing illegal exploitation of legal flows. They also plan to grant deferred action to some unlawfully present aliens, particularly those brought to the U.S. as children or with children who are citizens or LPR aliens. The Department of Homeland Security announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, allowing certain unlawfully present aliens brought to the U.S. as children to receive deferred action and employment authorization. The eligibility criteria excluded those over 31 years old or who entered the U.S. after June 15, 2007. A 2014 initiative extended the duration of deferred action grants to three years and included unlawfully present aliens with children who are U.S. citizens or LPRs. Aliens with children who are U.S. citizens or LPRs may qualify for deferred action and employment authorization under the November 2014 initiatives if they meet specific criteria, including continuous residence in the U.S. since before January 1, 2010, and not being an enforcement priority. Those granted deferred action are eligible for employment authorization if they can show an economic necessity. The revised priorities for civil immigration enforcement include narrowing the scope of highest priority removals to exclude aliens without legal status in the U.S. since 2013, who have not committed specified crimes. The Secure Communities program will be replaced by the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), focusing on aliens convicted of felonies or significant misdemeanors. Unlike Secure Communities, PEP will not involve states and localities holding aliens for removal. The revised priorities for civil immigration enforcement focus on excluding aliens without legal status who have not committed specified crimes. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) will target aliens convicted of felonies or significant misdemeanors, without involving states and localities in holding aliens for removal. Uniform recognition of grants of advance parole is also emphasized to prevent exclusion of aliens returning to the U.S. after departing under advance parole. The Obama Administration announced actions to support high-skilled businesses and workers, including granting \"parole in place\" to immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs seeking to enlist in the Armed Forces. This entails granting parole to unlawfully present aliens within the United States. The Obama Administration's actions aim to ensure all immigrant visas authorized by Congress are issued, avoiding the need for visa recapture in the future. This includes steps to improve the system for determining visa availability. The Obama Administration is taking steps to improve the system for determining immigrant visa availability and considering regulatory changes to assist beneficiaries of employment-based immigrant visa petitions. This includes expanding optional practical training for foreign nationals studying STEM fields in the US on F-1 visas. The Obama Administration is proposing changes to the OPT program for F-1 visa holders in STEM fields, allowing for a 17-month extension for a total of 29 months. They aim to strengthen ties to educational institutions and ensure OPT employment aligns with U.S. labor market protections. Additionally, they plan to utilize provisions for aliens with advanced degrees or exceptional ability to obtain immigrant visas without a sponsoring employer. The Obama Administration is proposing changes to immigration policies, including allowing immigrants with advanced degrees or exceptional ability to obtain visas without a sponsoring employer. This includes parole for inventors, researchers, and founders of start-up enterprises, clarifying specialized knowledge for L-1B visas, and defining \"same or similar job\" for employment-based immigrant visa petitions. The Obama Administration is proposing changes to immigration policies, including allowing immigrants with advanced degrees or exceptional ability to obtain visas without a sponsoring employer. This includes defining \"same or similar job\" for employment-based immigrant visa petitions and reviewing the PERM program to align worker recruitment requirements with occupational shortages and surpluses. DOL is also certifying applications for nonimmigrant T and U visas for victims of human trafficking and labor exploitation. The Obama Administration is proposing changes to immigration policies, including expanding a program for \"provisional waivers\" of bars on alien admission. This program will now include qualifying relatives of LPRs, allowing unlawfully present aliens with U.S. citizen or LPR relatives to be eligible for immigrant visas and legal status adjustment. The Obama Administration's proposed changes to immigration policies include expanding a program for \"provisional waivers\" of bars on alien admission. This program now includes qualifying relatives of LPRs, allowing unlawfully present aliens with U.S. citizen or LPR relatives to be eligible for immigrant visas and legal status adjustment. Obtaining an immigrant visa typically requires leaving the U.S., triggering the 3- and 10-year bars for those unlawfully present. Waivers can be granted for \"extreme hardship\" to the alien's spouse or parents, but the process has historically deterred many from legalizing their status. In 2013, the Obama Administration began allowing spouses or children of U.S. citizens to request provisional waivers of the 3- and 10-year bars to their admission while in the United States. Spouses and children of LPRs became eligible for provisional waivers in 2014. Other actions announced in November 2014 include personnel reforms, promoting naturalization, establishing an interagency task force on \"New Americans,\" and addressing the interplay of immigration and employment law. The Obama Administration implemented various immigration-related actions, including allowing spouses or children of U.S. citizens to request provisional waivers of admission bars. President Obama has not indicated issuing any new orders, except for specific actions in presidential memoranda. Previous actions, such as the \"Family Fairness\" program in 1990, were announced through intra-agency memoranda or fact sheets. President Clinton authorized deferred enforced departure for some unlawfully present aliens from Liberia through a memorandum to the Attorney General. The legal authority for such actions does not depend on whether they were announced by executive order or memorandum. Three broad types of legal authority underlie these actions: prosecutorial discretion, delegations of authority by Congress, and executive discretion in interpretation and application. The executive branch has discretion in interpreting and applying immigration law, including granting deferred action to certain individuals. This discretion is not dependent on explicit authorization from Congress. Prosecutorial discretion allows the executive wide latitude in making these decisions. The executive branch has wide discretion in determining when to prosecute violations of federal law, with potential constraints from the Constitution or federal statutes. Congress has granted specific authority to the executive, such as the ability to grant employment authorization documents to unauthorized aliens. The executive branch has broad discretion in determining when to prosecute violations of federal law, including granting employment authorization documents to unauthorized aliens as defined by the INA. This authority has been used to allow deferred action recipients to obtain EADs based on economic necessity. Other actions, such as paroling inventors and founders of start-up enterprises, granting provisional waivers for unlawful presence, and permitting aliens with advanced degrees to obtain immigrant visas, also involve delegated statutory authority. The Obama Administration has relied on delegated statutory authority to allow individuals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability to obtain immigrant visas without a sponsoring employer if their admission is in the national interest. Questions may arise regarding the consistency of these actions with historical practice, provisions of the INA, or congressional intent. The Administration may also be relying on deference given to the executive in interpreting and applying statutes. The court and agency must follow Congress's intent, but in cases of ambiguity, courts defer to agency interpretations. Congress leaves gaps for the executive to fill in the INA, such as defining \"extreme hardship\" and OPT duration for F-1 visa holders. The Obama Administration's immigration actions addressed gaps in visa issuance and specialized knowledge definitions. The executive must interpret laws reasonably, with deference to Congress's intent. The President has the responsibility to ensure faithful execution of the law. The expanded use of deferred action for certain unlawfully present aliens is based on executive assertions of constitutional authority, specifically prosecutorial discretion in enforcing federal immigration law. This discretion allows immigration officers to decide whether to pursue removal of violators. The discretionary authority in enforcing federal immigration law includes limitations on agency actions, such as the reviewability of general enforcement policies by courts to ensure consistency with congressional objectives. Non-enforcement policies by agencies may be subject to judicial review if they deviate from Congress's intended considerations. The Obama Administration's deferred action initiatives may face court review for potentially abdicating statutory responsibilities. Debate will focus on identifying unlawfully present aliens as non-priorities for removal and expanding deferred action to more aliens, possibly constituting a non-enforcement policy of federal immigration statutes. The INA provides grounds for removal applicable to aliens under the initiative. The Obama Administration's decision to focus enforcement resources on specific removable alien categories, while allowing a substantial portion of the unauthorized population to request deferred action, may be seen as neglecting its responsibilities under the INA. This approach enables a significant number of unlawfully present individuals to seek relief not explicitly authorized by federal statute. The Obama Administration's focus on specific removable alien categories neglects responsibilities under the INA. Resource constraints may limit DHS from pursuing the removal of all unlawfully present aliens, leading to a decision to prioritize those who pose a threat to public safety or have engaged in criminal activity. The Administration's initiative grants some unlawfully present aliens legal permission to remain in the US for a specified period without providing legal immigration status or benefits they are barred from receiving. The initiative is not a blanket policy of non-enforcement, as immigration officers retain discretion. The Obama Administration's initiative focuses on specific removable alien categories, prioritizing those who pose a threat to public safety or have engaged in criminal activity. Immigration officers retain discretion to grant deferred action on a case-by-case basis, and the executive branch's action does not constitute a blanket policy of non-enforcement. Congress may have implicitly approved the executive's use of administrative relief, suggesting that the executive is not abdicating its statutory duties by granting such relief in certain instances.

Immigration officers retain discretion to grant deferred action on a case-by-case basis, and the executive branch's action does not constitute a blanket policy of non-enforcement. In some cases, actions taken by the Obama Administration could potentially be seen as violating the INA, with recent court findings questioning the legality of DACA under certain provisions. The Obama Administration's initiative focuses on specific removable alien categories, prioritizing those who pose a threat to public safety or have engaged in criminal activity. Immigration officers have discretion to grant deferred action on a case-by-case basis. Recent court findings question the legality of DACA under certain provisions of the INA, as aliens granted deferred action through DACA may not have been placed in removal proceedings as required by the law. This could impact future grants of deferred action and other executive actions by the Obama Administration.

This could impact future grants of deferred action and other executive actions by the Obama Administration. In issuing guidance regarding waivers of the 3- and 10-year bars for aliens unlawfully present in the US, INA \u00c2\u00a7212(a)(9)(B)(v) may preclude waivers based on mere \"hardship\" instead of \"extreme hardship\" or considering hardship to U.S. citizen or LPR children instead of spouses or parents. In the immigration context, the term legalization refers to the process of acquiring legal status, typically as LPRs, for persons unlawfully present. Aliens granted deferred action are considered \"lawfully present\" and may be eligible for benefits like driver's licenses. Aliens granted deferred action are considered \"lawfully present\" but lack lawful status, so they do not automatically receive LPR status, a \"green card,\" or citizenship. They may potentially have their status legalized by Congress in the future. However, they are generally not eligible for public benefits due to the PRWORA of 1996. Aliens granted deferred action are seen as \"lawfully present\" in the United States, despite not being qualified aliens. While they are generally barred from receiving public benefits, subsequent Congresses have enacted legislation allowing for certain benefits inconsistent with PRWORA, such as Medicaid and CHIP coverage under CHIPRA. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows \"lawfully present\" individuals to participate in certain health care programs, including Medicaid and CHIP coverage. Aliens granted deferred action through DACA have been deemed ineligible for some benefits under ACA, but it is unclear how those granted deferred action through November initiatives will be treated. Aliens granted deferred action may be eligible for state and local benefits as states can enact legislation to provide public benefits to unlawfully present aliens. PRWORA's definition of public benefit is limited to various types of assistance. The PRWORA defines public benefits as assistance provided by a government agency or appropriated funds. Legal challenges to the Obama Administration's actions may face barriers due to standing requirements. Standing requirements for seeking judicial relief from a federal court are derived from Article III of the Constitution, limiting jurisdiction to actual cases and controversies. To demonstrate standing, parties must show they have suffered a concrete and particularized injury, traceable to the defendant's actions, and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. Lack of standing is often found when the sole injury is the government's alleged failure to follow the law. Government officers and employees lack standing if their only injury is being forced to violate their oaths by implementing an allegedly unlawful policy. They must show a separate adverse consequence from violating their oath, with differing opinions on whether the possibility of discipline suffices for standing. In the case of ICE officers challenging DACA, the issue of standing was reviewed. The ICE officers challenging DACA were found to have standing due to the possibility of discipline, which was considered an adverse employment action. However, the jurisdiction of the case was determined to be with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) rather than the court. Individual Members of Congress generally lack standing to challenge executive actions unless they can show a personal or institutional injury that cannot be addressed by existing legislative remedies. In some cases, states have challenged the federal government's failure to enforce immigration law, claiming it imposes costs on them. These challenges have been rejected on standing grounds or deemed nonjusticiable political questions. The question doctrine suggests that courts should avoid deciding issues entrusted to other branches of government. Recently, an argument has been made that U.S. workers impacted by competition from foreign workers could have standing to challenge the Obama Administration's actions. This argument is based on a court decision where U.S. herders successfully challenged the Department of Labor's guidance on foreign herders' wages. However, this case may differ from a challenge to the Obama Administration's deferred actions. The Obama Administration's deferred actions are being challenged due to concerns about protecting U.S. workers from foreign competition when issuing nonimmigrant visas. Arguments have been made regarding historical precedent for granting deferred action to certain groups of aliens. The executive branch has historically exercised discretion in enforcement and prosecution. The executive branch has historically exercised discretion in enforcement and prosecution by providing relief from removal to certain groups of aliens through various forms such as parole, extended voluntary departure, deferred enforced departure, temporary protected status, and deferred action. However, the legal basis for these actions can vary, with some grants of parole being authorized by Congress in the 1960s. The executive branch has historically exercised discretion in enforcement and prosecution by providing relief from removal to certain groups of aliens through various forms such as parole, extended voluntary departure, deferred enforced departure, temporary protected status, and deferred action. Congress has also adopted legislation encouraging the executive to exercise prosecutorial discretion. The \"Family Fairness\" initiatives of 1987 and 1990 granted indefinite voluntary departure and employment authorization to certain immediate relatives of aliens who had legalized their status. The Obama Administration's 2014 deferred action initiatives are similar to the Family Fairness initiatives, providing temporary relief from removal and work authorization to certain unlawfully present aliens based on humanitarian factors. Differences include the lack of a centralized application process under Reagan and Bush, some denied aliens facing removal in Family Fairness, and no reported removal proceedings for DACA recipients. The Obama Administration's 2014 deferred action initiatives, like the Family Fairness initiatives, offer temporary relief and work authorization to certain unlawfully present aliens based on humanitarian factors. Differences include the lack of a centralized application process under Reagan and Bush, some denied aliens facing removal in Family Fairness, and no reported removal proceedings for DACA recipients. The weight given to these similarities or dissimilarities may depend on one's views on the current initiatives."
