    "title": "SB 152",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that California has high poverty rates despite having large TANF cash grants. Census data shows a poverty rate of 23.4%, the highest in the nation. The economic recovery has not benefited low- and middle-income Californians, with income gains stagnating for the bottom three-fifths of the income distribution. According to the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office (LAO), academic studies show that the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) increases work participation and reduces poverty. However, there have been high levels of improper payments with the federal EITC. California should consider adopting its own version of the EITC with proper enforcement activities. A new section is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code, allowing a credit against the \"net tax\" for qualified taxpayers based on the federal earned income credit amount. The federal earned income credit amount is determined under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The Franchise Tax Board will recompute certain amounts for taxable years starting in 2017. The California Department of Industrial Relations transmits the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index to the Franchise Tax Board annually. The Board then computes an inflation adjustment factor and adjusts the income tax brackets accordingly for the preceding taxable year. For tax purposes, a \"qualified taxpayer\" is an individual eligible for a federal income tax credit under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code, who is legally working in the state with valid documentation. Any minor errors are treated as mathematical errors on the return. If the credit exceeds the allowable amount, certain conditions apply. The excess credit from this section can be carried over to reduce future tax liabilities. Any excess credit beyond tax liability will be credited against other amounts due and refunded to the qualified taxpayer. Payments made to a qualified taxpayer under this section are not taxable income. The credit allowed by this section must be claimed on a timely filed original return. The Franchise Tax Board's determinations on return receipt dates cannot be reviewed. Amounts paid under this section are treated like the federal earned income credit for determining eligibility for benefits under the Welfare and Institutions Code. The Franchise Tax Board administers enforcement activities to address improper payments. The Franchise Tax Board administers enforcement activities to address improper payments, collaborates with the Employment Development Department to verify taxpayer income information, establishes criteria for high-risk returns, and submits reports to the Legislature on credit usage and improper payments. The Franchise Tax Board may prescribe rules for this section, Section 41 does not apply to the credit, and this section will be repealed on December 1, 2023. This act is a tax levy and will take immediate effect."
