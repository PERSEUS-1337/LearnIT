    "content": "Disasters like wildfires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and winter storms impact American communities annually. Managing disaster debris, which can include various materials like trees, collapsed structures, and personal belongings, is crucial for community recovery. Proper debris management, such as recycling or composting, is essential to prevent overloading landfills. Inadequate debris handling can hinder recovery efforts and pose safety risks. Improper debris management post-disaster can lead to long-term environmental and health issues. Hazardous waste may mix with debris, causing contamination. Federal and state waste management requirements and challenges are discussed in this report, along with the roles of various agencies in providing debris removal assistance. The report focuses on federal agency roles in disaster debris removal, specifically FEMA, the Corps, and EPA. Waste management standards are established under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, with EPA regulating hazardous waste under Subtitle C and non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D. Under Subtitle D of RCRA, EPA regulates solid waste to prevent \"open dumping,\" with states having primary authority. Disaster debris, created after natural or man-made disasters, includes C&D waste, vegetative debris, damaged vehicles, and hazardous chemicals. Disaster debris management involves handling materials from consumer appliances to hazardous chemicals, with decisions made by local or state agencies. EPA and/or the Corps may provide assistance if requested, but ultimately it is the state's decision on how to manage the waste, typically involving volume reduction through methods like burning or recycling. Disaster debris reduction methods include open burning/incineration, recycling, chipping, grinding, or composting, with remaining waste disposed of in landfills. State agencies managing disaster debris face challenges in ensuring quick and safe disposal to prevent health and environmental risks. Factors such as improper reduction and disposal practices can contribute to threats to public health and safety. One of the greatest challenges in managing disaster debris is the overwhelming volume generated, with Hurricane Katrina creating 118 million cubic yards of debris. Coordinating the removal of large amounts of waste can be daunting, especially for unprepared regions. Debris management after a disaster can be challenging due to the large volume generated. Regions must coordinate debris removal, designate staging areas, and find waste haulers. Reusing and recycling waste can reduce costs, but lack of space may hinder implementation. Community opposition to burning debris may arise. Although most disaster debris is not hazardous, it can still pose risks. Safe management options for disaster debris depend on the ability to separate contaminated debris from non-hazardous waste. Vegetative debris can be reduced by chipping or burning, with potential volume reductions of up to 75% and 90% respectively. However, burning or chipping may not be safe for debris contaminated with sewage or oil. Safe management options for disaster debris depend on the ability to separate contaminated debris from non-hazardous waste. C&D landfills may not be safe for reducing vegetative debris contaminated with sewage, oil, or other contaminants as they are not subject to federal design and operational criteria. States determine the criteria for C&D landfills, and in emergencies, the definition of C&D waste may be broadened to include debris generated post-disaster. If commingled with hazardous materials, this waste may be disposed of in landfills not designed for such wastes. EPA recommends removing hazardous materials before disposal. The EPA and states aim to remove hazardous materials like asbestos and lead-based paint from construction and demolition waste before landfill disposal. Reusing and recycling C&D waste can reduce costs and strain on disposal facilities. If hazardous materials are mixed with C&D waste and cannot be separated, it may end up in a landfill not equipped to handle it. Private property debris removal is typically not federally funded, but moving debris to public areas may qualify for funding. Residents returning to areas affected by disasters may need to assist in debris removal from private property to expedite cleanup and rebuilding. Separating different types of debris is crucial for efficient waste management. If residents do not separate their waste, waste management contractors or landfill operators may have to do so, which is a time-consuming and costly process. Debris removal after disasters is a critical and potentially dangerous process. Table 1 categorizes disaster debris and factors affecting management options, such as burning, recycling, or disposal in landfills. Federal assistance under the Stafford Act is available for governors to request in case of emergencies or major disasters. The presidential declaration authorizes federal agencies to provide assistance for disaster response, including debris removal. The National Response Framework outlines guidelines for federal agencies to respond to disasters, organizing capabilities into 14 Emergency Support Functions. The National Response Framework organizes federal agencies into 14 Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) to coordinate interagency support for incident response. ESFs like Public Works and Engineering (ESF #3) and Oil and Hazardous Materials Response (ESF #10) involve debris removal missions, with lead agencies like the Corps and EPA providing support. FEMA, the Corps, and EPA play roles in disaster debris removal. FEMA provides funding for eligible debris removal activities and may offer direct federal assistance to governments lacking capability. Funding is coordinated through FEMA's Public Assistance Grant Program, reimbursing governments and nonprofits for response efforts. Debris removal must be necessary due to the disaster to be eligible for funding. Activities eligible for assistance in disaster debris removal must be required as a result of the disaster event, located within a designated disaster area, and the legal responsibility of an eligible applicant. These activities must be in the public interest, such as eliminating immediate threats to lives, public health, and safety, ensuring economic recovery of the affected community, or mitigating risks to life and property by removing damaged structures. If a local or state government lacks the capability for debris removal, they can request federal assistance. The federal government can assist with debris removal activities after a disaster. FEMA may request help from other federal agencies through a \"mission assignment.\" The Corps and EPA are commonly tasked with debris removal responsibilities. The Corps provides assistance after receiving a mission assignment from FEMA, coordinating engineering support and technical assistance for disaster response. The Corps may be assigned by FEMA to remove disaster debris from various areas and provide technical assistance for debris removal contracts. They coordinate landfill and burn sites, train debris monitors, and ensure proper management of contaminated debris with EPA's help. The Corps, in coordination with EPA, manages disaster assistance and debris removal. They are authorized to collect and remove drift and debris from harbors, remove obstructions from waterways, and assist with debris removal from flood control works. EPA responds to incidents involving oil or hazardous materials. The EPA responds to potential discharges of oil, hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants that may endanger public health. They work in accordance with the National Contingency Plan and may assist in managing hazardous wastes, locating proper disposal sites, and monitoring debris management methods to prevent risks to human health and the environment. They collaborate with other federal agencies like the Corps and the Coast Guard for waste collection and segregation. The Corps and the Coast Guard collaborate with states to facilitate waste collection, segregation, and disposal after disasters. State environmental agencies may issue their own declarations of emergency to specify debris removal operations. For example, after Hurricane Katrina, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality allowed the disposal of flooded homes' contents as construction and demolition waste. After disasters like Hurricane Katrina, states collaborate with the Corps and Coast Guard for debris removal. Each state manages its waste program, including debris disposal in landfills. Local agencies issue permits for debris removal on private property. Proper pre-disaster planning is crucial for managing large volumes of mixed debris effectively. FEMA emphasizes the importance of having a plan in place to restore public services efficiently. Communities with a proper plan in place are better prepared to restore public services and ensure public health and safety after a disaster. FEMA encourages governments to establish a Debris Management Plan (DMP) to manage debris efficiently. FEMA provides technical assistance to develop DMPs and approves plans that meet required criteria. The DMP must identify likely incidents and types of debris, as well as applicable laws for handling and disposal. President Obama signed this initiative on January 29, 2013. President Obama signed the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 into law on January 29, 2013, amending the Stafford Act to include Section 428. This section authorizes FEMA to use \"alternative procedures\" for debris removal activities, aiming to reduce costs, increase flexibility, expedite assistance, and provide financial incentives for timely project completion. FEMA can fund debris management planning and offer incentives to governments to prepare a DMP for approval. FEMA offers incentives to state, tribal, or local governments to prepare a Debris Management Plan (DMP) for approval. Having a FEMA-approved DMP results in a one-time, 2% increase in funding for debris removal activities. Currently, FEMA is implementing debris-related alternative procedures through pilot programs authorized until June 27, 2018. Relevant information on requirements and federal agency roles can be found in FEMA's Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide, Debris Management Guide, and related resources. The FEMA, Army Corps of Engineers, and EPA provide resources and guidance on debris management after disasters. This includes FEMA's Debris Management Plan incentives, alternative procedures, and the Corps' mission assignment for debris removal. Additionally, the EPA offers guidance on planning for disaster debris."
