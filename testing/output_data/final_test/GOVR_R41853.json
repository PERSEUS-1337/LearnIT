    "content": "State and local governments rely on general sales and use taxes for a significant portion of their tax revenue, with state governments deriving 31.7% and local governments deriving 11.0% of their total tax revenue from these taxes in FY2010. The concern over the erosion of tax base due to the expansion of e-commerce, estimated at $3.9 trillion in 2012, is a growing issue for state and local governments. Compliance with use taxes, which consumers are required to remit for online purchases, is low. The concern over the erosion of tax base due to e-commerce, estimated at $3.9 trillion in 2012, has led to states participating in the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) to simplify tax codes. Congress may be asked to allow states to require out-of-state vendors to collect taxes from resident customers. Bills such as S. 743 and S. 336 in the 113th Congress aim to address this issue. The SSUTA member states and non-member states meeting simplification standards may compel out-of-state vendors with over $1 million in remote sales to collect sales and use taxes. Previous bills in Congress aimed to grant similar authority to member states and implement simplification efforts for tax collection. The report clarifies issues in remote sales tax collection, including state enforcement challenges and the impact of congressional action. It includes a state-by-state analysis of sales tax history, starting with Mississippi's implementation in 1932. The sales tax was introduced in the late 1960s and quickly adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia. The revenue generated depends on the tax base and rate, which vary among states. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) aims to standardize definitions and rates across states. The sales tax is a transaction tax on tangible personal property, excluding most services. Groceries are exempt or taxed at a lower rate in most states. Table 1 shows state and local tax revenue data and estimates each state's sales tax base. Sales tax revenue includes collections from individuals and businesses. The sales tax base as a share of income is a rough approximation of the state sales tax base, with a higher percentage indicating a greater number of taxable items and services. The sales tax base includes over 100% of personal income, indicating potential pyramiding of the tax. Pyramiding occurs when businesses pay tax on goods multiple times. Roughly half of personal income is spent on taxable items. Some states have a single sales tax rate, while others have a combination of state and local taxes. As of March 1, 2013, California had the highest state sales tax rate of 7.5%, with Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Tennessee at 7.0%. Arizona had the highest potential combined state and local rate of 13.7% as of January 1, 2012. Residents in high tax rate areas may benefit more from online purchases to evade taxes. High-rate states are at risk of revenue loss due to tax evasion, especially with the growth of Internet commerce. These states are more likely to support reforms to maintain their sales and use tax revenue base. The amount of revenue generated by the sales tax varies by state, with compliance affected by sales tax collected by vendors and use tax remitted by purchasers. States vary in compliance with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA), with high vendor compliance but lower purchaser compliance in e-commerce. Some states are \"member\" states fully compliant with SSUTA, while others are \"associate\" states needing minor changes. Many states rely on sales, income, and property taxes for revenue. In FY2010, the U.S. relied on sales taxes, income taxes, and property taxes for revenue. Property tax had the highest reliance at 34.8%, followed by sales tax at 22.4% and individual income tax at 20.5%. Washington, Tennessee, and South Dakota were the top states in sales tax reliance due to not having a broad-based income tax. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Project (SSTP) was created in 2000 by 43 states and the District of Columbia to simplify and synchronize state sales and use tax. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Project (SSTP) was created in 2000 by 43 states and the District of Columbia to simplify and synchronize state sales and use tax laws. The SSTP was dissolved once the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) became effective on October 1, 2005. The SSUTA agreement focuses on uniformity and simplification of state-level administration of sales and use tax, with 10 key points identified for achieving the goal of streamlining. The latest amendments to the SSUTA were approved on May 24, 2012. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) aims to simplify state sales tax administration by implementing four key requirements: state level administration, uniform tax base, simplified tax rates, and uniform sales sourcing rules. Multistate businesses currently face complex compliance issues due to varying state sales tax laws. Under SSUTA, businesses would remit sales taxes to a single state agency, reducing compliance costs and inefficiencies. States would share the administrative costs of implementing the new system. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) aims to simplify state sales tax administration by implementing four key requirements. States would share administrative costs under SSUTA, with standardized vendor compensation rates based on tax collection volume. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) requires states to have uniform sales tax bases across all jurisdictions. This can be complex due to differing definitions of taxable items like groceries and candy. Member states will have taxes collected by remote vendors, while associate members do not have this requirement. Under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA), a common definition of candy is necessary for a streamlined sales tax regime. \"Candy\" is defined as a preparation of sugar, honey, or sweeteners with chocolate, fruits, nuts, or flavorings in bar, drop, or piece form, excluding any preparation with flour or requiring refrigeration. States have the authority to determine if candy is taxable and at what rate. SSUTA allows for one state tax rate with an exception for a second rate on food and drugs, along with an additional local jurisdiction rate based on ZIP code. States must maintain a catalogue of rates for all ZIP codes, averaging rates for ZIP codes with multiple rates. Under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA), states determine tax rates for candy based on a common definition. The agreement establishes \"origin\" and \"destination\" sourcing rules for sales tax collection. Member states set a single statewide rate, which includes state and local taxes. There is debate over the potential for consumers to pay higher tax rates than required under the SSUTA. The National Governors Association supports the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) to address concerns about collecting remote taxes and restore fairness between local retail stores and remote vendors. The agreement requires states to include a provision for consumers to receive credits for overpayments and for remote vendors to collect sales and use taxes from their customers. The NGA supports the SSUTA to restore fairness between local and remote sellers by collecting taxes owed under existing law. This is also backed by other state and local government organizations, as well as large retailers who believe the current system gives an unfair advantage to Internet retailers. Several retailers are seeking greater simplification and increased vendor compensation from states for collecting state sales taxes, while opponents of SSUTA legislation argue that the administrative obstacles are too costly and compliance with use tax laws could be improved through consumer awareness and enforcement activities. Business groups also believe the collection requirement would still be burdensome, and anti-tax groups view the SSUTA as a new tax burden rather than a simplification of the current tax system. Opponents view the SSUTA as a new tax burden rather than a simplification of the current tax system. State efforts include adopting SSUTA simplification and implementing Amazon laws. Federal legislation grants states authority to require remote vendors to collect sales taxes if they meet SSUTA requirements. The legislation requires non-SSUTA-compliant states to meet simplification standards for tax administration, including specifying applicable taxes, exemptions, a single tax administration entity, uniform tax base, taxability matrix, and free software for remote vendors. The legislation includes a small seller exception for firms with less than $1 million in annual \"remote\" sales, exempting them from the collection requirement. Vendors in states without a sales tax would still need to collect sales and use taxes on shipments to states with a sales tax, causing contention for states like Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. Businesses above the $1 million threshold would be responsible for tax collection and remittance. In the 112th Congress, legislation like S. 1452 and H.R. 2701 aimed to grant SSUTA member states the authority to compel out-of-state vendors to collect sales and use taxes, addressing the Supreme Court's recommendation in Quill Corporation v. North Dakota. The legislation would allow states fully adopting the SSUTA to collect sales taxes from large businesses without a nexus in the state, with a definition of \"sufficiently large business\" left to the SSUTA governing board. Congress would grant this authority if 10 states representing 20% of the total population of all states with a sales tax implemented the SSUTA. In the 112th Congress, legislation aimed to grant SSUTA member states the authority to compel out-of-state vendors to collect sales and use taxes. The legislation included requirements for administering the new sales tax system after the SSUTA adoption threshold has been achieved, such as a centralized registration system, uniform definitions, single tax rates, state-level administration, uniform sourcing rules, procedures for certification, filing returns, and seller compensation. Some modifications to the SSUTA or legislation would have been necessary for enactment. Some modifications to the SSUTA or legislation would have been necessary for enactment. Member states request remote sellers to voluntarily collect sales taxes on items purchased by customers outside their home state. Participating states share the burden of tax collection to ease the process for sellers. Business-to-business transactions are often exempt from retail sales tax to avoid \"pyramiding\" of taxes. If a business purchases products for resale, they are typically not subject to retail sales tax to avoid double taxation. The tax treatment of business purchases varies by state, with approximately 18% of purchases being taxable. Entities can claim sales tax exemptions by presenting a tax-free certification at the point of transaction. Non-profit organizations, including those with religious missions, are often exempt from state sales taxes. The SSUTA aims to establish a uniform system for states to define taxable goods and services, as well as identify entities exempt from sales taxes, such as non-profit organizations. H.R. 3179 and S. 1832 proposed similar policies without a formal multistate compact like SSUTA. The state must create a remote seller sales and use tax return with uniform tax base and one of three tax collection structures. Remote vendors with low sales volume are exempt from collection responsibility. Non-SSUTA states could also have remote collection authority under H.R. 3179 and S. 1832. S. 1832, like H.R. 3179, allows remote collection authority for non-SSUTA states if simplification requirements are met. Key requirements include a single state-level agency for tax administration, uniform tax base, destination tax rate, and software for remote vendors. The bill also includes a small seller exception and limits collection authority to sales tax only. Some states have enacted \"Amazon Laws\" related to sales tax collection by the online retailer. These laws focus on affiliate agreements that establish physical presence for Amazon in certain states. Amazon currently collects sales taxes in Washington, Kansas, Kentucky, New York, and North Dakota. Several legal challenges have been presented to the Amazon laws requiring sales tax collection by the online retailer in certain states. Proponents of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) are concerned about the impact of these laws on simplification efforts. Amazon has expressed support for congressionally approved collection authority with modifications. Congress may consider economic issues such as the influence of SSUTA on state tax systems, the impact of changes in Internet transaction treatment on sales tax reliant states, and the potential implications of streamlining legislation. The growth of tax-free Internet transactions, both business-to-business and business-to-consumer, will likely amplify the efficiency losses from altered consumer behavior in states reliant on sales tax. The optimal commodity tax theory suggests that tax rates should be based on the price elasticity of demand for products. Taxing price inelastic products at a higher rate and price elastic products at a lower rate can improve economic efficiency. However, measuring the price elasticity of products available online is challenging, and the efficiency gain from lower tax rates on Internet transactions may be minimal. The efficiency gain from lower tax rates on Internet transactions may be small, with vendors potentially changing locations to avoid collecting sales taxes, leading to higher transportation costs that could erode the tax advantage in the long run. For example, a Virginia consumer may choose to buy from an Internet retailer in Georgia offering a woodworking chisel set for $52 inclusive of profit and shipping costs, compared to a local Virginia hardware store selling it for $50. This could result in customers being indifferent between the two retailers before taxes, impacting their purchasing decisions. The imposition of a 5.0% state and local sales tax in Virginia results in a final sales price of $52.50 for consumers. This higher price may lead consumers to switch to buying from a Georgia-based Internet retailer to avoid the tax. The evasion of the use tax represents a loss in economic efficiency, with an additional $2 in production costs. If the Internet vendor continues to operate without the tax advantage, consumers may still choose to buy from them. The sales tax is often criticized as regressive, disproportionately burdening the poor. Internet shoppers, who are better off, can avoid paying tax on more of their purchases, exacerbating the regressiveness. As access to the Internet increases, this inequity may worsen in the short run. The growth of Internet-based commerce may reduce inequity in the \"digital divide\" as access to the Internet becomes more widespread. Equity issues arise for businesses regarding sales tax collection, with local retailers burdened while Internet retailers are not. This disparity in tax burdens can be significant in high tax rate states, leading consumers to purchase from out-of-state vendors. States reliant on sales and use tax revenue are most affected by the rise of Internet commerce, facing efficiency losses due to higher tax rates. States with high tax rates drive a larger wedge between retail and Internet prices, exacerbating efficiency loss from sales tax. Researchers estimated a $11.4 billion revenue loss from \"new e-commerce\" in 2012, excluding phone or catalog purchases. California, Texas, and New York were projected to lose billions in revenue."
