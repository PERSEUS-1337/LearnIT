    "content": "\"Normal trade relations\" (NTR) or \"most-favored-nation\" (MFN) status ensures equal treatment in trade. Only Cuba and North Korea lack NTR status with the US. NTR countries have lower import duties, giving them a price advantage. The Trade Act of 1974 restricts NTR status for certain countries, including communist nations. The Jackson-Vanik amendment further limits NTR eligibility. The Jackson-Vanik amendment restricts NTR status and access to US credit facilities for countries that deny freedom of emigration to their citizens. The President can remove these restrictions if the country complies with the amendment's conditions. The President must confirm compliance in semiannual reports to Congress, with the possibility of a resolution of disapproval. The President can also waive the freedom-of-emigration requirements if it promotes the amendment's objectives. The Jackson-Vanik amendment restricts NTR status and access to US credit facilities for countries that deny freedom of emigration to their citizens. The President can remove these restrictions if the country complies with the amendment's conditions, subject to annual renewal and congressional disapproval. A bilateral agreement is required for NTR treatment, with a joint resolution needed for it to go into effect. In 1990, the US and the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement under Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, which was later applied to US-Russian trade relations. Since September 1994, Russia has received NTR status under the full compliance provision, with presidential extensions facing little congressional opposition. Russian leaders pushed for Russia to be removed from Jackson-Vanik coverage, arguing it was outdated due to their democracy and market economy. While Russia was still under the Jackson-Vanik amendment, other former Soviet republics like Kyrgyzstan received permanent and unconditional NTR. Soviet republics like Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, and Armenia received permanent and unconditional NTR. The US granted PNTR to Ukraine in 2006, which irked Russian leaders. Legislation was passed to extend PNTR to Russia, removing restrictions under the Trade Act of 1974. President Obama signed the law in December 2012, marking a shift from limited economic ties during the Cold War. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian leaders have been dismantling the central economic planning system, liberalizing foreign trade and investment. U.S.-Russian economic relations have expanded, with U.S. imports growing due to rising world prices of oil and natural resources. U.S. exports to Russia include meat, machinery parts, and aircraft parts. U.S. exports and imports with Russia fluctuated due to the global financial crisis and economic downturn in 2009, but showed signs of recovery in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, U.S. exports continued to increase while imports decreased somewhat. Russia was the 28th-largest export market and 16th-largest source of imports for the United States in 2012, with trade heavily concentrated in a few commodity categories. Russia's treatment of U.S. meat imports is a sensitive issue in trade relations. The rise in Russian incomes has increased demand for meat, with U.S. producers, especially of poultry, becoming major sources for the Russian market. In 2009, Russia was the largest market for U.S. poultry meat exports. New regulations on imports of poultry were implemented by the Russian government on January 1, 2010, citing safety concerns over the chlorine wash used by U.S. producers. After discussions between U.S. and Russian officials, the dispute was resolved, and U.S. shipments of poultry to Russia resumed, although there were delays due to Russian demands for inspections of U.S. poultry processing plants. The delay in U.S. poultry shipments to Russia was due to Russian demands for plant inspections. A compromise was reached in 2010, but exports still dropped by 70% by 2011. Russia's lack of intellectual property rights protection has deterred U.S. investors, as highlighted in the USTR's reports. The United States has concerns about Russia's weak enforcement of intellectual property rights, including internet piracy. Structural problems and inefficient government regulations have hindered trade and investment with the U.S. Exporters also face issues with complicated and time-consuming Russian customs regulations. PNTR for Russia is linked to its efforts to join the WTO, as the U.S. would need to extend PNTR to fulfill WTO requirements. Russia applied to join the WTO in 1993 and completed negotiations with a Working Party including the US and EU. Concerns were raised about Russia's IPR enforcement, SPS regulations, agricultural subsidies, state-owned enterprises, and import restrictions on products with encryption technology. Putin announced Russia's decision to abandon its WTO application as a single entity. Russia initially planned to join the WTO with Belarus and Kazakhstan as a customs union but later decided to pursue accession separately. President Obama and President Medvedev aimed to resolve remaining issues by September 30, 2010, with the US providing technical assistance. By October 1, 2010, the US and Russia had reached agreements on various commitments, including amendments to laws related to IPR protection. Russia completed negotiations with the Working Party and was formally invited to join the WTO on December 16, 2011. President Putin signed the accession protocol into law on July 21, 2012, and Russia officially became a WTO member on August 22, 2012. PNTR was a significant issue in Russia's WTO accession due to Title IV still applying at the time, leading the US to invoke nonapplication of WTO rules in its trade with Russia. The United States invoked nonapplication of WTO rules in its trade with Russia, removing the application of Title IV and granting PNTR to Russia. The law required the USTR to report annually on Russia's implementation of its WTO commitments. The USTR report to committees on enforcing Russia's compliance with WTO commitments, promoting rule of law, and supporting trade and investment. Measures against bribery and corruption in Russia to be taken by the Secretary of Commerce. Description of Russian policies affecting U.S. digital trade to be included in USTR's annual trade barriers report. The USTR's annual trade barriers report under Section 181 of the Trade Act of 1974 and negotiations for a bilateral agreement with Russia on SPS measures were discussed. The law also authorized PNTR for Moldova and included the Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, imposing sanctions on individuals involved in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky."
