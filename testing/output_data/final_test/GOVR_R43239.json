    "content": "The report examines the political and economic situation in Venezuela under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, including crackdowns on opposition protests. It also discusses Venezuela's political and economic environment in 2015 and 2016, the opposition's legislative victory, attempts to remove Maduro, deteriorating conditions, and U.S. relations with Venezuela, including sanctions on Venezuelan officials. Significant recent developments in Venezuela include President Maduro appointing Tareck El Aissami as vice president, replacing Arist\u00f3bulo Ist\u00fariz. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee expressed concern about the crisis in Venezuela in S.Res. 537. The recent developments in Venezuela include the political, economic, social, and humanitarian crisis, urging the release of political prisoners, and calling for respect of constitutional and democratic processes. A U.S. federal court convicted two nephews of Venezuelan First Lady Cilia Flores for conspiring to transport cocaine. The Organization of American States (OAS) adopted a declaration supporting national dialogue in Venezuela and encouraging concrete results within a reasonable timeframe. On November 12, 2016, the Venezuelan government and opposition completed a second round of talks, committing to peaceful coexistence and resolving issues such as food and medicine supply. Some critics view the dialogue as a way for the government to avoid taking real actions, like releasing political prisoners. Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon visited Venezuela from October 31 to November 2, 2016. On October 30, 2016, government and opposition representatives in Venezuela held talks mediated by the Vatican and former presidents, aiming to resolve issues. The recall referendum process was suspended on October 20, 2016, due to fraud allegations. On September 27, 2016, the House approved a resolution expressing concern about the humanitarian situation in Venezuela. The House approved a resolution expressing concern about the humanitarian situation in Venezuela and urging the release of political prisoners. The Venezuelan government was called upon to hold the recall referendum this year. The signature drive for the recall referendum process was scheduled for October 26-28, 2016, with a potential referendum in early 2017. President Obama declared Venezuela non-compliant with international antidrug obligations for the 12th consecutive year. On August 11, 2016, the United States and 14 other OAS members urged Venezuela to engage in dialogue and complete the presidential recall referendum process without delay. Additionally, a 2015 indictment against two Venezuelan military officials for cocaine trafficking was unsealed by a U.S. Federal Court. President Maduro appointed General N\u00e9stor Luis Reverol Torres, former head of Venezuela's National Anti-Narcotics Office, as Minister of Interior and Justice. Under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela underwent political and economic changes, including the adoption of a new constitution and nationalization of enterprises fueled by oil profits. Under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela saw economic growth from oil proceeds funding social programs, while democratic institutions deteriorated and political polarization increased. Ch\u00e1vez's election in 1998 marked a rejection of traditional parties, leading to strained relations with the United States due to anti-American rhetoric. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's rise to power in Venezuela was fueled by disillusionment with corrupt politicians and mismanagement of oil wealth. He campaigned for constitutional reform to address elite domination and misuse of state oil revenues. The country's stable political system eroded after 1989, leading to economic and political challenges. Former President Carlos Andres Perez's austerity program sparked riots and violence. In 1992, two attempted military coups threatened President Perez's presidency, one led by Ch\u00e1vez. President Perez was dismissed in May 1993 for misusing public funds. Former President Rafael Caldera brought political stability in December 1993 but faced a severe banking crisis. The economy improved in 1997 but a decline in oil prices led to a deep recession in 1998, contributing to Ch\u00e1vez's election. In 1998, Ch\u00e1vez won a landslide election and brought huge political changes to Venezuela. The new constitution revamped political institutions, expanded the presidential term, and allowed for immediate reelection. Ch\u00e1vez easily won a new six-year term in the 2000 mega-election. In 2002, President Ch\u00e1vez faced temporary ouster after opposition protests and military pressure. He was restored to power after less than three days, following the interim president's hardline measures. After being briefly ousted from power in 2002, President Ch\u00e1vez faced continued opposition efforts to remove him from office, including a general strike and a recall referendum in 2004, which he won by a large margin. The Ch\u00e1vez government then packed the Supreme Court with its supporters, undermining judicial independence. Despite a boycott by the political opposition in 2005, Ch\u00e1vez's supporters dominated the National Assembly. The rebound of the Venezuelan economy due to rising oil prices allowed Ch\u00e1vez to implement social programs that reduced poverty by 20%, leading to his reelection in 2006. After his reelection in 2006, concerns arose about Chavez's radicalization as he closed a critical TV station, sparking protests. A constitutional amendment for \"21st century socialism\" was defeated in a 2007 referendum. University students led demonstrations against the closure of RCTV and played a key role in defeating a constitutional reform. The Venezuelan government nationalized key industries, including food, cement, and steel companies. President Ch\u00e1vez united his supporters into the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and won 17 out of 22 governors' races in the 2008 State and Municipal Elections. In the 2008 State and Municipal Elections in Venezuela, pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates won 17 out of 22 governors' races and over 80% of mayoral races. The opposition parties won five governorships and some key cities. President Ch\u00e1vez also pushed for a constitutional change in 2009 to lift the two-term limit for the presidency, allowing him to run for reelection. In February 2009, Venezuelans approved a constitutional change with almost 55% support, allowing President Ch\u00e1vez to run for reelection. Despite winning a majority of seats in the 2010 Legislative Elections, Ch\u00e1vez's government was denied the three-fifths majority needed to enact enabling laws. In December 2010, Venezuela's outgoing National Assembly approved laws criticized for threatening free speech and democratic governance. The laws were passed before the new National Assembly took office in January 2011, where opposition deputies could block certain government actions. Notably, an \"enabling law\" granted President Ch\u00e1vez decree powers. The enabling law granted President Ch\u00e1vez decree powers for 18 months, leading to changes in labor laws, criminal code, and nationalization of the gold industry. In the 2012 Presidential Election, Ch\u00e1vez won his fourth term with 55% of the vote, with a record turnout of 80.7%. The election was monitored by domestic observer groups, and reports indicate it was peaceful. During the 2012 Presidential Election in Venezuela, the opposition held a unified primary where Capriles was chosen as the candidate. Capriles, a member of the Justice First party, campaigned on a platform of reconciliation and national unity. He promised to improve Ch\u00e1vez's social programs rather than dismantle them. Capriles ran an energetic campaign with multiple rallies each day, strengthening the unified opposition. The election day was peaceful with minor irregularities, and the opposition received about 2.2 million votes. The opposition in the 2012 Venezuelan presidential election received 2.2 million more votes than in 2006, with their share of the vote increasing from 37% to 44%. Despite this, Ch\u00e1vez had advantages such as a strong economy, loyal supporters due to social programs, and the use of state resources and media for campaigning. In the 2012 Venezuelan presidential election, Ch\u00e1vez faced vulnerabilities like high crime rates and economic issues but ultimately won due to his popular support and social programs. He acknowledged the opposition in his victory speech and pledged to continue towards democratic socialism. In December 2012, President Ch\u00e1vez and the PSUV won 20 out of 23 governorships in Venezuela's state elections, solidifying their power. Despite Ch\u00e1vez's health issues, the opposition only managed to win three states, with Henrique Capriles Radonski emerging as a prominent opposition figure. President Ch\u00e1vez's declining health and battle with cancer raised questions about Venezuela's political future. Despite multiple treatments and declarations of being cancer-free, Ch\u00e1vez announced in December 2012 that his cancer had returned. In December 2012, President Ch\u00e1vez announced his cancer had returned and he would undergo a fourth surgery in Cuba. He expressed support for Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as his successor. Ch\u00e1vez faced complications post-surgery and Maduro was urged to be elected if needed. Vice President Maduro announced on January 8 that Ch\u00e1vez would not be sworn in on January 10 as scheduled. Instead, Ch\u00e1vez could take the oath of office before the Supreme Court at a later date, as upheld by Venezuela's Supreme Court. Opposition leaders argued that the January 10 inauguration date was fixed by Article 231 and that the president of the National Assembly should have been sworn in as interim president. President Ch\u00e1vez was expected to be sworn in as interim president until a new election or his recovery. He returned to Venezuela from Cuba in poor health, but never appeared publicly. He passed away on March 5, leaving a mixed legacy of empowering the poor but also harming democratic institutions and freedom of expression. Future presidential candidates will need to consider policies affecting working class Venezuelans. The economic situation in Venezuela is characterized by high inflation, crumbling infrastructure, and shortages of consumer goods. President Ch\u00e1vez's government's economic mismanagement wasted billions that could have benefited poor Venezuelans. After Ch\u00e1vez's death, \"Chavismo\" seemed to survive with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro winning the presidential election and Ch\u00e1vez supporters controlling key institutions. President Maduro's government in Venezuela faced challenges in 2014, including deteriorating economic conditions, high crime rates, and violent suppression of opposition protests. Efforts at dialogue with international organizations were unsuccessful, and human rights abuses increased. In 2013, Venezuela faced economic challenges exacerbated by the decline in oil prices. After President Ch\u00e1vez's death, Vice President Maduro became interim president and won a narrow victory in the subsequent election against opposition candidate Capriles. The election results surprised many observers who expected Maduro to win by a significant margin. The 2013 presidential election in Venezuela between Ch\u00e1vez and Capriles was marked by the PSUV's use of state resources and media control. After the election, polarization increased with street violence and calls for an audit of the results. The National Electoral Council conducted an audit of 46% of ballot boxes, finding no evidence of fraud. Maduro won with 50.61% of the vote against Capriles' 49.12%. Maduro won the 2013 presidential election in Venezuela with 50.61% of the vote, defeating Capriles by a narrow margin. The Venezuelan Electoral Observatory expressed concerns over the incumbent president's advantages in using public funds and resources, recommending changes for future elections. International groups were invited to provide \"accompaniment\" to the electoral process. International groups, including UNASUR, IAEE, and the Carter Center, were involved in monitoring the 2013 Venezuelan presidential election. UNASUR supported the decision for a full audit, while IAEE called for the elections to be voided. The Carter Center highlighted concerns about voting conditions and diminished confidence in the electoral system. The Carter Center issued recommendations to improve the 2013 Venezuelan election process, including enforcing rules on state resources, ensuring campaign equity in media access, and limiting public officials' involvement in campaigns. Opposition challenges were filed citing irregularities like voter intimidation and inflated electoral registries. The opposition challenges in Venezuela's 2013 election focused on nullifying certain election tables and tally sheets due to irregularities like inflated electoral registries. The Supreme Court rejected the challenges, leading to increased political tensions before the December municipal elections, which ultimately reflected a polarized country. In the 2013 municipal elections in Venezuela, the PSUV and its allies won 242 municipalities, the MUD won 75, and independents won 18. The opposition gained 18 more municipalities compared to the 2008 elections, including nine state capitals and four out of five municipalities in Caracas. The PSUV received 49% of the total vote compared to the MUD's 42%, with President Maduro's price cuts for consumer goods possibly influencing the results. The elections highlighted the country's polarization and a rural/urban divide, with the MUD's support mainly from urban areas. In 2014, the Maduro government faced challenges including high crime rates, economic deterioration, inflation, shortages, and declining oil prices. Student-led protests turned violent, resulting in casualties, injuries, and arrests. Opposition figures were imprisoned, diplomatic efforts at the Organization of American States failed, and tensions escalated. In 2014, the Maduro government in Venezuela faced challenges including high crime rates, economic deterioration, inflation, shortages, and declining oil prices. Student protests turned violent, leading to casualties, injuries, and arrests. Diplomatic efforts at the Organization of American States failed, but an initiative by UNASUR to start talks with the government and opposition broke down due to lack of progress. The Venezuelan economy contracted by 3.9% and inflation rose to 62%, the highest in Latin America. In February 2014, student-led protests in Venezuela expanded to other cities and included concerns about crime and the economy. A rally in Caracas turned violent, resulting in three deaths. Opposition leaders supported the protests, while President Maduro accused the protestors of trying to overthrow the government through violence. In 2014, student-led protests in Venezuela escalated to other cities, focusing on crime and the economy. Opposition leaders like Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and Mar\u00eda Corina Machado advocated street protests to force Maduro from power, while Henrique Capriles preferred a different approach. MUD presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, governor of Miranda state, focused on building support for the opposition within the existing system to address Venezuela's issues. Protests in Caracas and other cities dwindled by June 2014 due to government suppression and protest fatigue. Roadblocks were used by protestors against government security and armed colectivos, resulting in casualties on both sides. In the aftermath of the protests in Venezuela, over 800 people were injured and more than 3,000 were arrested, including opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez. L\u00f3pez was initially accused of serious crimes but was later charged with lesser offenses. Despite delays, his trial began in July 2014 with the court ruling against much of the evidence submitted by his defense. Over 100 witnesses were accepted for the prosecution in L\u00f3pez's case, sparking concerns about lack of due process. Two opposition mayors, Ceballos and Scarano, were jailed in 2014 for various charges. International human rights groups criticized the Venezuelan government for its handling of the protests. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch criticized the Venezuelan government for human rights violations during protests in 2014. The International Commission of Jurists highlighted deficiencies in Venezuela's legal system. The outbreak of violence in Venezuela led to calls for dialogue from various international entities, including the Obama Administration, OAS Secretary General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza, and Pope Francis. Many Latin American nations had a restrained response, calling for dialogue but not criticizing the Maduro government's harsh actions. The OAS Permanent Council met on the issue of Venezuela in March 2014 and approved a resolution expressing condolences for the violence, supporting dialogue for reconciliation. The United States, Canada, and Panama opposed the resolution, while all other countries supported it. In March 2014, the OAS Permanent Council approved a resolution supporting dialogue for reconciliation in Venezuela. The United States, Canada, and Panama opposed the resolution, while all other countries supported it. The OAS later rejected Panama's attempt to discuss the situation in Venezuela and closed the session to the press. In response to the crisis in Venezuela, UNASUR approved a resolution supporting dialogue between the government and opposition. Foreign ministers from Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, along with a Vatican representative, monitored the talks which began on April 10. The opposition called for an amnesty law and disarming of violent groups. The MUD set goals for talks with the government, including freeing political prisoners and disarming violent groups. Limited progress was made in private talks in April, leading to a crisis in May. The opposition suspended participation due to lack of government commitment and continued suppression of protests. Foreign ministers tried to mediate but were unsuccessful. UNASUR reiterated the need for dialogue between the Venezuelan government and opposition, rejecting unilateral sanctions on officials. Disagreement within the MUD coalition hindered participation in the talks, with moderate parties supporting while hardline parties refused due to jailed protestors and leaders. Opposition leaders, including Leopoldo L\u00f3pez's Popular Will party, refused to participate in dialogue with the government due to ongoing repression and imprisonment. The opposition appeared divided after the 2014 protests, with some advocating for a confrontational approach while others focused on the 2015 legislative elections. Henrique Capriles criticized the strategy of \"la salida\" as a failure. Capriles criticized the \"la salida\" strategy as a failure, stating it distracted the country and gave oxygen to the government. The opposition's divisions hindered taking advantage of the government's economic failures. The political and economic situation in Venezuela worsened in 2015 and 2016, with Maduro's government repressing the opposition, the economy in recession, and a growing humanitarian crisis. Antonio Ledezma, opposition mayor of Caracas, was detained in 2015 for alleged conspiracy to overthrow the government. Leopoldo L\u00f3pez signed a communiqu\u00e9 for a \"National Agreement for Transition\" to address Venezuela's crisis, including free elections. The Maduro government saw this as a threat due to L\u00f3pez's past actions. The opposition coalition, MUD, won a majority in the 2015 legislative elections, a blow to Chavismo. The Maduro government took actions to prevent the opposition from gaining a supermajority in the 2015 legislative elections. OAS Secretary General criticized the lack of transparency and electoral justice in Venezuela. Opposition faced disadvantages including government use of state resources for campaigning, disqualification of candidates, and restrictions on freedom of the press. Opposition leader Luis Manuel D\u00edaz was assassinated before the elections. Venezuela rejected international election observation missions from the OAS and EU, opting for a UNASUR delegation. Domestic groups like Observatorio Electoral Venezolano monitored the elections. The opposition coalition, MUD, led in polls by 19-30 percentage points, campaigning to release political prisoners and revive the economy. It includes parties like Justice First and Popular Will. After the MUD's electoral victory, the Maduro government undermined the power of the incoming opposition legislature by appointing new magistrates to the Supreme Court. This move prevented the new opposition-controlled National Assembly from confirming the judges, leading to the blocking of three elected representatives from taking office. This action deprived the opposition of its two-thirds majority and extensive powers. The opposition in Venezuela was supposed to have significant power in the government, including a major role in the budget, the ability to remove ministers and the vice president, and overturn enabling laws. However, the Supreme Court has blocked several laws approved by the opposition-led National Assembly since January 2016. In January, the Supreme Court rejected a measure granting the president broad powers, bypassing the legislature. In March, the court ruled against the legislature examining the government's appointment of 13 magistrates. In April, the court deemed an amnesty law unconstitutional, pardoning political prisoners. It also struck down a constitutional amendment to reduce the presidential term. In July, the National Assembly swore in opposition legislators blocked by the court, leading to the court declaring the Assembly's bills \"null and void\" in September. In September, the court ruled the National Assembly's bills \"null and void.\" In November, three legislators resigned to ease tension. Opposition focused on recalling President Maduro, but the process was delayed and suspended in October. If the recall didn't happen before January 10, 2017, the vice president would become president. If a recall were approved after January 10, 2017, the vice president would become president for the remainder of the term. The recall process began in April 2016, with multiple steps required for the referendum to proceed. Opposition legislators protested the delay in releasing forms needed for the recall referendum. The opposition in Venezuela protested delays in the recall referendum process, collecting over 1.95 million signatures which were later validated by the CNE. The next step required gathering 3.9 million signatures, initially planned for October but postponed to a later date. The CNE announced a three-day signature drive for the recall referendum, but it was suspended on October 20, 2016. The opposition wanted more voting machines and a national signature requirement instead of by state. If enough signatures were collected, the referendum would have taken place within 90 days. Opposition protests erupted over delays in the recall referendum process, with President Maduro declaring a national emergency in response to alleged plots supported by the United States. Despite the state of emergency, protests continued, leading to arrests and physical attacks on opposition members. In September 2016, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans protested peacefully in Caracas to push for the recall referendum. Hundreds of Venezuelans protested in Caracas for the recall referendum, following the CNE's suspension of the process. OAS Secretary General Almagro criticized Maduro in a public letter, urging him to return riches, release political prisoners, and respect the National Assembly's power. Almagro also warned against a coup and urged Maduro not to make the National Assembly disappear. OAS Secretary General Almagro criticized Maduro for suspending the recall referendum and urged him to respect democratic processes. Almagro invoked the Inter-American Democratic Charter, calling for diplomatic efforts to restore democratic institutions in Venezuela due to serious disruptions of the democratic order. The OAS Secretary General criticized Maduro for suspending the recall referendum in Venezuela, calling for diplomatic efforts to restore democratic institutions due to serious disruptions of the democratic order. The report recommended a recall referendum in 2016, the release of political prisoners, and a halt to the executive branch's blocking of laws from the National Assembly. The National Assembly had asked for the charter to be invoked, citing an unconstitutional and antidemocratic government that undermined democracy. Human Rights Watch called for OAS intervention in Venezuela to restore judicial independence and protect fundamental rights, despite Maduro's opposition. The OAS Permanent Council met to discuss a draft declaration on Venezuela, amended to include respect for sovereignty but maintaining key provisions. The OAS Permanent Council met to discuss a draft declaration on Venezuela, amended to include respect for sovereignty and support for dialogue efforts to resolve differences and consolidate democracy. Former leaders were involved in reopening dialogue between the government and the opposition. Venezuela requested a special meeting to hear about the status of the dialogue initiative. On June 23, 2016, the OAS Permanent Council met to discuss the Secretary General's report on Venezuela. Despite Venezuela's objections, the majority voted to proceed with the agenda. The Council did not take any action on the report, which called for diplomatic initiatives to address the constitutional regime alteration. At the OAS General Assembly, 15 member states, including the United States, supported dialogue efforts in Venezuela. The 15 member states, including the United States, issued a statement supporting political dialogue in Venezuela, emphasizing respect for the constitution, condemning violence, and calling for due process and human rights to be upheld. The OAS urged the Venezuelan government and opposition to engage in dialogue, ensure constitutional rights, and complete the presidential recall referendum promptly. The declaration supported the national dialogue, emphasized concrete results, and called for peaceful actions from all parties involved. The Vatican, former presidents of Spain, the Dominican Republic, and Panama supported a new role in the Venezuelan political process. OAS Secretary General Almagro emphasized the importance of releasing political prisoners promptly and expediting electoral processes. Talks mediated by the Vatican and former presidents aimed at peaceful coexistence and improving food and medicine supply. The dialogue between the Venezuelan government and opposition aimed to improve food and medicine supply, resolve issues with National Assembly representatives, and appoint new CNE members. However, critics felt it was a way for the government to avoid real actions like releasing political prisoners. The next round of talks was postponed, and many are doubtful about the dialogue's future. Many observers are pessimistic about the future of the dialogue between the Venezuelan government and opposition. Opposition leaders have demanded actions such as allowing humanitarian aid, reforming the CNE, freeing jailed activists, and recognizing the powers of the National Assembly. The Vatican representative will not attend future meetings, and efforts to reactivate the dialogue have been made by UNASUR and former presidents of Dominican Republic, Spain, and Panama. The economic growth during the Ch\u00e1vez era was fueled by high oil prices, allowing for the advancement of his \"Bolivarian revolution.\" During the Ch\u00e1vez era, Venezuela saw an expansion of state-led development, renegotiation of contracts with foreign investors for government control, nationalization of private companies, and increased social spending on misiones programs. Poverty rates declined significantly from 2002 to 2012. However, since mid-2014, the rapid decline in oil prices has impacted the economy. Since mid-2014, Venezuela has been hit hard by the rapid decline in oil prices, leading to a contracting economy, rising inflation, declining international reserves, and increasing poverty. Economic mismanagement by the Maduro government has worsened the situation, resulting in shortages of food and medicines, high rates of violent crime, and a poor economic outlook for the next several years. The country's GDP has significantly contracted since the decline in oil prices began in 2014. Venezuela's GDP has declined significantly since 2014 due to economic mismanagement and tight currency controls, leading to shortages and inflation. In 2016, GDP is projected to decline by 10%, with inflation expected to reach 476%. Venezuela's international reserves have fallen from $30 billion in 2011 to $10.6 billion in 2016. Budget cuts have severely affected the educational and health systems, leading to shortages of medicines in hospitals and pharmacies. Human rights organizations have urged UN agencies to address the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is causing shortages of food, water, healthcare, and clothing. IMF officials are concerned about health conditions and potential migration due to lack of food and medicine. Venezuela opened border crossings with Colombia in 2016 to alleviate shortages, leading to riots, protests, and looting. The shortages in Venezuela have led to riots, protests, and deaths. Poverty rates have been increasing since 2013, exacerbated by the economic slowdown under the Maduro government. President Ch\u00e1vez used foreign relations to counter U.S. influence, especially after his temporary ouster in 2002. President Ch\u00e1vez shifted Venezuela's foreign and economic relations away from the United States, developing closer ties with China, Russia, and Iran. He exported his brand of populism to other Latin American countries, supporting Bolivia's President Evo Morales and aiding in constitutional reforms. Evo Morales received assistance from Ch\u00e1vez to rewrite Bolivia's constitution and implement radical economic reforms. Venezuela, under Ch\u00e1vez, had close relations with Nicaragua and Ecuador, as well as a strong bond with Fidel Castro. Venezuela provided support to Cuba by supplying oil and receiving Cuban medical personnel. Ch\u00e1vez also established programs like PetroCaribe and the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas to promote regional integration and socioeconomic reform. The Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (ALBA) was founded in 2004 to promote regional integration, socioeconomic reform, and poverty alleviation. ALBA includes countries like Venezuela, Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, and Nicaragua, as well as Caribbean island nations. However, ALBA's momentum waned due to fluctuating oil prices and Venezuela's economic issues. Despite concerns about its future after President Ch\u00e1vez's death in 2013, ALBA countries continue to support the Maduro government. Venezuela also played a key role in establishing the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) in December 2011. In 2011, Venezuela helped establish the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) to boost regional integration. It was also a founding member of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in 2008 and joined Mercosur in 2012. Venezuela withdrew from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2013. Relations with Colombia improved after tensions during President \u00c1lvaro Uribe's administration. Venezuela's foreign policy under President Maduro has shown continuity with his predecessor, President Ch\u00e1vez, especially in supporting leftist Colombian guerrilla groups and encouraging peace talks with the FARC. Tensions with Colombia resurfaced in 2015 when the border was closed to crack down on smuggling, but reopened in 2016 to alleviate shortages in Venezuela. Some analysts argue that Maduro's foreign policy activism has been consistent. Some analysts believe Venezuela's foreign policy activism under Maduro has decreased due to economic and political challenges. Despite this, Maduro maintains close ties with leftist governments in Latin America and engages with organizations like CELAC and UNASUR. Changes in government in Argentina and Brazil are shifting regional dynamics, with President Macri criticizing Maduro's repression of political opponents. The Maduro government criticized the suspension of Brazilian President Rousseff, labeling it a parliamentary coup. Tensions over Venezuela are increasing. Tensions over Venezuela escalated within Mercosur, leading to Venezuela's suspension as a full member in December 2016. The rotating presidency of the group passed to Argentina. In December 2016, Venezuela's suspension from Mercosur led to Argentina taking over the rotating presidency. Venezuela maintains close relations with China and Russia for trade and investment, with China providing significant financing for infrastructure projects. However, concerns about Venezuela's economic crisis have led to a more cautious approach from China. Venezuela was elected to the U.N. Security Council for a two-year term in October 2014. Latin American and Caribbean nations traditionally alternate representation on the UNSC, with Venezuela securing a seat in 2014 despite criticism of its human rights record. The United States has had strained relations with Venezuela due to concerns about human rights, military arms purchases, relations with Cuba and Iran, and cooperation on antidrug and antiterrorism efforts. Venezuela's influence in the region is declining, and there has been friction with both the Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro governments. The United States has imposed various sanctions on Venezuela for not cooperating fully with U.S. antiterrorism efforts and supporting groups like FARC, Iran, and Hezbollah. Tensions escalated after President Ch\u00e1vez's brief ouster in 2002, with Venezuela alleging U.S. involvement. In 2006, the U.S. refrained from responding to Venezuela's attacks, shifting focus to a positive agenda. However, tensions rose in 2008 when Venezuela expelled the U.S. Ambassador in solidarity with Bolivia. Under the Obama Administration, tensions in bilateral relations between the United States and Venezuela continued. In 2009, hopes for an improvement in relations were raised when ambassadors were set to return, but this did not materialize. The U.S. expressed concerns about democratic institutions and freedom of expression in Venezuela. In 2010, the Ch\u00e1vez government revoked an agreement for a U.S. Ambassador-designate, leading to further diplomatic tensions. In 2012, the Venezuelan Consul General in Miami was declared persona non grata by the Department of State. In 2013, tensions between the United States and Venezuela escalated when Venezuela expelled three U.S. diplomats, accusing them of destabilizing the country. Efforts to improve relations were hindered by the Maduro government's strong rhetoric and actions. In response to allegations of conspiracy to destabilize the Venezuelan government, the State Department expelled three Venezuelan diplomats, including the charg\u00e9 d'affaires of the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, DC. The U.S. criticized Venezuela's crackdown on protesters in 2014 and called for dialogue with the opposition. Venezuela expelled three U.S. diplomats, accusing them of organizing protests, leading to diplomatic tensions between the two countries. U.S. officials urged Latin American countries to help resolve the situation and supported UNASUR's efforts to facilitate talks between the government and the opposition. In April, UNASUR initiated talks between the Venezuelan government and the opposition. The Obama Administration initially opposed sanctions but imposed travel restrictions on Venezuelan officials involved in human rights abuses in July 2014. Additional visa restrictions were announced in February 2015 for officials linked to human rights abuses and public corruption. As of early March 2015, a total of 56 Venezuelans were affected by these restrictions. In February 2015, the US imposed visa restrictions on 56 Venezuelans for human rights and corruption reasons, leading to further deterioration in US-Venezuelan relations. President Maduro announced limits on US diplomats in Venezuela, calling for a reduction in staff to match the number of Venezuelan diplomats in Washington, DC. The State Department rejected allegations of coup plotting and stated that the US does not support unconstitutional political transitions. In response to Venezuela's request to reduce US diplomats in the country, the State Department pointed out that Venezuela has eight consulates in addition to their embassy in the US. President Obama issued Executive Order 13692 in March 2015, implementing the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014, which allows for targeted sanctions against those undermining democratic processes or committing human rights violations. The Executive Order 13692 issued by President Obama in March 2015 allows for targeted sanctions against individuals involved in human rights abuses, freedom of expression limitations, peaceful assembly restrictions, and public corruption in Venezuela. The EO froze the assets of seven Venezuelans, including members of Venezuela's security forces and a prosecutor. President Obama issued an Executive Order on Venezuela, following U.S. sanctions laws, declaring a national emergency due to a threat to national security. President Maduro criticized the sanctions, warning of a potential U.S. attack, including a naval blockade. Some analysts believe the sanctions played into Maduro's narrative of U.S. aggression, while the opposition MUD expressed disapproval. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela, criticized by President Maduro as a threat. The opposition MUD disapproved of the sanctions, while U.S. officials clarified they target individuals involved in human rights abuses. The Obama Administration spoke out against Venezuela's poor human rights situation and efforts to disadvantage the opposition before the 2015 legislative elections. Secretary of State Kerry condemned the conviction of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez in September 2015. In response to the poor human rights situation in Venezuela, Secretary of State Kerry called for the release of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and urged the government to respect the rights of political prisoners. The State Department also condemned violence against opposition members and emphasized the importance of fair public trials. Additionally, the Obama Administration expressed concern about democracy setbacks in Venezuela and interference with the 2016 elections. The State Department expressed concern about Venezuelan government interference with the newly elected National Assembly, including silencing opponents and limiting the Assembly's authority. Dozens of political leaders have been imprisoned, leading to a climate of intimidation and repression. President Obama renewed a national emergency declaration with economic sanctions, prompting Venezuela to recall its top diplomat. In response to economic sanctions, Venezuela recalled its top diplomat in the US. The State Department called for the release of political prisoners, highlighting poor conditions. Secretary of State Kerry expressed willingness to engage in dialogue and help Venezuela economically, emphasizing the need for respect for the rule of law. US intelligence officials warned of a crisis in Venezuela due to shortages and foreign debt. A crisis is unfolding in Venezuela due to shortages of basic goods, high crime levels, and political intransigence. US intelligence officials predict President Maduro may not finish his term, with potential scenarios including his removal through a recall referendum or by some members of his government with military support. The officials acknowledge limited US leverage in the situation and stress regional efforts to help resolve it. The State Department condemned violence against opposition members of Venezuela's National Assembly. The State Department condemned violence in Venezuela and supported OAS efforts to address the crisis, calling for a national dialogue to tackle political, economic, social, and humanitarian issues. Secretary of State Kerry supports OAS efforts to address Venezuela's crisis, calling for the release of political prisoners, respect for freedom of expression, and a fair recall referendum. The United States is not seeking to suspend Venezuela from the OAS, preferring dialogue over isolation. Secretary Kerry expressed support for dialogue facilitated by former leaders of Spain, the Dominican Republic, and Panama regarding Venezuela's challenges. He emphasized the importance of upholding democratic processes and agreed to continue discussions on improving bilateral relations. The United States and Venezuela have not had ambassadors in place since 2010. Kerry announced steps to move relations forward. State Department Under Secretary Tom Shannon visited Venezuela in June 2016 for talks with government officials, including President Maduro and opposition leaders. The visit did not improve bilateral relations. U.S. officials have consistently called for peaceful respect of democratic norms in Venezuela. Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Annie Pforzheimer expressed deep U.S. concern about the worsening political, economic, and social situation in Venezuela. She reiterated U.S. calls for the Venezuelan government to release political prisoners, emphasized the need for dialogue, and stressed the importance of regional cooperation to address the erosion of democratic institutions and human rights. Deputy Assistant Secretary Pforzheimer also mentioned imposing visa restrictions on over 60 individuals believed to be undermining democracy in Venezuela. The United States imposed visa restrictions on over 60 individuals involved in undermining democracy, corruption, and human rights abuses in Venezuela. President Obama had previously ordered asset-blocking sanctions against seven Venezuelan officials in 2015. The U.S. aims to protect democracy and human rights in Venezuela without targeting the Venezuelan people or government as a whole. The U.S. also supports dialogue, respect for the separation of powers, and the rule of law in Venezuela. At a meeting on Venezuela at the OAS, the U.S. representative emphasized the need for constitutional mechanisms and democratic institutions. He called for action to address any unconstitutional alterations to the regime in Venezuela, stressing that dialogue should not delay necessary steps. The U.S. supports the release of political prisoners in Venezuela. The United States, along with other OAS members, urges the Venezuelan government to release political prisoners, respect freedom of expression and assembly, and honor constitutional mechanisms, including a recall referendum. Concerns were raised about delays in the recall referendum process and actions to weaken the authority of the National Assembly. The State Department expressed concerns about delays in the recall referendum process in Venezuela and urged the government to engage in dialogue with the opposition. Secretary of State Kerry met with President Maduro to discuss these issues. Secretary of State Kerry discussed U.S. concerns about Venezuela's challenges with President Maduro and urged constructive dialogue with opposition leaders. Under Secretary of State Shannon traveled to Venezuela to show support for Vatican-facilitated dialogue, emphasizing its importance as a peaceful solution to the political impasse. Human rights organizations and U.S. officials have expressed concerns about the deterioration of democratic institutions and threats to freedom of speech and press in Venezuela under Ch\u00e1vez's presidency, characterized by a concentration of power and disregard for human rights guarantees. Ch\u00e1vez and his followers seized control of the Supreme Court and undermined the rights of journalists and human rights defenders. By his second term, the erosion of human rights protections had intensified. Under Maduro's government, human rights abuses in Venezuela have worsened, with crackdowns on protests leading to numerous detentions and deaths. The State Department's 2015 report highlighted abuses such as using the judiciary to target government critics, police violence resulting in arbitrary detentions and killings, and restrictions on freedom of expression and the press. Human Rights Watch and PROVEA also documented government abuses in April 2016. The Venezuelan government has been cracking down on low-income and immigrant communities since mid-2015 to combat criminal gangs, leading to high rates of violence in the country. Security forces have been accused of serious human rights abuses during raids, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, forced evictions, and the arbitrary deportation of Colombian nationals. Human Rights Watch reported 21 cases of people detained by SEBIN and National Guard since May 2016, with detainees alleging torture and abuse while in custody. The Venezuelan government has been accused of human rights abuses, including firing workers who supported the recall referendum and detaining political prisoners. Foro Penal Venezolano lists 96 political prisoners, with cases dating back to 2003. Notable prisoners include Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, Daniel Ceballos, and Antonio Ledezma. Some prisoners were released in 2016, like Manuel Rosales. Several individuals, including Manuel Rosales, Francisco M\u00e1rquez, and Joshua Holt, have been detained in Venezuela on various charges. Judge Mar\u00eda Lourdes Afiuni was imprisoned in 2009 for corruption after releasing a businessman. U.S. officials have expressed concern about the human rights situation in Venezuela. Judge Mar\u00eda Lourdes Afiuni was imprisoned in 2009 on corruption charges. She was held in deplorable conditions, received inadequate health treatment, and claimed to have been raped in prison. Despite being ordered to be freed in June 2013, she remains under house arrest with restrictions on leaving the country, talking to the media, or using social media. International human rights groups have called for her release. The Venezuelan government has undermined free expression by discriminating against media that offer views of political opponents, using laws and regulations to limit freedom of speech and the press. President Ch\u00e1vez expanded state-owned media to counter media imbalance. Human Rights Watch reports self-censorship due to fear of government reprisal. The Ch\u00e1vez government in Venezuela targeted private media, closing RCTV in 2007 due to its support of a coup. The government also shut down RCTV's cable station in 2010. In 2015, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights criticized Venezuela's government for refusing to grant a broadcasting license to RCTV and ordered the license to be reinstated. Globovisi\u00f3n, a critical television news station, faced government targeting in 2009, leading to the arrest of its president for offensive remarks. Mounting fines and harassment by the government eventually led to the station's sale in 2013, with a promise of \"impartial coverage.\" In the aftermath of Venezuela's December 2015 legislative elections, Globovisi\u00f3n shifted to more impartial coverage, including reporting on the National Assembly, interviewing both opposition and pro-government supporters, and investigating issues like food shortages and government mismanagement. Human rights organizations condemned the four-year prison sentence of Venezuelan newspaper editor David Natera Febres for criminal defamation, warning of negative impacts on press freedom and investigative journalism. Natera Febres was the editor of the Correo del Caron\u00ed. In Venezuela, concerns about press freedom and investigative journalism arose after the imprisonment of editor David Natera Febres for criminal defamation. The country was also criticized for its lack of efforts to combat trafficking in persons, leading to its downgrade to Tier 3 in the Trafficking in Persons Report. The United States downgraded Venezuela to Tier 3 in its annual Trafficking in Persons Report for 2014, 2015, and 2016 due to the government's lack of compliance with anti-trafficking standards. Venezuela is identified as a source, transit, and destination country for sex trafficking and forced labor. The Venezuelan government has provided minimal information on its efforts to combat trafficking, with limited investigations and indictments but no prosecutions or convictions reported. The United States has been providing democracy-related assistance to Venezuela through USAID and NED since 2002. USAID supported democracy projects in Venezuela from 2002 to 2010 through its Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), funding over 600 activities to monitor democratic stability and strengthen institutions. Objectives included enhancing access to information, promoting citizen participation, and democratic leadership. In recent years, U.S. democracy assistance to Venezuela totaled $5 million in FY2011, $6 million in FY2012, $5.8 million in FY2013, and $4.3 million in FY2014 and FY2015, provided through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) foreign aid funding account. For FY2016 and FY2017, the Administration requested funding through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for democracy and human rights programs in Venezuela. Congress appropriated $6.5 million for FY2016 and the House Appropriations Committee proposed $8 million for FY2017. The assistance aims to defend democratic practices, institutions, and values supporting human rights and civic engagement. The Committee's version of the bill, S.Rept. 114-290 to S. 3117, fully funded the Administration's request for Venezuela but noted the possibility of additional funds for future opportunities. The 114th Congress did not complete action on FY2017 appropriations, but a continuing resolution (P.L. 114-254) provided funding at FY2016 levels with a slight reduction. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has been funding projects in Venezuela since 1992, with funding not specifically earmarked in annual appropriations. In FY2015, NED allocated $1.9 million for Venezuela, supporting 43 projects. Venezuela's proven reserves of oil in 2016 were 300 billion barrels, the largest in the world. The country also had 198 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, the second largest in the hemisphere. The petroleum industry consumes a significant portion of Venezuela's natural gas production for crude oil extraction, leading to gas imports to meet demand. Under President Ch\u00e1vez, the government asserted greater control over oil reserves. Venezuela increased control over oil reserves by converting operating agreements to joint ventures with the government holding majority shares. Production declined from peaks in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with total oil production falling from 3.46 million b/d in 2000 to 2.58 million b/d in 2003. This decline was due to a strike in 2002-2003 when PdVSA fired some employees. Venezuela's oil production declined from 3.46 million b/d in 2000 to 2.58 million b/d in 2003 due to a strike where PdVSA fired 18,000 workers. The company has not fully recovered, affecting production levels. In 2014, Venezuela produced 2.69 million b/d. Despite being a major oil supplier to the US, imports have decreased due to lower production and increased imports from Canada. In 2015, Venezuela supplied the US with 830,000 b/d, accounting for 8.8% of US imports. In 2015, Venezuela was the third-largest foreign supplier of crude oil and products to the United States, with exports valued at $14.8 billion. U.S. Gulf coast refineries are equipped to handle Venezuelan crude oil, and PdVSA owns CITGO, which operates refineries and pipelines in the U.S. Venezuela has diversified its oil export markets, with significant exports to the United States, India, and China. The country also provides oil under favorable terms to Cuba and other Caribbean nations, with Cuba receiving 90,000 barrels per day in exchange for services. A cutoff of Venezuelan oil to Cuba would have economic consequences for the country. Since 2005, Venezuela has provided oil to Caribbean nations through PetroCaribe program with preferential financing terms. Most Caribbean nations participate, except Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. Concerns have been raised about increasing debt owed to Venezuela by Caribbean nations. In 2015, Dominican Republic and Jamaica reached agreements to pay back PetroCaribe debt at a discount due to Venezuela's declining reserves. Reports suggest Venezuelan oil provided to PetroCaribe beneficiaries has decreased due to lower oil prices and increased U.S. energy exports. In 2014, Venezuelan oil exports to PetroCaribe countries fell 12% to almost 99,000 b/d per day. A domestic subsidy made gasoline virtually free for Venezuelans, costing the government $12 billion annually. The subsidy increased consumption, spurred smuggling, and reduced government revenue. In February 2016, the government raised gas prices for the first time since 1994 to 15 cents a gallon, saving $2 billion a year for importing food. Raising the price of gasoline in Venezuela is politically sensitive due to past riots in 1989. Venezuela's border with Colombia makes it a major transit route for cocaine to the US. Cooperation with the US DEA was suspended in 2005 over spying allegations. President Bush annually determined from 2005 to 2008 that Venezuela failed to adhere to international narcotics agreements. President Obama waived economic sanctions on Venezuela for democracy programs, citing public corruption facilitating drug trafficking. Venezuela has not acted against officials linked to drug trafficking. The United States and Venezuela were close to signing an antidrug cooperation agreement in 2006, but Venezuelan approval has not happened yet. In 2014, retired General Hugo Carvajal was detained in Aruba on drug trafficking charges but was released due to diplomatic immunity. Carvajal had been sanctioned by the Department of the Treasury in 2008 for drug trafficking involvement. U.S. officials were disappointed with the situation. The US officials expressed disappointment with the Netherlands' decision to release Carvajal, citing credible reports of Venezuela threatening Aruba and the Netherlands for his release. Venezuela allegedly used economic and military threats. Carvajal faced federal indictments in Miami and New York for cocaine trafficking with Colombian traffickers. The State Department's 2016 INCSR highlighted Venezuela as a key drug trafficking route due to porous borders, weak judicial system, and corruption. The report highlights cocaine trafficking routes through Venezuela, involving aerial, terrestrial, and maritime methods. Colombian drug trafficking organizations facilitate transshipment, with Mexican cartels also operating in the country. Venezuelan authorities are ineffective in prosecuting drug traffickers due to political corruption. Venezuelan law enforcement officers lack the necessary equipment, training, and resources to effectively prosecute drug traffickers, hindered by political corruption. Counternarcotics cooperation between the United States and Venezuela has been limited and inconsistent since 2005, with a 1991 bilateral maritime agreement in place. In 2015, Venezuela cooperated with the U.S. Coast Guard in 10 maritime drug interdictions cases, showing a commitment to countering drug flow. Enhanced cooperation could be achieved through Venezuela signing the outstanding addendum to the 1978 Bilateral Counternarcotics MOU negotiated in 2005. The report concluded that enhanced cooperation could increase information exchange, leading to more drug-related arrests and dismantling of criminal networks in Venezuela. In 2016, an indictment was unsealed against two Venezuelans for cocaine trafficking to the US, involving top ONA officials. President Maduro appointed General Reverol in response. In 2010, top ONA officials were appointed by President Maduro. General Reverol was later made Minister of Interior and Justice, overseeing the country's police forces. In November 2016, two nephews of Venezuelan First Lady Cilia Flores were convicted in the US for conspiring to transport cocaine. President Maduro claimed the conviction was an attempt to weaken his government, shedding light on the involvement of Venezuelan officials in drug trafficking. US officials have expressed concerns about Venezuela's lack of cooperation on antiterrorism efforts. Since 2006, the United States has imposed an arms embargo on Venezuela due to its lack of cooperation with antiterrorism efforts. Various sanctions have been placed on Venezuelan individuals and companies for supporting terrorist groups like FARC, Iran, and Hezbollah. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 highlighted credible reports of Venezuela's ties to terrorism. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 highlighted credible reports of Venezuela maintaining a permissive environment for known terrorist groups like FARC, ELN, ETA, and Hezbollah supporters. Venezuela has been accused of harboring members of FARC and ELN, leading to strained diplomatic relations with Colombia in 2010. In 2015, new Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and President Ch\u00e1vez agreed to improve border security and diplomatic relations. Venezuelan-Colombian relations were strained in 2015 when President Maduro closed the border to crack down on smuggling and alleged paramilitaries. The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan officials for supporting FARC with weapons and drug trafficking. The FARC and ELN use Venezuela for incursions into Colombia and safe haven. Venezuela captured and returned members of the FARC and ELN to Colombia. Colombian peace talks with the FARC began in 2012 and ended with a peace agreement in 2016, supported by Presidents Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro. Concerns have been raised about Iran's relations with Venezuela and Latin America, leading to the approval of the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 by the 112th Congress. The State Department conducted an assessment on Iran's presence in the Western Hemisphere as required by a 2012 law. The report stated that Iranian influence in Latin America and the Caribbean is decreasing due to various factors such as U.S. diplomatic outreach, sanctions, and Iran's poor foreign relations management. The personal relationship between Ch\u00e1vez and Iranian President Ahmadinejad contributed to the strengthening of ties. The personal relationship between Ch\u00e1vez and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad drove the strengthening of bilateral ties, leading to numerous agreements on construction projects, energy initiatives, banking programs, and nanotechnology. Iran's focus on Latin America aimed to overcome international isolation and Venezuela played a key role in expanding relations with other leftist governments in the region. Iran promised assistance and investment to Latin American countries, but there is little evidence of fulfillment. Relations with the region have diminished since Ahmadinejad and Ch\u00e1vez left office. President Rouhani has not prioritized relations with Latin America. Venezuela is in a political and economic crisis, with President Maduro's popularity plummeting. The opposition has focused on recalling Maduro through a national referendum. The opposition in Venezuela focused on recalling President Maduro through a national referendum in 2016, but the process was delayed by the government. Efforts to facilitate a government-opposition dialogue were also met with skepticism. The Venezuelan government's popularity is affected by the economic crisis caused by the decline in oil prices and economic mismanagement. The road to recovery may take years, and there is a risk of social unrest due to food shortages and a humanitarian crisis. The Obama Administration criticized the Maduro government for undemocratic practices and imposed sanctions on officials involved in human rights violations. The US imposed sanctions on 7 Venezuelans for human rights violations and supported OAS efforts to promote normalization in Venezuela. US-Venezuela relations may remain strained without improvements in human rights and democratic institutions. Congressional interest in Venezuela is expected to continue during the 115th Congress. Legislation initiatives include the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. Initiatives in the 113th Congress included funding for democracy and human rights projects in Venezuela through various acts such as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 and the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014. The Administration requested funds for these programs, with appropriations totaling around $4.3 million. The bill was reported and amended on May 20, 2014, and passed by the Senate on December 8, 2014, and by the House on December 10, 2014. It was signed into law on December 18, 2014. Section 5 (a) imposes sanctions on foreign persons involved in violence or human rights abuses in Venezuela related to antigovernment protests that began on February 4, 2014. Section 5 of the law imposes sanctions on individuals involved in violence or human rights abuses during antigovernment protests in Venezuela. The President can waive sanctions if it is in the national interest, with a report to Congress required by the Broadcasting Board of Governors on news access in Venezuela. The U.S. government is involved in information distribution and technology distribution in Venezuela. S.Res. 213 and H.Res. 488 express support for democracy, condemn violence, and call for dialogue in Venezuela. The House approved a resolution supporting the people of Venezuela in their pursuit of democratic principles, condemning violence and politically motivated charges, and urging international solidarity and dialogue to end the violence. The resolution S.Res. 365 (Menendez) supports efforts to end violence in Venezuela, uphold democratic norms, and guarantee rights to life, humane treatment, and political freedoms for all Venezuelans. Introduced on February 27, 2014, it was approved by the Senate on March 12, 2014. The Senate approved a resolution on March 12, 2014, reaffirming U.S. support for Venezuela's pursuit of democracy, condemning violence against protestors, calling for disarmament of government-affiliated militias, and urging sanctions against individuals involved in planning violence. The Senate resolution in March 2014 reaffirmed U.S. support for Venezuela's democracy, condemned violence against protestors, and called for sanctions against individuals involved in violence. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 imposed targeted sanctions on those committing human rights violations in Venezuela and urged dialogue between the government and opposition. The Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Extension Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-194) extended sanctions under the 2014 Act until December 31, 2019. The Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 114-254) was signed into law on July 15, 2016, providing funding for Venezuela democracy and human rights. The Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 (P.L. 114-323) became a legislative vehicle for a FY2017 continuing resolution funding most programs at the FY2016 level with a slight reduction. It required a report on political freedom in Venezuela and listed sanctioned Venezuelan officials involved in antigovernment protests. The House passed a resolution expressing concern about shortages in Venezuela and calling for the release of political prisoners. It also supports dialogue for respect of human rights. The House resolution supports dialogue for respect of human rights in Venezuela, urges OAS assessment of democratic order, and calls for government to respect constitution for recall referendum. The House resolution urges the U.S. President to support OAS efforts for democratic solutions in Venezuela, hold Venezuelan officials accountable for violations, and stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan people for a fair recall referendum and release of political prisoners. The House and Senate introduced bills for appropriations in 2017, with the Senate fully funding the Administration's request for democracy and human rights programs in Venezuela. The 114th Congress did not complete action on FY2017 appropriations but approved a continuing resolution funding most programs through April 28, 2017. Additionally, a resolution was introduced to support the empowerment of women and urge countries to #FreeThe20, including Judge Maria. Resolution S.Res. 537 (Cardin) was introduced in July 2016 to address the crisis in Venezuela, calling for the release of political prisoners, protection of freedom of expression, and support for dialogue.

General invoked Article 20 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter, urging the OAS Permanent Council to assess Venezuela's constitutional and democratic order. Calls were made for neutrality of security forces, respect for freedom of expression and assembly, halting of efforts to undermine separation of powers, and strengthening the rule of law in Venezuela. The U.S. President was urged to support OAS efforts for democratic solutions and hold Venezuelan officials accountable.
