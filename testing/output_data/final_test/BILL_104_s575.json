    "content": "\"Definitions.\" In this Act, \"coastline,\" \"county,\" and \"coastline State\" are specifically defined. \"Coastline\" refers to the Submerged Lands Act definition, \"county\" is a local government unit below the state level, and \"coastline State\" includes states bordering specific bodies of water. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the leasing of tracts for oil and gas exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf, including the meaning of \"distance,\" \"leased tract,\" and \"new revenues.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, including the definition of \"Outer Continental Shelf\" and \"Secretary.\" The curr_chunk focuses on impact assistance formula and payments. The \"Outer Continental Shelf Impact Assistance Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States to receive new revenues. The Secretary of the Treasury can invest excess funds in public debt securities. Amounts in the Fund, along with interest earned, will be paid at the direction of the Secretary. The Secretary determines new revenues from leased tracts within 200 miles of eligible coastal states. The allocable share of revenues is calculated at 27 percent for each state. The eligible coastal States' share of new revenues is determined based on the distance between their coastline and the leased tract's center. The sum of these shares equals the total allocable revenue determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will pay 50 percent of each eligible coastal State's share of new revenues from the Fund, along with corresponding interest earned, to the State. Within 60 days of the Act's enactment, the Governor of each eligible coastal State must provide a list of counties eligible for impact assistance payments, including those along the coastline and within 60 miles certified to have significant impacts from Outer Continental Shelf activities. The Governor designates coastline for counties without a border, can modify list annually based on Outer Continental Shelf activities. The Secretary determines eligible counties within 200 miles of leased tract for impact assistance payments. The eligible coastal State's attributable share for an eligible county is determined based on its distance from the leased tract. The ratio of one county's share to another is inversely proportional to the distance between the leased tract's center and the counties' coastlines. The Secretary will pay eligible counties their share from the Fund, including interest earned. Payments to eligible coastal States and counties must be made by December 31 each year from new revenues and interest earned in the previous fiscal year. The remaining revenues and interest will be retained. The remaining revenues and interest in the Fund not distributed to eligible States or counties will be disposed of according to applicable laws for receipts from leases on the Outer Continental Shelf. Funds received under this Act are to be used by coastal States and counties for projects related to impacts of Outer Continental Shelf activities, including air and water quality, wildlife, wetlands, and other coastal resources. Additionally, funds can be used for activities authorized by relevant acts and for administrative costs. Eligible counties and states have obligations under this Act. Prior to receiving funds under this Act, eligible counties must submit a plan to the State Governor outlining proposed projects and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year. The Governor must approve the plan before funds are disbursed, ensuring compliance with state and federal laws. If the plan is disapproved, funds will be held in escrow until modifications are made and approved. The eligible county must submit a plan outlining projects and expenditures for the fiscal year, which must be approved by the Governor before funds are disbursed. If the plan is disapproved, funds will be held in escrow until modifications are made and approved. After receiving funds, the county must certify the amount expended, project details, and status within 60 days after the fiscal year ends. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT, REFUNDS. Each State Governor must report to Congress by June 15 on the previous fiscal year's Fund monies received. Royalty refunds owed to entities generating new revenues under this Act must be repaid in proportion to monies received under section 2 by the governmental entities receiving Fund distributions."
