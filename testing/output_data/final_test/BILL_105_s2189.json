    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Conservation and Quality Incentives Act\". Congress finds that water supplies in the United States are insufficient to meet current or future demand due to various factors such as population growth and increased environmental demands. Water conservation and more efficient use of water could help meet these increased demands, while also allowing for the rights to use conserved water to be granted to irrigation suppliers, farmers, and ranchers. The Federal Government should provide financial assistance for implementing practical water conservation measures to meet changing water needs for irrigation, farming, and ranching. SEC. 3. USE OF STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS FOR WATER CONSERVATION IMPROVEMENTS. Section 603 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include provisions for construction of water conservation improvements by eligible recipients. The term 'eligible recipient' is defined to include various entities such as municipalities, tribal authorities, and nonprofit organizations. State agency, nonprofit private organization, or lending institution in a State with water conservation laws allowing water use rights for investments, stream flow reservation authority, and prohibition of transactions affecting existing water rights. Financial assistance can be provided for water conservation improvements like piping or lining irrigation canals from the state's water pollution control revolving fund. The water conservation improvement program allows for various improvements such as piping irrigation canals, wastewater recycling, irrigation scheduling, water metering, on-field efficiency, and other state-approved measures. Participation in the program is voluntary, and conserved water allocation follows applicable state laws. Conserved water allocated under the water conservation improvement program must comply with any State law mandating a portion for instream flow enhancement or other conservation purposes. The use of conserved water for irrigated agriculture is limited to previously irrigated land, unless authorized by State law and does not degrade water quality. SEC. 4. USE OF STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS FOR WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. Section 603 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include provisions for construction of water quality improvements by eligible recipients such as municipalities, tribal authorities, and nonprofit organizations. Eligible recipients are defined as various types of entities including municipal corporations and lending institutions. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act allows states to provide financial assistance from their water pollution control revolving fund to eligible recipients for constructing water quality improvements. Participation in these improvements is voluntary. Section 601(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow for construction of water conservation and quality improvements by eligible recipients under specific subsections."
