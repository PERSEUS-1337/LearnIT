The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is amended to include a provision for the Tularosa Basin Desalination Facility. Sandia National Laboratories, in collaboration with the Secretary of Energy, will develop a desalination technology progress plan within one year of the enactment of this subsection. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is amended to include a provision for the Tularosa Basin Desalination Facility. Sandia National Laboratories, in collaboration with the Secretary of Energy, will develop a desalination technology progress plan that includes an overview of available short-term and long-term desalination technology development, recommendations for facility location, an assessment of contributions to desalination, and cost-sharing requirements. The cost-sharing requirements from the Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act do not apply to funding the technology progress plan, the construction of the authorized facility, or research by Sandia National Laboratories. Additionally, a testing and evaluation facility must be constructed within 3 years. The Secretary of Energy, in collaboration with the Secretary, will construct a desalination test and evaluation facility at the Tularosa Basin in New Mexico within 3 years. A report must be submitted within 1 year of the facility's operation. The Secretary of Energy will submit a report to Congress on project plans and technological advancements of the desalination facility within 1 year of its operation. Contractors may be hired as needed, including other federal agencies, state agencies, educational institutions, and private entities. A memorandum of understanding will be established between the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior will provide technical assistance to the Secretary of Energy for the development of a desalination facility to research and test new technologies for cost reductions. The desalination facility aims to evaluate new technologies for energy consumption, byproduct disposal, and operational maintenance costs to produce potable water from salinated water. It should be capable of processing at least 100,000 gallons of water per day and collaborate on research efforts. The desalination facility will conduct research in collaboration with the Secretary of Energy, and may use other suitable laboratory facilities. All desalinated water produced will be provided to communities in Otero County, New Mexico, determined jointly by the Secretaries of Energy and the Interior. The Secretary of Energy, in coordination with Sandia National Laboratories, will provide water of consistent quality to communities in Otero County, New Mexico. The water will be supplementary to water from public systems or wells. A technical advisory committee will be established by the Secretary and the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy, in coordination with Sandia National Laboratories, will establish a technical advisory committee composed of representatives from the Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, academic institutions, private sector, other Federal agencies, and educational institutions to provide guidance and assistance in providing water to communities in Otero County, New Mexico. The Secretary of Energy, along with Sandia National Laboratories, will create a technical advisory committee with representatives from various entities to assist in providing water to communities in Otero County, New Mexico. The committee will be co-chaired by representatives from the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy. Cost sharing regulations under Section 7 will not apply to this initiative. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is amended to include the Secretary of Energy in consultation and authorization of appropriations. Section 8 is removed, section 9 is redesignated, and the Secretary of Energy is included in the first sentence. Authorization of appropriations is added as section 9. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is amended to authorize $6,000,000 annually for research and studies from 2002 to 2008. Funds can be awarded to institutions of higher education for research grants without cost-sharing requirements. Additionally, a minimum of $1,000,000 is allocated for internal research in fiscal year 2002. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 authorizes $30,000,000 for desalination demonstration and development from 2002 to 2008. Up to 25% of funds can be used for internal research by the Department of the Interior without cost-sharing requirements. Authorized $6,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2003 through 2008 to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy for transfer to Sandia National Laboratories for section 4(c) activities. SEC. 4. TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Authorization of Research and Studies under the Water Desalination Act of 1996 is amended to allow for grants, cooperative agreements, interagency agreements, and contracts. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is amended to allow for grants, agreements, and contracts for research and studies, including the possibility of conducting programs outside the United States. All awards will be based on a competitive, merit-reviewed process. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is amended to include international organizations, foundations, and educational institutions in addition to other suitable facilities for programs. The Secretary may also conduct programs outside the United States if deemed in the national interest. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is amended to include grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts with various entities to develop projects. Cost-sharing agreements are also addressed in the amendment. The Federal share of the cost of research, study, or demonstration projects under the Water Desalination Act of 1996 shall not exceed 100 percent of the total cost and may be paid out of funds from the Secretary or other Federal agencies. The Federal share of the cost for Interior projects carried out by the Secretary shall not exceed 50 percent. The Secretary shall prescribe procedures for determining infeasibility and non-Federal responsibilities. The Federal share of the cost for Interior projects carried out by the Secretary shall not exceed 50 percent, with procedures for determining infeasibility and non-Federal responsibilities. (42 U.S.C. 10301 note; Public Law 104-298) is amended. The Secretary must consult with other Federal agencies experienced in desalination research. International consultation with the Secretary of State is required for certain activities. Other agencies are not prohibited from conducting desalination research programs authorized by law."
