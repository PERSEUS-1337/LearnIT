    "content": "The \"Film Disclosure Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title. Amendment to the Lanham Act is included in the Act. The Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. 1125) is amended to require distributors or networks planning to alter a motion picture to notify artistic authors in advance and address their objections. The Lanham Act is amended to require distributors to notify artistic authors of any future material alterations to a motion picture and address their objections by including applicable labels on copies before distribution. The Lanham Act now requires distributors to notify artistic authors of any material alterations to a motion picture and address objections before distribution to exhibitors or retail providers. Distributors or networks exploiting a previously altered film are exempt from certain requirements if the film was altered by another party complying with the Act. The Lanham Act mandates distributors to inform artistic authors of any changes to a film and address objections before distribution. Distributors must request and provide author information from professional guilds, allowing authors time to respond before the film's exploitation. The distributor or network is relieved of liability if the artistic author or professional guild fails to respond within the specified time period. Exhibitors are required to broadcast, exhibit, or distribute all required labels with the motion picture and label any materially altered film objected to by an artistic author. The provisions of this paragraph apply to motion pictures for home use through retail purchase or rental. Retail providers must include all required labels provided by the distributor. No consideration over one dollar can be given for an artistic author's waiver. Any artistic author of a motion picture exploited in the US can object under this subsection. Within the United States, any individual who believes they are harmed by a violation of this subsection can file a civil action for relief. The court has the power to grant injunctions to prevent violations and may require the defendant to report on compliance. In the United States, a district court can grant an injunction upon hearing, with notice to the defendant. The injunction can be enforced nationwide and violators of an artistic author's rights may be subject to remedies under section 35(a). Additionally, in cases involving materially altered motion pictures, the court may order changes to film packaging. The violation of artistic author rights, including film packages, may result in delivery and destruction of the material. Any legal action must be initiated within 1 year. State disclosure requirements on movie alterations are preempted. Artistic authors can notify copyright owners or guilds for assistance in locating aggrieved parties. The Professional Guild Registry helps locate artistic authors of motion pictures. No legal action against guilds for not maintaining the registry or providing information. Definitions of 'artistic author', 'colorize', and 'distributor' are specified in the subsection. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the distribution and exhibition of motion pictures, including 'distributor', 'editing', 'exhibitor', and 'exploit'. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the distribution and exhibition of motion pictures, including 'exploit' meaning to exhibit publicly or offer for sale or lease, 'film' or 'motion picture' referring to theatrical movies of 60 minutes or more in duration, and 'lexiconning' as altering the sound track of a movie to match the visual images. The curr_chunk defines the terms 'materially alter' and 'material alteration' in relation to changes made to a motion picture, including colorization, time compression or expansion, panning and scanning, and editing. It excludes insertions for commercial breaks, FCC compliance editing, and secondary media preparation. The curr_chunk defines terms related to motion picture distribution for foreign markets and network distribution. Panning and scanning is also explained as the adaptation of films for television screens. The curr_chunk defines terms related to professional guilds in the motion picture industry, including directors, screenwriters, and cinematographers. It also mentions the Professional Guild Registry as a list of artistic authors' names and addresses. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the motion picture industry, including publication, retail provider, secondary media, and syndicator. The curr_chunk discusses the terms 'time compression' and 'time expansion' in relation to altering the speed of a motion picture. It also defines the term 'vendor' as the wholesaler or packager of a motion picture for distribution. Additionally, it outlines the requirements for labeling materially altered versions of motion pictures intended for public performance or home use. The curr_chunk discusses objections to various alterations made to motion pictures, including cutting scenes, panning and scanning, colorizing, and speeding up/slowing down electronically. The director, screenwriter, and cinematographer object to these changes as they impact the narrative, visual information, composition, and pace of the performances. The label for a motion picture that has been materially altered must accurately describe the changes and the objections of the artistic author. If a film has been altered in multiple ways or has multiple artistic authors, the label only needs to state the name of the artistic author once. Additionally, a label for a film package of a materially altered motion picture should include specific statements on the front of the package. The label for a motion picture that has been altered must accurately describe the changes and objections of the artistic author. The questionnaire required for conformity to ancillary media includes specific statements and related questions. The questionnaire for conformity to ancillary media includes specific statements and questions regarding editing, time compression/expansion, panning and scanning, and colorization of black and white films. The Act and its amendments will take effect 180 days after enactment."
