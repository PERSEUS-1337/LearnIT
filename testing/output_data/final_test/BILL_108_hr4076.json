    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Toxic Flame Retardant Prohibition Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that brominated flame retardants are widely used in various products to meet fire standards, but their potential effects on human health and the environment, including disruption of thyroid hormone balance and developmental deficits, need to be understood. Certain polybrominated diphenyl ethers have increased 40-fold in human breast milk since the 1970s, reflecting chemicals found throughout the body, including in a fetus. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for its protective benefits against diseases and infections, as well as cognitive development in children. The State of California and several countries have phased out products containing polybrominated diphenyl ethers to protect human health and the environment. A tracking and labeling system should be incorporated in the manufacturing, processing, and distribution of these products to improve end-of-life management. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION. Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit the manufacture, process, or distribution of products containing more than 1 percent of certain diphenyl ethers. Effective 2 years after enactment. SEC. 4. REGULATION. Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to address the identification and phase out of precursors of polybrominated diphenyl ethers within 3 years of enactment. The Administrator must issue regulations within 1 year of enactment requiring products with certain brominated diphenyl ethers to bear a specific label meeting ISO standards. The Administrator must issue regulations within 1 year of enactment requiring products with certain brominated diphenyl ethers to bear a specific label meeting ISO standards. The regulations may include alternative requirements certified by the Administrator to convey the same information."
