    "content": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill released 4.1 million barrels of oil, the largest accidental marine oil spill in history. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 allows governments to seek compensation for restoring damaged natural resources through the NRDA process. This report examines the NRDA process in the context of the spill, describing statutory requirements, implementing regulations, and developments in the Gulf of Mexico. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) applies to oil discharges into US waters and aims to unify oil spill liability laws, increase liability, and establish a fund for claims. OPA preempts other maritime remedies and holds responsible parties accountable for damages to natural resources, including in offshore drilling cases. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) holds responsible parties accountable for damages to natural resources, including in offshore drilling cases. Liability under OPA is strict and joint and several, meaning multiple parties can be liable for the full amount of damages regardless of blame. Responsible parties can seek reimbursement among themselves through subrogation. OPA provides a federal remedy for natural resource damages but does not preclude liability under other laws. OPA allows states to impose additional liability for oil spills and removal activities. Responsible parties are liable for removal costs and damages, including natural resource damages. Removal is defined as containment and removal of oil or hazardous substances from water and shorelines. OPA categorizes harm to natural resources as damage and holds responsible parties liable for damages to natural resources. Three factors are used to measure natural resource damages: restoration costs, diminution in value, and assessment costs. Damages are capped under OPA unless exceptions apply. For offshore facilities, additional liability may be imposed by states for oil spills and removal activities. Under OPA, a responsible party's liability for economic damages is limited to $75 million for offshore facilities, with no cap on removal costs. Exceptions to the cap include gross negligence, willful misconduct, or violating federal regulations. The Trustees, representing federal, state, tribal, and foreign entities, assess natural resource damages and develop restoration plans on behalf of the public. Responsible parties must be invited to participate in the NRDA process in writing. The NRDA process under OPA requires presenting claims to responsible parties before any legal action can be taken. If Trustees satisfy NOAA's regulations in estimating damages, their assessment is presumed accurate in court. Trustees form a Council to develop a restoration plan addressing damages to all resources, requiring consensus on damages and restoration. Responsible parties must prove the assessment wrong, not Trustees proving it right. The NRDA process under OPA requires cooperation among Trustees to determine the extent of natural resource injury and create a restoration plan. Each state and federal department involved gets one vote on issues. Litigation can be avoided if responsible parties agree to the Trustees' plan. Money recovered is deposited in a special trust account for resource restoration costs. NRDA aims to resolve liability issues collaboratively. NRDA aims to resolve liability issues collaboratively by establishing a process to avoid litigation. OPA includes a citizen suit provision for natural resource damages and an Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund financed by a per-barrel tax on crude oil. The fund can be used to remedy natural resource damages if responsible parties refuse to accept the Final Restoration Plan. The Oil Spill Trust Fund can be used for remedial and compensatory purposes, including paying removal costs and expenses incurred during the NRDA process. It has a compensation limit of $1 billion per incident, with $500 million available until responsible parties reimburse the fund. The Oil Spill Trust Fund can pay damages up to $1 billion per incident, with $500 million specifically for natural resource damage assessments. The remaining funds can cover removal costs, expenses, claims, and economic damages under OPA. Claims must first be presented to responsible parties before seeking payment from the Fund. The Fund can be used if responsible parties are unknown, insolvent, or refuse to pay. NOAA oversees the NRDA process. NOAA oversees the NRDA process for oil spill cases in the Gulf, including the BP spill. Trustees are incentivized to comply with NOAA's regulations due to the rebuttable presumption. Emergency restoration actions can be taken before completing the NRDA process under certain conditions. Settlement for natural resource damages can occur at any time if the terms are adequate to satisfy the goal of OPA. The OPA regulations require inviting responsible parties to participate in the NRDA process promptly. Trustees and responsible parties may enter into binding agreements to facilitate interactions and resolve disputes. Trustees determine the scope of participation once responsible parties accept an invitation. Trustees can expedite restoration through pre-incident planning and regional restoration plans. The Trustees' work involves a Preassessment Phase. In the Preassessment Phase, Trustees determine jurisdiction under OPA and assess the feasibility of restoring damaged resources. They gather data from various sources, including the public, to identify injuries and potential restoration actions. If injuries are confirmed, a Notice of Intent to Conduct Restoration Planning is prepared. The Preassessment Phase involves preparing a Notice of Intent to Conduct Restoration Planning Activities, published in the Federal Register and delivered to responsible parties. A publicly available administrative record is opened until the Final Restoration Plan is delivered. The Restoration Planning Phase focuses on designing the restoration plan, with steps including injury assessment and developing restoration alternatives. Injury assessment determines if natural resources were harmed, defined as an adverse change or impairment of a natural resource service. The Trustees evaluate harm from response actions like burning, dispersants, or vehicle damage. They quantify injuries, identify restoration projects, and establish a baseline for resource restoration under NRDA. Activities in the Restoration Planning Phase include field studies, data evaluation, modeling, injury assessment, and quantification of damage. The Trustees quantify injuries and estimate time for natural recovery to develop a restoration plan that includes specific remediation projects. Restoration can involve restoring, replacing, rehabilitating, or acquiring equivalent natural resources. Trustees must consider a range of restoration alternatives before selecting a preferred option, with only technically feasible alternatives included in the plan. Each restoration alternative addresses specific injuries resulting from an incident. The trustees must consider restoration components for addressing injuries from an oil spill incident, including primary restoration actions to return resources to baseline. They must also consider compensatory restoration actions for interim loss of resources, providing services of the same type and quality as the injured resources. If not feasible, they should identify actions that provide resources of comparable type and quality. The House Conference Report emphasizes the priority of restoring, rehabilitating, and replacing damaged resources, with acquiring equivalent resources as a last resort. Trustees evaluate and choose alternatives based on cost, meeting goals, success likelihood, preventing future injury, and avoiding collateral damage. The Trustees are required to select a \"preferred\" restoration alternative based on factors like cost-efficiency, benefits to natural resources, and public health and safety. The Draft Restoration Plan should include an injury assessment summary, restoration alternatives considered, and specific restoration objectives. Public involvement opportunities are also mandated by OPA. The Trustees must provide public involvement opportunities during the development of restoration plans. A Draft Damage Assessment and Restoration Plan is open for public comment, with comments addressed in the Final Restoration Plan. NEPA requires a review of major federal actions that impact the environment, with Final Restoration Plans with significant impacts requiring an environmental impact statement. Restoration Implementation begins once a Final Restoration Plan is agreed upon. After agreeing on a Final Restoration Plan, the Trustees move on to phase three, Restoration Implementation. They must close the administrative record and send a written demand to responsible parties, inviting them to implement the plan under Trustee oversight and cover assessment and oversight costs. Alternatively, parties can advance a specified sum to cover all costs. The demand must include incident details, trustee information, injury descriptions, an index to the record, and the Final Restoration Plan. Responsible parties have 90 days to respond by paying or assuring reimbursement to the Trustees. The responsible parties have 90 days to respond to a written demand by paying or providing assurance to reimburse trustees' assessment costs and implement the plan. If they do not agree, trustees can file a judicial action for damages or present the claim to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Judicial actions and claims must be filed within three years. Recovered sums must be placed in a trust account, with some used for reimbursement of past costs. The regulations state measures Trustees can take for restoration, including establishing a committee, developing workplans, monitoring progress, and evaluating success. Responsible parties for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill include BP Exploration and Production, Inc. The federal government Trustees include the U.S. Department of the Interior. The government Trustees involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill restoration efforts include various federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of the Interior, NOAA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Defense, and EPA, as well as state agencies from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and Texas. The Federal Lead Administrative Trustee is the Department of the Interior. The Federal Lead Administrative Trustee for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill restoration efforts is the Department of the Interior. State Trustees include governors and agencies from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Federally recognized Indian tribes and state recognized Indian tribes may also be Trustees. Potential claims from Canada and Mexico are being considered, but the search for harms in Mexican territory is inconclusive. The size of the spill and the diverse range of Trustees may make consensus more difficult. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) allows for separate NRDA processes by different Trustees, who may argue over resource ownership. OPA does not require collaboration on a single plan, allowing for multiple plans to be developed. Each type of Trustee is responsible for developing a restoration plan for the resources they oversee. Congress acknowledged the possibility of separate plans in the legislative history of OPA. The House Conference Report on OPA acknowledges the potential for separate plans by different Trustees and emphasizes the importance of cooperation. While trustees should coordinate their assessments and restoration plans, they can also act independently if resources can be divided. NOAA regulations state that trustees should act jointly in cases affecting multiple interests to avoid double recovery of damages. The Trustees have formed a Trustee Council for the Gulf oil spill NRDA process, aiming to enhance their negotiating position with responsible parties. However, individual interests may diverge as restoration priorities differ. The natural resources under federal and state Trustees' jurisdiction continue to be threatened by oil discharges from the Deepwater Horizon spill. Adverse effects on aquatic organisms, birds, wildlife, vegetation, and habitats have been observed. The NRDA process in the Gulf is currently in the Restoration Planning Phase following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Over 950 miles of shoreline habitats have been jeopardized, leading to a decline in human use of natural resources in the region. Visibly oiled wildlife, including birds, sea turtles, and marine mammals, have been affected. The Trustees announced their Intent to Conduct Restoration Planning to assess natural resource injuries and develop a restoration plan. The Notice of Intent includes the Trustees' determination of jurisdiction to pursue restoration under OPA for injuries to natural resources in the Gulf from the incident. Feasible restoration actions exist to address the natural resource injuries and losses. NOAA announced plans to develop a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to assess the environmental, social, and economic attributes of the affected environment and potential restoration actions. The PEIS process for assessing environmental impacts and restoration actions in the Gulf Coast states and the District of Columbia included public scoping meetings to identify concerns and define issues for the draft PEIS. BP provided $45 million for NRDA preassessment during the early stages of the process. BP provided $45 million for NRDA preassessment and assessment activities. DOI Trustees received an additional $12.4 million from BP for actual costs. DOI also received $47.8 million from the U.S. Coast Guard for baseline data collection. DOI has presented a claim of $67.5 million for assessment procedures. BP agreed to provide $1 billion for early restoration. BP agreed to provide $1 billion for early restoration projects in the Gulf of Mexico to address injuries to natural resources caused by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The funds will be allocated to DOI, NOAA, and the five Gulf states, with $100 million each for implementation projects. The remaining $300 million will be used for projects proposed by state trustees, focusing on the restoration of coastal marshes, damaged beaches, sensitive ocean habitats, and wildlife conservation. This funding represents a first step towards fulfilling BP's obligation for complete restoration of injured public resources. The Trustees have selected and planned 10 early restoration projects costing nearly $71 million after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. BP established a $20 billion escrow fund known as the Gulf Coast Claims Facility for individual and business losses. The Gulf Coast Claims Facility has ceased operations, with a court-supervised claims settlement program starting in 2012. President Obama signed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) during the 112th Congress, which includes the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and. The RESTORE Act, part of MAP-21, establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund funded by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. 35% of the fund is allocated to Gulf Coast states for ecological and economic restoration. The RESTORE Act established the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund funded by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. 35% of the fund is allocated to Gulf Coast states for ecological and economic restoration, including various activities like natural resource protection, infrastructure projects, and job creation. Additionally, 30% of funds go to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council for developing a comprehensive plan and identifying projects for ecosystem restoration in the region. The RESTORE Act allocates funds from the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund to Gulf Coast states for ecological and economic restoration. An additional 30% of the fund is disbursed based on factors like oiled shoreline mileage and population of coastal counties. The NRDA process faces challenges in assessing damages and restoring resources after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Trustees must decide on restoring damaged resources, with BP having the option to reject the Final Restoration Plan, leading to potential delays in natural resource restoration."
