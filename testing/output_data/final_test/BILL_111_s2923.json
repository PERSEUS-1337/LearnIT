    "content": "The \"Youth Jobs Act of 2010\" is also known as the Youth Jobs Act. It focuses on providing summer and year-round youth jobs. Congress finds that a $1,500,000,000 investment in summer and year-round employment for youth can create up to 450,000 temporary jobs for economically disadvantaged youth, addressing the growing need for employment opportunities as evidenced by increased unemployment rates in November 2009. Research from Northwestern University has shown that every $1 a youth earns has an accelerator effect of $3 on the local economy. Summer and year-round jobs for youth help supplement the income of families living in poverty and provide valuable work experience for economically disadvantaged youth. Often, a job provided under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is an economically disadvantaged youth's introduction to the world of work. According to the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, early work experience is crucial. According to Northeastern University, early work experience is a strong predictor of success and earnings in the labor market, raising lifetime earnings by 10 to 20 percent. Participation in youth jobs programs can reduce criminal behavior and benefit both youth and communities by providing work readiness skills and engaging youth productively. References to \"certificate\" and \"credential\" in subsection (d) have meanings defined by the Secretary of Labor. In this Act, a youth is defined as an individual aged 14 to 24, and a youth activity refers to activities for this age group. Authorization of appropriations is provided to the Secretary of Labor for youth activities. Appropriated $1.5 billion to the Secretary of Labor for youth activities under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, available from January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011. Funds are to be used for youth jobs and training programs, excluding unpaid work experiences, and may include learning opportunities. Funds allocated for youth activities under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 must be distributed according to specific sections of the Act, with priority given to providing work experiences in various industries or the public sector to fulfill community needs. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 prioritizes providing work experiences in the private sector that comply with child labor laws and offer opportunities for youth to earn certificates or credentials with value in the labor market. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 aims to maximize the likelihood of participants completing a program leading to a degree or credential. The effectiveness of activities funded will be measured using performance indicators based on core indicators of performance."
