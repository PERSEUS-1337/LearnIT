    "content": "The \"Military Amnesty Prevention Act\" is the short title of this Act, with the purpose of preventing military amnesty. The findings by Congress reveal that the Undersecretary of Defense signed a memorandum in 2014 expanding eligibility in the MAVNI program to include unlawful aliens, which was previously not allowed. This memo also highlighted that the Department of Defense had never before attempted to enlist aliens granted deferred action by the Department of Homeland Security. The MAVNI program, initially for lawful immigrants, was a one-year pilot program with a cap of 1,000 recruits for all branches of the Armed Forces. It expired in 2009 but was extended until 2011 for safety and security reasons. The MAVNI program was initially a one-year pilot program with a cap of 1,000 recruits for all branches of the Armed Forces. It was extended in 2012 for two years with a cap of 1,500 recruits, and in 2015 the cap was increased to 3,000 recruits for fiscal year 2015 and 5,200 recruits for fiscal year 2016. The Department of Defense relies on USCIS to validate recruits. In fiscal year 2015, all branches of the Armed Services met their enlistment goals, with approximately 80 percent of enlistment applicants being rejected in recent years. Despite no shortage of qualified applicants, the Department of Defense is reducing 160,000 uniformed personnel positions over nine years. The MAVNI program, validated by USCIS, aims to recruit unlawful aliens. The MAVNI program allows participants to receive US citizenship after wartime service. The Department of Defense intends to renew the program pending a final decision. Changes allowing unlawful aliens to enlist were not authorized by Congress, violating the Constitution. The purpose of the Act is to prevent amnesty in the military by ensuring unlawful aliens cannot enlist. The Act amends section 504(b) of title 10, allowing the enlistment of aliens in lawful immigration status if deemed vital to national interest."
