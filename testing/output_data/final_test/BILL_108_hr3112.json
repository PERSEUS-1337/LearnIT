    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Highway Borders and Trade Act of 2003\". It includes a Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program. The Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program, under Subchapter I of chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, defines terms like 'border region', 'border state', 'commercial vehicle', and 'passenger vehicle'. The Secretary is required to establish and implement this program. The Secretary will establish a border infrastructure program to improve cross-border movement of people and goods between the US and Canada, and the US and Mexico. Allocations will be made to border States for projects in the border region, focusing on transportation improvements, highway construction, safety facilities, and operational enhancements. The border infrastructure program aims to expedite cross-border vehicle and cargo movement through operational improvements, international coordination with Canada and Mexico, projects proposed by border States, and planning studies. The Secretary will allocate funds to border States for these initiatives. The formula described in paragraph (2) determines the allocation of funds to border States based on the average annual weight of cargo entering the state by commercial vehicle across the international border with Canada or Mexico. The allocation of funds to border States is determined based on the average trade value of cargo imported and exported by commercial vehicles across the international borders with Canada and Mexico. The allocation of funds to border States is based on the ratio of passenger vehicles entering the border State to all commercial vehicles entering all border States across the international borders with Canada and Mexico. This ratio is set at 25 percent. The Secretary uses data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics for allocating funds to border States based on vehicle entry ratios. Border States are guaranteed a minimum allocation of funds each fiscal year. The Federal share of project costs funded under this section cannot exceed 80 percent. Funds allocated to a State can be transferred to the Administrator of General Services for projects in border States if certain conditions are met, without increasing appropriations. Funds transferred under paragraph (1) are not considered additional appropriations for the General Services Administration. The funds will be administered following GSA procedures and can be obligated in the same manner as other funds under this chapter. Obligation authority will be transferred to the GSA Administrator in the same way and amount as funds for a project. Authorization of appropriations is provided from the Highway Trust Fund. The Highway Trust Fund will provide $200,000,000 annually from 2004 to 2009 for section implementation. Funds can be obligated as if apportioned under section 104, excluding them from state allocation calculations under section 105. The National Trade Corridor Program is established under Section 3. The National Trade Corridor Program, established under Section 3, includes the definition of an intermodal road connector and a program for allocating funds to states for planning, designing, and constructing significant national corridors. The National Trade Corridor Program allows states to apply for funding allocations by submitting applications to the Secretary. Eligible corridors include high priority corridors and intermodal road connectors. Funds can be used for feasibility studies for eligible corridors. The National Trade Corridor Program allows states to apply for funding allocations by submitting applications to the Secretary. Eligible corridors include high priority corridors and intermodal road connectors. Funds can be used for feasibility studies, comprehensive corridor planning, location and routing studies, multistate and intrastate coordination, environmental review, and construction. The Secretary allocates funds among states based on freight traffic weight, traffic increase percentage, and corridor specifics. The National Trade Corridor Program allows states to apply for funding allocations by submitting applications to the Secretary. Eligible corridors include high priority corridors and intermodal road connectors. Planning for allocated corridors must be coordinated with transportation planning by states, metropolitan planning organizations, Federal land management agencies, and tribal governments. The National Trade Corridor Program allows states to apply for funding allocations for high priority corridors and intermodal road connectors. The Federal share of project costs shall not exceed 80 percent, with $200,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2009. Funding is available from the Highway Trust Fund, and funds can be obligated as if apportioned under section 104. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century by reallocating funds for the coordinated border infrastructure program and national trade corridor program for fiscal years 2004 through 2009. Repeals sections 1118 and 1119. Adds new sections 165 and 166 for the coordinated border infrastructure program and national trade corridor program."
