In any case where the Commission initiates an action for violation of regulations, no State can file a separate action against the same defendant during the pending Commission action. Venue for actions under subsection (a) can be in the district court where the defendant is found, is an inhabitant, transacts business, or meets venue requirements under section 1391 of title 28, US Code. Process serving can occur in any district where the defendant is an inhabitant or can be found. Other state officials are not restricted by this section.
