The \"Tighten Washington's Belt Act of 2010\" defines terms like \"discretionary budget authority\" and \"current year\" in alignment with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The \"Tighten Washington's Belt Act of 2010\" defines terms such as \"discretionary budget authority\" as budget authority provided in appropriation Acts, \"discretionary spending limit\" as specified amounts in section 6, \"OMB\" as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and \"sequestration\" as the cancellation or reduction of budget authority provided in appropriation Acts. SEC. 3. ADMINISTRATION AND EFFECT OF SEQUESTRATION. (a) Presidential Order.--OMB shall issue a discretionary sequestration report 15 days after the end of session. If sequestration is required, the President shall issue an order implementing all required sequestrations without change. The order shall be effective immediately. CBO shall issue a discretionary sequestration report 10 days after the end of session. If the specified date for the Presidential order falls on a Sunday or holiday, it shall be issued the following day. \n\n(b) Effects of Sequestration.--Budgetary resources sequestered from any account shall be as follows: Budgetary resources sequestered from any account shall be permanently cancelled, except as provided in paragraph (5). The same percentage sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, and activities within a budget account. Administrative regulations implementing a sequestration must be made within 120 days of the sequestration order. If formula allocations differ, the sequestration shall result in a lower total appropriation. Budgetary resources sequestered in special fund accounts and offsetting collections sequestered in appropriation accounts shall not be available for obligation during the fiscal year of sequestration, but can be used in subsequent years as allowed by law. Each report required by this section must be submitted to the House of Representatives. The report required by this section must be submitted to the House of Representatives, the Senate, and OMB in the case of CBO, and to the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the President in the case of OMB on the day it is issued. A notice of the report will be printed in the Federal Register the following day. SEC. 4. GAO COMPLIANCE REPORT. The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress and the President upon request, certifying the compliance of orders issued by the President and reports issued by OMB or CBO under this Act. SEC. 5. DISCRETIONARY SEQUESTRATION REPORTS. The Discretionary Sequestration Reports require OMB and CBO to issue reports on specified dates, reflecting laws enacted. The reports detail estimates for fiscal years 2011-2015, including discretionary spending limits, budget authority, sequestration percentages, and sequestered budget authority and outlays. The OMB report must detail differences in estimates between OMB and CBO for breaches and required sequestration percentages. It should also explain discrepancies in sequesterable resources exceeding $5,000,000. OMB is required to use the same economic and technical assumptions as the most recent budget submitted by the President. The President's budget submissions must include adjustments to discretionary spending limits for the fiscal year and beyond. SEC. 6. LIMITS. Discretionary Spending Limits defined in the Act for fiscal years 2011-2015, with the President recommending limits for years after 2015. Enforcement includes sequestration to address budget breaches. Sequestration is used to eliminate budget breaches by reducing each account by a calculated dollar amount based on the enacted level of budget authority. If there are part-year appropriations in effect, the sequestration amount is subtracted from the annualized amount available by law in that account. Sequestration is used to eliminate budget breaches by reducing each account by a calculated dollar amount based on the enacted level of budget authority. If there are part-year appropriations in effect, the sequestration amount is subtracted from the annualized amount available by law in that account. If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress causes a breach, the discretionary spending limit for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of that breach. If an appropriation is enacted after Congress adjourns and causes a breach, reports containing required information shall be issued by CBO and OMB within specific timeframes. After enactment, OMB must issue a report with required information. The President will then implement sequestrations based on OMB calculations. CBO and OMB provide estimates for discretionary appropriations within specific timeframes. The Senate requires a report containing CBO and OMB estimates for legislation, with an explanation of any differences. If there are discrepancies, OMB must consult with the Committees on the Budget before issuing the report. OMB and CBO must follow specific assumptions and guidelines when preparing the estimates. OMB and CBO must prepare estimates in accordance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation with House and Senate Committees on the Budget. Deferrals and rescissions proposed under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 for the budget year will not be considered in determining the budget base. SEC. 7. EXEMPTIONS FROM SEQUESTRATION. All discretionary budget authority is subject to sequestration procedures, with exemptions for active duty military benefits, emergency requirements designated by the President and Congress, and expenditures protected by constitutional requirements. Exemptions to sequestration procedures under this Act are limited to active duty military benefits, emergency requirements designated by the President and Congress, and expenditures protected by constitutional requirements."
