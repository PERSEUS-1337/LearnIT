However, feed-forward and convolutional architectures have shown better results in some tasks like machine translation by processing all inputs concurrently, allowing for faster training times. The Universal Transformer (UT) is proposed as a self-attentive recurrent sequence model that aims to generalize beyond the limitations of popular feed-forward models like the Transformer. The Universal Transformer (UT) is a self-attentive recurrent sequence model that combines the parallelizability of feed-forward models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. It introduces a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and has been shown to outperform standard Transformers on various tasks, including achieving a new state of the art in language modeling and machine translation. The Transformer model, a feed-forward architecture, is a parallel-in-time model that addresses the sequential computation limitation of RNNs. It relies on a self-attention mechanism to predict output sequences symbol-by-symbol, allowing for easy parallelization and addressing the vanishing gradients problem. The Universal Transformer refines vector representations for each sequence position in parallel using self-attention and a recurrent transition function across all time steps. This approach allows for a global receptive field, unlike convolutional architectures, but lacks the iterative bias of RNNs. The Universal Transformer (UT) is introduced as a parallel-in-time recurrent self-attentive sequence model that generalizes the Transformer model. It offers increased theoretical capabilities and improved results on challenging sequence-to-sequence tasks compared to other models like the Neural Turing Machine and the Neural GPU. The Universal Transformer (UT) combines the global receptive field of Transformers with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs, making it suitable for various sequence-to-sequence problems. It is shown to be Turing-complete and refines representations for all symbols in parallel using self-attention and a shared transformation mechanism. Additionally, it includes a dynamic per-position halting mechanism for choosing the number of refinement steps for each symbol dynamically. The Universal Transformer (UT) combines Transformers with RNNs, refining symbols in parallel with dynamic refinement steps. UT outperforms Transformers and LSTMs in various tasks, including machine translation and algorithmic tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the LAMBADA text understanding dataset. The Universal Transformer (UT) operates by applying a recurrent neural network to the representations of each position in the input and output sequences. It does not recur over positions in the sequence but over consecutive revisions of the vector representations of each position. The UT is not computationally bound by the number of symbols in the sequence but only by the number of revisions made to each symbol's representation. In each recurrent time-step, the representation of every position is concurrently revised in two sub-steps using a self-attention mechanism. The Universal Transformer (UT) generates vector representations for each position in the sequence by applying a recurrent transition function and self-attention mechanism. Unlike traditional neural sequence models, UTs can have variable depth, allowing for flexible processing steps per symbol. The Universal Transformer (UT) generates vector representations for each position in the sequence using a multi-headed dot-product self-attention mechanism. It applies a recurrent transition function, residual connections, dropout, and layer normalization. The scaled dot-product attention combines queries, keys, and values, with affine projections mapping the state to queries, keys, and values. The Universal Transformer (UT) computes revised representations for input positions using transition functions like separable convolution or fully-connected neural networks. Position and time coordinate embeddings are fixed two-dimensional vectors obtained by computing sinusoidal position embeddings. The number of steps for each position is determined dynamically using dynamic halting. The Universal Transformer encoder computes vector representations for input symbols after a dynamic number of steps using ACT BID11. The decoder also attends to the encoder representations using a multihead dot-product attention function. The UT is autoregressive and trained using teacher-forcing. The Universal Transformer (UT) model is autoregressive and trained using teacher-forcing. During generation, the decoder produces output one symbol at a time, with self-attention distributions masked to only attend to positions to the left of any predicted symbol. Per-symbol target distributions are obtained through an affine transformation followed by a softmax. The encoder is run once for the input sequence, and the decoder repeatedly generates output symbols while consuming previously generated ones. Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) dynamically adjusts computational steps for processing ambiguous symbols in sequence processing systems. It modulates the number of steps needed for each input symbol, improving performance on the bAbI dataset.

The Universal Transformer, incorporating a dynamic ACT halting mechanism for adaptive computation time, achieves state-of-the-art results on tasks involving reasoning over linguistic facts. Attention distributions become sharper around correct supporting facts, similar to human problem-solving. Dynamic halting shows improved average ponder times. The Universal Transformer with dynamic halting adjusts processing steps based on the number of supporting facts required for tasks. Ponder times are higher for tasks with more supporting facts, showing adaptive computation time. The Universal Transformer (UT) has an iterative attention process that allows it to condition its attention over memory on previous iterations. There is a notion of temporal states in UT, updating memory in each step based on previous outputs, resembling a multi-hop reasoning process. Additionally, UT's ability to predict number-agreement between subjects and verbs in English sentences serves as a measure of capturing hierarchical structures in natural language. The dataset from BID21 is used to train a language model for next word prediction and ranking accuracy evaluation. Different subsets of test data with varying task difficulty, measured by agreement attractors, are used.

Two experimental setups were proposed by BID21 for training models on this task. In this paper, the language modeling objective is used to evaluate the model's ability to predict the correct form of the verb in a sentence with agreement attractors. The model must identify the head of the syntactic subject corresponding to the verb and ignore intervening attractors to make accurate predictions. The LAMBADA task BID22 is a language modeling task where the goal is to predict the last word of a passage. The task involves predicting the target word in the target sentence, which is challenging for human subjects. An example from the dataset involves a conversation about an unplanned pregnancy and the target word is \"miscarriage\".
