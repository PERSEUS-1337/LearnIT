    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Act\". Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease mainly affects the lower part of the small intestine and large intestine, while ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and ulceration of the colon. Both diseases, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease, share symptoms like severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and rectal bleeding. There is no known cause or medical cure for these diseases. Up to 1,400,000 people in the US have inflammatory bowel disease, with 30% diagnosed in childhood. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and increased risk of colorectal cancer. Annual medical costs exceed $2 billion. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is expanding research on Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The Director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is intensifying research on inflammatory bowel disease, focusing on genetic susceptibility, causes in children, animal models, clinical studies, and treatment trials. Expansion of the Institute's Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centers program with a focus on pediatric research and other research initiatives identified in scientific documents. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2006-2008 totaling $75,000,000, $85,000,000, and $100,000,000 respectively, with a reservation of up to 20% for training health professionals in biomedical research focused on inflammatory bowel disease. Professionals in biomedical research, including pediatric investigators, focused on inflammatory bowel disease. SEC. 4. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; National Inflammatory Bowel Disease Action Plan. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in consultation with the inflammatory bowel disease community, will prepare a comprehensive plan called the \"National Inflammatory Bowel Disease Action Plan\" to address the burden of the disease in both adult and pediatric populations. Within 12 months of the enactment of this Act, the Director will submit the plan to relevant committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The National Inflammatory Bowel Disease Action Plan will focus on determining the prevalence of the disease in the US, raising awareness, and preventing disease progression. The National Inflammatory Bowel Disease Action Plan includes strategies to prevent disease progression and complications like colorectal cancer. $750,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006 for this purpose."
