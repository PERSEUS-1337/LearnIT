Uranium is the key element used for nuclear power production. Congressional interest in the front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle includes domestic uranium production, concerns about reliance on imports, and the economic viability of U.S. reactors. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission promoted uranium production through federal contracts from 1947 to 1971. Between 1947 and 1971, the United States promoted domestic uranium production through federal contracts, mainly for nuclear weapons and naval propulsion reactors. After 1971, uranium concentrate was produced for commercial nuclear power reactors. By the late 1980s, U.S. nuclear utilities relied more on foreign suppliers for uranium, with 93% purchased from abroad by 2017. To minimize fuel costs, utilities diversified uranium sources globally, including mining in Australia, conversion in France, enrichment in Germany, and fuel fabrication in the U.S. The front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle involves global sourcing of uranium materials for fuel production, with the U.S. relying heavily on foreign suppliers. Policy questions arise regarding the federal government's role in promoting domestic nuclear fuel production. The report analyzes domestic and imported uranium sources, but does not address issues related to spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, environmental concerns, public health, or proliferation risks. The front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle consists of four stages: uranium mining and milling, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment, and uranium fuel fabrication. These stages involve processes such as developing yellowcake uranium concentrate, producing enriched uranium, and fabricating uranium oxide pellets for use in nuclear power reactors. The nuclear fuel produced from these processes is known as primary supply. The front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle involves uranium mining and milling, with uranium resources in the United States being relatively low compared to other countries. Uranium milling includes processing ore to generate fuel. Uranium milling processes ore to produce yellowcake uranium concentrate. Tailings, waste material from milling operations, were abandoned before the 1970s, leading to environmental contamination. The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act authorized a cleanup program for these abandoned tailings. In the United States, ISR methods have replaced conventional mining and milling for uranium production. Five ISR facilities are operating in Wyoming with an annual production capacity of 11.2 million pounds. Additionally, there is one conventional uranium mill in Utah with a capacity of 6 million pounds per day, and 11 ISR operations with a total annual production capacity of 13 million pounds. Uranium concentrate is processed and shipped for conversion. After uranium concentrate is processed, it is shipped to a uranium conversion facility where UF 6 is produced. UF 6 is a solid at room temperature and becomes a gas at higher temperatures. The Honeywell plant in Metropolis, IL, is the only uranium conversion facility in the United States. UF 6 is used as feed material for uranium enrichment, with civilian nuclear power fuel typically enriched to 3%-5% U-235. Uranium enrichment in the US previously used gaseous diffusion technology until 2013. The uranium enrichment process in the United States now utilizes gas centrifuge technology, which involves spinning UF6 gas in centrifuges to separate U-238 and U-235 isotopes. This process gradually increases the isotopic composition of U-235 from 0.71% to 3%-5%, resulting in enriched uranium hexafluoride (enUF6) as the product and depleted uranium (DU) as the waste stream. The uranium enrichment process involves increasing the isotopic composition of U-235 in the product, resulting in enriched uranium hexafluoride. This enriched uranium is then converted to uranium oxide powder for fuel fabrication, where it is formed into ceramic pellets for use in fuel rods specific to each reactor. Secondary supplies refer to uranium materials not directly processed through the front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle. Secondary supply in the uranium market includes excess uranium from underfeeding during commercial enrichment, materials in inventories, federal government's excess uranium, and downblending of higher enriched uranium. Reenrichment of depleted uranium and underfeeding are the main sources. Secondary supplies account for over a quarter of total annual world uranium supply. Uranium enrichment involves balancing energy requirements and product quantity. Enrichment operators may choose to underfeed to produce tails with lower assay, allowing for desired uranium product assay, reduced tails for storage, and less feed material used. Excess feed material from underfeeding is considered secondary supply. Uranium traders buy, sell, and store uranium materials based on market conditions. Goldman Sachs' involvement in the uranium market included buying uranium from mining companies, storing it, and providing it to utilities for nuclear power plants. Their uranium inventory peaked at $242 million in 2013, and they planned to exit the market by 2018. The current status of their holdings is unknown as sales contracts are privately negotiated. EIA provides a list of uranium sellers to U.S. civilian nuclear power reactors. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), total uranium inventories for owners and operators of U.S. civilian nuclear power reactors more than doubled from 2002 to 2016. Owners and operators increased inventories of uranium concentrate and enriched UF6 by the largest margin during that time. As of 2016, the total uranium inventory for U.S. utilities was 128 million pounds U3O8 (eq). The Department of Energy (DOE) maintains inventories of uranium essential to national security missions and excess inventories, which are sold on commercial markets to support cleanup services for former federal uranium enrichment facilities. Concerns have been raised about DOE's uranium transfers impacting market prices and the transparency of methodology used for determining transfer quantities. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) expressed legal concerns with some DOE uranium transfers from 2012 through 2013. The Secretary of Energy determines the impact of uranium transfers on the domestic production uranium industry. In FY2017, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry determined that transferring up to 1,200 metric tons of uranium per year would not harm domestic uranium producers. The DOE plans to end uranium transfers in FY2020, with a $60 million appropriation to replace anticipated profits. The uranium market involves various industries exchanging products and services indirectly. The uranium market involves industries exchanging uranium products and services through separate markets. Producers, suppliers, and utilities buy, sell, store, and transfer uranium materials through bilateral contractual agreements. Civilian nuclear power utilities purchase uranium through long-term contracts or the spot market. About 84% of uranium materials delivered in 2018 were purchased through long-term contracts. In 2018, 84% of uranium materials were purchased through long-term contracts, while 16% were bought through spot market purchases. US utilities may engage with multiple uranium producers and suppliers globally for various stages of production. This includes uranium concentrate from Australia, conversion in France, enrichment in the Netherlands, and fuel fabrication in the US. Additionally, utilities may acquire uranium materials from secondary sources, traders, or brokers. Since the late 1980s, U.S. nuclear utilities and reactor operators have increasingly purchased foreign-origin uranium for reactor fuel over domestically produced uranium. The U.S. International Trade Commission categorizes uranium imports and exports by the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, with data provided from the top five importing or exporting countries from 1992 through January 2019. Other countries may have contributed lesser amounts of uranium imports or exports during this time period, but were not included in the report. This diversification of nuclear fuel sources aims to avoid supply disruptions. The U.S. has increasingly relied on foreign-origin uranium for reactor fuel over domestically produced uranium. The DOE defines domestic facilities as those operating within the United States, regardless of foreign ownership. By 2018, 93% of uranium used in domestic nuclear reactors was of foreign origin. The term \"foreign\" refers to non-U.S. based uranium sources. The following sections detail domestic uranium sources and foreign imports for the nuclear fuel cycle. Countries like Australia export uranium concentrate to the U.S., despite not having commercial nuclear power plants. Some overseas producers lack the resources for mining but operate conversion or enrichment facilities. In 2016, ISR facilities produced half of global uranium concentrate. ISR methods are less capital-intensive than conventional mining. Domestic uranium concentrate production in the U.S. was 1.5 million pounds in 2018, the lowest since the 1950s. Production outlook remains low for 2019, with first-quarter production at 58,000 pounds, the lowest since 1996. Uranium ore and concentrates are imported into the United States. The United States imported the largest quantities of uranium concentrate from Canada and Australia in 2018. Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, Namibia, Niger, Russia, Uzbekistan, China, the United States, and Ukraine were the largest uranium-producing countries in 2017. The United States lacks an operational uranium conversion facility, requiring imported uranium concentrate to be sent abroad for conversion or stored. The Honeywell facility in Metropolis, IL, is currently on standby due to oversupply, operated by ConverDyn for trading UF6 and uranium concentrate. The United States relies on imported uranium concentrate for conversion due to the lack of operational facilities. The ConverDyn-operated Honeywell facility in Metropolis, IL serves as a trading platform for UF6 and uranium concentrate, with 62 million pounds of UF6 stored as of 2018. Major commercial uranium conversion capacity is found in Canada, China, France, Russia, and the United States. The US primarily imports UF6 from Canada, with the UK being the next highest source. Export data sheds light on the international flow of UF6, a key material for uranium enrichment. Domestic exports are goods grown, produced, or manufactured in the United States, while foreign exports consist of commodities of foreign origin previously admitted to U.S. Foreign Trade Zones. The incidence of domestic exports may indicate uranium concentrate that underwent conversion in the United States before export. Since 2010, UF 6 foreign exports have totaled roughly 32 million kg to four countries: Russia, Germany, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Historically, the federal government operated gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, TN, Paducah, KY, and Portsmouth, OH, which supplied enriched uranium for defense purposes during World War II and the Cold War. Honeywell operates as a \"global trading warehouse\" according to ConverDyn's comments. The government used uranium enrichment services at sites in Oak Ridge, TN, Paducah, KY, and Portsmouth, OH to produce enriched uranium for defense purposes. These sites have ceased operations and are undergoing decontamination and decommissioning. The Urenco facility in Eunice, NM is the only operational uranium enrichment facility in the US, supplying one-third of the annual requirements for US reactors. Other domestic enrichment facilities are not proceeding with construction. According to the World Nuclear Association, uranium enrichment services are mainly conducted in China, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Urenco operates enrichment facilities in the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. The top exporters of enriched UF6 to the US in 2018 were the Netherlands, Germany, Russia, and the UK. The US also received enriched uranium from the Megatons to Megawatts program, which involved downblended Russian HEU. After the Megatons to Megawatts program ended in 2013, imports of enriched uranium from Russia to the United States decreased by 50%. Currently, the enriched uranium imported from Russia is sourced from mined and milled uranium concentrate, not from downblended uranium from weapons. The United States has three fuel fabrication facilities in Wilmington, NC, Columbia, SC, and Richland, WA, offering various services and capacities. The ITC data separates uranium material by type and quantity that physically entered or exited the United States, while the EIA data indicates the country of origin of uranium purchased by U.S. nuclear utilities. Comparing ITC and EIA data for Kazakhstan provides insights into uranium imports. Kazakhstan is the world's top producer of uranium concentrate since 2009, with 21,700 tons produced in 2018. Between 2013 and 2017, 18% to 54% of uranium purchases by U.S. nuclear utilities were imported from Kazakhstan. The difference in quantities may indicate material processed in other countries before entering the U.S. U.S. utilities may have purchased uranium concentrate from Kazakhstan, which was then converted to UF6 in France and enriched in the Netherlands before being imported into the United States for nuclear reactor use. Enriched UF6 is also imported from countries like Germany and the United Kingdom, while U.S. utilities reportedly did not purchase uranium from these countries. Uranium purchases and imports can vary annually, and in 2018, two U.S. uranium mining companies petitioned the Department of Commerce to investigate the matter. Uranium mining companies petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce to investigate if imports from state-owned enterprises like Russia, China, and Kazakhstan threaten national security. The debate between uranium producers and nuclear utilities focused on the impact of import restrictions on domestic production and nuclear plant operations. Both sides agreed that proposed quotas would raise fuel costs for nuclear utilities. The proposed quotas would increase fuel costs for nuclear utilities and boost revenues for domestic uranium mining. Studies estimated a 25% quota could raise fuel costs by $500 million to $800 million annually and increase uranium mining revenues by $551 million to $690 million per year. The $0.41 per megawatt-hour increase in fuel costs for nuclear generators could amount to approximately $317 million per year. The uranium Section 232 investigation also raised policy questions about Congress's role under Section 232. The President can impose restrictions on imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 without congressional approval, specifically for actions related to petroleum imports. A petition called for a quota on uranium imports under Section 232, reserving 25% for U.S. production. The Department of Commerce began an investigation into uranium imports under Section 232, accepting public comments until September 10, 2018. The investigation raised policy questions about Congress's role under Section 232. The Department of Commerce conducted a Section 232 investigation on uranium imports, citing national security concerns. The President disagreed with the findings but called for a more in-depth analysis of the issue. The Department of Commerce conducted a Section 232 investigation on uranium imports due to national security concerns. A Nuclear Fuel Working Group was established to analyze the entire nuclear fuel supply chain and provide a report to the President within 90 days. No trade actions were taken as a result of the 1988 investigation on uranium imports. The Section 232 investigation on uranium imports did not result in trade actions for two consecutive years. Supporters of trade restrictions on uranium imports include domestic producers, mining associations, and elected officials from uranium-producing states. The petition argues that foreign state-owned enterprises' unfair market practices threaten the domestic uranium industry's long-term viability. Advocates believe trade quotas could increase uranium prices, boost domestic production, create employment opportunities, and stimulate local economies. The Wyoming Mining Association (WMA) supports actions to restrict uranium imports, stating that foreign state-supported production is harming the domestic industry. Energy Fuels expressed concern over the President's decision not to take action on uranium imports, but also noted success in gaining attention from the Administration. Energy Fuels expressed concern over the President's decision not to take action on uranium imports, but also noted success in gaining attention from the Administration. Cameco, another U.S. uranium producer, agreed with the President's determination. Representatives from various groups opposed the trade actions on uranium imports, citing potential fuel cost increases and early shutdowns of nuclear reactors. The Ad Hoc Utilities Group (AHUG) representing U.S. nuclear generators emphasized the importance of imports for nuclear fuel supply and grid reliability. Concerns were raised by operators of U.S. conversion and enrichment facilities about uranium import quotas potentially leading to supply diversions. U.S. uranium enrichers, including Urenco USA, shared these concerns. Melissa Mann, president of Urenco USA, highlighted the lack of natural UF6 sources in the US due to ceased operations at Honeywell and the DOE's termination of its barter program. Urenco relies on deliveries from Canada and France. Mann warned that disruptions in UF6 deliveries could jeopardize the facility's operation and $5 billion investment, impacting uranium Section 232 investigation remedies and utility reactor reload schedules. Some utilities downplay concerns about foreign uranium dependence and supply chain vulnerabilities. Dominion Energy is one example. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports in March 2018, the first use of trade actions under Section 232 since 1986. Some Members of Congress question the broad use of national security in these actions. Bills in the 116th Congress aim to amend Section 232 for congressional disapproval of certain trade actions. The uranium Section 232 investigation prompted creative ideas outside of import restrictions. Congress may consider the federal role in issues related to the nuclear fuel cycle. The House Committee on Natural Resources requested documents relating to the uranium investigation. The uranium materials and service industry supplies fuel for nuclear power reactors through private contracts in a global marketplace. The United States ceased HEU production for weapons in 1964, relying on government stockpiles for naval propulsion. The future of domestic uranium producers is uncertain due to a sharp decline in production in the 1980s. Domestic uranium production has remained low for the past 25 years, with a sharp decline in the early 1980s. Global demand for uranium has been depressed, partly due to the shutdown of Japanese nuclear power reactors after the Fukushima Daiichi accident. In 2018, domestic uranium concentrate production was at its lowest levels since 1950. U.S. producers have reduced production and laid off employees to cope with poor market conditions. Some states have proposed legislation to support domestic uranium producers. The U.S. nuclear power industry is facing economic challenges with several reactors scheduled to shut down by 2025. The Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion project in Georgia is over budget and behind schedule. A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists highlights the financial struggles of many nuclear power plants. Some groups oppose trade actions on uranium imports, fearing it will increase domestic mining operations. Increased domestic uranium mining and milling operations have raised concerns about health and environmental issues from historical activities. Soil, surface, and groundwater contamination remain a worry for communities, especially on Navajo Nation lands. Congress may need to assess the long-term environmental and public health impacts of expanding uranium production and the adequacy of financial assurance for site reclamation and decommissioning."
