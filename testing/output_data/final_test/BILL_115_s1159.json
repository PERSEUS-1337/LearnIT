Congress has enacted laws to prevent economic protectionism by State and local governments that discriminate against interstate commerce. In Gibbons v. Ogden, the Supreme Court affirmed Congress's sole right to regulate commerce between states under the dormant Commerce Clause.

Over 100 discriminatory taxes have been imposed since 1990. SEC. 80505 prohibits tax discrimination against motor vehicle rental property. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like assessment, assessment jurisdiction, commercial and industrial property, and commercial and industrial taxpayers.

Commercial and industrial taxpayers are individuals or entities engaged in a trade or business. The term 'covered person' in the context of renting motor vehicles includes individuals or entities engaged in the business of renting, owning, or purchasing motor vehicle rental property.

Such taxes are prohibited unless imposed before a certain date. The section prohibits discriminatory taxes on motor vehicle rentals and businesses, allowing covered persons to seek legal remedies in court for violations. If relief is granted, only the discriminatory portion of the tax is struck down. In subparagraph (B), a covered person must prove that a tax violates subsection (b) by a preponderance of the evidence. If the court finds a violation, the State or Locality must prove that the tax is equivalent to those imposed on other taxpayers. Other remedies under Federal or State law are not limited by this subsection. This section clarifies that it does not authorize State or Local taxation that would otherwise be prohibited. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 805 of title 49, United States Code. Rules relating to State taxation on automobile rentals are clarified in this section."
