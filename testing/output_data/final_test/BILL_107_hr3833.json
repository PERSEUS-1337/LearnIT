    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that the World Wide Web offers educational opportunities for children but also exposes them to harmful material, such as pornography, which can negatively impact their development. The development of youth is at risk due to online dangers like sexual solicitation, harassment, and exposure to illegal content. Studies show that a significant percentage of youth are targeted online, but many incidents go unreported. It is important for children to report any illegal content they come across to the CyberTipline. The CyberTipline, established by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, has received over 64,400 reports of sexual crimes against children, including child pornography and online enticement. Efforts by industries to restrict harmful material for minors online have not provided a national solution. A proposal for a \"green-light\" area in the US internet domain is suggested. The proposal aims to create a children's section within the US internet domain to protect minors from harmful material online. This initiative is compared to establishing a safe space in a library for children. The Act emphasizes the importance of shielding minors from content that could be detrimental to their well-being. The goal is to have a designated second-level domain within the US country code Internet domain for age-appropriate and non-harmful material for minors, overseen by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration oversees the creation and operation of a second-level domain within the US internet domain for age-appropriate content for minors. The NTIA is given authority to establish a child-friendly second-level internet domain within the US country code domain. The NTIA is required to establish a child-friendly second-level domain within the US country code domain, ensuring access to material suitable for minors. The initial registry must agree to operate this new domain in accordance with specified requirements. The NTIA must select a successor registry for the United States country code Internet domain, and the chosen registry must agree to operate in accordance with specified requirements within 90 days. The new domain must meet certain requirements outlined in subsection (c). The NTIA must select a successor registry for the United States country code Internet domain within 90 days. The new domain must adhere to specific written content standards, agreements with registrars and registrants, enforcement procedures, and a process for removing non-compliant content. The new domain must adhere to specific content standards, dispute resolution processes, continuous service, accurate contact information, operationality within one year, and written agreements with registrars. The Efficiency Act of 2002 requires written agreements with registrars to prohibit certain services and hyperlinks in the new domain, as well as any other actions deemed necessary by the NTIA for the operation of the domain. The NTIA must grant option periods to the initial registry for the United States country code Internet domain based on satisfactory performance. The NTIA retains the authority to terminate the contract for cause or convenience. Certain entities involved in functions under this section are considered interactive computer services under the Communications Act of 1934. The NTIA will publicize and educate parents about the new domain, while certain entities involved in its operation are considered interactive computer services under the Communications Act of 1934. The new domain will be made available to the public within 30 days, with a program to educate parents on its use with filtering technologies. The registry operating the domain will coordinate with federal agencies to prevent minors from being targeted for predatory behavior. The registry for the new domain will establish procedures to prevent targeting, start within 30 days of launch, prepare annual compliance reports, and may suspend the domain if necessary. The NTIA may suspend operation of a new domain if it is not serving its intended purpose, until it can be operated as intended. Definitions for \"harmful to minors\" are provided in the section. The term 'harmful to minors' refers to material that depicts a simulated sexual act, normal or perverted sexual act, or lewd exhibition of genitals lacking serious value for minors. A 'minor' is defined as a person under 13 years of age, and 'registry' refers to the entity operating the US country code Internet domain. A 'successor registry' is an entity that takes over this operation after the termination of the contract. The term 'suitable for minors' defines material that is appropriate for minors in terms of psychological, intellectual, educational, informational, social, emotional, or entertainment needs. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
