    "content": "Since the U.S.-Singapore FTA in 2004, U.S. trade with Singapore has grown significantly. U.S. exports to Singapore increased by 68% from $16.6 billion in 2003 to $27.9 billion in 2008, with a slight decline to $22.3 billion in 2009. U.S. imports from Singapore rose by 22% to $18.4 billion in 2007 before dropping to $15.7 billion in 2009. The U.S. trade surplus with Singapore peaked at $12.0 billion in 2008 before falling to $6.6 billion in 2009. Key U.S. exports to Singapore include machinery, electrical machinery, aircraft/spacecraft, mineral fuel and oil, optical and medical instruments, plastic, and organic chemicals. Since the U.S.-Singapore FTA in 2004, U.S. exports to Singapore have increased, with industrial and scientific machinery being major exports. Despite a rising surplus in merchandise trade, Singapore's imports from the U.S. have been declining relative to other countries. In 2001, the U.S. accounted for 16.4% of Singapore's imports, which fell to 12% by 2009, even though U.S. exports to Singapore grew rapidly. Singapore still imports more from the U.S. ($28.5 billion). Since the U.S.-Singapore FTA in 2004, U.S. exports to Singapore have increased, with industrial and scientific machinery being major exports. Despite a rising surplus in merchandise trade, Singapore's imports from the U.S. have been declining relative to other countries. Singapore imports more from the U.S. ($28.5 billion) than from China ($26.0 billion). China has passed Japan as a source of imports for Singapore. The U.S. balance of merchandise trade with Singapore shows a surplus, contrary to the perception that free trade agreements lead to larger U.S. deficits. In 2009, the U.S. ran trade surpluses with several FTA countries, including Singapore. During FTA talks with Singapore, negotiations focused on import restrictions on certain products. Negotiations in Singapore focused on import restrictions for specific products, including chewing gum, beer, stout, and samsu. Singapore allowed imports of chewing gum with \"therapeutic value\" from the U.S. to be sold in pharmacies and eliminated duties on beer, stout, and samsu from the U.S. U.S. beer exports to Singapore increased from $0.352 million in 2003 to $0.505 million in 2009, accounting for 0.5% of Singapore's total beer imports. Top sources of beer imports for Singapore in 2009 were Malaysia, Mexico, Belgium, the Netherlands, Thailand, and South Korea. In 2009, Singapore imported chewing gum worth $850,309, with none coming from the United States. Imports mainly came from Indonesia and South Korea. The U.S.-Singapore FTA is expected to increase access for U.S. companies in Singapore's service market, such as insurance and shipping. The United States has traditionally run a surplus in its balance of services trade with Singapore, which declined under the FTA but has since risen. The U.S. ran surpluses in royalties and license fees, with an increase from $2.5 billion in 2001 to $3.1 billion in 2008. The U.S. surplus in royalties and license fees with Singapore increased from $2.5 billion in 2001 to $3.1 billion in 2008. The surplus in other private services fluctuated, with a fall from $1.9 billion in 2001 to $0.7 billion in 2006, but rose to $2.2 billion in 2008. In military and government transactions, the trade balance varied over the years. The balance in travel and transportation showed a growing U.S. deficit, particularly in transportation and passenger fares, increasing from -$0.3 billion in 2001 to -$1.0 billion in 2006, but decreasing to -$0.4 billion in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. Increased market access in services under an FTA may or may not improve the U.S. bilateral trade balance. It depends on the type of service traded and each country's comparative advantage. U.S. service providers may benefit from increased access and strengthened intellectual property rights under an FTA by setting up subsidiaries in the partner country. This could reduce U.S. exports of private services but increase royalties and earnings from operations in the host country. For example, U.S. income from assets in Singapore rose significantly after the FTA, while Singaporean investors also earned from their assets in the U.S. Singapore earned $6.3 billion on their assets in the United States, resulting in a $14.8 billion surplus for the U.S. In financial services, Singapore made concessions under the FTA, allowing U.S. banks to expand their operations in the country. Citibank was among the banks to benefit from these changes. Citibank has expanded its presence in Singapore with eleven full-service branches and innovative payment systems. It holds a 50% share of the credit card market and has its own ATM network. Foreign banks in Singapore can enter the domestic ATM network if financially viable. Foreigners in Singapore cannot practice Singapore law without local credentials. U.S. and other foreign lawyers can represent parties in arbitration in Singapore without a local attorney. U.S. law firms can provide legal services related to Singapore law through joint ventures with local firms. Singapore recognizes law degrees from certain U.S. universities for admission to practice law. The Free Trade Agreement includes provisions on electronic commerce. The Free Trade Agreement with Singapore includes provisions on electronic commerce, strengthening intellectual property rights laws in the country. Amendments to various acts were made to create a robust IPR regime, attracting foreign business investments. The FTA with Singapore strengthened IPR protection, attracting foreign investments from companies like Microsoft, Pfizer, and Motorola. WIPO established an office in Singapore for dispute resolution activities, aiming to provide expertise in intellectual property ADR in the Asia-Pacific Region. The U.S.-Singapore FTA offers national treatment and financial transfer rights to foreign investors. The U.S.-Singapore FTA provides national treatment and financial transfer rights to foreign investors. Singapore was the third largest destination for U.S. foreign direct investment in the Asia Pacific in 2006, with significant growth in investment from 2001 to 2008. Manufacturing operations in Singapore saw a strong increase in value added for U.S. multinational corporations in 2004 and 2005. The enactment of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement boosted Singapore's appeal as a manufacturing base for the Asia-Pacific region. In 2005, U.S. affiliates in Singapore contributed 15% to the country's GDP, employing 123,600 persons and generating net income of $18.7 billion. U.S. imports from Singapore increased by 22% after the FTA came into effect in 2004. After the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, U.S. imports from Singapore rose by 22% from $15.1 billion in 2003 to $18.4 billion in 2007. However, imports declined to $15.7 billion in 2008 and 2009 due to the global financial crisis. U.S. exports have increased more than imports since the FTA. Imports from Singapore are concentrated in the top six categories, accounting for 91% of total imports in 2009. In 2009, U.S. imports from Singapore accounted for 91% of total imports. Concerns about increased textile and apparel imports did not materialize. Imports of woven apparel fell by 39% annually to $3 million, while knit apparel fell by 22% annually to $68 million. U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals from Singapore saw significant growth, reaching $3.0 billion in 2007 before declining to $2.0 billion in 2009. Singapore is the ninth largest supplier of pharmaceuticals to the U.S., with cardiovascular medicaments making up 95% of imports. The increase in pharmaceutical imports from Singapore to the United States ($1.9 billion) is not due to reduced tariffs under the FTA, as pharmaceuticals already enter duty-free. Singapore has become a regional hub for multinational pharmaceutical companies, with factors such as strengthened intellectual property laws and the development of biomedical industrial parks contributing to this growth. Multinational companies now dominate pharmaceutical manufacturing in Singapore. Singapore has become a hub for multinational pharmaceutical companies, with the government aiming to have ten multinational manufacturing facilities by 2010. The country exports more pharmaceuticals than other \"Asian Tiger\" economies, with domestic production now dominating exports. Singapore's global exports of pharmaceuticals have seen a significant shift towards domestic production, with re-exports decreasing from 60% to 11% between 2002 and 2006. In the modern global economy, trade is often intra-industry, with countries like the United States both importing and exporting products within the same sector. This trade can involve complex supply chains spanning multiple countries, such as electronic products designed in the US but assembled in Singapore using components from various economies in the region. The U.S. balance of trade with Singapore shows strong performance in aerospace products, mineral fuel, and electrical machinery, with trade surpluses exceeding $2.3 billion. However, there are deficits in organic chemicals and pharmaceutical products. Most other sectors have small surpluses or deficits in bilateral trade. Labor obligations are included in the U.S.-Singapore FTA. Labor obligations are a key part of the U.S.-Singapore FTA, requiring both parties to uphold International Labor Organization standards in their domestic laws. Singapore has ratified 24 ILO Conventions, including those on child labor and forced labor. The agreement prohibits weakening labor protections to promote trade and mandates enforcement of domestic labor laws through dispute settlement procedures. In 2009, Singapore's labor force consisted of approximately 2.99 million workers, with 500,000 unionized workers represented by 68 unions affiliated with the National Trade Union Congress. The Government Accountability Office found that Singapore had strong worker protections before and after the U.S.-Singapore FTA, with improvements made. Singapore, as a high-income economy, offers good working conditions and social benefits for most workers. Singapore offers good working conditions and social benefits for most workers. Changes in labor laws were not needed for the U.S.-Singapore FTA, with improvements made in worker protections since the agreement took force. Singapore's unique system for determining wage increases through the National Wages Council was understood by U.S. FTA negotiators. The workplace safety and health act in Singapore provides safety protections for workers. The Ministry of Manpower effectively enforces laws on working conditions, safety, health standards, and child labor. Despite high labor standards and few problems, there has been no U.S. activity or assistance on labor since the FTA. U.S. officials did not see a need for extensive cooperation due to Singapore's good labor laws and enforcement systems. Neither U.S. nor Singapore government officials were aware of any technical cooperation despite provisions in the labor cooperation annex. Since the implementation of the U.S.-Singapore FTA, there has been no technical cooperation on labor issues between the two countries. However, Singapore has been collaborating on labor matters with other trade partners like Chile, New Zealand, and Brunei Darussalam. The FTA mandates both parties to maintain high levels of environmental protection and not weaken their laws to promote trade. Enforcement of environmental laws is a key aspect of the agreement, with dispute settlement procedures in place. Singapore, an island with a population of 3.4 million, faces environmental issues typical of urbanized cities. Despite its lack of natural resources, it prides itself on being clean, well-planned, and environmentally conscious. The country addresses industrial pollution, urbanization, and conservation of natural areas. Measures such as tolls during rush hours and taxes on cars help manage vehicular traffic. The U.S.-Singapore FTA has strengthened economic ties and improved cargo security. In December 2007, Singapore announced a trial project for environmental initiatives. In December 2007, Singapore announced a trial project under the Secure Freight Initiative to scan 100% of U.S.-bound shipping containers for nuclear or radiological materials. Singapore is one of seven ports participating in the trial, already cooperating with the United States in security initiatives. The Ports Command in Singapore scans about 15% of cargo containers passing through its ports and can scan an incoming container truck in less than one minute. Singapore was the first country to sign on to the U.S.-sponsored Cargo Security Initiative in March 2003. The U.S.-Singapore FTA also provided reassurance of U.S. interest in Asia. The U.S.-Singapore FTA reassured U.S. interest in Asia and led to other countries negotiating their own FTAs with the United States. Singapore supported the proposal for a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific and signed a Strategic Framework Agreement with the U.S. for defense and security cooperation. Singapore actively cooperates with the United States in political and security matters, particularly in the global counterterrorism campaign. It has been at the forefront of enhancing maritime security in the region, including the Strait of Malacca. Singapore also ensures the security of cargo bound for the U.S., welcomes port visits by the U.S. Navy, and allows U.S. aircraft carriers to use a special pier at its naval base. In 2007, during its chairmanship of ASEAN, Singapore supported an investigation into Buddhist-led demonstrations in Burma despite the tradition of non-interference in member states' domestic affairs. Singapore supported investigation of protests in Burma by the Special U.N. Envoy to Myanmar Ibrahim Gambari and continued intelligence cooperation to investigate terrorist groups, focusing on Jemaah Islamiya."
