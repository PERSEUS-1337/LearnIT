    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Older Americans Sustainable Mobility Act of 2006\". Congress acknowledges the aging population in the United States and the importance of providing dignified and sustainable mobility for older individuals. It recognizes the need for safe transportation alternatives for older individuals who rely on driving, especially those with age-related conditions, living in rural and suburban areas. Many older individuals in rural and suburban areas lack access to public transportation. The cost of addressing their transportation needs is increasing as the population ages. Programs that increase mobility for older individuals can promote economic growth and community well-being. Private nonprofit organizations can provide sustainable senior transportation alternatives that supplement public transportation. The Federal Government should accelerate the availability of these models to address the transportation needs of older individuals and test their viability for a nationwide network. The Act aims to establish a national network of sustainable transportation providers for older individuals and the blind in various settings. It includes definitions for qualified transportation providers. The Act defines an economically sustainable transportation provider as a nonprofit organization capable of providing transportation services through the National Network. The provider must submit a plan for approval, connect to the network, and offer services in accordance with the Act. The Act defines economically sustainable transportation services as demand-responsive services provided by a combination of volunteer and paid drivers to qualified individuals and passengers 24/7 for up to 5 fiscal years with Federal financial assistance. After this period, the provider must continue services without public financial aid. The National Network is a network of transportation providers offering services to qualified individuals and passengers. Qualified individuals include older individuals and those who are blind or visually impaired.

The curr_chunk specifies that it includes passengers and their incidental goods or luggage. The curr_chunk specifies a demonstration project.

An eligible entity will provide recommendations for the project's requirements and administration. Eligible organizations must have experience in replicating economically sustainable transportation models. An entity entering into a contract under this section must provide technical assistance, recommendations for the National Network, and suggestions for qualified transportation accounts.

Recommendations for the use of these accounts, including how providers can debit them for services, should be provided to the Secretary. The Secretary shall establish requirements and provisions based on recommendations for national network connection and matching grant programs. Copyright and trademark laws of the United States are not affected by this Act.
