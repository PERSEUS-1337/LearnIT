    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diverse Teachers Recruitment Act of 2010.\" Congress finds that teacher diversity and cultural competence are critical for addressing the achievement gap among students. Lack of diversity among teachers can hinder positive learning outcomes and leave underrepresented students without relatable role models, leading to poorer performance in the classroom. The lack of diversity among public school teachers, with 83.1% Caucasian, contributes to lower test scores and graduation rates. Teacher demographics should be diverse to provide educational benefits and role models for students from different backgrounds and genders. The Act aims to promote educational benefits by increasing diversity among teachers, reducing achievement gaps, and enhancing student cultural competence for a more diverse workforce and society. The Act aims to increase diversity among teachers by funding activities to attain a critical mass of teachers from underrepresented groups and address historically low employment of these individuals in public schools. Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new part focused on recruitment, training, and retention of teachers, especially those from underrepresented groups. This includes a grant program aimed at increasing diversity among teachers in public schools. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible entities for recruiting teachers from underrepresented groups and providing training and retention incentives to teachers in public schools. Preference will be given to teachers from underrepresented groups. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible entities to recruit, train, and retain teachers from underrepresented groups in public schools. Eligible entities must demonstrate how they will address the challenges in recruiting and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups. The eligible entities receiving grants must show how they will address challenges in recruiting and retaining teachers from underrepresented groups. The activities are designed to provide educational benefits, including promoting positive learning outcomes, reducing achievement gaps, and increasing student cultural competence for a diverse workforce. Priority for grants under this program is given to local educational agencies serving high-need schools and schools with diverse student populations. The Secretary may make grants under this section, prioritizing high-need schools and those with diverse student populations. Grants require a 10% non-Federal contribution from eligible entities, which can be in cash or in-kind. The Secretary may waive or reduce the non-Federal contribution required if the eligible entity demonstrates financial hardship. When determining grants for school districts, the Secretary assesses if schools attract a diverse group of teachers for educational benefits. The Secretary may grant funds to schools that have not attracted a diverse group of teachers for educational benefits. SEC. 2502. REPORTS TO SECRETARY. An eligible entity receiving a grant under section 2501(a) must submit a report to the Secretary within 90 days after each school year detailing activities funded by the grant, data on teachers from underrepresented groups, including their numbers and retention rates, and indicators of student academic achievement for the last year of grant funding. The report must include data on student academic achievement, disaggregated by various groups, graduation rates, and attendance rates compared to previous school years. The report must include data on student academic achievement, graduation rates, and attendance rates compared to previous school years. It should also provide a description and data on the characteristics of the schools served by the eligible entity and the students, including the number and percentage of students in different groups. The Secretary evaluates grant-funded activities by eligible entities to compile a database of best practices for recruiting, training, and retaining underrepresented teachers. This database is accessible through an Internet website. Up to 10% of funds appropriated for this purpose can be used for this section. \"In this part, the term 'eligible entity' refers to a local educational agency or an entity that partners with a local educational agency and is a private nonprofit organization, educational service agency, institution of higher education, or State educational agency. The term 'high-need high school' is also defined.\" A high-need high school is a secondary school with an entering grade of at least 9 and a graduation rate of no more than 65% in the past 2 years. A high-need middle school is a secondary school with an entering grade of at least 6 and the highest grade not exceeding 9, with at least 35% of students enrolling in a high-need high school. A high-need school is defined as a public school where at least 40% of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, or it can be a high-need high school or middle school. An individual from an underrepresented group is someone historically underrepresented among teachers in the school district. Authorization of appropriations for the Recruitment, Training, and Retention of Teachers program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is approved for fiscal years 2011 through 2016."
