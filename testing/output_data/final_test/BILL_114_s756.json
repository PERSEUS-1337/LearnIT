    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Syrian War Crimes Accountability Act of 2015\". Congress finds that the conflict in Syria has been ongoing since March 2015, with over 191,000 people killed, including 10,000 children, and 1,000,000 injured. More than half of Syria's population is displaced, with over 7,600,000 internally displaced and 3,700,000 refugees in neighboring countries. The United Nations Secretary-General reported that parties to the conflict are not protecting civilians as required by international law. The Department of State issued a report on Syria describing President Assad's use of deadly force, including sarin gas attacks. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that terrorist organizations in Syria promote violence. The OPCW expressed concern about the use of chlorine as a weapon in Syria in 2014, calling for accountability. The UN Commission reported attacks on Syrian civilians by pro-government forces, including murder and torture. The civil war in Syria has seen widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, with various groups using murder, torture, assault, and rape as war tactics. Anti-government groups have also committed similar atrocities, including attacks on medical personnel and facilities. Physicians for Human Rights reported that since 2011, at least 610 medical personnel have been killed and there have been 233 deliberate or indiscriminate attacks on 183 medical facilities in Syria. The government of Syria has committed the majority of hospital attacks and killings of medical personnel, using healthcare as a weapon of war. International rules of war require all parties to protect the wounded and sick and provide access to medical care. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. Congress strongly condemns the ongoing violence, use of chemical weapons, and human rights violations in Syria, supports democratic change, urges parties to halt attacks on civilians and allow humanitarian aid, and calls for international efforts to ensure peace. The international community must ensure accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria, as mandated by United Nations Security Council Resolutions. Regular reporting by the Secretary-General on resolution implementation is supported, including the establishment of a committee to investigate past and ongoing violations of human rights and war crimes in the conflict. The international community must ensure accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria, as mandated by United Nations Security Council Resolutions. Regular reporting by the Secretary-General on resolution implementation is supported, including the establishment of a committee to investigate past and ongoing violations of human rights and war crimes in the conflict. SEC. 4. REPORT ON ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN SYRIA. The Secretary of State must submit a report on war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria within 90 days of the enactment of the Act and again within 180 days after the violence in Syria stops. The report should detail violations of human rights, war crimes, and crimes against humanity during the civil war, including incidents involving President Bashar al-Assad's regime and forces fighting on its behalf. The report on war crimes in Syria must include incidents by extremist groups, anti-government forces, and combatants, violations of medical neutrality, and details on weapons used. It should also cover efforts by the Department of State and USAID for ensuring accountability. The report on war crimes in Syria should include accountability for violations of human rights and crimes against humanity by various parties involved in the conflict. This involves initiatives to train investigators in Syria and efforts by the United States Government to support training on documenting and investigating war crimes. The report on Syrian conflict accountability should assess international efforts, including establishing a tribunal for war crimes prosecution and evaluating the impact of accountability measures on conflict resolution. The report may be classified or unclassified but must include a publicly available annex. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" in this section refers to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives. The bill was passed by the Senate on July 14, 2015, as confirmed by Secretary JULIE E. ADAMS."
