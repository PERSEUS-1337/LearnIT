Congress finds that in 1902, 640 acres of land were ceded to create Sulphur Springs Reservation, later known as Platt National Park. In 1976, Platt National Park and other lands were combined to form Chickasaw National Recreation Area to protect resources and honor Chickasaw Nation's history. The Chickasaw Nation now seeks to establish a cultural center within or near the park. The Chickasaw National Recreation Area's Final Amendment to the General Management Plan (1994) identified the best location for a proposed Chickasaw Nation Cultural Center within the existing boundary. The City of Sulphur, Oklahoma, donated land to the Chickasaw Nation for a land exchange with the United States, conveying fee simple title to Tract 102-26. The National Park Service, Chickasaw Nation, and City of Sulphur, Oklahoma have agreed to a land exchange for building a cultural center.
