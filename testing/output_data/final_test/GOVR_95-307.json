It provides funding for research, fellowships, and projects, making around 11,500 new awards annually. Support is given to academic institutions, research firms, and major facilities. The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides over $400 million in annual awards for contracts and supports Antarctic research stations, oceanographic vessels, and national research centers. It also fosters university-industry relationships and U.S. participation in international scientific ventures. The majority of NSF-funded research is conducted at U.S. colleges and universities, with approximately 82.3% of its FY2009 budget awarded to them. In FY2009, NSF funded around 63.8% of all federally funded basic research at colleges and universities, excluding biomedical research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent agency in the executive branch led by a presidentially appointed Director and a National Science Board (NSB). The NSF has experienced moderate growth in its total appropriation over the past 10 years, with a 4.8% increase in the FY2013 budget request. This increase is part of President Barack Obama's Strategy for American Innovation. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has proposed doubling federal investment in basic research over 10 years, but this may not be achievable due to economic concerns. The FY2013 request includes priorities like cyberinfrastructure, interdisciplinary research, advanced manufacturing, and STEM education. The FY2013 budget request by the National Science Foundation (NSF) focuses on research at the intersection of biological, mathematical, and physical sciences, expanding access to the radio spectrum, implementing evidence-based reforms, and promoting clean energy. The agency aims to develop a diverse scientific workforce and measure the use of proven instructional practices in colleges and universities. The budget supports seven major directorates, with the Research and Related Activities (R&RA) account proposed at $5,983.3 million, a 5.2% increase from FY2012. R&RA funds research projects, facilities, education, and training activities. The Research and Related Activities (R&RA) account at the National Science Foundation (NSF) provides funding for research projects, facilities, education, and training activities. It supports directorates in various fields such as Biological Sciences, Computer Science, Engineering, Geosciences, and Social Sciences. The FY2013 budget request for the BIO Directorate aims to enhance scientific understanding of biological phenomena. The CISE and ENG directorates at the National Science Foundation focus on computing, information processing, engineering research, and innovation. The CISE Directorate is proposed at $709.7 million in the FY2013 request, while the ENG Directorate is proposed at $876.3 million. Research emphasis areas include parallel processing, automation, robotics, scientific computing, and networking. The ENG aims to enhance the nation's economic strength and security through engineering education and research. The FY2013 request for the GEO Directorate is $906.4 million to support programs related to earth sciences. The GEO aims to expand knowledge of processes in the ocean and its boundaries. The FY2013 request for the MPS is $1,345.2 million to increase knowledge in relevant sciences and improve educational programs. The SBE Directorate, proposed at $259.6 million in the FY2013 request, supports programs for developing scientific knowledge about human behavior, culture, and social systems. The EHR, with a budget request of $875.6 million, aims to support science and technology education at all levels. The EHR receives funding to support science and technology education at all levels, including researchers, students, and teachers. The MREFC account is proposed at $196.2 million in the FY2013 request to acquire and construct major research facilities and equipment. NSF emphasizes the importance of research infrastructure for maintaining U.S. leadership in science and engineering. The FY2013 request for NSF prioritizes ongoing and new research projects with potential to advance scientific understanding. Funding is allocated to projects like Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, Advanced Technology Solar Telescope, Ocean Observatories Initiative, and National Ecological Observatory Network. Atacama Large Millimeter Array does not require additional funding. The MREFC account is proposed at $196.2 million to acquire and construct major research facilities and equipment. The FY2013 NSF budget prioritizes ongoing and new research projects. Language in the FY2012 conference report gave NSF flexibility to move funds into the MREFC account. The report emphasized the need for better management of construction funding to improve project efficiencies and cost savings. NSF is directed to tighten controls on fund drawdown and incentivize grantees to complete construction under budget. The FY2013 budget for the EHR Directorate is $875.6 million, with a focus on increasing technological literacy, preparing STEM professionals, and closing achievement gaps. Priorities include Research on Education and Learning, Math and Science Partnership, Project and Program Evaluation, and Discovery Research K-12. Discovery Research aims to promote innovative thinking. In FY2013, the NSF allocated $109.9 million for K-12 research, focusing on STEM education and learning impact measurement. Undergraduate priorities included the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, Advanced Technological Education, STEM Talent Extension Program, Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM, and Federal Cyber Service Scholarship for Service/Cybercorps, totaling $246.7 million. Graduate level priorities were also emphasized. In FY2013, the NSF allocated $246.7 million for undergraduate and graduate priorities in STEM education. Graduate level priorities included Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, Graduate Research Fellowships, and Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education, totaling $184.8 million. An additional priority was the Broadening Participation and Institutional Capacity in STEM program with $5.0 million to increase participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. In FY2013, the NSF allocated funds for programs to expand institutional capacity and increase participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. Programs included HBCU-UP, TCUP, LSAMP, and CREST. The NSF released a strategic plan in April 2011 to address the accelerating pace of scientific discoveries in a competitive international environment. The Strategic Plan outlines investment priorities for the next five years, focusing on innovative learning systems, management excellence, learning culture, and creativity. There is ongoing debate in the academic and scientific community and Congress regarding project management and funding prioritization. NSF emphasizes the need for flexibility in reconsidering major projects at different stages of development to adapt to changes in science and technology. The 2008 Facility Plan outlines goals and strategies for selecting, managing, and overseeing large facility projects. The MREFC system oversees large facility projects to ensure proper construction and suitability. Projects go through detailed stages for funding consideration. Legislation aims to strengthen science and math education. Concerns exist about global competitiveness and workforce development. NSF prioritizes research productivity and increasing students in STEM fields, despite proposed budget cuts for science education programs in FY2013. The FY2013 budget request proposed reductions for some science education programs authorized under the America COMPETES Act. Questions have been raised about NSF's ability to improve science and mathematics education effectively. Subra Suresh became the 13th director of the NSF in 2010, succeeding Arden L. Bement. Suresh, a mechanical engineer and former dean at MIT, highlighted potential changes needed at NSF, including the peer review system and the \"broader impact\" measure requirement. In the FY2013 budget, NSF faces challenges such as the peer review system, \"broader impact\" measure in grant proposals, and talent loss in the scientific pipeline. Despite budget constraints, NSF plays a crucial role in America's future. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act authorized increasing appropriations for NSF from FY2011 to FY2013. The EHR was authorized at the following levels: FY2011, $937.9 million; FY2012, $979.0 million; and FY2013, $1,041.8 million. Committee action denied the Administration's request to merge programs aimed at broadening participation in the sciences. The Senate proposed $7,273.1 million for the NSF in FY2013, $100.0 million below the Administration's request. The Senate proposed $196.2 million for MREFC and $875.6 million for the EHR, in line with the Administration's request. They agreed with NSF's plan to consolidate or eliminate 11 programs, including cutting support for core programs in favor of multi-disciplinary initiatives. The House Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the bill H.R. 5326, proposing $7,332.5 million for the NSF in FY2013. The bill prioritizes activities in cybersecurity, materials research, and interdisciplinary research in natural and physical sciences. $196.2 million is allocated for MREFC, and $875.6 million for the EHR program. The EHR program, funded at $875.6 million, includes proposed program reductions and reallocations by the Administration to support workforce development, goal-oriented education partnerships, and education research."
