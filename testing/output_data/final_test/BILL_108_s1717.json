The purpose of the donor banks is to acquire, tissue-type, test, and cryopreserve cord blood stem cells. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network acquires, stores, and distributes donated cord blood units for stem cell transplantation and research. Donor banks must comply with regulations and have necessary licenses and certifications. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network must have necessary licenses, certifications, and authorizations to operate.

Additionally, they must maintain strict confidentiality to protect patient and donor identities in accordance with federal and state laws. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network must have systems in place for donor diversity, communication with other banks and transplant centers, tracking recipients' outcomes, and public education.
