This does not affect the applicability of any Federal laws. In this section, the lead agency is defined as the agency managing the starting point of a special recreation permit trip, while the associated agency is the one managing the destination. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES AND PERMIT FEE CALCULATION. The Secretary must publish guidelines for setting recreation permit fees and allow deductions for certain revenues.

Permit holders can disclose these fees to customers. SEC. 5. USE OF PERMIT FEES FOR ADMINISTRATION: Permit fees from recreation service providers will offset the Secretary's costs and improve the permitting process. SEC. 6. ADJUSTMENT TO PERMIT USE REVIEWS. In reviewing and adjusting allocations of use for priority use permits on Federal recreational lands managed by the Forest Service, the Secretary of Agriculture shall allocate the highest amount of actual annual use plus 25 percent to permit holders, capped at the initial allocation. Use reviews may be waived for circumstances like weather or natural disasters, with non-use approved without reducing service days. Approved non-use may be temporarily assigned to other qualified permit holders when conditions warrant. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior must establish a program within 180 days to allow temporary permits for new recreational uses on Federal lands managed by the Forest Service or BLM. These permits can be converted to long-term permits after 2 years. The process is subject to specific regulations outlined in the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act. SEC. 8. INDEMNIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. A permit holder must have liability insurance or be self-insured if unable to provide indemnification to the Federal Government. The use of exculpatory agreements between recreation service providers and customers is allowed if enforceable by state law. SEC. 9. STREAMLINING OF PERMITTING PROCESS.

Special use authorizations include an exemption for the first 50 hours of work per year for processing and monitoring applications, with a 50-hour credit per permit. The exemption applies to processing and monitoring of recreation special use permits requiring more than 50 hours of work. The Secretary shall reduce the cost recovery for processing applications if the work exceeds the specified exemption. For multiple applications requiring over 50 hours in total, the Secretary will allocate the amount equally or prorated to each application. The agency processing recreation special use applications can apply a separate exemption of up to 50 hours per application. They should use existing studies to reduce processing costs. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture cannot recover costs for consultations under the Endangered Species Act for these applications. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture may waive costs for processing recreation special use permit applications if it would burden small businesses or threaten outdoor recreational activities in the public interest.
