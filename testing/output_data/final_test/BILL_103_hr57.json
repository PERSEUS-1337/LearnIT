The Act, known as the \"United States Merchant Marine Utilization and Preference Act of 1993,\" emphasizes the importance of clear coordination between the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense regarding control and use of ocean-going merchant vessels registered under US laws. It states that the Federal Maritime Administration and the Secretary of Defense have significant control over US-flag merchant vessels for national defense purposes. The Act of 1936 (46 App. U.S.C. 1101) mandates that military drafts of US-flag merchant vessels must adhere to Department of Defense requirements and plans for national defense purposes. The purpose of this Act is to clarify the transportation requirements for Department of Defense cargoes by water, giving preference to privately owned United States-flag vessels. Section 2631 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to prioritize transportation by water of Department of Defense cargoes using privately owned United States-flag vessels in liner or tramp trades, not chartered to the Government. Time charter or voyage charter of suitable privately owned United States-flag vessels in liner service is also considered. The Department of Defense prioritizes using privately owned United States-flag vessels in liner or tramp trades for transportation. Time charters and voyage charters should be kept to a minimum necessary level. If suitable US-flag vessels are not available, the nucleus fleet can be used with approval from the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Defense may authorize the use of foreign-flag vessels for urgent military needs, limited to a single voyage. Tariffs filed with the Federal Maritime Commission apply to transportation of Department of Defense cargo on US-flag vessels, unless a negotiated rate is more favorable to the government. The Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in the Department of Defense is responsible for obtaining, operating, and controlling government-owned or chartered vessels for transporting cargoes in areas not served by US-flag vessels. The Military Sealift Command manages ocean transportation of Department of Defense cargoes. The Department of Defense provides ocean transportation to support commercial water transportation when needed, without competing with private persons in the industry. SEC. 5. NUCLEUS FLEET. The Secretary of Defense is required to establish and maintain a fleet of vessels known as the 'nucleus fleet' under the exclusive custody of the Department of Defense. This fleet can consist of government-owned vessels operated by the Military Sealift Command or private U.S.-flag vessels. The nucleus fleet, under conditions other than full mobilization, consists of various types of vessels chartered by the Department of Defense to meet logistic needs, provide immediate capability in emergencies, and allow for necessary expansion during mobilization. During non-full mobilization, the nucleus fleet for water transportation must maintain close numbers of vessels: 10 dry cargo vessels and 22 tanker vessels. These numbers can be adjusted based on vessel deactivation or charter termination, and are subject to review by the Secretary of Defense. The nucleus fleet for water transportation must maintain 10 dry cargo vessels and 22 tanker vessels, which can be adjusted with approval from the Secretary of Defense. Additionally, the fleet may include other support vessels deemed necessary by the Military Sealift Command for indirect support of Navy vessels. If a vessel in the nucleus fleet is inactive for 30 days, it will be placed in reduced operating status. If it remains inactive for 120 days, it will be deactivated or disposed of. During full mobilization, the nucleus fleet can be augmented with additional vessels as deemed necessary. The Secretary of Defense determines appropriate vessels for the nucleus fleet, while the Chief of Naval Operations decides on specific types and acquisition schedule. Vessels added to the nucleus fleet must follow mobilization procedures approved by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Transportation provides additional support vessels as deemed necessary by the Secretary of Defense. During mobilization, the Secretary of Defense reviews and transfers excess merchant vessels to the Secretary of Transportation. After hostilities end, the nucleus fleet is reduced to pre-mobilization levels as determined by the Secretary of Defense. During mobilization, excess merchant vessels are transferred to the Secretary of Transportation. The nucleus fleet is reduced after hostilities end, with priority given to releasing vessels under charter and desired for sale or charter by US citizens for commercial service. Vessels sold or chartered are considered war-built for the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946. SEC. 6. CLERICAL AMENDMENT. The table of sections in title 10, United States Code, is amended by updating section 2631 and adding a new section 2631a. SEC. 7. READY RESERVE FORCE. SEC. 7. READY RESERVE FORCE. Amends the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 to allow vessels in the Ready Reserve Force to be used for routine cargo movements in peacetime as part of military exercises without competing with US-flag commercial operators. Vessels activated for national emergencies must be deactivated promptly when no longer needed."
