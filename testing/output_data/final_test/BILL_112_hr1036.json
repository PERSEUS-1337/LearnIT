    "content": "The Job Creation and Innovation Investment Act of 2011 may be cited as the Act. It includes an extension and modification of dividends received deduction for certain repatriated foreign earnings. The Reinvest in America Act of 2011 amends section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing taxpayers to elect to apply the section to specific taxable years. The Act eliminates a limitation in subsection (b) and modifies the investment requirement in subsection (c). The Reinvest in America Act of 2011 amends section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow taxpayers to elect to apply a special rule for investment in the United States through a qualified domestic reinvestment plan, which increases the percentage of dividend reinvestment to 100 percent. The \"domestic reinvestment plan\" requires approval from the taxpayer's top official and board of directors, and mandates reinvestment of dividends in the US within 3 years. The \"domestic reinvestment plan\" requires approval for the payment of dividends to fund research and development, expansion of facilities, proof of concept centers, venture capital investment, or manufacturing start-up costs. Proof of concept centers include activities that assess and validate commercial feasibility in public and private institutions and universities. The text chunk discusses amendments to the tax code, specifically changing dates and making conforming amendments. Amendments to section 965(c) of the tax code involve striking certain subparagraphs and revising the language regarding controlled groups. The effective date for these changes applies to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act."
