    "title": "AB 1697",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Governor Brown set a goal to cut petroleum use by 50% by 2030 to further reduce emissions. The California Legislature enacted the California Alternative and Renewable Fuel, Vehicle Technology, Clean Air and Carbon Reduction Act of 2007 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This established the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program to provide grants for alternative fuel production and infrastructure. The shift towards policies reducing emissions will lead to a greater focus on green jobs in the job market. To transition workers to green jobs, the state must provide training opportunities and earn-and-learn pathways. Section 44272 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to support this transition. The Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program is created to provide funding for innovative technologies to transform California's fuel and vehicle types in line with climate change policies. The program offers grants, loans, and other funding measures to various entities for this purpose. The program aims to develop and deploy alternative and renewable fuels and technologies in the marketplace without favoring any specific fuel or technology. The commission must approve projects receiving over $75,000 at a public meeting and align with established priorities. The executive director can approve projects under $75,000 or amendments that do not increase funding or change project scope. The commission gives preferences to projects that maximize the goals of the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program based on criteria such as transitioning from petroleum fuels to alternative fuels, aligning with state climate policies, and reducing air pollutants and environmental impacts. The project aims to reduce water pollutants and substances harmful to human health and the environment compared to California Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline or diesel fuel. It must also not negatively impact the sustainability of the state's natural resources, including state and federal lands. The project provides nonstate matching funds for costs incurred from the proposed award notice date. It aims to promote California-based technology firms, jobs, and businesses while utilizing existing or proposed fueling infrastructure. Additionally, the project must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10% from current fuel standards. The project aims to use alternative fuel blends of at least 20 percent, drive new technology advancement, and transition workers to the alternative fuel and vehicle technology sector. Funding preference is given to projects with higher benefit-cost scores. Eligibility for funding is limited to specific criteria. Projects eligible for funding include developing alternative and renewable low-carbon fuels like electricity, ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, optimizing these fuels for engine technologies, producing them in California, and reducing their life-cycle carbon footprint. Funding preference is given to projects with higher benefit-cost scores. The preference for funding alternative and renewable fuel infrastructure does not apply to renewable diesel or biodiesel equipment used solely for these fuels. Projects to develop and improve vehicle technologies for better fuel efficiency, lower greenhouse gas emissions, alternative fuel usage, propulsion systems, advanced internal combustion engines with 40% efficiency, lightweight materials, intelligent transportation systems, energy storage, control systems, battery recycling, engine optimization, hybrid technology, plug-in hybrid technology, battery electric vehicle technology, fuel cell technology, and conversions to plug-in technology. Programs and projects focus on accelerating the commercialization of vehicles and alternative fuels, retrofitting medium- and heavy-duty vehicle fleets for higher fuel efficiency, and promoting infrastructure development for alternative fuel usage in existing transportation systems. Workforce training programs focus on developing and deploying technologies to transform California's fuel and vehicle types in line with climate change policies. This includes training for alternative and renewable fuel production, high-performance vehicle technology, mass transit fleet conversion, and transitioning workers affected by greenhouse gas emission policies. State-approved apprenticeship opportunities in occupations related to the purposes of this chapter are available. The commission may adopt guidelines for block grants or incentive programs for projects, education, and promotion in California. State agencies perform analyses to assess impacts of low-carbon transportation fuels and technologies. The commission may provide funding for homeowners purchasing plug-in electric vehicles to install charging stations, considering criteria to maximize public benefit. They may also make single source awards for applied research, following specific requirements. The commission has the authority to contract with the Treasurer or small business financial development corporations to expend funds for specific programs. They can also advance funds to public entities, recipients, or administrators of block grant programs. The commission collaborates with workforce development entities to implement the workforce development components of the program."
