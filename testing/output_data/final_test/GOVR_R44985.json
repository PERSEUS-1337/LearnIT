    "content": "USDA's FAS administers export market development programs for U.S. agricultural products authorized in farm bills. These programs include the Market Access Program, Foreign Market Development Program, Emerging Markets Program, Quality Samples Program, and Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops program. They provide matching funds for activities like market research, consumer promotion, and trade servicing. Export financing assistance programs like GSM-102 and FGP provide payment guarantees on commercial financing to facilitate U.S. agricultural exports. These programs lower the cost of borrowing for foreign countries to buy U.S. agricultural products. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and extended funding for these programs through FY2018. Funding for USDA's market development and export assistance programs, such as MAP and FMDP, is mandatory through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and not subject to annual appropriations. Annual mandatory CCC funding for export market promotion programs is authorized at approximately $255 million. Contributions by industry partners have been increasing, accounting for more than 70% of total MAP and FMDP funding in 2014. In 2014, industry partners contributed over 70% of the total funding for USDA's market development and export assistance programs, MAP and FMDP, amounting to roughly $680 million. The USDA's GSM-102 export credit guarantee program facilitates up to $5.5 billion in financing for U.S. agricultural exports annually, with a total guarantee value of $2.1 billion in FY2016 and $3.5 billion in FY2017. Administrative expenses for the program are around $7 million. The United States has committed to WTO rules on export subsidies and domestic farm support measures. Budgetary outlays for administrative expenses total about $7 million annually. USDA's market development and export assistance programs are not subject to reduction commitments or WTO notifications. Market research and promotion services are considered \"green\" under WTO rules. Market research and promotion services are classified as \"green box\" policies under WTO rules, exempt from commitment reductions. These services provide information and technical assistance, involve public-private partnerships, and do not lower prices for foreign buyers. Some cite a provision in the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures for exemption. In contrast, export subsidies are considered \"amber box\" and are limited under WTO rules, including direct subsidies contingent on export performance. Export subsidies are considered \"amber box\" policies under WTO rules and are limited, including direct subsidies contingent on export performance. These subsidies can include the provision of export credit guarantee or insurance programs by governments at inadequate premium rates. Member countries agreed to exercise \"utmost restraint\" with regard to the use of export subsidies and other forms of \"export competition\" policies that subsidize exports in international markets. Export competition policies include direct export subsidies, export credits, guarantees, insurance programs, international food aid, and state trading enterprises. The Nairobi Ministerial Decision set terms for export financing support, limiting repayment terms to 18 months and requiring self-financing through fees or premiums. Exporters must pay premium rates to obtain guarantees. To obtain a guarantee, exporters pay premium rates based on guaranteed value, covering long-term operating costs without providing implicit subsidies. U.S. officials argue that export credit guarantee programs comply with WTO rules and are not subject to reduction commitments. The U.S. notification to the WTO for 2014 showed zero outlays and quantities of subsidized agricultural products. Congress shortened the loan term for export credit guarantees from 36 months to 24 months to comply with U.S. WTO commitments. USDA limits loan guarantees under GSM-102 to 18 months and made changes to meet terms of the 2010 MOU with Brazil. Further changes to the program in 2014 addressed repayment terms and guarantee fees. The U.S. follows OECD guidelines on export credits. The OECD Arrangement sets guidelines for government-backed export financing, exempt from the WTO SCM Agreement. Export credit practices in line with the OECD Arrangement are not considered export subsidies. USDA conducts economic studies on the impact of export market development programs on U.S. agricultural exports and the economy. The USDA conducts economic studies on the impact of export market development programs on U.S. agricultural exports and the economy, including effects on the farm economy, macroeconomic output, and full-time U.S. civilian jobs. These studies use various methodological approaches and measure the economic return ratio, with estimates ranging from $24 to $37 for each dollar spent on programs like MAP and FMDP. USDA's recent study suggests a return of $28 for each dollar spent on these programs. The USDA's economic studies show that MAP and FMDP programs yield a high return on investment, with estimates ranging from $24 to $37 for every dollar spent. Recent studies indicate a return of $28 for each dollar invested, leading to increased export volumes, higher prices, and greater farm income levels. These programs also have broader economy-wide impacts, including farm revenue, economic output, and full-time U.S. jobs. The USDA's recent study found that MAP and FMDP programs added $12.5 billion to export value and $1-2 billion to farm income annually from 2002 to 2014. These programs also created up to 240,000 jobs across the U.S. economy during this period. Despite their significant benefits, the U.S. Government Accountability Office has raised concerns about the economic effects of these export promotion programs. The USDA's export market development programs have had significant economic effects, adding billions to export value and farm income annually. However, concerns have been raised about the accuracy of USDA's assessment methodologies and the need for improved methods and cost-benefit analysis. GAO criticized a 2010 study commissioned by USDA for methodological limitations and omitted variables in estimating changes in market share. This criticism led to a more recent 2016 study commissioned by USDA. Additionally, GAO highlighted that USDA's program funding has been consistently spent on a set group of participants. The GAO further highlighted that USDA's program funding has been consistently spent on a set group of participants and in a consistent group of countries. It also noted industry contributions exceeding matching contribution requirements. GAO identified risks of duplication despite management efforts and the need to improve reporting requirements for program participants. Additionally, GAO found limited evidence of benefits to the U.S. agricultural sector and a lack of transparency in participant reporting contributing to limitations in USDA's analysis. The GAO's recommendations focused on the need for USDA to develop more systematic information on the potential strategic value of export assistance programs. Economic factors like expanding global markets and rising demand for U.S. products play a significant role in influencing export markets, making it challenging to determine the impact of USDA's programs. Studies reviewed by GAO show mixed evidence on the effectiveness of government promotional activities on exports. The GAO reviewed studies on the effectiveness of government promotional activities on exports, finding mixed evidence. Recommendations were made to improve USDA's export programs, including better program management and strategic planning. The Office of Inspector General also reviewed export market development programs, focusing on data collection under MAP. The Office of Inspector General recommended that USDA identify areas for tracking and analyzing data to expand exports of U.S. agricultural products. They also suggested implementing methodologies for program evaluations and standard reporting requirements, as well as conducting more outreach on foreign trade constraints and business opportunities. The Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural Exports, comprising various organizations, actively supports these efforts. The Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural Exports, along with other sponsor groups, supports USDA's export market development programs like MAP and FMDP. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to double funding for these programs by 2023. NASDA also backs doubling MAP funding. Government intervention is necessary for market promotion to address market failure and the \"free rider\" problem. Without intervention, there may be underinvestment in the market. Proactive promotion of U.S. exports is needed to differentiate from global competitors and offset subsidies. Some in Congress oppose USDA's export and market promotion programs, like MAP, and call for their elimination. Some in Congress oppose USDA's export and market promotion programs, like MAP, and have called for their elimination or reduced funding. President Trump's FY2018 budget proposes to eliminate both MAP and FMDP. Outside groups such as the Heritage Foundation and Citizens Against Government Waste have also targeted MAP for elimination. Previous legislation has attempted to limit federal spending on export promotion programs through the appropriations process. Some Members of Congress have proposed changes to the Market Access Program (MAP), including reducing funding by 20%, prohibiting funding for certain activities, and requiring USDA to disclose travel expenses. Critics argue that MAP funding is corporate welfare benefiting large companies like Welch Food and Sunkist Growers. In 2011, 85% of MAP funding was used for promoting generic commodities overseas, while 15% was allocated for branded products. Federal agencies like the Export-Import Bank and Small Business Administration provide support to U.S. agricultural exporters, but data on their assistance is not publicly available. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is a U.S. government corporation that finances and insures U.S. exports to support U.S. jobs when the private sector cannot do so on its own. It leads in financing non-agricultural exports and also supports agricultural exports, working in conjunction with the USDA. Ex-Im Bank's charter requires it to supplement, not compete with, private capital or USDA's agricultural commodity programs. Ex-Im Bank's charter mandates consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and consideration of their recommendations on agricultural export financing. It also emphasizes the importance of agriculture commodity exports to the U.S. market and trade balance. The bank must minimize competition in government-backed export financing and collaborate with other agencies to reduce government-subsidized export financing. Ex-Im Bank's role in supporting agricultural exports has evolved to include commodities, consumables, livestock, equipment, and project financing. Short-term insurance programs are comparable to USDA's GSM-102 program for agricultural commodity exports. Ex-Im Bank's support for U.S. agricultural exports is small compared to USDA's, with only a fraction of total authorizations directed towards agricultural goods. In FY2016, Ex-Im Bank authorized $190 million for agricultural exports out of $5 billion total authorizations, while USDA's GSM-102 program had a guarantee value of $2.1 billion. The differences between USDA and Ex-Im programs vary in terms of mission, eligibility, repayment terms, and specific requirements. While both support U.S. agricultural exports, policymakers have questioned the potential duplication of their activities. USDA and Ex-Im have different missions and serve different constituencies, leading to distinct program features. However, the presence of two agencies offering agricultural export financing services may lead to confusion and inefficiencies for U.S. businesses. SBA administers various programs to support small businesses, including loan guarantee, venture capital, contracting, direct loan, and management assistance programs. It also provides financial and technical assistance for small businesses involved in international trade. SBA offers three financing programs for exporters: Export Express loan program for working capital or fixed assets, Export Working Capital loan program for financing export orders, and International Trade loan program for long-term financing to support growing export sales or modernization due to foreign competition. Personal guarantees are required, and SBA shares the risk with lenders by guaranteeing less than 100% of the loan value. SBA provides loan guarantees for small businesses that cannot obtain credit elsewhere, with a higher rate of guarantee on loans issued through its export financing programs. In FY2016, SBA guaranteed $1.55 billion in loans to 1,550 small business exporters and offers technical assistance through various programs to help small businesses start or expand their exporting activities. The SBA offers various activities to boost small business exports, such as trade missions and training workshops. The most recent round of STEP awards for FY2017 totaled $18 million."
