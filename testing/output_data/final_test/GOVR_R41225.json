    "content": "In the 111th Congress, legislation was introduced to clarify the scope of the Clean Water Act after Supreme Court decisions narrowed its jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters. The decisions impact various provisions of the law, including permits for discharges of dredged or fill material. In SWANCC, the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Water Act does not extend jurisdiction to isolated, nonnavigable waters based solely on potential use by migratory birds crossing state lines, creating uncertainty over which wetlands would no longer be federally regulated. In Rapanos v. United States, the Court addressed Clean Water Act jurisdiction over \"adjacent wetlands,\" with a split ruling. Justice Scalia's opinion restricted jurisdiction to permanent bodies of water with a continuous connection to navigable waters. Justice Kennedy proposed a case-by-case test for a significant nexus to waters of the United States for jurisdiction over adjacent wetlands. In Rapanos v. United States, the Court addressed Clean Water Act jurisdiction over \"adjacent wetlands,\" with a split ruling. Justice Scalia's opinion restricted jurisdiction to permanent bodies of water with a continuous connection to navigable waters. Justice Kennedy proposed a case-by-case test for a significant nexus to waters of the United States for jurisdiction over adjacent wetlands. Kennedy's opinion stated that wetlands have significant nexus if they affect the integrity of traditional navigable waters through flood retention, pollutant trapping, and filtration. The scope of CWA jurisdiction has remained unsettled post-Rapanos, leading to diverging opinions in lower courts. Bills have been proposed to nullify SWANCC and Rapanos and reinstate the previous interpretation of \"waters of the United States.\" In response to the rulings in SWANCC and Rapanos, legislation has been introduced in the 111th Congress to reinstate the previous interpretation of \"waters of the United States.\" The Obama Administration officials have supported the need for legislative clarification on these issues, marking the first time they have done so. S. 787 (the Clean Water Restoration Act) was introduced by Senator Feingold and approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in June 2009. Legislation introduced in response to court rulings and regulatory guidance aims to clarify the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act, restoring protections for waters and wetlands that were weakened by previous decisions. Proponents argue that the legislation is necessary to uphold congressional intent and safeguard the nation's water quality. Both S. 787 and H.R. 5088 share this objective but propose slightly different approaches. Critics of the bills argued that they would expand federal regulatory jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, causing ambiguity and uncertainty in defining \"waters of the United States.\" Supporters, including states, environmental organizations, and outdoor groups, believed the bills would strengthen CWA protections for water quality and wetlands. The bill approved by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works aimed to strengthen CWA protection for water quality and wetlands. Critics, including manufacturing industry groups and agricultural interests, opposed the bill, arguing it would alter the regulatory balance of federal and state authority under the CWA. Senator Feingold introduced the legislation in April 2009, with the purpose of reaffirming Congress's original intent in enacting the CWA in 1972 and defining the waters of the United States as interpreted before the SWANCC ruling. The Senate Committee approved a bill to strengthen CWA protection for water quality and wetlands. The bill included findings about the economic and ecological importance of protecting intrastate waters and wetlands, as well as the need to protect small streams from pollutant discharges. It aimed to overturn the SWANCC and Rapanos rulings and reaffirm federal jurisdiction over all waters of the United States. The findings in the bill were modified by the Senate committee, influencing regulatory decisions and judicial interpretation. The Senate Committee approved a bill to strengthen CWA protection for water quality and wetlands, aiming to overturn previous rulings and reaffirm federal jurisdiction over all waters of the United States. Section 4 of the bill would have redefined \"navigable waters\" to \"waters of the United States,\" impacting regulatory decisions and judicial interpretation. The CWA would define \"waters of the United States\" broadly to include various water bodies and exclude prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems. The CWA would define \"waters of the United States\" broadly to include various water bodies and exclude prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems. Section 5 of the bill would replace phrases in the CWA with \"waters of the United States,\" while Section 6 would preserve CWA permit exemptions. Section 402(l) of the Clean Water Act prohibits the EPA Administrator from requiring NPDES permits for certain discharges, such as return flows from irrigated agriculture and stormwater runoff from oil or gas mining operations. The legislation also aims to preserve permit exemptions specified in CWA section 404(f)(1). Section 404 authorizes the Corps to issue permits for dredged or fill materials into navigable waters, including wetlands. Subsections 6(3) through (8) of S. 787 would have preserved existing exemptions for various activities. The committee approved Section 6 with only statutory citations for the saved provisions, dropping additional language that would have paraphrased each provision. Critics of the legislation had argued against these changes. Section 7 of the bill directed the EPA and the Corps to promulgate regulations within 18 months of enactment. It clarified the term \"waters of the United States\" and referenced federal jurisdiction under the CWA. Representative Oberstar introduced a modified version of the legislation, with similar purposes to S. 787. H.R. 5088 aimed to reaffirm Congress's original objective in enacting the Clean Water Act and define the waters of the United States subject to the CWA. It also sought to protect these waters under specific constitutional powers. The bill included findings on the importance of safeguarding small and intermittent streams, including seasonal streams and their headwaters, to prevent pollution in larger rivers and streams. H.R. 5088 aimed to reaffirm Congress's original objective in enacting the Clean Water Act by defining the waters of the United States subject to the CWA. It included findings on the importance of safeguarding small and intermittent streams to prevent pollution in larger rivers and streams. The bill would have addressed the SWANCC and Rapanos rulings, stating that they impair the statutory protection of U.S. waters. Section 4 of the bill was crucial, as it would have affected the key CWA phrase determining the act's reach. Unlike the Senate committee bill, H.R. 5088 proposed a longer definition based on existing regulatory language of the Corps and EPA with some modifications. H.R. 5088 proposed defining \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act to include various water bodies that impact interstate or foreign commerce, with modifications to existing regulatory language. H.R. 5088 proposed defining \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act to include various water bodies that impact interstate or foreign commerce, with modifications to existing regulatory language. The bill aimed to exclude certain terms currently excluded from jurisdiction by regulation only, and to replace phrases in the CWA with \"waters of the United States.\" H.R. 5088 aimed to redefine \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act, replacing phrases and excluding certain terms to provide clarity on regulatory jurisdiction. The bill did not include a Savings Clause, statutory construction provision, or call for new regulations, as it largely codified existing regulatory language. Proponents and critics sought predictability and certainty in determining which waters are protected and subject to regulation under the CWA. The proposed bills aimed to redefine \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act to provide clarity on regulatory jurisdiction. Supporters argued that including specific examples like prairie potholes and playa lakes would clarify congressional intent, while critics raised concerns about costly delays in obtaining jurisdictional determinations. The bills aimed to redefine \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act to clarify regulatory jurisdiction, with some stakeholders advocating for verbatim codification of existing regulations. However, the Senate rejected this approach and crafted a definition from various parts of the regulatory text. The authors of H.R. 5088 in the 111th Congress included a statutory definition that closely followed the existing Corps-EPA regulatory language. H.R. 5088 aimed to redefine \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act by extending the regulatory definition to include international waters and wetlands, potentially expanding the act's jurisdiction. Additionally, it proposed to include waters that affect U.S. treaty obligations or territory. The bills aimed to restore the original intent of the Clean Water Act by addressing the Court's interpretation of \"navigable waters.\" Supporters believed the Court had discounted the broad interpretation of the term by the Corps and EPA. The Scalia plurality opinion in Rapanos limited the Clean Water Act's coverage to certain bodies of water and wetlands, potentially putting many upper-reach tributaries at risk of losing federal protection. The 111th Congress legislation aimed to clarify Congress's intent in 1972 to protect and conserve waters from pollution. The 1972 legislation aimed to protect and conserve waters from pollution by removing the word \"navigable\" from the Clean Water Act, which supporters believe restores its original intent. Critics argue that retaining \"navigable\" is crucial to prevent federal overreach and maintain states' authority over water resources. Critics of S. 787 and H.R. 5088 argued that the legislation would expansively interpret jurisdictional waters under the Clean Water Act, contrary to congressional intent. Environmentalists were concerned about the Supreme Court's SWANCC and Rapanos rulings questioning Congress's power limits. The SWANCC ruling questioned Congress's power to regulate waters not connected to traditional navigable waters under the Commerce Clause. Commentators suggest that if Congress reverses the rulings, it should clearly state the constitutional basis for jurisdiction to prevent future challenges to its authority. The legislation aimed to define \"waters of the United States\" in accordance with Congress' Commerce Clause power and protect such waters as authorized by the Constitution. It also addressed waters affecting U.S. treaty obligations and territory. Critics of the legislation raised objections to the language addressing Congress's authority to regulate waters, arguing that it would expand the law's reach beyond original intent. Supporters of the bill disputed this interpretation, pointing to a provision that would limit the term \"waters of the United States\" to federal jurisdiction as interpreted by the EPA and Corps. The legislation approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in June 2009 aimed to clarify the scope of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, but critics were concerned about potential regulatory expansion. Amendments were made to address these concerns during markup. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved legislation in June 2009 to clarify federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Amendments were made during markup, including discussions on permit exemptions and constitutional authority to protect U.S. waters. Some exemptions were adopted, but the broadest language sought by environmental groups was not included in the final bill. After the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved legislation in June 2009 to clarify federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, further changes to the bill were of interest to both supporters and opponents. Representative Oberstar introduced H.R. 5088 in the 111th Congress, reflecting testimony from previous hearings. The Administration did not take an official position on the legislation, but agencies like EPA and the Corps expressed support for legislative clarification. No specific schedule for action on the bill was announced, and there was no further legislative action during that Congress. Future prospects for legislation clarifying federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act are uncertain due to differing views among stakeholders and the defeat of key sponsors in the 111th Congress. The desire for greater certainty over jurisdictional waters remains, but challenges in legislating changes to protect wetlands and U.S. waters persist. The complex scientific questions surrounding these areas make precise resolution in law difficult, highlighting the challenges of using legislation to address these issues. The challenges of using legislation to clarify federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act have been highlighted by the SWANCC and Rapanos cases. The implications of defining \"waters of the United States\" would depend on new statutory language, legislative history, regulations, and interpretive case law."
