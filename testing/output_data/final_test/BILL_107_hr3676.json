    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare, Medicaid, and MCH Tobacco Use Cessation Promotion Act of 2001\" amends the Medicare program to include coverage for counseling for tobacco cessation. This includes defining counseling for cessation of tobacco use as a covered service under the Social Security Act. The term 'counseling for cessation of tobacco use' includes diagnostic, therapy, and counseling services for individuals using tobacco products, provided by a physician or other authorized healthcare professional under state law. It is limited to services in line with current clinical practice guidelines on treating tobacco use. The Public Health Service issues clinical practice guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence. Payment for counseling services for tobacco cessation will be covered at 100 percent of the actual charge or a fee schedule determined by the Secretary. The amendments eliminate deductibles and coinsurance for counseling services for tobacco cessation in outpatient hospital settings. The amendments made by this section will apply to services provided on or after January 1 of the first calendar year that begins at least 6 months after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3.
