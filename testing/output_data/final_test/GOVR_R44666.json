    "content": "The homeland security appropriations bill allocates resources to every departmental component of DHS, with discretionary appropriations providing the majority of funding. The budget also includes fee revenues, trust fund resources, and mandatory spending. Appropriations measures for DHS are typically organized into five thematic groupings, with a fifth title containing general provisions that impact the entire department. The DHS appropriations bill allocates funding to various components, with Title II being the largest and covering CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The Administration requested $32.27 billion for these components in FY2017, which was $797 million less than FY2016. Additionally, a transfer of $163 million was requested in the Department of Defense budget. The Administration requested a transfer of $163 million from the Navy to the USCG in the Department of Defense budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $32.92 billion in net discretionary budget authority for various components, $652 million more than requested. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $32.85 billion in net discretionary budget authority, $592 million more than requested. The House Appropriations Committee sought to provide $163 million in OCO-designated funding as a transfer from the Navy in the Department of Defense appropriations bill. No annual appropriations bill for DHS was enacted prior to the end of FY2016. Continuing resolutions were signed into law to fund the government at the same rate of operations as FY2016, with slight reductions, through April 28, 2017. A new provision in the second continuing resolution provided budgetary flexibility to CBP, ICE, TSA, and the Coast Guard. The Administration requested flexibility for CBP, ICE, TSA, and U.S. Secret Service to maintain staffing levels, border security, and immigration enforcement priorities in response to unpredictable migration surges. Congress extended the flexibility to ensure aviation security activities and protection of the President-elect. For more details on DHS appropriations, refer to CRS Report R44621. The curr_chunk provides information on the funding and responsibilities of CBP under the Security, Enforcement, and Investigations title for FY2016 and FY2017. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry, preventing terrorism while facilitating travel and trade. It includes the Office of Field Operations, U.S. Border Patrol, and Air and Marine Operations. CBP officers inspect people and goods at ports of entry for authorization. CBP officers and USBP agents enforce over 400 laws and regulations at the border to prevent illegal entries. CBP's major accounts include Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control between Ports of Entry, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user fee accounts. The Administration requested $11.9 billion in discretionary funding for FY2017. The Administration requested $11.9 billion in discretionary budget authority for CBP in FY2017, with a $625 million increase from FY2016. The Senate Appropriations Committee's reported amount was $11.4 billion, $489 million less than the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee's reported amount was also $11.4 billion, $458 million less than the Administration's request. The Senate committee did not include the transfer of OBIM to CBP. CBP requested $11.9 billion in FY2017, $625 million more than FY2016. The House Appropriations Committee reported $11.4 billion, $458 million less than the request. Issues with recruiting and retaining personnel persist. CBP has faced challenges in hiring additional officers due to competition with other agencies, remote job locations, and a lengthy hiring process. Despite efforts to improve recruitment and retention, staffing levels in July 2016 were below authorized levels. The Administration requested funding for fewer USBP agents in FY2017 compared to FY2016. Additionally, there is a need for 2,107 additional CBPOs through FY2017. The proposal suggests raising fees under COBRA and Express Consignment Courier Facilities to fund 2,070 additional CBPOs. It also recommends removing fee exemptions for sea passengers from the US, Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands. H.Rept. 114-668 and S.Rept. 114-264 highlight CBP's struggle to hire and maintain personnel. H.Rept. 114-668 suggests a $12.7 million reduction in personnel funding due to slow hiring. The report highlighted DHS's struggle to define required USBP personnel levels and recommended maintaining current agent numbers. It also directed CBP to use hiring hubs, work with OPM to reach funded personnel levels, and create a staffing model considering operational needs. Additionally, it supported hiring new CBP technicians to assist CBPOs in law enforcement activities. Border Patrol apprehensions of unaccompanied child migrants peaked in FY2014. The number of unaccompanied minors and family units apprehended by CBP has fluctuated over the years, with a peak in FY2014 and a subsequent decrease in FY2015. However, there was an increase in FY2016, prompting the Administration to request a $23 million increase in appropriations for the Unaccompanied Child Contingency Fund in FY2017. This funding would only be triggered if the number of UACs exceeded the previous year's levels. The House and Senate did not recommend funding this contingency fund. H.Rept. 114-668 directed CBP to report to Congress on implementing GAO recommendations for UAC care. Recommendations included improving short-term holding conditions, access to resources and legal assistance for UACs, and collaboration with other agencies. Concerns over migrant family separation were mentioned, with a recommendation for CBP to work on keeping families together. CBP has increased transparency on incidents involving use-of-force or misconduct. In May 2014 and 2015, CBP published its use-of-force policy and statistics, conducted a body-worn camera feasibility study, and commissioned a review of complaints and discipline systems. Issues were found in investigation processes, discipline, stakeholder roles, performance metrics, and reporting practices. The CBP Integrity Advisory Council made recommendations to improve disciplinary processes, public complaints system, and transparency in use-of-force incidents. The Administration requested $70 million in FY2017 to support the Investigative Operations Division. The Administration requested $70 million for the Investigative Operations Division to investigate CBP employee misconduct and use-of-force incidents. This includes $7 million for hiring 30 criminal investigators, $21 million for the Use of Force Center of Excellence, and $5 million for integrating camera technology. H.Rept. 114-668 recommended an additional $7 million for hiring investigators. CBP must report deaths in custody or after use of force within 24 hours. The report recommended $5 million for integrating camera technology into CBP operations. Concerns were raised about CBP's lack of a comprehensive process for determining the appropriate number of criminal investigators needed. A pilot program was created to allow CBP to accept donations and enter into reimbursable service agreements. The Donations Acceptance Program (DAP) and Reimbursable Services Program (RSP) allow CBP to accept donations and partner with private or public sector entities to fund improvements in border facilities and port services. The FY2016 appropriations act increased the number of possible air POE pilots from 5 to 10, and the Administration has proposed increased immigration fees to support an increase in CBPOs. The H.Rept. 114-668 recommended removing the limitation on reimbursable fee agreements in air POEs and increasing the overtime cap for CBPOs to $45,000. In contrast, S.Rept. 114-264 suggested a $35,000 annual overtime cap for CBP employees and expressed disappointment in the lack of small or mid-sized air POEs in the RSP. H.Rept. 114-668 directed CBP to consider the impact of donation proposals on other POEs, maintenance costs, and staffing requirements, while S.Rept. 114-264 instructed CBP to collaborate with GSA for review. CBP was directed to collaborate with GSA to review the evaluation process for donations over $3 million. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws, with components like HSI targeting criminal organizations involved in various illegal activities. ICE, responsible for enforcing immigration laws, requested $5,832 million in net budget authority for FY2017, a 1.4% increase from the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3001 proposed $5,963 million in net budget authority for ICE, exceeding the President's request by 2.2%. The House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 would provide $5,904 million in net budget authority for ICE, a 1.2% increase from the Administration's request. This would result in $6,137 million in gross budget authority for the agency. ICE's resources allocation for its mission is continuously debated, with a focus on Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and issues related to the identification, custody management, and removal of foreign nationals who violated U.S. immigration law. The House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 would provide $5,904 million in net budget authority for ICE, a 1.2% increase from the Administration's request. This would result in $6,137 million in gross budget authority for the agency. ICE's resources allocation for its mission is continuously debated, with a focus on Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and issues related to the identification, custody management, and removal of foreign nationals who violated U.S. immigration law. ERO provides custody management of aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the United States. Congressional attention has been on the number of detention beds for foreign nationals detained by ICE, with a mandated average number of beds specified by Congress. The Administration requested a decrease in funding and beds from 34,000 to 30,913. The House-reported H.R. 5634 would provide funding to maintain 34,000 beds for ICE detention. It also includes reporting requirements on detention costs and facility inspections. The bill prohibits the use of funds to release certain detained aliens unless required by law or court order. ICE reports that in FY2015, 83% of detained aliens were classified as Priority 1 (threats to national security, border security, and public safety) and 16% as Priority 2 (committed misdemeanors or entered illegally after Jan 1, 2014). The remaining detainees were Priority 3 or other removable aliens. Critics argue that DHS's discretion in detaining aliens has faced backlash, with concerns about conflicting court decisions and the high cost of detention. There is interest in developing alternatives to detention, such as ICE's Alternatives to Detention program, which uses electronic monitoring and home visits for certain aliens awaiting removal hearings. ICE's Alternatives to Detention program, funded at $126 million, uses electronic monitoring for aliens awaiting removal hearings. Priority is given to vulnerable populations. ICE is responsible for transporting UAC and representing the government in removal proceedings. In FY2014, there was a large increase in the number of UAC apprehensions, causing strain on agency resources. UAC apprehensions decreased in FY2015 but increased again in FY2016. The Administration requested $10 million for UAC transportation costs and $3 million in contingency funding. ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about ICE operations and policies. ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about ICE operations and policies. Some argue that the position of Public Advocate was renamed Deputy Assistant Director of Custody Programs and Community Outreach, with functions now under \"community outreach.\" TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was established in 2001 to protect air, land, marine, and rail transportation systems in the United States. In 2002, TSA was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure the freedom of movement for people and goods by deploying security measures against terrorist threats and criminal acts. This includes screening passengers and baggage, using detection systems for explosives and weapons, and enforcing security regulations for all modes of transportation. The TSA serves as the primary liaison for transportation security to law enforcement and intelligence communities. Its budget is a complex component of the DHS Appropriations bill, with various sources offsetting aviation security costs and funding screening technology investments. In FY2017, the Administration requested $7.6 billion in gross discretionary budget authority for TSA, a slight increase from FY2016. In FY2017, the Administration proposed a $141 million increase in TSA funding, with the Senate and House appropriations committees differing on the inclusion of an $880 million increase in Aviation Passenger Security Fee collections. The Senate proposed $7.7 billion in discretionary budget authority for TSA, while the House proposed $7.6 billion, with slight variations from the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee's discretionary funding level is $66 million less than proposed in the Senate committee-reported bill. The House report noted concerns about passenger volume increases not being fully accounted for in budget requests, leading to delays and long screening lines. TSA was allowed to hire more screeners as a temporary measure to address higher passenger volumes over the 2016 summer season. TSA will assess its needs to enhance security and efficiency in passenger and baggage screening. The Senate committee allocated funds to hire over 600 staff in FY2017. Concerns were raised about low enrollment in the PreCheck program causing delays at checkpoints. The House committee directed TSA to make PreCheck more accessible to the public by assessing service fees, staffing at enrollment offices, and convenience of locations and hours. They also instructed TSA to consider leveraging airport operators and private-sector entities to increase PreCheck enrollment. TSA was directed to expand enrollment capabilities through private-sector solutions and partnerships. The provision directs TSA to partner with the private sector to enhance identity verification for PreCheck applicants and conduct security risk assessments at foreign airports. Funding for these mandates may be considered in FY2017 appropriations. The TSA has been authorized to donate security screening equipment to foreign airports to enhance global transportation security efforts. They are also working with foreign governments to review air cargo security programs and provide training in various aspects of air transportation security. Budgetary resources for these mandates may be a concern for FY2017 appropriations. The House bill allocated funds for TSA implementation of the Rap Back Service and other criminal vetting enhancements. The Senate report raised concerns about potential misuse of SIDA badges by airline workers and directed TSA to take actions to screen aviation workers more effectively. The TSA is implementing information-based screening for aviation workers to enhance security and prevent vulnerabilities in vetting processes. The Coast Guard is responsible for maritime security, including U.S. ports and waterways, as well as other missions like search and rescue and environmental protection. The Administration requested $8.4 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2017, $714 million less than FY2016. Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $8.6 billion, $129 million more than requested. House Appropriations Committee proposed $8.6 billion, $111 million more than requested. House funding is $18 million less than Senate proposal. Commandant mentioned the need for increased resources in a speech on the \"State of the Coast Guard.\" In a 2016 speech on the \"State of the Coast Guard,\" the Commandant emphasized the need for a larger Coast Guard. The Coast Guard requested an increase of 320 FTEs for FY2017, but the H.Rept. 114-668 questioned the realistic hiring assumptions. Both House and Senate appropriations committees recommended a $10 million reduction in military pay and allowances. The Coast Guard's workload has increased with the responsibility of inspecting towing vessels, doubling the number of vessels it inspects. The Coast Guard's role in promoting fishing vessel safety has recently increased, with suggestions to allocate inspection personnel more efficiently. A 2015 report recommended relying more on classification societies for vessel safety inspections. The Coast Guard is statutorily required to inspect all maritime facilities twice per year for security purposes, but suggested inspections could be based on a security risk profile of each facility. The Senate recommended procuring a 10th national security cutter (NSC) for the Coast Guard in the 2017 fiscal year, with $95 million allocated for the procurement process. This recommendation deviated from the original plan of acquiring eight NSCs, with concerns raised about the operational and funding implications of acquiring additional vessels beyond the program of record. The annual operating cost for a single NSC was stated to be $45 million in a March 2016 hearing. The Coast Guard testified that the annual operating cost for a single NSC is $45 million, with $140 million needed for shore infrastructure. The House Committee recommended acquiring six fast-response cutters instead of the requested four for FY2017. Additionally, the House committee suggested $95 million more than requested for a 14th HC-130J long-range surveillance aircraft. The Senate did not recommend funding for the 14th plane due to decreased sea ice leading to increased maritime activity in the Arctic. Increased maritime activity in the Arctic is primarily focused on the Northern Sea Route along Russia's north coast, with less viability for large commercial vessels in the Northwest Passage due to shallow and narrow straits. Cruise vessel excursions have also increased in the Northwest Passage. Before the recent fall in oil prices, there was exploratory oil drilling off Alaska's North Coast. The Coast Guard was directed to provide a report on its oil spill response and search-and-rescue capabilities in the Arctic. The Coast Guard is making progress in acquiring a heavy polar icebreaker, with the House Committee recommending $38 million and the Senate Committee recommending $14 million, compared to the $148 million requested. The funding is for hiring acquisition staff and specifying equipment needs for a vessel expected to cost around $1 billion. The United States has established a 200-mile perimeter from its coastlines for reducing emissions from maritime vessels. Ships must use cleaner-burning fuel in a designated zone since January 1, 2015, enforced by the Coast Guard. Concerns arise over uniform enforcement due to higher costs. Committees request information on ECA enforcement actions, fuel availability reports, waivers granted, and potential economic impacts on coastal oil shipments. The drop in world fuel prices has lessened the economic impact of ECA. The recent drop in world fuel prices has lessened the economic impact of ECA requirements for ships. However, additional emission caps pending in 2020 or 2025 could have a more significant impact on shipping costs. Some ships have experienced loss of propulsion (LOP) when switching to cleaner fuel at sea, possibly due to thermal shock from the temperature difference between the fuels. The Coast Guard issued a safety alert about LOP incidents associated with fuel changeover processes and procedures. The Houston Pilots Association attributes a 2015 collision to a switch to low-sulfur fuel causing loss of speed. The Coast Guard's primary function is maintaining aids to navigation, including buoys and beacons. They service about 134 buoys and fixed aids daily. The Administration requested $1.3 billion for the ATON mission in FY2017. In FY2017, the Administration requested $1.3 billion for the ATON mission, which is about 16% of the agency's discretionary budget. A bill (H.R. 5531) has been introduced to allow the Coast Guard to reimburse nonfederal entities for constructing ATONs. Additionally, in FY2016, Congress provided an extra $12 million for the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) aboard national. The President's request for the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) on national security cutters has garnered interest from Congress. The Coast Guard is exploring the potential efficiencies of using UAS for various missions, including testing smaller and larger UAS for surveillance. In April 2015, the Coast Guard announced testing UAS in the Arctic for tasks like ice surveying and search and rescue. The Senate Committee recommended $18 million for testing ultra-long endurance UAS. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has two main missions - protection of important individuals and criminal investigations. Protection includes safeguarding Presidents, Vice Presidents, foreign visitors, and securing key locations. Criminal investigations focus on financial crimes, identity theft, and cyber attacks. The USSS utilizes Electronic Crimes Task Forces and Financial Crimes Task Forces to enhance their investigative work. The USSS enhances its work through Electronic Crimes Task Forces and Financial Crimes Task Forces, combining resources to combat threats to financial payment systems and critical infrastructures. They view protection and investigation as an integrated mission set, relying on partnerships from domestic and international field offices. The backbone of the Secret Service includes a network of domestic and international investigative offices. The Secret Service has 21 international Resident investigative offices that investigate financial crimes, cybercrime, and protective intelligence cases. Special agents provide surge capacity for protection missions. The Administration requested nearly $1.9 billion for USSS in FY2017, $42 million less than FY2016. Senate Appropriations Committee-supported the requested budget but recommended shifting $15 million from protection to investigative operations. The House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 allocated over $1.9 billion for USSS in FY2017, $41 million more than requested by the Administration. This funding includes support for the 2016 Presidential Campaign costs, upgrades for USSS radio systems, and the Operational Mission Support Initiative aimed at enhancing protection from threats. The Senate committee-reported bill proposed a similar funding level, with a recommendation to shift $15 million from protection to investigative operations. The House report supports funding requests for campaign costs, USSS radio system upgrades, and OMS. It notes higher funding levels in many areas but does not specify funding for 2016 campaign costs, radio system upgrades, or OMS. The Senate Appropriations Committee report expresses concerns about underfunding permanent change of station costs for USSS personnel. The House Appropriations Committee report recommends additional funding for the USSS to address recruitment and hiring challenges, including funding for permanent change of station moves and temporary reemployment of retired agents. The report anticipates a surge in newly trained personnel and a need for overtime hours in the coming fiscal year. Overall personnel funding is reduced by nearly $14 million in anticipation of slower hiring. The House and Senate bills, H.R. 5634 and S. 3001, aim to increase overtime pay for U.S. Secret Service agents for specific calendar years. They also provide new pay authority for subsistence expenses for agents unable to return home due to severe weather or events. The Senate committee requires a briefing on the use and cost of this authority within 180 days of enactment."
