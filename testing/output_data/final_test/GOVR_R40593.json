    "content": "Costa Rica, a politically stable country in Central America with a population of 4.3 million, gained independence from Spain in 1821. It has had continuous civilian democratic rule since a civil war in 1948, leading to the abolition of the military and the establishment of a welfare state. In recent decades, Costa Rica has shifted to market-oriented economic policies to attract foreign investment and diversify its economy. The World Bank now classifies Costa Rica as an upper-middle-income country. Costa Rica has transitioned to a market-oriented economy and is now classified as an upper-middle-income country by the World Bank. Public disillusionment with politics has grown due to corruption scandals involving former presidents, leading to increased voter abstention and a fragmentation of the political party system. The traditional ruling parties have been affected, with newer parties like the Libertarian Movement and Citizen Action Party gaining prominence. Oscar Arias, a former president and Nobel laureate, was elected president in February. Oscar Arias, former president and Nobel laureate, was elected president in February 2006, winning 41% of the vote. He has pursued market-oriented economic policies and maintained cross-party alliances in the National Assembly. President Arias has continued the market-friendly economic policies of previous Costa Rican administrations. Between 2006 and 2008, Costa Rica experienced significant economic growth, with export earnings and foreign direct investment (FDI) increasing substantially. President Arias focused on high-tech sectors, with products like integrated circuits and medical equipment accounting for a large portion of exports. He also pursued free trade agreements, including CAFTA-DR and agreements with Panama, China, and Singapore. Ongoing negotiations with the European Union are also in progress. President Arias of Costa Rica is engaged in FTA talks with the European Union and other Central American nations. He has implemented social welfare programs, doubled welfare pensions, increased healthcare services, and education funding. Arias introduced Avancemos, a cash transfer program for poor students, modeled after successful programs in Latin America. Costa Rica invests 17.3% of its gross domestic product in these initiatives. Costa Rica invests 17.3% of its GDP in public health, education, and social welfare, leading to a high standard of living. Despite recent economic challenges, such as the global financial crisis, Costa Rica still maintains the highest level of human development in Central America. Costa Rica's economy faced challenges with declining investment, export demand, and tourism, leading to a rise in poverty and unemployment rates. President Arias implemented a $2.5 billion economic stimulus plan called Plan Escudo to counter the downturn. The plan includes measures like recapitalizing state banks, supporting small businesses, and investing in infrastructure. Analysts predict a GDP growth of 3.3% in 2010, indicating signs of recovery. President Arias has pursued an active foreign policy, establishing diplomatic ties with China, Palestinians, and Cuba. He aims to reassume a leadership role in Latin America, offering to mediate in the Honduran crisis. Former President Arias offered to mediate in the Honduran crisis, proposing the \"San Jos\u00e9 Accord\" which aimed to end the political crisis but failed to restore Zelaya to office. Arias emphasized the need for Latin American countries to prioritize economic development and democratic institutions over military expenditures. In the 2010 Costa Rican elections, Laura Chinchilla of the ruling PLN was elected president with 46.9% of the vote, avoiding a second-round runoff. In the 2010 Costa Rican elections, Laura Chinchilla of the ruling PLN won the presidency with 46.9% of the vote, avoiding a second-round runoff. Chinchilla easily defeated her competitors Ott\u00f3n Sol\u00eds of the PAC and Otto Guevara of the ML. The PLN won a plurality in legislative elections with 23 seats, while the PAC became the principal opposition party with 12 seats. Analysts attribute Chinchilla's victory to the fragmentation of Costa Rica's political party system. Chinchilla won the 2010 Costa Rican elections with over 20 points despite a decline in public support for the Arias Administration. She is expected to continue the Administration's policies, focusing on market-oriented economic policies, free trade agreements, and social welfare programs. Chinchilla's campaign emphasized improving public security through increasing the police force, supporting victims and witnesses, and boosting government security spending. Analysts anticipate her to implement policies aligned with President Arias' goal for Costa Rica. Chinchilla is expected to implement policies to make Costa Rica carbon neutral by 2021 and take socially conservative stands on issues like abortion and homosexual marriage. The National Assembly's composition will pose challenges, with the PLN controlling only 23 of 57 seats, requiring cross-party alliances for legislation. Legislative progress may be slowed by appeals to the Supreme Court. Previous administrations have tried to address deforestation and environmental degradation from logging and agriculture. Costa Rica has made significant efforts to restore its environment after deforestation and environmental degradation caused by logging and agriculture. The country is recognized as a world leader in environmental protection and has played a key role in global environmental policies. However, there are still environmental problems that need to be addressed. Costa Rica's emphasis on environmental protection is relatively recent, with a significant decrease in forest cover from 75% in the 1940s to 21% in 1987 due to logging and agricultural expansion. Costa Rica has implemented various conservation programs, including the National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC), which protects over 26% of the country's land and 16.5% of its waters. The government has also imposed a 3.5% \"carbon tax\" on fossil fuels since 1997, with funds directed to the \"Payment for Environmental Services\" (PSA) program, which pays property owners for sustainable development and forest conservation. 11% of Costa Rica's national territory is protected by this program. Costa Rica's environmental policies have been successful, with 11% of the country's territory protected for forest conservation. The government imposes a water pollution tax to penalize polluters and generates 76% of its energy from renewable sources. President Arias opposes oil exploitation to promote alternative energies. The country has seen an increase in forest coverage since 1997. Costa Rica has seen a significant increase in forest coverage since 1997, with over 50% of its territory now covered by forests. This expansion has provided crucial habitat for the country's diverse plant and animal species. Additionally, Costa Rica's environmental protection efforts have led to economic growth, making it a top destination for ecotourism. The country's success in environmental policies has also allowed it to play a significant role in global environmental discussions. Costa Rica's success in environmental policies has led to economic growth and made it a top destination for ecotourism. Former President Arias proposed that developed nations, responsible for environmental damage, should cut carbon emissions by 45%. Costa Rica aims to be carbon-neutral by 2021 and export its successful environmental policies to other developing nations. Despite achievements, there are still environmental challenges to address. Costa Rica lacks adequate protection for coastal and marine biological diversity, with less than 10% of important areas currently protected. Environmental problems include water pollution, overexploitation of marine resources, and a decline in reforestation. The country has led Latin America in per capita importation of ozone depleting substances since 2004. Relations with the United States have been strong, but were strained slightly by U.S. intervention in Central America during the 1980s. President Arias of Costa Rica won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for crafting a peace plan in Central America. Relations with the United States were strained over U.S. intervention in the region and the Iraq war. Despite these tensions, current relations between the two countries are friendly. Costa Rica implemented CAFTA-DR in January 2009, strengthening its trade relationship with the United States. Vice President Biden visited Costa Rica, recognizing it as a strategic partner. President Arias criticized anti-Americanism in Latin America and mediated the political crisis in Honduras. U.S. assistance to Costa Rica may increase due to the \"M\u00e9rida Initiative.\" The Peace Corps has been active in Costa Rica since 1963 and has been a significant source of U.S. assistance. Costa Rica has also received aid through various U.S. programs like INCLE, IMET, and FMF. In recent years, Costa Rica received $364,000 in U.S. assistance in FY2009, with an increase to $705,000 in FY2010 and a request for $750,000 in FY2011. Additionally, Costa Rica signed a large debt-for-nature swap with the U.S. government in 2007. Costa Rica's debt payments were reduced by $26 million over 16 years through an agreement with the U.S. government. The funds were used to support grants for organizations protecting tropical forests. The U.S. government, Conservation International, and the Nature Conservancy contributed a total of $15.1 million. Crime and violence have increased in Costa Rica in recent years due to drug cartels operating in Central America. The murder rate nearly doubled from 2004 to 2008, reaching 11 per 100,000 residents. The surge in organized crime in Costa Rica has led to a significant security challenge for the government. The US and Mexico introduced the M\u00e9rida Initiative to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Central America, with funding allocated through various acts. Costa Rica received $1.1 million in M\u00e9rida/CARSI funds in June 2009 to improve security initiatives, including the Central American Fingerprint Exchange, policing equipment, prison management, maritime interdiction, and border assistance. President Arias praised the initiative but stated that U.S. funding is insufficient. Costa Rica receives IMET assistance to train public security forces for counterdrug and military operations. Costa Rica received IMET assistance to improve its counterdrug, rule of law, and military operations capabilities. The country was previously prohibited from receiving IMET funds due to its refusal to sign an Article 98 agreement exempting U.S. personnel from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. However, in FY2007, Costa Rica began receiving IMET funds again after President Bush waived the restrictions. In January 2009, Security Minister Janina del Vecchio announced that Costa Rica would send police officers to WHINSEC in Fort Benning, GA. The decision to resume training at WHINSEC in Fort Benning, GA, came just a year and a half after Costa Rica announced its withdrawal of students from the school. WHINSEC has trained military and police personnel from Latin America, including Costa Ricans, but has faced criticism for human rights abuses by some graduates. Supporters argue that the school promotes democratic values and fosters partnerships for effective combined operations. The Latin American Military Training Review Act (H.R. 2567, McGovern) aims to suspend operations at WHINSEC, establish a task force to assess appropriate training for Latin American militaries, and investigate activities at WHINSEC and its predecessor. Additionally, the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) was signed in August 2004, liberalizing trade in goods, services, government procurement, intellectual property, and investment. The CAFTA-DR agreement, signed in August 2004, liberalizes trade in goods, services, government procurement, intellectual property, and investment. It provides duty-free status to some goods immediately and phases out tariffs on others over five to twenty years. Each country defines its own market access schedule with the United States under the agreement. The CAFTA-DR agreement was signed in August 2004 to liberalize trade. In Costa Rica, a referendum was held in October 2007 to ratify the agreement, reflecting polarization among the electorate. Trade unions, students, and social movements opposed it, while business groups and other political parties supported it. President Arias requested the referendum after facing opposition from PAC deputies. Just before the referendum, Costa Rica's Second Vice President resigned for linking anti-CAFTA-DR forces to Castro and Ch\u00e1vez. US officials warned against voting no, stating trade preferences could be lost. 51.6% voted in favor of CAFTA-DR, with turnout exceeding the required minimum. The approval led to the need for 13 laws to implement the agreement. Costa Rica had to pass 13 laws to implement the CAFTA-DR agreement, including reforms in intellectual property laws, insurance, telecommunications, criminal code, anti-corruption, and protection of foreign firms' agents. The process was slowed down by the country's consensus-seeking tradition and challenges to the constitutionality of the legislation. By the original deadline in February 2008, only five reforms were passed. After a ruling that the intellectual property legislation was unconstitutional, Costa Rica obtained extensions and eventually passed all necessary laws. Costa Rica implemented CAFTA-DR on January 1, 2009, after passing necessary reforms. Despite the global financial crisis, U.S. trade with Costa Rica increased by over 7% in 2009, with U.S. exports amounting to $4.7 billion and imports to $5.6 billion. Electrical machinery, heavy machinery, and oil were major exports, while machinery parts, medical instruments, and fruit were major imports."
