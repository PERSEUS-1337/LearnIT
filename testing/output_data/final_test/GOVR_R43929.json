    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was last amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Congress has not reauthorized the ESEA, but programs continue to receive annual appropriations. The House Education and the Workforce Committee considered the Student Success Act (H.R. 5) to reauthorize the ESEA, including a new option for distributing funds under Title I-A to local educational agencies and schools. Under current law, Title I, Part A of the ESEA provides federal aid to LEAs for the education of disadvantaged children. Title I-A grants offer educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. It is the largest program under the ESEA, funded at $14.4 billion for FY2015. Annual funds are allocated through four different formulas. For FY2015, Title I-A funds are allocated through four formulas - Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). Maximum grants are calculated based on population and expenditure factors, with adjustments made to match available appropriations. Only LEAs meeting specific criteria can receive grants. The primary factors in all formulas are the population factor. The primary factors used in Title I-A funding formulas are the population factor (based on eligible child count) and expenditure factor. Children in poor families make up 97% of the formula child count, with data sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau. LEAs must have at least 10 formula children to receive Basic Grants. To receive funding under Basic Grants, an LEA must meet specific criteria regarding the number and percentage of formula children in the district. The percentage of formula children is calculated by dividing the number of formula children by the total number of children ages 5 to 17 in the LEA. The expenditure factor for Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants is based on the state's APPE for public K-12 education. The EFIG formula for Title I-A funding includes a state APPE subject to narrow bounds, with weighting schemes to aid LEAs with high numbers of eligible children. LEAs with high poverty rates receive the highest grants per child counted. The EFIG formula for Title I-A funding considers rates and numbers of children in poor families to determine grants per child. It includes an effort factor based on education expenditure compared to income, and an equity factor based on expenditure variations among LEAs. Each formula has a hold-harmless provision to ensure a minimum grant amount for LEAs. State education agencies make adjustments before finalizing the grant amounts for each LEA. The adjustments to the total amount of Title I-A grants to LEAs include reservations for school improvement grants, state administration, academic achievement awards, funds for eligible charter schools, and optional alternative methods used by states. Title I-A funds are allocated to individual schools with LEAs having discretion over a portion of the grants. Schools are selected based on the percentage of students from low-income families, with a minimum threshold set by the LEA. States can use alternative methods to reallocate grants among small LEAs. Title I-A funds are allocated to schools based on the percentage of students from low-income families, with LEAs having the option to set higher eligibility thresholds. Funds are distributed proportionally to the number of low-income students. Data used for student eligibility differs from that used for state and LEA allocations due to lack of information on school-age children below the poverty threshold. LEAs must use proxies like free/reduced-price school lunches, TANF, or Medicaid to determine low-income status for Title I-A funds allocation. Free/reduced-price school lunch data is commonly used at the school level. Income eligibility thresholds for lunches are higher than poverty levels used for allocation. The allocation of Title I-A funds is based on the percentage of students from low-income families in schools, with priority given to schools with the highest poverty levels. Funds are distributed among schools proportionally to the number of low-income students, ensuring that all schools with 75% or more low-income students receive grants. Grants per student from a low-income family may vary among eligible schools. LEAs have the flexibility to select specific grade levels for grant eligibility as long as the criteria are met. LEAs have the flexibility to allocate Title I-A funds based on the percentage of low-income students in schools. Schools with higher poverty levels receive priority, with grants per low-income student varying. If a school serves 40% or more low-income students, it can implement a schoolwide Title I-A program to benefit all students. Title I-A funds can be used to improve school performance for all students through professional development, technology upgrades, and new curricula. The targeted assistance program (TAP) focuses on the lowest-achieving students, providing extra support such as after-school programs or teacher's aides. States have the option to reallocate Title I-A funds earned by LEAs. The state has the option to reallocate Title I-A funds earned by LEAs based on each LEA's share of enrolled eligible children from low-income families. This new formula would distribute funds to individual public schools based on each school's share of enrolled eligible children, following a low-income child to any public school they attend. However, this approach eliminates various factors used under current law to determine LEA grants. The state option in H.R. 5 eliminates provisions targeting funds to LEAs with concentrations of formula children and hold harmless provisions capping fund losses. Data needed to estimate eligible children for LEA grants is not readily available, creating potential administrative burdens. Under the state option in H.R. 5, equitable participation requirements for private school students with Title I-A funds would no longer apply. LEAs would no longer decide which schools receive funds or provide higher grants to schools with more low-income families. Schools would only need to enroll one child from a low-income family to receive funds, and current requirements for schools with high poverty concentrations would no longer apply. Once funds reach the school level, schools can choose between a schoolwide program or targeted assistance. Under H.R. 5, all schools would be eligible to operate a schoolwide program using Title I-A funds based on a measure of poverty. Schools can choose to use the funds to serve students beyond those from low-income families, and students transferring schools may or may not continue to receive Title I-A services. Under H.R. 5, Title I-A funds would now follow the child to any school, allowing schools to use the funds based on academic need. Schools not currently receiving Title I-A funds could start receiving grants under the state option, with potential new requirements. All schools with even one low-income student would receive Title I-A funds. This section of the report discusses estimated grants under the state option. The analysis discusses the methodology used to examine how grants would be concentrated by poverty under the state option compared with current law. It also looks at estimated grant amounts per child in poverty and LEA grants for selected states. The analysis is based on SAIPE data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The analysis is based on SAIPE data from the U.S. Census Bureau for calendar year 2013 to determine FY2015 Title I-A grants. Data on delinquent students in Part D-2 LEAs were used as a proxy for poverty numbers. The state option relies on child poverty count to provide grants to LEAs, eliminating various factors used under current law. The state option for Title I-A grants relies on child poverty count to allocate funds to LEAs, removing current provisions targeting funds to specific LEAs based on concentrations of formula children. Eligibility requirements for LEAs include the number and percentage of formula children. Estimated grant amounts for FY2015 were calculated by ED and CRS using the most current data available. The analysis assumes that FY2015 Title I-A grants were calculated using FY2014 data when current data was unavailable. The state option would change how funds are allocated to LEAs based on child poverty count, nullifying provisions targeting funds to specific LEAs. This would impact how funds are distributed to schools with concentrations of formula children. The state option would alter the allocation of funds to LEAs based on child poverty count, affecting the distribution of funds to schools with concentrations of formula children. This change would increase funds to LEAs with lower concentrations of formula children compared to current law. The Targeted and EFIG formulas aim to provide more funding per formula child to LEAs with higher numbers or percentages of formula children. The state option would change how funds are allocated to LEAs based on child poverty count, resulting in a proportional distribution of Title I-A funding to LEAs in each state. This would eliminate the targeting of funds to individual LEAs with higher concentrations of eligible children. Figures 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the estimated grants per child in poverty for LEAs in Ohio, Washington, and New Jersey under the state option. The state option would change how funds are allocated to LEAs based on child poverty count, resulting in a proportional distribution of Title I-A funding to LEAs in each state. Figures show the estimated grants per child in poverty for LEAs under both current law and the state option, indicating a trend where higher poverty levels result in higher grant amounts per child. The state option would alter funding allocation based on child poverty count, leading to a proportional distribution of Title I-A funds to LEAs. Higher poverty levels would result in higher grant amounts per child under current law. Tables compare estimated LEA grants under the state option and current law for the 25 LEAs with the highest number and percentage of formula children, showing most would lose funding under the state option. LEAs with a formula child total of 36% or higher would typically lose funding, except for those that previously did not meet eligibility requirements under current law. The state option would change funding allocation based on child poverty count, resulting in a proportional distribution of Title I-A funds to LEAs. Higher poverty levels would lead to higher grant amounts per child under current law. However, many LEAs with relatively high numbers of formula children would lose funds under the state option, even though some with lower percentages of formula children may also see a decrease in grants. The allocation of funds under the state option may not be as straightforward as under current law, as it is based on SAIPE data and the number of children living in poverty in each LEA. This could result in varying grant amounts for different LEAs compared to what they would receive under current law. Under the state option, an LEA's final grant would be calculated without hold harmless provisions, allowing for a shift in funding based on child poverty count. This could result in some LEAs losing funds, like the Los Angeles Unified School District, which would see a 22.91% decrease in their grant. However, these funds would be redistributed to other LEAs. Under the state option, LEAs could benefit from funds intended for other LEAs based on current law. For example, Loudon County Public Schools would gain about $2 million due to the elimination of eligibility requirements. If a state chose to implement the state option, there would be substantial changes in grant amounts. If a state chooses to implement the state option, there would be significant changes in grant amounts at the LEA level. The fluctuations in grant amounts may not be as substantial if the state continues to use the state option in subsequent years. However, switching back and forth between the state option and current law provisions could lead to disruptive changes in LEA grant amounts. The state option allows LEAs or schools to receive Title I-A funds as long as they enroll at least one eligible child, unlike current law which can create uncertainty from year to year. LEAs have discretion to provide funding to schools for an additional fiscal year if they do not meet requirements. ED calculates grants based on prior-year amounts under current law. Under current law, ED uses the prior-year grant amount to determine current-year grants without considering adjustments made by states."
