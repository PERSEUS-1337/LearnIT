    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section's title and its findings. The Act is titled the \"Medicare Cancer Patient Database and Coverage Act of 2009\" and highlights the need for quality healthcare for cancer patients, especially those without insurance. Over 1.4 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer each year, and more than 11 million are living with cancer. Active monitoring and follow-up care are crucial for cancer survivors. More than 10 percent of cancer patients are uninsured, with higher rates among minority populations. Uninsured patients receive less cancer care, leading to delays in screening and diagnosis at advanced stages. Young adults with cancer have worse outcomes due to lack of insurance. Medicare covers over half of all cancer patients, highlighting the importance of insurance in cancer care. Medicare provides quality care to over half of all cancer patients, eliminating financial barriers and ensuring access to care, better outcomes, and protection from out-of-pocket expenses. Enrolling all diagnosed with cancer in Medicare could guarantee these benefits. SEC. 2. IMPROVING CANCER DATABASE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will update databases with data on individuals with cancer in the US to track the number, types, stages of cancer, and treatment efficacy. The database will monitor a person's cancer journey from diagnosis to treatment outcomes. Additional funding will be provided for research and treatment of cancer based on the database information. The database aims to improve cancer research and treatment by providing physicians with timely information on outcomes to enhance quality care. MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR UNINSURED CANCER PATIENTS: A new section is added to Title II of the Social Security Act, providing special provisions for Medicare coverage for uninsured, initial cancer patients. New section added to Title II of the Social Security Act provides Medicare coverage for uninsured individuals with initial cancer, who are lawfully residing in the US, under age 65, not covered by creditable coverage, and have filed an application for benefits. Entitlement begins the month following the cancer diagnosis. The new section in the Social Security Act provides Medicare coverage for uninsured individuals with initial cancer, under age 65, not covered by creditable coverage, and have filed an application for benefits. Entitlement begins the month following the cancer diagnosis and ends when the individual becomes entitled to benefits under part A of title XVIII or is covered under creditable coverage. Procedures are in place to prevent delays in enrolling eligible individuals with cancer. The Secretary will develop educational practices to ensure enrollees meet criteria, implement post-enrollment procedures, and prevent benefits misuse. Excludes basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma from the definition of cancer. The amendment defines creditable coverage as per the Public Health Service Act and will apply to benefits six months after the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will promote early cancer detection through educational campaigns, encouraging individuals to undergo testing as recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force."
