    "content": "The traditional principles of international law grant nations the power to exclude aliens and property, but this power is often not fully exercised for the benefit of commerce. Some nations incorporate restraints into their domestic laws, such as Clause XXX of the Magna Carta which ensures safe conduct for merchants in England. The Magna Carta includes Clause XXX to ensure safe conduct for merchants in England. Treaties and agreements have restricted foreign persons and property, with the United States accepting such restraints. The American colonies were established to generate profits for investors, and after the War of Independence, the government settled foreign claims to maintain creditworthiness and attract foreign investment, as seen in the Jay Treaty. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the United States government compensated the British for seized property and unpaid debts from the Revolution. Alexander Hamilton advocated for foreign investment in his 1791 Report on Manufactures, emphasizing its importance for national development. Foreign capital played a significant role in building the nation's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, canals, banks, and railroads. Foreign capital played a crucial role in the United States' development during the 18th and 19th centuries. State bonds sold overseas financed the nation's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, canals, banks, and railroads. Anglo-American banking houses in London, led by Baring Brothers, specialized in American finance and facilitated investments. By the mid-19th century, foreigners held a significant portion of federal, state, and municipal debts, with the California Gold Rush further increasing foreign investment. American real estate was also popular among foreign investors. Foreign investors, including Europeans, acquired substantial holdings in American real estate in states like New York, Maine, Florida, West Virginia, and Iowa. Some titled Europeans attempted to create baronial estates in the West. Foreign oil companies, such as Royal Dutch Shell, started buying American properties with the rise of the automobile and oil industry. However, World War I led to a decrease in foreign capital influx as European creditor countries sold their American holdings to fund wartime needs. This shift transformed the United States from a debtor to a creditor nation. Throughout history, the United States has faced criticism of foreign investment, with various restrictions put in place. Despite this, foreign investment in the US increased significantly in the early 1970s, leading to ongoing debates in Congress about imposing more restrictions on foreign citizens investing in American businesses. The debate revolves around whether there should be more restrictions on foreign investment in American businesses. Federal constitutional provisions may validate federal statutes restricting investments by foreigners, while states must adhere to other constitutional provisions when imposing additional restrictions. The federal government's limited powers do not explicitly permit the regulation of foreign investment, so other federal powers like immigration, commerce regulation, and national defense must justify such regulation. Congress has exclusive power over naturalization, citizenship requirements, and admitting/expelling aliens. The United States government has the power to exclude aliens from its territory, which is essential for its independence and security. Congress can regulate the conduct of alien residents and set conditions for their admission and residency. Congress has the power to set conditions for the admission and residency of aliens, including restricting foreign investments in the United States. This is supported by Congress's exclusive power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and raise and support armies, which could be used to limit foreign investment if it impairs national preparedness. The Supreme Court has ruled that foreign investments could impair national preparedness, potentially justifying a prohibition on such investments. Additionally, the federal government holds exclusive authority over foreign relations. In the case of Zschernig v. Miller, the Court deemed unconstitutional an Oregon statute that required the escheat of property to the state if it would pass to a nonresident alien without reciprocal rights for U.S. citizens in the foreign nation. The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Zschernig v. Miller that an Oregon statute requiring property escheat to the state for nonresident aliens was unconstitutional as it infringed on federal authority over foreign relations. Imposing significant investment controls could violate bilateral treaties regulating trade and investment relations. Foreign investment statutes must consider Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation Treaties, such as NAFTA, which provide opportunities for foreign investors. Constitutional provisions, like the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, may protect foreigners from actions by state and local governments. The Fourteenth Amendment protects persons, not just citizens, from state laws that discriminate based on citizenship. The Supreme Court has ruled that laws solely based on citizenship are suspect and subject to strict scrutiny. For example, in Graham v. Richardson, laws denying welfare benefits to resident aliens were deemed unconstitutional for violating equal protection principles. States have discretion in classification as long as it has a reasonable basis. The Supreme Court has established that classifications based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny. Aliens as a class are considered a \"discrete and insular\" minority deserving of heightened judicial solicitude. In the case of Takahashi, the Court emphasized that states must be cautious in applying laws exclusively to aliens. This was exemplified in a case challenging a California statute that restricted commercial fishing licenses to non-citizens, which the Court found to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has ruled that classifications based on alienage are subject to strict scrutiny. While citizenship has been rejected as a legitimate basis for certain classifications, exceptions exist in cases involving essential state functions. State laws restricting investments by resident aliens may come under strict judicial scrutiny, while the federal government has broad authority over naturalization and immigration. The responsibility for regulating the relationship with alien visitors is entrusted to the political branches of the Federal Government due to implications on foreign relations and changing circumstances. The Supreme Court has held that decisions regarding aliens can be more appropriate for the Legislature or Executive than the Judiciary. Congress has virtually absolute power to exclude aliens from the United States and prescribe entry conditions. Federal statutes impact foreign investment through information-gathering rather than restriction. The International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act of 1976 gives the President authority to collect information on international investment and foreign trade. The President has the authority to collect information on international investment and foreign trade, including direct investments owned by foreign governments or persons. Responsibility for studying direct investment is delegated to the Commerce Department, while portfolio investment is handled by the Treasury Department. The President is required to conduct a benchmark survey of foreign direct investment in the United States every five years. Amendments in 1990 direct the President to publish periodic information on foreign investment for the general public and federal agencies. The 1990 Amendments require the President to provide periodic information on foreign investment to the general public and federal agencies. This includes details on ownership of US business enterprises by foreign governments or persons, as well as foreign direct investment in specific industries. Another federal statute, the Foreign Direct Investment and International Financial Data Improvements Act of 1990, also impacts foreign investment in the US. The Financial Data Improvements Act of 1990 allows the Bureau of Economic Analysis access to information collected by the Census to enhance the accuracy of reports on foreign direct investment in the US. This act requires the Census to exchange relevant information with the Department of Commerce to improve data quality. The Data Improvements Act of 1990 mandates reports to be prepared by the Secretary of Commerce and the Comptroller General under the Survey Act. The Bureau of the Census can share business data with the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics if needed for statistical purposes. The Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 requires foreign individuals acquiring agricultural land to report to the Secretary of Agriculture within 90 days. The Domestic and Foreign Investment Improved Disclosure Act of 1977 requires foreign investors acquiring 5% or more equity securities to disclose specified information to improve federal monitoring of foreign investment in the US. The federal government has the ability to monitor foreign investment in the United States through various statutes that focus on industries affecting national security.

Foreign investment in the aircraft industry is restricted by statutory limitations. Only vessels owned by US citizens, entities with US citizen members, or US government entities are eligible for documentation under US laws. Foreign investment in the aircraft industry is restricted by statutory limitations. Aircraft must be registered to operate, with eligibility criteria including ownership by US citizens, lawful permanent residents, US government entities, or certain corporations. Foreign aircraft can be operated in the United States by airmen with valid US or foreign licenses, subject to restrictions based on citizenship. Operating an aircraft without an airman is unlawful. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may restrict issuing an airman certificate to an alien based on citizenship. The Secretary of Transportation can provide insurance against aircraft operation risks, with citizenship requirements being important for obtaining this insurance. Valuable mineral deposits in US lands can only be purchased by US citizens or those intending to become citizens. Ownership of valuable mineral deposits in US lands is restricted to United States citizens, associations, or corporations organized under US laws. Non-US citizens are not eligible for such ownership due to restrictions based on citizenship. Foreign citizens or corporations are prohibited from owning interests in mineral leases on US lands. Only US citizens, resident aliens, and domestic corporations can obtain leases for oil, natural gas, and other mineral deposits. Licenses for power development on federal lands and water can only be issued to US citizens and domestic corporations. Foreign citizens or corporations cannot acquire licenses for nuclear facilities. Federal restrictions on ownership appear limited. Federal restrictions on foreign ownership of land in the United States are in place. The Homestead Act and Desert Land Act required American citizenship for land claims. The Secretary of the Interior mandates citizenship for grazing permits on public lands. The Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act requires foreigners to disclose land purchases. Public lands improved with reclamation project funds can only be sold to US citizens. Foreign ownership and operation of mass communications media are also restricted by federal statutes. Restrictions on foreign ownership and operation of mass communications media in the United States are in place. Radio station licenses are not granted to foreign governments or their representatives. Broadcast or carrier licenses are also not granted to aliens or corporations with significant foreign ownership. The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires agents of foreign principals to register with the Attorney General of the United States and label informational materials for or in the interests of a foreign principal.

Exemptions include US-based news organizations with majority US ownership and citizenship among officers and directors. The Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) regulates companies that control US banks, defined by ownership of voting securities, control of directors, or influencing management. Administered by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). The Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) regulates companies that control US banks by ownership of voting securities. The Act requires approval from the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) for any company seeking to become a Bank Holding Company (BHC) or acquire a 5% share or more of a bank or BHC. BHCA imposes activity restrictions on BHCs, confining their portfolios to banking and financial services. The Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) restricts companies controlling US banks to banking and financial services. Permissible activities are outlined in Section 4(k) of the BHCA and 12 C.F.R. Section 225.28 for non-banking activities. Financial Holding Companies under Section 4(l)(1) have additional permissible activities listed in 12 C.F.R. Section 225.86. The FRB can also approve activities closely related to banking. The Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) restricts companies controlling US banks to banking and financial services. Section 2(h)(2) of the BHCA allows foreign companies acquiring stock of a U.S. bank or BHC to be exempt from activities restrictions if certain conditions are met. The Federal Reserve Board can also provide exemptions under certain circumstances and conditions. Corporations controlled by foreign citizens can do business with the federal government like domestic corporations. Some federal statutes require products purchased by federal agencies to be made in the US. Only US-mined or produced materials can be acquired for public use. The federal government requires that materials for public use must be mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, with some exceptions allowed under certain circumstances. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 grants the President the authority to waive restrictions on products from trading partners, but small business and minority preferences are not waived. Additionally, entities controlled by foreign governments are prohibited from merging with or acquiring companies engaged in interstate commerce in the US. The federal government prohibits entities controlled by foreign governments from merging with or acquiring US companies engaged in interstate commerce, especially those with Department of Defense or Department of Energy contracts exceeding $500 million. This restriction does not apply if approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires registration with the SEC for investment companies operating in the US. Only US-based companies can sell their securities in interstate commerce unless exempted by the SEC. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 mandates registration for certain securities sold in interstate commerce unless issued under an indenture with trustees. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a board led by the Secretary of the Treasury that reviews \"covered transactions\" involving foreign control of US entities for potential national security concerns. Factors considered include domestic production for national defense needs. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews \"covered transactions\" for national security concerns, including domestic production for national defense needs and the control of domestic industries by foreign entities. If the acquiring party is controlled by a foreign government, a national security investigation is conducted."
