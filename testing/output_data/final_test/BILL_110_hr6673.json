    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that developing clean renewable geothermal energy on appropriate Federal lands is in the best interest of the United States. The Bureau of Land Management is authorized to issue non-competitive leases for geothermal energy production on Federal lands, focusing on development rather than speculation to avoid artificially raising costs. Developers of geothermal energy on Federal lands should be allowed to secure resources to avoid raising costs and provide increased revenue to the Federal Government through production royalties. SEC. 2. Noncompetitive leasing of adjoining areas for geothermal resource development. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to define \"industry standards\" and \"qualified geothermal professional\" in relation to geothermal resource assessment. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to define \"valid discovery\" as a geothermal resource found by a slim hole or production well with temperature measurements and permeability. Adjoining lands may be available for lease by qualified companies or individuals with legal rights to develop geothermal resources. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 allows noncompetitive lease of adjoining areas up to 640 acres at fair market value per acre for qualified companies or individuals with legal rights to develop geothermal resources, provided they have not previously received a noncompetitive lease for a valid discovery. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 allows noncompetitive lease of up to 640 acres for qualified companies or individuals with legal rights to develop geothermal resources, based on a valid discovery and submission of sufficient geological and technical data to the relevant Federal land management agency.
