    "content": "Turkmenistan has shown little progress in democratization since gaining independence in 1991. Saparamurad Niyazov ruled the country with overwhelming powers, becoming president for life in 1999. His regime was highly authoritarian, corrupt, and responsible for human rights abuses. Despite significant natural gas exports, poverty remained widespread. The United States has strategic and economic interests in Turkmenistan and must stay engaged. The United States has strategic and economic interests in Turkmenistan and must remain engaged with the country to gain critical cooperation in reducing threats to regional stability, including terrorism and illegal trafficking. Turkmenistan has supported U.S.-led coalition efforts in Afghanistan, but ties have been strained at times. Turkmenistan's ties with the U.S. were strained due to allegations of U.S. involvement in a coup attempt and criticism of human rights abuses. President Niyazov died in 2006, and Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedow became acting president. After President Niyazov's death in 2006, Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedow became the acting president of Turkmenistan. He urged calm after his arrest on vague charges, maintaining that domestic and foreign policies would remain unchanged. Measures were taken to tighten the country's isolation, including halting air and train traffic and cutting internet links. The Khalk Maslakhaty quickly changed the constitution to legitimize Berdimuhammedow's position and scheduled a presidential election for February 11, 2007. The next presidential election in Turkmenistan was scheduled for February 11, 2007. Eligibility criteria included being a citizen born in Turkmenistan aged 40-70, residing in the country for 15 years, and holding official positions or being members of selected NGOs. Six candidates were designated by the Khalk Maslakhaty, all government officials, including Berdimuhammedow. The ruling Democratic Party endorsed Berdimuhammedow as Niyazov's heir-apparent for the upcoming presidential election in Turkmenistan. The United Democratic Opposition proposed Hudayberdi Orazow as their candidate, urging citizens to write him in. Berdimuhammedow emphasized democratization and acknowledged the need for changes in education policies. Berdimuhammedow promises to improve education and healthcare, expand internet access, and reverse pension cuts. He pledges to maintain popular subsidy programs and prioritize job creation and support for small businesses. Despite expectations of an easy victory in the upcoming election, concerns remain about the lingering cult of personality from the previous leader. Berdimuhammedow acknowledges agricultural problems and pledges to make the sector profitable for both farmers and the state. He also promises to address readiness issues in security matters. The Turkmen president acknowledged readiness problems in security matters and pledged to strengthen material provisions for the national army. Concerns of corruption were raised by a report from Global Witness, alleging personal control of gas exports by the late Niyazov. Observers suggest post-Niyazov actions may signal liberalization, with citizens offered alternative choices in a presidential election for the first time in Turkmenistan's history. In a presidential election in Turkmenistan, citizens will have alternative choices, indicating a slightly more open political climate. Candidates pledge to continue the late leader's policies but also mention reforms, reflecting possible popular grievances. Gurbanov promises more support for Hajj travelers, Pomanov pledges aid for agriculture and youth activities, and Atajikov plans to give private land ownership to farmers. Observers see potential for a less isolationist and authoritarian country under Berdimuhammedow's leadership. Observers are skeptical of Berdimuhammedow's pledge to turn Turkmenistan into a democratic country, citing concerns about human rights violations and authoritarian policies. Recent arrests of activists and opposition figures raise further alarms about the lack of political freedom in the country. Observers are concerned about the potential for a new \"cult of personality\" surrounding Berdimuhammedow, who has been criticized for orchestrating a \"palace coup\" to legitimize his takeover as acting president. Some suggest he may be a figurehead ruling in tandem with Niyazov's former presidential guard. Observers are concerned about the potential for a new \"cult of personality\" surrounding Berdimuhammedow, who may be ruling in tandem with the head of Niyazov's presidential guard. The State Security Council, led by Akmurat Rejepov, is seen as the dominant force, overshadowing the legislature and presidency. The U.S. delegation, led by Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher, attended the December 24 funeral to signal interest in improved U.S.-Turkmen relations and offer assistance in reforms, without imposing a specific blueprint for Turkmenistan to follow. The United States did not provide a specific blueprint for Turkmenistan to follow in terms of reforms. Despite low expectations for a free and fair presidential election, there is hope for a more open society through proposed education and internet access reforms. The U.S. aims to support Turkmenistan in developing its oil and gas reserves in a market-oriented manner to ensure sovereignty and independence. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed interest in strengthening bilateral relations for a stable, democratic, and prosperous future. Turkmenistan's sovereignty and independence are crucial. Instability in the country could impact gas exports to Russia, affecting Europe. The EU may focus more on Turkmenistan for energy diversification. The Minister of Oil, Gas, and Mineral Resources reassured foreign customers of gas exports. Turkmenistan aims to diversify energy export routes, including proposed pipelines. Some critics have urged the Administration to push for opposition candidates in Turkmenistan's election and freeze Niyazov's assets in the US. Analysts warn that Berdimuhammedow's reforms may not be sincere, aiming for a non-democratic constitution. They also caution that Turkmenistan's role in the Global War on Terrorism could change. Turkmenistan's participation in the Global War on Terrorism may change under a more pro-Russian leadership. Niyazov had supported U.S.-led coalition operations in Afghanistan. Political instability in Turkmenistan could increase the threat of Islamic terrorism. Congress has raised concerns about Turkmenistan's poor record of democratization and human rights. The 110th Congress might consider boosting U.S. assistance if the Berdimuhammedow government pursues reforms, or debate sanctions if not. Possible sanctions or disapproval may be discussed if Turkmenistan's government fails to improve human rights and democratization efforts. Other issues include U.S.-Turkmen anti-terrorism assistance, humanitarian aid for food shortages, and the impact of regime change on Western energy security."
