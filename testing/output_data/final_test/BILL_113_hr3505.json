    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Technology, Equality and Accessibility in College and Higher Education Act\" or the \"TEACH Act\". It provides guidelines for accessible electronic instructional materials and related information technologies in institutions of higher education. The \"TEACH Act\" mandates the Access Board to develop guidelines for accessible electronic instructional materials in higher education within 18 months. The guidelines must ensure accessibility for blind and disabled individuals, aligning with existing standards. The Access Board must ensure guidelines for electronic instructional materials align with national and international accessibility standards. They must review and amend the guidelines every 3 years to reflect technological advances. Institutions of higher education using compliant electronic instructional materials and technologies are considered in compliance with non-discrimination provisions of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Noncompliant materials and technologies are addressed in a separate section. Institutions of higher education are not required to use electronic instructional materials that meet accessibility guidelines if they provide accommodations for blind and disabled individuals to access the materials equally and with ease. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of this Act. Definitions are also included. The Act defines terms such as \"blind individual\" and \"covered individual with a disability\" as individuals whose visual impairment limits their access to electronic instructional materials. The Act defines terms related to disabilities and electronic instructional materials used in higher education. The Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1003) defines \"related information technology\" as electronic platforms or systems used in higher education for accessing instructional materials, including hardware, software, and applications for manipulation and dissemination."
