Russia aims to weaken the transatlantic union by exploiting tensions within European countries. A 2016 report highlighted Russia's network of patronage to influence decision-making and gain control over state institutions and economies. Russia engages in economic warfare through politically motivated investments to advance its agenda and challenge the transatlantic orientation of Central and Eastern Europe. Countries along Russia's border are under threat from Moscow's malign influence and military aggression, with corruption being part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy to coerce and destabilize other nations. Russian-fueled corruption infiltrates countries through legitimate financial transactions, infecting strategic sectors like energy, media, and finance. This compromises institutions, allowing Russian control over governments. In France, Austria, Germany, and the UK, Russia supports entities that exploit lack of trust in democratic systems, boosting extreme parties' popularity. The United States intelligence community found that Russia used similar tactics in the 2016 elections to undermine trust in the political system. To counter this, the US should assist foreign partners in investigating corruption and enhancing fiscal transparency to strengthen governance and prevent Russian interference in democracy. The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 is amended to include a new section establishing the Office of Anti-Corruption relating to illicit Russian financial activities in Europe. The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 is amended to establish the Office of Anti-Corruption focusing on Illicit Russian Financial Activities in Europe. The Office will be headed by the Director, appointed by the Secretary of State, and will analyze Russian financial networks in European countries across various sectors. The Office of Anti-Corruption focusing on Illicit Russian Financial Activities in Europe will train US liaison officers to cooperate with foreign partners in uncovering illicit financial activities. The Office will submit an annual report on its activities to congressional committees in unclassified form. The Secretary of State is authorized to accept personnel for the Office. The Secretary of State is authorized to accept personnel on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis for carrying out specific tasks. The term 'appropriate congressional committees' refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. SEC. 4. FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MATTERS. The Secretary of State is authorized to provide assistance to European countries to combat corruption, including support for investigative journalism, media independence, anti-corruption activities, anti-propaganda efforts, and countering Russian influence in Europe. The Secretary of State will work with NATO to elevate anti-corruption measures and monitor Russian influence in member states. They are also authorized to host a summit with the European Union to prevent undeclared money flows in strategic sectors. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Director of National Intelligence must submit a National Intelligence Estimate to Congress on purchases in European countries that may lead to monopolistic control. The report will include an analysis of the individuals and entities involved, including any ties to Russia. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Treasury must submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees on the implementation of the Act. The Act defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" and \"intelligence community\" as specified in the National Security Act of 1947."
