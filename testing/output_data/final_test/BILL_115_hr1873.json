    "content": "The \"Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act\" mandates vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance on federal lands with electric transmission and distribution facilities. This includes rights-of-way for these facilities on federal lands. The \"Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act\" requires vegetation management, inspection, and maintenance for electric transmission and distribution facilities on federal lands to enhance grid reliability and reduce wildfire risks. This directive applies to existing and future rights-of-way on public lands and National Forest System lands. The \"Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act\" aims to enable facility owners to maintain operations, comply with reliability standards, and minimize the need for routine approvals for vegetation management and maintenance activities within existing electrical transmission and distribution rights-of-way. The \"Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act\" allows expedited review and approval for utility vegetation management, facility inspection, and maintenance activities near electrical transmission and distribution rights-of-way to ensure human safety and electric reliability. Owners can develop and submit vegetation management plans for facilities on designated lands. The \"Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act\" allows owners or operators of transmission and distribution facilities on Federal lands to develop and submit vegetation management plans for approval to the Secretary with jurisdiction over the lands. The plan must ensure compliance with federal, state, and local electric system reliability and fire safety requirements. The Secretaries will jointly develop a review and approval process for these plans. The \"Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act\" mandates a coordinated process for review and approval of vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plans. This process ensures timely approval within 90 days, includes timelines for agency comments, complies with the law, and minimizes costs. Amendments to plans are promptly made if conditions change. The process for reviewing and approving vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation plans includes notification of changed conditions, allowing for plan amendments, and continuing implementation of approved elements not affected by the changes. The Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture apply a categorical exclusion process. The Secretary of Agriculture will use the categorical exclusion process for plans developed under this subsection on existing transmission and distribution rights-of-way. Approved plans become part of the authorization for the covered right-of-way and adjacent hazard trees. Vegetation management plans for existing facilities must be reviewed concurrently with new facility siting. Once approved, the owner/operator only needs to notify the agency. The operator must notify the agency of planned activities for the upcoming year, certify compliance with the plan, and provide a description of the activities. The term 'vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan' refers to a long-term plan prepared by the owner or operator of electrical transmission or distribution facilities. The text chunk discusses the management of facilities and vegetation within the right-of-way and adjacent Federal lands to enhance electricity reliability, promote public safety, and avoid fire hazards. The terms 'owner' and 'operator' include contractors or other agents engaged by the owner or operator of a facility. A 'hazard tree' is defined as any tree designated as a hazard before tree failure. The text addresses the response to emergency conditions regarding vegetation or hazard trees near electric transmission or distribution lines on Federal lands. Owners or operators are allowed to prune or remove vegetation to prevent service disruption and fire risk, and must notify local agents. If vegetation on Federal lands near electrical transmission or distribution lines does not meet clearance standards, the owner or operator can conduct vegetation management activities after notifying the Secretary. The Secretary or Secretary of Agriculture must report requests and actions annually on their website. Owners or operators of transmission or distribution facilities are not liable for wildfire damage if they are not allowed to operate according to approved vegetation management plans on Federal lands. The Electric Reliability Organization standards must be followed, and the Secretary or Secretary of Agriculture must allow vegetation management activities for hazard trees near transmission or distribution facilities. Training programs for personnel involved in vegetation management decisions are encouraged. The personnel must understand electric system reliability and fire safety requirements, assist facility owners with compliance, promote voluntary vegetation management practices for wildlife habitats, and be knowledgeable about unmanned technologies. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture are required to implement regulations within one to two years to utilize unmanned technologies for vegetation management, lower energy costs, and reduce wildfire risks. Operation and Maintenance Plans.--Owners or operators are not required to submit a vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan if one has already been approved by the Secretary or Secretary of Agriculture before the enactment of this section. SEC. 3. NO LOSS OF FUNDS FOR WILD-FIRE SUPPRESSION.\n\n    This Act ensures that funds for wild-fire suppression will not be affected by the provisions or amendments made within the Act."
