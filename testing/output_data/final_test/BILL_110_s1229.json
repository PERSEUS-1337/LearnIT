    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hass Avocado Quality Assurance Act of 2007\". The purpose of the Act is outlined in the findings and purpose section. Congress finds that Hass avocados are a valuable and healthy food source enjoyed by millions for various occasions, grown domestically and abroad, and their interstate and foreign commerce impacts the overall market viability. To preserve the economic viability of the domestic Hass avocado industry, mandatory minimum maturity standards are necessary to ensure that immature avocados are not marketed, which can lead to dissatisfied customers and decreased demand for all Hass avocados. Setting mandatory minimum maturity standards for all Hass avocados is essential for maintaining, expanding, and developing markets for this variety. The purpose of this Act is to establish quality standards to ensure that immature avocados are not sold, ultimately strengthening the domestic Hass avocado industry and promoting market growth and diversification. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 is amended to include maturity requirements for Hass avocados, aiming to set quality standards and prevent the sale of immature avocados to strengthen the domestic industry and promote market growth. The Hass Avocado Quality Assurance Act of 2007 mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to establish regulations ensuring that all Hass avocados sold in the US meet minimum maturity standards. Exceptions include avocados for charitable institutions, relief agencies, and commercial processing. The Secretary may divert, export, or repack any Hass avocados that do not meet requirements. Civil penalties may be imposed on violators of the regulations. The Secretary may impose civil penalties on violators of regulations related to Hass avocados, including forfeiture of the commodity's value or fines ranging from $50 to $5,000 per violation. The Secretary is also authorized to collect fees for avocado inspections to cover associated costs, with all fees and penalties collected credited to relevant accounts. Appropriations are authorized as necessary to implement these regulations. SEC. 4. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or the amendment made by this Act is held invalid, the rest of the Act and the amendment, and their application to others, will not be affected."
