    "content": "During the first several months of 2008, lenders reduced participation in the FFEL program due to difficulties in raising capital and reductions in subsidies. Concerns arose about students facing challenges in obtaining loans, especially for those who rely on private student loans. Legislation related to federal student loans was active in the 110th Congress. The CCRAA was enacted in the 110th Congress, making changes to federal student loan programs. The House passed H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, addressing concerns about loan availability. The Senate introduced S. 2815, the Strengthening Student Aid for All Act, amending the HEA. H.R. 5715 was amended and passed by the Senate, then enacted as P.L. 110-227 on May 7, 2008. The ECASLA grants temporary authority to the Secretary of Education to purchase student loans until July 1, 2009. The HEOA, enacted later, includes amendments to provisions under the ECASLA. The Secretary's authority to purchase FFEL program loans was extended through July 1, 2010. Title IV, Part B of the Higher Education Act (HEA) and the DL program provide loans to students for postsecondary education, with $72 billion estimated to be provided in AY 2008-2009. FFEL program involves private lenders with federal guarantees, while DL program uses federal capital from the U.S. Treasury. The FFEL and DL programs provide loans for postsecondary education using different sources of capital. They offer Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Subsidized Stafford Loans are need-based, with the interest paid by the Secretary while borrowers are in school. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the Higher Education Act (HEA) to ensure the availability of federal student loans. These bills aimed to address separate issues from previous bills and included amendments to increase borrowing limits for loans under the FFEL and DL programs. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the Higher Education Act (HEA) to address issues related to federal student loans. S. 2815 and H.R. 5715 aimed to increase borrowing limits for Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, delay repayment for parent borrowers of PLUS Loans, update procedures for lender-of-last-resort loans, and authorize loan purchases. S. 2815 also proposed establishing a negative expected family contribution for need analysis to broaden student eligibility for federal aid. H.R. 5715 included language to extend PLUS Loan eligibility to individuals with adverse credit under certain circumstances. H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, was enacted as P.L. 110-227, amending the Higher Education Act by increasing borrowing limits for Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, delaying repayment for parent borrowers of PLUS Loans, and revising procedures for lender-of-last-resort loans under the FFEL program. The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 expanded eligibility for aid through AC Grants and SMART Grants, expressed Congress's support for entities to assist in ensuring access to federal student loans, and required the GAO to evaluate the impact of federal loan increases. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was tasked with evaluating the impact of federal student loan limit increases on tuition, fees, room and board, and private student loan borrowing. The report discusses amendments made to the Higher Education Act (HEA) under the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 to ensure access to federal student loans. Loan limits for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are constrained by statutory limits. Students may borrow Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, with more favorable terms for Subsidized Loans. Subsidized Loans are need-based, while Unsubsidized Loans are not. Loan limits vary by dependency status and educational level. Students can borrow up to the annual limits or their unmet financial need. Total Stafford Loans have separate limits. Aggregate loan limits determine the maximum amount students can borrow in Subsidized and total Stafford Loans based on their dependency status and educational level. Prior to the ECASLA, annual loan limits differed for dependent undergraduate students compared to independent undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Loan limits are typically set by statute, with independent students having higher total Stafford Loan limits. The ECASLA amended annual and aggregate borrowing limits for total Stafford Loans for different student categories, effective July 1, 2008. Annual total Stafford Loan limits were increased by $2,000 for undergraduate students, making them greater than Subsidized Stafford Loan limits for the first time. The ECASLA increased annual and aggregate Stafford Loan limits for undergraduate students, with higher limits for independent students and those in preparatory coursework. Aggregate limits were raised to $31,000 for dependent students and $57,500 for independent students or dependents unable to obtain a PLUS Loan. Additionally, a five-year study on the impact of these increases is required. The Comptroller General is required to conduct a five-year study on the impact of federal student loan limit increases on tuition prices and private student loan borrowing. Interim and follow-up reports will be provided to relevant committees. PLUS Loans repayment terms have changed under ECASLA, allowing for deferment under certain circumstances. The ECASLA amended the HEA to allow parent borrowers of PLUS Loans to defer repayment until six months after the dependent student ceases to carry at least a half-time workload. This amendment only applies when the borrower meets the qualifying conditions. Under the HEOA, parent borrowers of PLUS Loans can request a deferment if the student qualifies, starting from July 1, 2008. Interest accrues from the first disbursement, and borrowers can choose to pay it as it accrues or have it added to the principal balance quarterly. Borrowers must not have adverse credit history to be eligible. The Department of Education required lenders to obtain credit reports for PLUS Loan applicants and consider adverse credit history for delinquent payments or financial issues. The ECASLA amended the HEA to specify extenuating circumstances for eligible lenders. The HEA was amended to allow eligible lenders to extend PLUS Loans under certain extenuating circumstances related to delinquent payments. This provision was further amended to specify that extenuating circumstances exist if an applicant is no more than 180 days delinquent on mortgage payments for a primary residence or medical bills. Eligible borrowers have an entitlement to obtain Stafford Loans but not necessarily PLUS Loans. State guaranty agencies must establish lender-of-last-resort programs to provide loans to eligible students who have been rejected by eligible lenders. Students can borrow LLR loans after two rejections, with no additional eligibility requirements. Guaranty agencies can designate an eligible lender or act as the lender-of-last-resort themselves. LLR lenders make loans using private capital, similar to other FFEL program loans. Students must receive a response within 60 days of applying for LLR loans. The lender-of-last-resort (LLR) program provides loans to eligible students who have been rejected by lenders, with a 100% insurance percentage in case of default. Guaranty agencies can also make LLR loans using their funds. If agencies are unable to ensure loan availability, the Secretary can take actions to restore it, including emergency advances of federal funds. The Higher Education Act authorized emergency advances of federal capital funds to guaranty agencies for lender-of-last-resort (LLR) loans when agencies lacked the capacity to provide them. However, the source of funds for these advances was not clearly identified, leading to ambiguity over the Secretary's authority. Amendments under the ECASLA were made to the LLR program. Under the ECASLA, amendments were made to the LLR program, requiring guaranty agencies to provide LLR loans to students and parents unable to obtain Subsidized Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, or PLUS Loans. The ECASLA temporarily authorized the Secretary to designate institutions for institution-wide participation in the LLR program, extending this authority through June 30, 2010. Institutions may be required to demonstrate their inability to secure FFEL program lenders for student loans to qualify for institution-wide participation. Institutions seeking institution-wide student qualification for LLR loans must demonstrate their inability to secure conventional FFEL program loans for at least 80% of students and parents. Documentation of three attempts to find eligible lenders is required. The guaranty agency must provide documentation of institution's eligibility to ED for final determination. FFEL program sets maximum interest rates and fees for borrowers. Lenders compete by offering different packages of discounts to attract borrowers. Guaranty agencies may pay origination or default fees to attract loan business. LLR lenders are prohibited from offering borrower benefits more favorable than maximum rates and fees. Under the LLR program, guaranty agencies must inform higher education institutions about the availability of LLR loans and are exempt from the prohibition on providing inducements to lenders. The amendments under ECASLA make guaranty agencies and lenders subject to prohibitions on inducements specified in the HEA. The ECASLA amendments prohibit guaranty agencies and lenders from advertising LLR loans to IHEs, except for required information. The Secretary must review regulations on prohibited inducements and ensure guaranty agencies do not engage in improper inducements for the LLR program. The ECASLA allows the Secretary to advance funds to guaranty agencies for making LLR loans to eligible borrowers who cannot obtain other types of loans under the FFEL program. Mandatory appropriations are provided for emergency advances of federal funds for loans as lenders-of-last-resort. The ECASLA also grants temporary authority to purchase loans previously made under the FFEL program. The DL program is amended to authorize funding for the Secretary to purchase Subsidized Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and PLUS Loans first disbursed between October 1, 2003, and July 1, 2009. P.L. 110-350 extends this authority to loans disbursed before July 1, 2010. The Secretary may purchase loans if it is in the best interest of the United States, with costs determined jointly by the Secretaries of Education and the Treasury. The HEOA requires the Secretaries of Education and the Treasury, along with the Director of OMB, to publish terms for purchasing FFEL program loans in a way that results in no cost to the government. Guaranty agencies lose obligations upon loan purchase, and lenders must use sale proceeds to maintain participation. The Secretary of Education must use proceeds from loan sales to maintain lender participation in the FFEL program and originate new loans. A \"Dear Colleague\" letter outlined plans to purchase FFEL program loans, with two initial options identified. The Department of Education outlined two options for purchasing FFEL program loans: the Loan Purchase program and the Loan Participation Purchase program. Lenders had until September 30, 2009, to complete the sale, after which ED would gain control over loan servicing. The Loan Purchase program involved buying loans at a set price, while the Loan Participation Purchase program involved purchasing participation interests in trusts of FFEL program loans. The Department of Education introduced the Purchase of Participation Interests (PPI) program, allowing trusts of FFEL program loans to refinance or sell loans to ED. The terms and conditions were outlined in a notice published in the Federal Register on July 1, 2008. The Put and PPI programs were continued on November 10, 2008. On November 10, 2008, the Secretary announced the continuation of the Put and PPI programs for the 2009-2010 academic year, along with plans to establish a program allowing FFEL program loans to be transferred to Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits. This program involved creating loan pools for private investors through commercial paper sales, with the Department of Education providing liquidity support. The Department plans to enter a forward purchase commitment with eligible lender trustees to create ABCP Conduits for student loans. This commitment involves purchasing student loans at a future date for a pre-arranged price. Additionally, the Secretary announced a short-term extension of the Loan Purchase program for loans made during the 2007-2008 academic year to ensure continued availability of student loans. The Department plans to purchase loans for 97% of the amount owed by the borrower. Up to $500 million in eligible loans for the 2007-2008 academic year will be purchased each week until February 28, 2009. The ECASLA urges entities to assist in ensuring access to federal student loans without limiting the Secretary's authority. The ECASLA requires savings to be used for Academic Competitiveness Grants, expanding eligibility for AC and SMART Grants effective July 1, 2009. Students no longer need to be US citizens and can be enrolled at least half-time to qualify for the grants. The ECASLA amendments expand eligibility for AC and SMART Grants effective July 1, 2009. Grants will be awarded similarly to Pell Grants based on grade level. AC Grants can now be awarded to students in certificate programs, clarify eligibility for first-year AC Grants, and extend SMART Grants to fifth-year students in five-year programs. SMART Grants are also available to students in institutions with a single liberal arts curriculum leading to a baccalaureate degree. Institutions with a single liberal arts curriculum leading to a baccalaureate degree do not allow students to declare a major in a specific subject area if they meet certain criteria."
