    "content": "Germany's strong commitment to Israel's sovereignty and security has historically influenced its policy in the Middle East and its cooperation with the United States. Recent debates over German involvement in a UN mission on the Israeli-Lebanese border, increased advocacy for a proactive EU role in the region, and changing perceptions of Israel in the German public suggest a shifting role for Germany. The deployment of a German naval contingent near Israeli soil in October 2006 marks a significant development in Germany's engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Germany's EU presidency in the first half of 2007 aims to revive European and international engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Germany's close ties to Israel and the U.S. are seen as positive for increased involvement in the Middle East. However, there are concerns about potential divergence in policies due to German troops in Lebanon and growing public opposition to Israeli actions. Germany's role as a key partner for Israel and the U.S. is evolving amidst changing dynamics in the region. The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and Israel established formal diplomatic relations in May 1965, with German policy towards Israel rooted in atonement for Nazi atrocities. Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's policies included financial reparations to Israel and individual victims of Nazi persecution. In the Luxembourg Agreement, West Germany agreed to pay 3 billion Deutschmark to Israel and 4.5 million DM to Jewish organizations. Germany enacted legislation for direct compensation to individual victims of Nazi crimes, with over 25 billion Euros going to Israel or individuals living there. In 1992, the government expanded compensation laws to include individuals previously denied by East Germany. Reparations to Israel were not required by the international community and were not wholeheartedly endorsed by the German and Israeli people. German support for Israel was largely due to the efforts of Adenauer and Ben-Gurion, who established military ties in 1957. However, in 1964, German newspaper reports exposed secret arms shipments to Israel, leading to crises within Germany, Israel, and the Arab world. In response to the exposed secret arms shipments to Israel in 1964, West Germany suspended the shipments, leading to crises. To address public and political pressure, Adenauer offered to establish formal diplomatic relations with Israel in March 1965, despite previous reluctance due to fear of Arab retaliation. The following decades saw Germany striving to maintain neutrality in the Middle East publicly while privately fulfilling a moral commitment to Israel initiated by Adenauer. Leaders emphasized neutrality and avoided taking sides in conflicts from the 1970s onwards. Germany maintained neutrality in conflicts involving Israel, aligning with EEC positions. Despite not openly supporting Israel in the 1967 and 1973 wars, Germany provided economic assistance and nurtured defense cooperation with Israel. Germany's policy reflected its dependence on Arab states for oil, but it successfully maintained strong relations with Israel. Germany's stance on Israel shifted over time, initially claiming neutrality but later supporting EEC resolutions urging Israel to retreat to pre-1967 borders. Despite signing the EEC's Venice Declaration endorsing Palestinian self-determination in 1980, Germany avoided direct references to the PLO. This change in policy was seen as less favorable towards Israel, but Germany remained a strong ally within Europe. Germany's robust bilateral relationship with Israel is based on reparations for the Holocaust, defense cooperation, and scientific collaboration. Despite increasing public criticism of Israeli policies, the countries are focusing on expanding cultural and societal exchanges. Germany is Israel's second largest trading partner, with bilateral trade worth 3.7 billion Euros. Economic considerations do not play a decisive role in German policy towards Israel, and German direct investment in Israel is not significant. Former Israeli Ambassador to Germany Avi Primor has highlighted increased German investment as an area of potential growth. Israeli Ambassador to Germany Avi Primor emphasizes the importance of increased German investment in German-Israeli relations. Security concerns related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are seen as a major obstacle to greater investment. However, Israeli investment in Germany is on the rise, with over 40 Israeli companies established in Germany by 2005. The German-Israeli Business Council was established in 2005 to boost business relations, and Germany supports preferential trade agreements between Israel and the EU. Scientific cooperation between German and Israeli scientists dates back to 1961 and has become a key aspect of bilateral relations, with Germany being the second largest sponsor of scientific research in Israel after the United States. The Minerva Foundation, funded by the German government, supports German-Israeli scientific cooperation through projects at Israel's Weizmann Institute. People-to-people exchanges and Holocaust education are emphasized by leaders on both sides. Over 100 \"sisterships\" between German and Israeli towns exist, with cultural exchange and language promotion efforts increasing in recent years. Over the past decade, efforts have been made to promote the German language in Israel and jointly promote Holocaust education. Germany is home to over 100,000 Jews, the world's fastest-growing Jewish population, with most coming from the former Soviet Union since 1990. Secret military and intelligence cooperation between Germany and Israel resumed in the late 1960s, with German leaders committed to defense cooperation despite risks. Germany has remained committed to defense cooperation with Israel, with the latter being a top recipient of German military technology. German arms have played a significant role in Israeli military victories in past conflicts. In response to Iraqi scud missile attacks during the Gulf War, Germany provided arms and financial assistance to Israel. In recent years, Germany financed the construction of \"Dolphin-class\" submarines for the Israeli navy. Germany has continued defense cooperation with Israel, providing Dolphin-class submarines. There are concerns that Israel may reconfigure the submarines for nuclear missiles, but supporters emphasize Germany's obligation to defend Israel. Israelis view the cooperation positively, with the Jerusalem Post praising it as crucial for preventing another Holocaust. Israel's intelligence agencies, BND and Mossad, have a long history of cooperation with Germany, dating back to the 1960s. Counter-terrorism collaboration intensified after the 1972 Munich Olympics attack and has grown since 9/11. In 2002, Germany banned the Al-Aqsa charity under pressure from Israel, highlighting the close partnership between the two countries despite Israeli concerns about legal constraints on counter-terror operations. Despite perceived constraints on counter-terror operations by German law, cooperation between Israel and Germany remains strong. Israeli leaders appreciate Germany's advocacy on Israel's behalf within the EU and internationally since the 1950s. Concerns arise about the historical basis for the relationship weakening due to a rise in neo-Nazi activity, anti-Israel sentiment, and crimes committed by neo-Nazis in Germany. The rise of neo-Nazi movements in German society and political life has sparked criticism and concern from Jewish leaders and Israeli officials. Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged the need for increased education and training to address anti-Semitic tendencies. The German government funds tolerance-education programs to combat these trends. The German government funds tolerance-education programs focusing on anti-Semitism and Holocaust remembrance, collaborates with Israeli organizations, provides 24-hour police protection at Jewish institutions, investigates xenophobic and anti-Semitic crimes, and prosecutes perpetrators. There is tension in German society between its commitment to Israel and criticism of Israeli policies. Public and political opposition to Israeli policies has increased in recent years. In reaction to alleged media bias and opposition from German politicians to Israeli bombings during the 2006 war with Hezbollah, the German Jewish Council leader criticized Germany for its hostile attitude towards Jews and Israel. A survey showed that 75% of Germans viewed Israeli actions as disproportionate, compared to 63% of British and 50% of Americans. Germany was cautious in supporting Palestinian self-determination until the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993. Since 1993, Germany has been a strong advocate for a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a major donor to the Palestinian Authority. It is the first country to open a representative office in the Palestinian territories and supports EU involvement in the Quartet. Despite Israeli pressure, Germany continues to provide aid to the Palestinians while prioritizing support for Israel as a key aspect of its Middle East policy. Germany has emerged as a proactive advocate for greater EU engagement in the Middle East, supporting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Former Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's efforts in 2002 were seen as a significant step towards the Road Map and marked a turning point in Germany's role in the region. Israelis generally view Germany as a strong and reliable partner. Despite occasional tensions, Germany is seen as a strong and reliable partner within the EU, advocating for Israel's interests. Germany has supported Israel politically within the EU, blocking sanctions in 2002 and endorsing opposition to Israel's security in 2004. In 2004, Germany supported Israel's decision on the security fence in the West Bank and during the 2006 conflict with Hezbollah, Germany and the UK were the only EU states against an immediate cease-fire. In November 2006, Germany, along with the Czech Republic and the UK, blocked EU condemnation of Israel's military operation in Gaza. Germany is known for backing Israel within the EU while maintaining trust with Palestinians and other groups opposed to Israeli objectives. Foreign Minister Fischer played a role in mediating between Yasser Arafat and Ariel Sharon after a Tel Aviv bombing in 2001. In 2004, Germany supported Israel's decision on the security fence in the West Bank and during the 2006 conflict with Hezbollah, Germany and the UK were the only EU states against an immediate cease-fire. Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier took office in November 2005 promising continuity in a German Middle East policy based on a commitment to protect Israel's right to exist; support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; a commitment to a European framework for peace; and a belief that U.S. engagement in the region is essential. Germany is known for backing Israel within the EU while maintaining trust with Palestinians and other groups opposed to Israeli objectives. Germany has increased calls for revived U.S. and Quartet engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process since deploying troops to the Lebanese coast in 2006. They have been active in international negotiations to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and are willing to support Iraqi reconstruction efforts. However, Israel and the U.S. disapprove of German efforts to engage Syria in the peace process. Germany has increased calls for revived U.S. and Quartet engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process since deploying troops to the Lebanese coast in 2006. They lead a contingent monitoring the Lebanese coast to prevent weapons smuggling to Hezbollah forces. German participation in UNIFIL has increased domestic pressure on Merkel to push for a political solution to the broader Arab-Israeli conflict. Germany initially ruled out a military role in UNIFIL but reconsidered after a direct request from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. While ground troops were not sent, there was a surprising willingness from governing political parties, especially the Social Democrats, to consider the option. Opposition from Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and its sister party prevented further consideration of a more robust German military presence. Since Germany's naval deployment in October 2006, Israeli Air Force jets flying over German vessels have caused diplomatic tension, leading to official complaints and apologies. The weak UN mandate for the UNIFIL mission is believed to be ineffective. Israeli leaders have apologized for lack of communication during fly-overs, while Germany faces criticism for its role in the region. Germany's ability to track potential arms shipments is limited by conditions requiring approval from Lebanese authorities before boarding ships or entering territory near the coast. Chancellor Merkel aims to revive Quartet efforts for Israeli-Palestinian peace, emphasizing the need for U.S. engagement. Germany is expected to use diplomatic capital in the first half of 2007 to increase U.S. involvement in peace initiatives. Germany aims to increase U.S. engagement and gain European support for Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. Chancellor Merkel and Foreign Minister Steinmeier advocate for broadening the peace process to include more neighboring states. They support Palestinian President Abbas's unity government efforts with Hamas, potentially diverging from the U.S. stance. Steinmeier suggests expanding the Quartet to include Arab states like Egypt, emphasizing the need for Syrian involvement in any sustainable agreement. Foreign Minister Steinmeier met with President Bashar Asad in Damascus in December 2006, urging him to stop supporting Hezbollah and pressure Hamas for peace cooperation. Despite initial opposition, Chancellor Merkel defended the visit as a demonstration of readiness for dialogue with all regional stakeholders. Israeli Prime Minister Olmert supported the Road Map and Germany's role but criticized Steinmeier's trip to Damascus and a German-backed proposal for Israeli-Palestinian conflict discussions. Germany, as part of the EU-3, supports multilateral efforts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Despite opposition, Merkel and Steinmeier are open to considering stricter economic sanctions against Iran. Germany, along with the EU-3, backs multilateral actions to halt Iran's nuclear weapon ambitions. Merkel and Steinmeier are willing to explore tougher economic sanctions if Iran remains uncooperative. Israeli officials urge stronger international measures against Iran, emphasizing the country's threat and the need for assertive action. Olmert urges Germany to take a stronger stance against Iran due to moral obligations and concerns about German companies doing business in Iran. The United States Treasury Department also urges Germany to prevent Iranian companies from exploiting European banking systems for terrorist financing. Germany has refrained from sending troops to Iraq since 2003 and focuses on training Iraqi forces in the UAE. Germany is providing training and financial assistance for Iraqi police and military forces in the UAE, within the Paris Club framework. German leaders, including Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, show a growing willingness to support stabilization efforts in Iraq. Merkel and Steinmeier endorse the U.S. Iraq Study Group report and support an international conference on Iraq to address regional disputes. Merkel emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive diplomatic initiative for stabilizing the Middle East. In December 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was skeptical of German assistance for a Middle East initiative. Israeli Prime Minister Olmert prefers bilateral negotiations over international conferences for Israeli-Arab relations. The US and Germany are close allies with shared interests in the Middle East, including a commitment to Israel's security and a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They also aim to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and combat terrorism. Germany's approach in the Middle East emphasizes diplomatic engagement over military measures, showing a willingness to engage with traditional adversaries like Syria and Iran. Merkel's call for a comprehensive diplomatic initiative aims to address conflicts in the region, including Israeli-Palestinian and Israel-Lebanon issues. This approach differs from the US, which prioritizes preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons and combating terrorism. Calls for Germany to offer Syria concessions within a broader dialogue are fueled by the presence of German troops off the Lebanese coast and criticism of their mandate. While Merkel supports dialogue with Syria and Iran, Germany and the EU prioritize robust U.S. engagement in the peace process. However, European frustration with U.S. inattention may lead to EU-led initiatives, with Germany unlikely to take a leadership role without strong U.S. backing. Germany's ability to drive the peace process is doubted due to U.S. inattention. Merkel maintains traditional support for Israel but faces growing criticism within Germany for Israeli policies. German troops in the region increase interest in resolving Israeli-Arab conflicts. Germany's commitment to a stronger EU foreign policy and potential divergence from U.S. and Israeli policies is noted. Despite this, German officials emphasize their continued support for Israel and a common transatlantic approach to the Arab-Israeli peace process. Historical perspective shows consistent German support for Israel, often carried out secretively. Maintaining positive relations on both sides of the conflict has been a German priority. Germany's success in maintaining positive relations in the Arab-Israeli conflict has relied on avoiding a high-profile leadership role. Congressional concerns intersect with Germany's relations with Israel, particularly regarding policy issues in the Middle East. For example, Congress has urged the EU to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, with resolutions passed in 2005 and a letter signed by 200 House members in 2006. The EU has not designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. The EU has not designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization due to some member states' views on its role in Lebanon. Germany follows the common EU list of terrorist organizations and is unlikely to designate Hezbollah as such. France has been a strong opponent to classifying Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Germany, previously hesitant to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, now indicates potential support for such a designation. Concerns persist in Congress regarding EU aid to Palestinians, leading to restrictions on U.S. funding for the Palestinian Authority. Chancellor Merkel has backed Quartet conditions for aid provision and negotiations with Hamas since 2006. Observers worry that European states, including Germany, may show more flexibility in meeting these requirements compared to the United States. German officials are willing to show flexibility in meeting Quartet principles, especially in exchange for Hamas cooperation in a national unity government or peace talks."
