    "content": "Charitable contributions of scientific equipment to elementary and secondary schools. The amendment to section 170(e)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code defines a qualified research or education contribution as a charitable donation of tangible personal property by a corporation to an educational organization, governmental unit, or specific organization. In section 41(e)(6)(B), a taxpayer can make a contribution of scientific equipment or apparatus for research or experimentation purposes within 3 years of acquiring the property. A taxpayer can contribute scientific equipment for educational purposes within the United States, with the original use of the property starting with the taxpayer. The property must not be exchanged for money, other property, or services, and the taxpayer must receive acknowledgment from the donee. Donations to charity for refurbishing can be treated as qualified research or education contributions if the taxpayer receives a written statement ensuring the property will be used according to specific provisions. Donations to a tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) can be considered qualified contributions if the property is repaired and donated to another eligible organization, with the taxpayer receiving a written statement confirming the proper use of the property. Amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for qualified research or education contributions. Effective date for these amendments is for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996."
