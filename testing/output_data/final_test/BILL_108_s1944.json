    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Israeli-Palestinian Peace Enhancement Act of 2003\". Congress finds that the security of Israel is a key national interest of the United States, and lasting peace in the Middle East can only happen without violence and terrorism. The Palestinian people have suffered due to leaders resorting to violence, hindering efforts for a negotiated settlement. The US supports a peaceful coexistence of Israel and Palestine. President George W. Bush also emphasized this in his 2002 speech. President George W. Bush emphasized the need for a peaceful Palestinian state to achieve security for Israel, with Israel willing to make concessions for peace once there is a partner on the Palestinian side. The Act aims to express Congress's support for recognizing a Palestinian state, encouraging Palestinian leadership reforms for peace with Israel and combating terrorism, and offering economic and humanitarian assistance once reforms are achieved. Congress supports transforming the Palestinian government for peace with Israel, providing economic aid post-reforms, urging security measures for a peace roadmap, and promoting a two-state solution. The United States supports a two-state solution for the Arab-Israeli conflict, based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, to achieve peace and security in the region. SEC. 5. RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE. The sense of Congress is that the US should not recognize a Palestinian state until a new leadership not involved in terrorism is elected, and the entity shows commitment to peaceful coexistence with Israel, ends anti-Israel incitement, and takes measures against terrorism in the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinian entity must demonstrate cooperation with Israeli security, govern effectively with democracy and rule of law, and promote acceptance of Israel and peace while discouraging anti-Israel incitement. SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO A PALESTINIAN STATE. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act to include a limitation on assistance to a Palestinian state. The Foreign Assistance Act includes a limitation on providing direct assistance to the government of a Palestinian state, which can only be done with a valid certification. However, humanitarian aid through NGOs and assistance for reforming Palestinian institutions are exempt from this limitation. The President can waive the limitation on providing assistance to a Palestinian state if it is deemed vital to national security. Assistance to a Palestinian state cannot be given until 15 days after notification to Congress. The President can waive the limitation on providing assistance to a Palestinian state if it is deemed vital to national security. Assistance to a Palestinian state cannot be given until 15 days after notification to Congress, and a certification must be provided to Congress that a Palestinian state exists and has been recognized by the United States and Israel. A binding international peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian state must be freely signed by both parties, guaranteeing a secure border, resolving refugee issues, and addressing permanent status issues. The new Palestinian government, democratically elected and committed to non-violence towards Israel, has exclusive authority over national affairs. The Palestinian government must dismantle terrorist groups, cooperate with Israel on security, refrain from inciting violence, have a non-compromised leadership, set limits on its military, and avoid alliances that threaten Israel. The Palestinian government must not have alliances or agreements that threaten Israel. The President must recertify every 6 months for 10 years that the requirements are being met, or provide a report if unable to do so. A certification under subsection (c) is valid for 10 years unless stated otherwise. The President must recertify every 6 months for 10 years that the requirements are being met, or provide a report if unable to do so. The certification is valid for 10 years unless the President determines otherwise and transmits a report to Congress explaining the reasons. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE TO A PALESTINIAN STATE. This section adds a new authorization for assistance to a Palestinian state in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The President is authorized to provide assistance to a Palestinian state to improve the economy and living conditions by supporting activities such as economic development, promoting democracy, developing water resources, assisting in security cooperation, and helping with refugee compensation and rehabilitation. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these purposes. The President is authorized to provide assistance to a Palestinian state for economic development, democracy promotion, water resource development, security cooperation, and refugee compensation. The Secretary of State will coordinate international assistance through donors conferences and ensure timely commitments are honored. The Secretary of State is responsible for monitoring and ensuring that assistance provided to Palestinians is used for its intended purposes. They must also prevent other countries, institutions, and organizations from providing assistance through designated terrorist entities. Annual reports on this assistance must be submitted to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Senate committees receive annual reports detailing the assistance provided to Palestinians by countries and organizations, including amounts committed and provided."
