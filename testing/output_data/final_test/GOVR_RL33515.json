This sale also included F-16 A/B Mid-Life Update Modification Kits, engine modifications, structural upgrades, missiles, munitions, and associated hardware. Some view these sales as a reward for Pakistan's support in U.S.-led anti-terrorism efforts. Congress has 30 days to review and express its opinion on the proposed sales. Pakistan-U.S. relations have historical roots in the Cold War and regional politics of the 1950s. The differing expectations of the security relationship have strained bilateral ties, with the U.S. seeing Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union, while Pakistan viewed the U.S. as a security guarantor against India. Tensions escalated in the mid-1970s over Pakistan's nuclear ambitions, leading to a suspension of U.S. aid in 1979. Congress has 30 days to review proposed arms sales to Pakistan under the Arms Export Control Act. In 1985, the Pressler amendment was added to the Foreign Assistance Act, requiring certification that Pakistan does not possess nuclear weapons to receive aid. Aid to Pakistan was suspended in 1990 due to nuclear activities, leading to the non-delivery of F-16 fighter aircraft. In 1989, Pakistan purchased F-16 fighter aircraft from the United States. Aid to Pakistan was suspended in 1990 due to nuclear activities. In late-2001, major U.S. aid, including weapons systems, flowed to Pakistan again. The U.S.-India relationship was influenced by the Cold War but has improved, with President Bush calling India a \"natural partner\" and seeking to assist India's rise as a major power. Despite a rapprochement with Pakistan, U.S.-India security cooperation has flourished. U.S.-India security cooperation has flourished with regular military exercises and a ten-year defense framework agreement signed in June 2005. The potential counterbalance to Chinese influence in the region is seen positively, but an overt counterweight alliance is viewed as unlikely. The rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked by three full-scale wars and ongoing military friction, stems from the partition of British India in 1947 and the unresolved Kashmiri sovereignty issue. Despite significant defense expenditures, a peace initiative initiated in 2003 has shown improvement. A peace initiative started in 2003 has improved relations between Pakistan and India, leading to a 2004 summit and an agreement to resolve bilateral issues, including Kashmir. Despite positive assessments of the ongoing dialogue, progress on territorial disputes has been minimal. Pakistan's planned purchase of new F-16s is not expected to significantly impact India's military advantage. The F-16 Falcon, a versatile fighter aircraft manufactured by Lockheed Martin, is proposed for export to Pakistan with advanced capabilities including high-resolution radars, helmet-mounted cuing system for improved dogfighting, and integrated defensive electronic countermeasures. This purchase is not expected to diminish India's military advantage or affect the regional balance of power. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, a dual-engine, multi-role aircraft by Boeing, is the U.S. Navy's most modern combat aircraft with initial operational capability in 2001. Differences between the E/F and earlier variants are significant, making it almost a new aircraft. The Super Hornet has been approved for export, but no sales have been made yet. Potential sales to South Asia could impact U.S. political relations with Pakistan and India. The Bush Administration announced the resumption of F-16 sales to Pakistan in 2005, part of a new strategy for South Asia. The US also expressed support for India's interest in purchasing F-16 or F/A-18 warplanes and discussed the sale of transformative systems. Members of the House urged President Bush not to license the sale of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, citing concerns about long-term strategic interests in South Asia. The Bush Administration resumed F-16 sales to Pakistan in 2005, despite concerns about long-term strategic interests in South Asia. Indian Prime Minister expressed disappointment initially but later welcomed expanded cooperation with the US. The decision was justified by the US interest in Pakistan's security and stabilizing the balance between Pakistan and India. The White House resumed F-16 sales to Pakistan in June 2006 as a commitment to a long-term relationship. Some view it as a reward for post-9/11 cooperation and a way to increase U.S. leverage in Islamabad. The timing may have been influenced by U.S.-India relations and Pakistan's request for a similar nuclear cooperation initiative, which the Bush Administration rejects. The Bush Administration resumed F-16 sales to Pakistan in June 2006, despite opposition from some analysts and lawmakers who see it as disruptive to regional stability and India-Pakistan relations. The decision was criticized for not being related to counterterrorism efforts and potentially escalating tensions between the two countries. Several critics have raised concerns that renewed F-16 sales to Pakistan may strengthen non-democratic forces in Islamabad, despite the Bush Administration's focus on spreading democracy. The House Appropriations Committee expressed worry about Pakistan's lack of progress in democratic governance and rule of law. Additionally, some Pakistanis question why the government plans to spend billions on weapons instead of improving social services. In the wake of Pakistan's 2005 earthquake, concerns were raised about the country's spending on weapons instead of improving social services and infrastructure. Congressional opposition to F-16 sales to Pakistan due to nuclear proliferation activities led to legislation prohibiting aid unless cooperation with U.S. non-proliferation efforts is certified. In 2004, Abdul Qadeer Khan, founder of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, confessed to involvement in an illicit nuclear smuggling network selling technology to North Korea, Libya, and Iran. Pakistan refuses direct access to Khan by non-Pakistani investigators, raising skepticism in Congress. The importance of F-16 transfers to Pakistan is viewed in the context of nuclear proliferation concerns. The acquisition and upgrade of F-16s by Pakistan is crucial due to its military confrontation with India, nuclear tensions, and fight against terrorism. India currently has a significant advantage in terms of quantity and modern aircraft. The F-16 Block 50/52 is comparable to India's advanced Su-30. However, India has additional support like aerial refueling and electronic countermeasures. The sale of 36 F-16s to Pakistan would increase their modern combat aircraft capabilities but still not match India's. Concerns exist about Pakistan using F-16s for nuclear delivery, but the impact on nuclear deterrence in South Asia is unclear due to existing nuclear-capable F-16s and ballistic missiles. Some argue that replacing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles with additional F-16s in Pakistan's arsenal could reduce nuclear instability. F-16s could potentially be used against terrorists and insurgents, but they may be considered too advanced for such operations. The proposed Block 50/52 variant of the F-16 includes advanced weapons and avionics unnecessary for counterinsurgency, suggesting that less expensive and sophisticated aircraft may be more suitable for these tasks. The Indian Defense Minister opposes the sale of F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan, citing concerns about potential use against India. Combat aircraft are crucial for offensive operations, but the F-16 may not fully meet Pakistan's need for a highly advanced fighter. Pakistan is considering purchasing advanced fighter aircraft from various countries, including China and Sweden, due to concerns about potential military sales cutoffs by the U.S. The proposed sale of F-16s from the U.S. offers limited long-term benefits, prompting Pakistan to explore other options. Pakistan is exploring purchasing advanced fighter aircraft from Sweden, potentially the Gripen, as the U.S. may not become its main supplier. India's potential purchase of U.S. fighters could impact its negotiations with Russia for more advanced systems and financing. This raises policy questions for the U.S. regarding military technology transfer to India. The release of military technology and its potential use by India, especially in developing aerospace production capabilities and acquiring aircraft from various countries. The discussion revolves around the benefits of selling aircraft to Pakistan and India to extend the production life of U.S. aircraft and improve industry competitiveness. The potential sale of F-16s to Pakistan could keep the production line open, which employs around 5,000 workers. The potential sale of F-16s to Pakistan could keep the production line open, employing around 5,000 workers. India's larger demand for combat aircraft presents a significant market opportunity for U.S. companies to compete with Russian and European aircraft. This could lead to increased military exports to India, as the country aims to upgrade its armaments and strengthen its military capabilities. India's potential demand for combat aircraft presents a market opportunity for U.S. companies to compete with Russian and European aircraft. Questions remain about the domestic U.S. benefit from these sales, with concerns about job preservation and the impact on the U.S. industrial base. Producing aircraft for India could increase jobs in India but reduce jobs in the United States, with debates on whether this would advance innovation or competitiveness. The potential demand for combat aircraft in India creates a market opportunity for U.S. companies. Concerns arise about the impact on the U.S. industrial base if significant design and engineering changes are needed for exported aircraft."
