It establishes an Advisory Council to improve mobility access for underserved populations and senior citizens. The Secretary of Transportation will establish an Advisory Council on Improving Mobility Access for Underserved Populations and Senior Citizens within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Council will have diverse members appointed by the Secretary, including representatives from various sectors. The Advisory Council on Improving Mobility Access for Underserved Populations and Senior Citizens, appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, will serve for a term of three years. Vacancies will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Council will gather information, provide technical advice, and make recommendations to the Secretary on mobility access and highly automated vehicles. Recommendations will also be reported to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House. The Council established by the Secretary of Transportation will conform to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary will provide technical assistance and may detail Department of Transportation personnel to assist the Council. Members of the Council will serve for a term of three years. The Council established by the Secretary of Transportation will serve without pay, except for travel and per diem expenses for meetings. It will terminate 6 years after the enactment of the Act. Definitions include \"automated driving system\" as hardware and software capable of driving tasks, and \"dynamic driving task\" as real-time vehicle operations in traffic. The term \"highly automated vehicle\" refers to a motor vehicle equipped with lateral and longitudinal motion control, monitoring of the driving environment, object and event response execution, maneuver planning, and enhancing conspicuity. The term \"highly automated vehicle\" refers to a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system, excluding commercial vehicles. The term \"operational design domain\" refers to the specific conditions under which a driving automation system is designed to function. If SAE International revises certain definitions in Recommended Practice Report J3016, they must notify the Secretary of the revision. The Secretary must publish a notice in the Federal Register to inform the public of any new definition for highly automated vehicles, unless the Secretary determines that the new definition does not meet safety needs or is inconsistent with the law. If the Secretary notifies SAE International of this, the existing definition will remain in effect. The Secretary may update definitions for highly automated vehicles without following certain regulatory procedures if circumstances change significantly. The definitions for highly automated vehicles may need to be updated due to changed circumstances impacting motor vehicle safety."
