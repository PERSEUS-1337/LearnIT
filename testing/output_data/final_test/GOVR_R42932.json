    "content": "This report outlines the process for filling PAS positions requiring Senate confirmation in various government organizations. It includes nominations in 41 executive branch organizations and 4 legislative branch agencies for the 111th Congress. The report tracks Senate activity on confirmations, rejections, and elapsed time between nomination and confirmation, as well as presidential actions like withdrawals and recess appointments. The Constitution empowers the President to nominate and appoint officers with Senate confirmation. The appointment process involves selection, nomination, confirmation, and appointment stages. The report outlines the process for filling PAS positions in government organizations during the 111th Congress. The President selects a candidate for Senate-confirmed positions with assistance from the White House. Senators may recommend candidates, but the White House is not obligated to follow these suggestions. Senators argue they are entitled to provide advice on nominations. Insufficient consultation may lead Senators to take procedural actions. During the pre-nomination consultation process, Senators may delay or block consideration of a nomination. The candidate undergoes a clearance process overseen by the Office of the Counsel to the President, which includes background investigations by the FBI and OGE. Conflicts of interest are addressed, and once cleared, the nomination moves forward. After clearance by the Office of the Counsel to the President, nominations are submitted to the Senate. Delays can occur, especially during high-volume periods or when conflicts arise. Priority is often given to higher-level positions. In 2004, amendments were made to speed up the appointment of national security team members after a new President's inauguration. During presidential transitions, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows for a 90-day extension for temporary appointments. The President typically nominates individuals recommended by Senators from the same party for positions within a state. Recommendations from party leaders or opposition Senators may also be considered. The President considers Senate recommendations for federal positions, taking into account confirmation process and potential recess appointments. Recess appointments can have political consequences if seen as circumventing Senate's role. Nominees have no authority until Senate confirmation and presidential appointment. In the Senate confirmation process, authority to act is granted through confirmation and presidential appointment. The Senate scrutinizes nominees based on position importance, political circumstances, and policy implications. Factors like party control and presidential support also influence the confirmation process. The Senate confirmation process involves nominations being received by the Senate executive clerk and referred to committees. Committees conduct investigations, hearings, and reporting stages on nominees. Hearings provide a public forum for discussion on nominees and related issues. The Senate confirmation process allows Senators to explore nominees' qualifications and policy perspectives through hearings. Committees can choose to report a nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. If a nomination is not reported, the Senate may discharge the committee to bring it to the floor for a vote. Most executive nominations are confirmed, with rare failures on the Senate floor. Rarely does a Senate vote to confirm a nomination fail on the floor. Unsuccessful nominations often do not make it out of committee due to various reasons such as opposition, lack of time for consideration, or unrelated factors. Senate rules dictate that pending nominations not confirmed or rejected in the session they were made must be resubmitted by the President in the next session. These pending nominations are typically returned to the President at the end of the session or Congress, or at the start of a recess lasting more than 30 days. After Senate confirmation, the nominee receives a commission signed by the President and is sworn into office, granting full authority. The President can make limited-term recess appointments without Senate confirmation, which expire at the end of the following session of Congress. This power has been used to bypass the confirmation process, leading to restrictions by Congress on pay. The President can make recess appointments without Senate confirmation, but pay restrictions apply. If the position is filled by a recess appointment while the Senate is in session, the appointee may not be paid until confirmed by the Senate, unless certain conditions are met. The President can make recess appointments without Senate confirmation, but pay restrictions apply. A recess appointment falling under certain exceptions must be followed by a nomination within 40 days. The Department of Justice interprets provisions to preclude payment for appointees with successive recess appointments to the same position. If a recess appointee's nomination for a full term is rejected, they can continue to serve until the end of their recess appointment. The FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act provision may prevent appointees from being paid after rejection by the Senate. Congress also restructured Senate recesses to prevent the President from making recess appointments. The Senate restructured its recesses to prevent the President from making recess appointments by holding pro forma sessions every three days. This practice was used during the 2010 pre-election break due to disagreements between the Senate majority leader and minority leader on pending nominations. If the Senate goes on recess for more than 30 days, nominations must be returned to the White House. The Senate restructured its recesses to prevent recess appointments by holding pro forma sessions every few days. Nominations must be returned to the White House if the Senate goes on recess for more than 30 days, leading to a tug-of-war between President Obama and Senate Republicans over confirmations. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, vacant executive agency positions requiring Senate confirmation can be temporarily filled in three ways: the first assistant assumes duties, the President can direct another officer to perform tasks, or the President can select an officer or employee meeting certain criteria. The temporary appointment lasts 210 days, with exceptions for pending nominations or presidential transitions. During a presidential transition, the 210-day restriction period for vacant executive agency positions does not start until 90 days after the President takes office or after the vacancy occurs within the 90-day inauguration period. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 does not apply to certain positions on regulatory boards and commissions.
