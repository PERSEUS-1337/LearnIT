The credit is limited based on the type of motor vehicle used, with maximum amounts ranging from $2,000 to $50,000 depending on the vehicle's specifications. Qualified clean-fuel vehicle property excludes motor vehicles propelled by non-clean-burning fuel. Qualified refueling property costs are defined for tax purposes. The term 'qualified refueling property costs' refers to amounts paid by eligible businesses for clean-fuel vehicle refueling property placed in service in a nonattainment area during the taxable year. The aggregate cost taken into account is limited to $100,000 or the cost of the property, whichever is less. The cost of the property is reduced by the amount previously taken into account under different clauses for preceding taxable years and with respect to property placed in service. The clean-burning fuel use credit is 50 cents for each gasoline gallon equivalent of clean-burning fuel used by an eligible business to propel qualified clean-fuel vehicle property. The term 'clean-burning fuel' is defined by section 179A, including compressed fuel. Special rules from section 179A(b)(2) apply.

The credit can be used against regular and minimum tax liabilities. Special rules apply to the clean fuels credit, where it is treated separately from other credits and the limitation on the credit is reduced by the amount allowed for the taxable year.
