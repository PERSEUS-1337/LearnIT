    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Withholding Tax Repeal Act of 2009\". Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1861 during the Civil War, imposing a tax on personal incomes with withholding at the source. After the war, the income tax was abolished in 1872, but reinstated with the 16th amendment. Treasury Secretary McAdoo considered eliminating the withholding of income tax at the source due to taxpayer criticism. During World War II, Federal officials reinstated the withholding of income tax at the source as a temporary wartime measure to fund the war effort and ensure taxpayers paid higher tax rates and surcharges. The Withholding Tax Act of 1943 was passed to reinstitute a permanent system of withholding taxes, overcoming public opposition. Congress has since refused to repeal this mandate, leading to overpayments refunded by the IRS in fiscal year 2007, totaling over $248 billion more than actual tax liabilities. According to a 2007 report, millions of families, especially those with zero tax liability or receiving government transfers, benefit from tax refunds. The absence of federal withholdings mandate allows for alternative tax collection methods, enabling individuals to earn interest on their income. The Federal withholdings mandate disguises tax increases, hampers accountability, and imposes burdens on employers. Nobel Prize winning economist James Buchanan criticized the mandate for not allowing individuals to sense the real cost of public services. The Federal tax withholding mandate disguises tax increases and hampers accountability, making it difficult for individuals to sense the true cost of public services. This administrative mechanism enables the government to collect private resources without significant protest, funding a vastly expanded welfare state. The incremental nature of withholding masks the actual cost of Federal income taxes, which would be more apparent if individuals had to write checks to the government regularly. The purpose of this Act is to increase transparency and accountability in the Federal tax system, decrease the overall tax burden, and end the deceptive practice of masking higher tax rates from taxpayers. It aims to allow for personal collection of interest on overpayments, relieve employers from collecting income tax withholdings, and repeal the Federal income and social security tax withholding mandate. The Act aims to increase transparency and accountability in the Federal tax system by repealing sections related to tax deductions and withholding. It also requires estimated tax payments for employee social security taxes and specifies an effective date for the amendments. SEC. 5. CONTINUED VOLUNTARY TAX WITHHOLDING. The IRS retains the authority to accept voluntary tax payments from employers and allows for voluntary employer and employee participation in Federal income tax withholding systems. Employees are not required to participate, but can opt in with negotiable terms between the employee and employer."
