    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fishery Conservation Transition Act\" and focuses on transitioning to sustainable fisheries. Within 180 days after the close of fishing year 2010, the Secretary of Commerce must determine if fishery management plans with complete prohibitions on retaining overfished stocks are effective. If not, the Secretary can allow retention of non-overfished fish. The Secretary may authorize retention of fish not undergoing overfishing in a fishery, even if discard mortality of prohibited stocks conflicts with overfishing prevention. The Regional Fishery Management Council must implement measures to minimize bycatch, enhance data collection, and have on-board observers within 90 days of the Secretary's determination. The Secretary must ensure accountability in fisheries by addressing data gaps in stock assessments and implementing monitoring and research programs for overfished species within one year of enactment. The Regional Fishery Management Council must submit a report to Congress and the Secretary detailing a long-term plan for reducing discard mortality of affected fish stocks within 2 years of the Act's enactment. If the Secretary determines that the Council has complied with requirements and the fishery management plan's prohibition on overfishing continues, further action is required. The Secretary will take necessary action to end overfishing for stocks subject to overfishing if current measures are insufficient by the end of fishery year 2015. The Economic Assistance Program is outlined in Section 3. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include an economic assistance program under subsection (f) and fees collected under permit programs for fisheries affected by overfishing. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include an economic assistance program to help fishery participants affected by overfishing or rebuilding overfished stocks. The program will prioritize assistance based on conservation and management history and sustainability criteria. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include an economic assistance program for fishery participants affected by overfishing or rebuilding overfished stocks. The program involves an application process to determine eligibility for assistance and consultation with affected states. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include an economic assistance program for fishery participants affected by overfishing or rebuilding overfished stocks. Assistance provided under the program may not exceed 75 percent and requires consultation with the State for matching funds. The Secretary has the authority to waive the matching requirement. SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO ACT.\n\nEmergency authority clarified under Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act for unforeseen situations affecting fishery conservation or management. Allows adjustments to catch limits, closures, or retention prohibitions based on new science or stock assessments to address conservation issues.\n\nSEC. 5. FISHERY STUDIES AND REPORTS. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require the Secretary to consider stock assessments, social and economic impacts on fishing communities, and fishery management measures to enhance sustainability of overfished stocks. The Magnuson-Stevens Act now mandates stock assessments every 2 years for overfished fish stocks and full assessments every 5 years. The Secretary must report review summaries and recommend actions for sustainable fishery management. Additionally, a study with the National Academy of Sciences will assess current fishery management measures. The study will assess current fishery management measures for a multispecies fishery to determine the most productive use of marine resources, identify impediments to achieving maximum sustainable yield, environmental stressors, economic value, and propose alternative measures for increased economic and harvest yields. A report is due within 180 days after enactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Secretary must submit a report to the Senate and House Committees containing findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary of Commerce to implement the provisions of this Act and its amendments."
