    "content": "The \"Fuel Choice and Deregulation Act of 2015\" may be cited as the Act. It includes provisions related to alternative fuels. Aftermarket conversions of motor vehicles to alternative fuel are addressed in the Clean Air Act. The aftermarket conversion system must be well-designed and installed properly to not be considered tampering. Older vehicles can be converted as long as the technology matches the vehicle and is installed correctly. The Clean Air Act addresses aftermarket conversions of motor vehicles to alternative fuel. The conversion system must not degrade emission performance and a label must be affixed to the vehicle stating it has been equipped with an aftermarket conversion system. This does not preclude the Administrator from issuing orders to prohibit certain activities. The Clean Air Act allows aftermarket conversion systems for vehicles to alternative fuel as long as emission performance is not degraded. The Administrator may issue orders to prohibit certain activities related to aftermarket conversion systems. Additionally, the Act specifies that biomass fuels cannot be prohibited or controlled under the Act. SEC. 3. CALCULATION OF AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY. The definitions in Section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code, are amended to include a new definition for 'biodiesel' as liquid fuel derived from biomass meeting specific environmental requirements. The Clean Air Act defines E85 as a fuel mixture containing 51-83% ethanol that meets ASTM Standard D5798 specifications. A flexible fuel vehicle can operate on gasoline, E85, and M85. A 'fuel choice enabling manufacturer' is a manufacturer whose fleet contains at least 50% fuel choice enabling vehicles, which are automobiles warranted to operate on natural gas, hydrogen, propane, biodiesel, flexible fuel vehicles, plug-in electric drive vehicles, or fuel cell vehicles that can produce power without petroleum. The amendment to Chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code, includes defining 'M85' as a fuel mixture containing up to 85 percent methanol meeting specific standards, and 'plug-in electric drive vehicle' as per the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Additionally, manufacturers with a fleet of at least 50% fuel choice enabling vehicles are deemed compliant with the Clean Air Act. The amendment to Chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code states that manufacturers with a fleet of at least 50% fuel choice enabling vehicles are deemed compliant with the Clean Air Act and greenhouse gas regulations established by the EPA. The amendment to Chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code allows manufacturers with a fleet of 50% fuel choice enabling vehicles to comply with Clean Air Act and EPA greenhouse gas regulations. The amendment includes new provisions for calculating average fuel economy bonuses for manufacturers, effective for model year 2016 and beyond. SEC. 4. Equalization of excise tax on liquefied natural gas and per energy equivalent of diesel. The excise tax on liquefied natural gas is equalized to 24.3 cents per energy equivalent of a gallon of diesel. The excise tax on liquefied natural gas is equalized to 24.3 cents per energy equivalent of a gallon of diesel. The energy equivalent of a gallon of diesel for liquefied natural gas is defined as having a Btu content of 128,700 (lower heating value). Administrative provisions state that references to any liquid subject to tax also include liquefied natural gas subject to tax. These amendments apply to sales or use of liquefied natural gas 14 days after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. ETHANOL WAIVER. Amends Section 211(h)(4) of the Clean Air Act to allow for ethanol blends of 10 percent or more and removes the requirement for additional alcohol."
