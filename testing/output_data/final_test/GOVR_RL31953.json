    "content": "The increased use of the Internet for email has led to a rise in unsolicited advertising, also known as spam. Despite concerns about fraudulent and pornographic content, recent research shows that users' worries about spam are actually decreasing. For example, a survey conducted in 2007 found that only 18% of respondents considered spam a big problem, down from 25% in 2003. The percentage of participants who viewed spam as a significant problem decreased from 25% in 2003 to 18% in 2007. The number of users considering spam \"not a problem at all\" increased from 16% to 28% during the same period. The use of spam filters by Internet users also rose from 65% in 2005 to 71% in 2007, contributing to a change in attitude towards spam. Defining spam remains a challenge, with varying interpretations among users. Some view spam as unwanted commercial e-mail, while others argue that if recipients show interest, it is not spam. The definition of spam varies, with some believing it is only fraudulent e-mail. The complexity of defining spam adds to the debate on whether marketers should be allowed to send commercial e-mails with an opt-out option. The CAN-SPAM Act defines spam as fraudulent UCE and allows marketers to send commercial e-mails as long as they comply with certain requirements, such as no fraudulent header information or deceptive subject headings, and including an opt-out option. This law aims to give recipients control over their in-boxes and reduce fraudulent activities. The FTC issued a final rule defining \"commercial electronic mail message\" under the CAN-SPAM Act. Consumers can file complaints about spam with the FTC and forward offending spam to spam@uce.gov for monitoring. The FTC can be contacted at spam@uce.gov to report spam and help monitor spam trends. Consumer Reports rated spam filters in their September 2004 issue. ISPs use filters and have reporting mechanisms for subscribers. Spam is a global issue, with some originating outside the US. European officials claim the US is a major source of spam. The CAN-SPAM Act was passed by the 108th Congress in 2003, signed into law by President Bush, and went into effect in 2004. It allows commercial emails to be sent as long as they meet certain requirements, such as not having false or misleading transmission information in the header. The United States was listed as the largest spam producing country in April 2005, with South Korea coming in second. Tracing the origin of spam can be difficult due to spammers routing messages through other computers globally. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 sets guidelines for commercial emails, ensuring they are not deceptive, include a way to opt-out, and are clearly identified as advertisements. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 regulates commercial emails, requiring them to be non-deceptive, provide an opt-out option, and clearly labeled as advertisements. The Act excludes transactional or relationship messages from certain requirements, such as deceptive subject headings and opt-out mandates. The FTC issued regulations in December 2004 to define criteria for determining an email's primary purpose. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 allows sexually-oriented commercial emails to include a \"warning label\" in the subject heading, prescribed by the FTC. If the message initially viewable by the recipient does not contain the sexually oriented material, only a link to it, the warning label, opt-out, and physical address must be included in the initially viewable content. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 requires sexually-oriented commercial emails to include a \"warning label\" in the subject heading, as well as in the initially viewable email message. Sexually oriented material is defined as any material depicting sexually explicit conduct, unless it constitutes a small part of the whole. Businesses are prohibited from promoting themselves with false or misleading email transmission information. State laws related to spam are preempted, but other state laws not specific to electronic mail may still apply. Violators may be sued by the FTC, state attorneys general, and ISPs. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 imposes penalties of up to $2 million for violators who engage in unauthorized access to computers for sending deceptive commercial emails, falsifying header information, or using false identities for multiple email accounts. Penalties include fines, prison sentences, or both. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 imposes penalties for deceptive commercial emails, including unauthorized access to computers, falsifying header information, and using false identities for multiple email accounts. Sentencing enhancements are provided for certain acts, and rules to protect users of wireless devices from unwanted commercial messages were issued in August 2004. The act does not create a \"Do Not Email registry\" for consumers. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 requires consumers to opt-in before receiving commercial emails and mandates that commercial emails include an identifier like \"ADV\" in the subject line. The law also includes a provision for rewarding individuals who identify violators of the act. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 includes a provision to financially reward individuals who report violators of the act. Debate surrounds whether consumers should opt-in or opt-out of receiving unsolicited commercial emails. The Act requires senders to provide an opt-out option for recipients. Anti-spam groups argue for an opt-in system similar to the European Union's policy. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 allows individuals to report violators for financial rewards. There is a debate between opt-in and opt-out approaches for unsolicited commercial emails. Some U.S. groups prefer opt-in like the EU policy, which requires prior consent for sending commercial emails. The EU directive requires each member nation to pass its own law on email marketing. Congress chose opt-out over opt-in, allowing consumers to opt-out of commercial emails. A \"Do Not Email\" registry was considered but faced skepticism due to security concerns. Mr. Muris expressed doubts about the feasibility of a Do Not Email registry, stating it would be difficult to enforce. The FTC's position on the registry remained unchanged, with Congress needing to change the law to require its creation. Despite the passage of the CAN-SPAM Act, which did not mandate the registry, Mr. Muris commended Congress for addressing spam but emphasized that legislation alone would not solve the issue. The FTC's report to Congress on the Do Not Email registry concluded that without a system to authenticate email origins, the registry would not reduce spam and could potentially increase it. Spammers could misuse the registry for verifying email addresses, posing security, privacy, and enforcement challenges. The FTC's report highlighted the challenges of protecting children online and the ineffectiveness of proposed registry models and security techniques in controlling risks. A necessary prerequisite for a Do Not Email registry is an authentication system to prevent email origin misuse. The FTC proposed an email registry to prevent email origin falsification and encourage industry adoption of an authentication standard. If a standard doesn't emerge, the FTC may consider a federally mandated standard. Testing showed that 89% of online retailers honored opt-out requests. The CAN-SPAM Act requires clear identification of commercial emails as advertisements and proposes using labels like \"ADV\" in the subject line. It also suggests special labels like ADV-ADLT for adult-oriented spam. The Act mandates the FTC to prescribe warning labels for sexually-oriented emails within 120 days and submit a report within 18 months of enactment. The FTC rule, effective May 19, 2004, mandates the inclusion of \"SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT\" in the subject line and body of commercial emails containing sexually oriented material. This rule was adopted by the FTC on April 13, 2004, and does not require clear identification if the recipient has given prior consent. The FTC rule, effective May 19, 2004, requires the inclusion of \"SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT\" in commercial emails with sexually oriented material. The rule clarifies that visual images and written descriptions are included. The FTC charged seven companies for violating these laws, with four settling and paying $1.159 million in penalties. The rule also mandates the FTC to report to Congress on making commercial emails identifiable from the subject line. The FTC rule, effective May 19, 2004, requires the inclusion of \"SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT\" in commercial emails with sexually oriented material. The rule clarifies that visual images and written descriptions are included. The FTC charged seven companies for violating these laws, with four settling and paying $1.159 million in penalties. The rule also mandates the FTC to report to Congress on making commercial emails identifiable from the subject line. In June 2005, a report concluded that requiring UCE senders to use a prefix such as ADV probably would not result in less spam. Spam filters are more effective in empowering consumers to set email preferences to reduce unwanted UCE from spammers and marketers. Mandatory subject line labeling is seen as an imprecise tool that may only segregate labeled UCE from unlabeled UCE, with outlaw spammers unlikely to comply. The CAN-SPAM Act required email messages to be labeled, but there were concerns that legitimate marketers would comply while outlaw spammers would not. The act also mandated the FTC and FCC to take various actions, including issuing regulations for spam on wireless devices. The FTC routinely issues Notices of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the act, with more information available on their spam website. The FTC conducted a study on the effectiveness of rewarding individuals who identify spammers. The study concluded that without substantial rewards and assurance of receiving them, whistleblowers may not be willing to provide information. Recommendations included tying rewards to court orders, funding rewards through congressional appropriations, and limiting eligibility to insiders with valuable information. The FTC conducted a study on rewarding individuals for identifying spammers, recommending high rewards for insiders with valuable information. The act required the FTC to define criteria for determining an e-mail's primary purpose, with a final rule issued clarifying the distinction between commercial and non-commercial speech in e-mails. The FTC issued a final rule to define the primary purpose of an email as commercial or non-commercial. If an email contains commercial content and transactional or relationship content, it is deemed commercial if the recipient would likely interpret it as such. If an email contains only transactional or relationship content, it is not considered commercial. The FTC final rule defines commercial email as containing commercial advertisement or promotion of a product or service, including content on a commercial website. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates commercial electronic mail messages and transactional or relationship messages. The U.S. SAFE WEB Act allows the FTC to share information with foreign law enforcement agencies for investigating unfair and deceptive practices involving foreign commerce. On October 10, 2007, the FTC filed a civil lawsuit against an international enterprise for using spam to promote ineffective pills. The lawsuit involved defendants in the United States, Canada, and Australia. This action marked the first use of the U.S. SAFE WEB Act by the agency to collaborate with foreign partners in combating online threats like spam. The FTC's spam database received over 175,000 spam messages related to this operation. The FTC filed a civil lawsuit against a Detroit-based spam operation, Phoenix Avatar, for violating the CAN-SPAM Act by sending deceptive commercial emails. The DOJ also arrested two Detroit-area men associated with the company for sending spam with false headers. Phoenix Avatar made deceptive claims about a diet patch in the spam and did not provide a valid opt-out option. The men were charged under the CAN-SPAM Act for sending multiple commercial emails. The FTC filed criminal charges against men associated with Phoenix Avatar for violating the CAN-SPAM Act by sending deceptive commercial emails. The FTC also took legal action against Global Web Promotions, an Australian spam enterprise, for deceptive practices in selling diet patches and human growth hormone products. The FTC filed a complaint against six companies and five individuals for violating the CAN-SPAM Act by sending sexually-explicit emails without warning labels. A federal court issued a Temporary Restraining Order against the defendants. Additionally, four major ISPs filed civil suits under the CAN-SPAM Act against alleged spammers. The Massachusetts Attorney General filed a state CAN-SPAM case against DC Enterprises and its proprietor in July 2004, settling for $25,000. Some ISPs struggle to recover monetary judgments from spam cases. Microsoft won $620 million but collected only $500,000. The FTC enforces the CAN-SPAM Act and approved new provisions in 2008. The CAN-SPAM Act was clarified with four new provisions in 2008. These provisions address topics such as recipient opt-out requirements, defining the \"sender,\" including post office boxes as valid addresses, and adding a definition for the term \"person.\" The CAN-SPAM Act was updated in 2008 with four new provisions, including recipient opt-out requirements, defining the \"sender,\" allowing post office boxes as valid addresses, and clarifying the term \"person.\" The Commission's Statement of Basis and Purpose also discusses topics like transactional messages, opt-out timeframes, aggravated violations, and the application of CAN-SPAM to forward-to-a-friend campaigns. The FTC explains that sellers must comply with the CAN-SPAM Act when offering something in exchange for forwarding commercial messages. The report outlines findings from a 2007 workshop on spam and phishing threats, proposing action steps for stakeholders to mitigate harm. It also discusses the agency's role in protecting consumers and highlights results from a 2007 study on spam filtering by Internet service providers. The FTC hosted the \"Spam Summit: The Next Generation of Threats and Solutions\" in July 2007 to address issues such as defining the problem, deterring malicious spammers, and empowering consumers in the fight against spam and malware. The event was a follow-up to the FTC's 2003 Spam Forum and aimed to assess the effectiveness of the CAN-SPAM Act. The FTC concluded in December 2005 that the CAN-SPAM Act has been effective in promoting best practices among legitimate online marketers and reducing the volume of spam reaching individuals' inboxes. However, there is still a significant international dimension to spam, with an increase in malicious content like malware. Spammers are also using complex business arrangements to evade the law. Spammers are using complex business arrangements to evade the law and hide their identities by providing false information to domain registrars. The FTC did not recommend changes to the CAN-SPAM Act but encouraged the passing of the US SAFE WEB Act. Thirty-eight states have passed laws regulating spam. The CAN-SPAM Act preempts state spam laws, but not other state laws unrelated to electronic mail. California had a strict anti-spam law requiring opt-in for UCE, which influenced Congress to pass a federal law in 2003. Lawsuits have been filed under state laws, with Maryland's law being ruled unconstitutional in 2004. A judge ruled Maryland's anti-spam law unconstitutional for regulating commerce outside the state. Eric Menhart, a DC resident with a business in Maryland, sued a NY spammer. Maryland law prohibits unauthorized use of domain names in commercial emails. Menhart is appealing the ruling. In contrast, Virginia's anti-spam law led to convictions of two NC residents. According to spamlaws.com, Virginia's law prohibits sending unsolicited bulk emails with falsified routing information and allows jurisdiction over nonresidents using Virginia's computer networks. The first felony spam case in the US involved misrepresentation of email origins by Jaynes and DeGroot, with DeGroot's conviction later overturned. Jaynes, sentenced to nine years, appealed his conviction, which was upheld by the Virginia Court of Appeals. Virginia Attorney General plans to uphold the decision. Virginia Attorney General Robert McDonnell plans to ask the court to revoke bond and order Jaynes to begin serving his sentence."
