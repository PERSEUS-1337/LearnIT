    "content": "Many Indo-Pacific nations are responding to China's increasing influence and the perception of the United States' weakening commitment to the region. Regional states are developing new strategies to strengthen their geopolitical position independently. Concerns include Chinese military modernization, assertive maritime territorial claims, control of disputed waters, military presence in the South China Sea, and global expansion, such as the military base in Djibouti. Economic interdependence with China may also influence government policies. Indo-Pacific nations are adopting hedging strategies in response to China's increasing influence and the United States' perceived weakening commitment to the region. Economic interdependence with China plays a role in government policymaking, while other factors affecting the geostrategic balance include North Korea's nuclear power status, Japan's power projection capabilities, and the introduction of new military technologies. Indo-Pacific nations are accelerating the adoption of hedging strategies due to the Trump Administration's perceived retreat from its traditional role as guarantor of the liberal international order. This is important for Congress as it addresses U.S. interests in the region and oversees the Administration's policies towards allies and partners. The Administration's 2018 National Defense Strategy emphasizes the need to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific to deter aggression and ensure stability and free access. The Department of Defense Indo-Pacific Strategy Report emphasizes the need for a robust constellation of allies and partners in the region. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper highlighted the importance of being present in key locations to lead in the Indo-Pacific. Despite this focus on allies and partners, the Trump Administration has been perceived as less engaged in regional issues. The Trump Administration has been perceived as less engaged in regional issues, questioning the value of alliance relationships with Japan and South Korea. This has raised concerns among U.S. allies and partners in Asia about aligning too closely with the United States. The administration's trade policies have further complicated the strategic picture in the region. In response to evolving dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region, some allies are increasing defense budgets and forming new security networks to counter Chinese influence. Regional states are adjusting strategic calculations, with trends such as developing intra-Asian security partnerships and adopting an \"Indo-Pacific\" regional concept. Japan, Australia, and India are actively involved in these efforts. In response to evolving dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region, some allies are increasing defense budgets and forming new security networks to counter Chinese influence. Regional states are adjusting strategic calculations, with trends such as developing intra-Asian security partnerships and adopting an \"Indo-Pacific\" regional concept. Congress has sought to address questions about challenges and opportunities in the region, including the efficacy of the Trump Administration's strategy. Members of Congress have also demonstrated commitment to maintaining and expanding relationships in the Indo-Pacific through legislation like the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018. The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (ARIA) emphasizes the need for expanded security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region and highlights the importance of a strong U.S. military presence. It stresses the role of the United States in upholding the international system and supporting alliances and partnerships in the region. Relevant legislation includes the Indo-Pacific Cooperation Act of 2019 and resolutions reaffirming U.S. commitment to the region. Legislation related to Indo-Pacific cooperation and alliances includes S. 2547, S.Res. 183, H.Res. 349, S.Res. 67, H.Res. 127, S. 985, H.R. 2047, and H.R. 2123. Japan has been promoting the concept of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean regions as a single strategic space since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's speech in 2007. Tokyo's security concerns about China's increasing power and influence have been heightened by a territorial dispute over islands in the East China Sea. Abe aims to establish a regional order amidst Sino-Japanese relations stabilizing in recent years. Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy aims to establish a regional order not dominated by China, seeking new partners to counter China's influence. Abe coined the concept of the \"Indo-Pacific,\" expanding the strategic landscape to include the South Asian subcontinent. Japan is concerned about the United States' waning power in the region and wants them to remain a dominant presence. The Trump Administration's Free and Open Indo-Pacific formulation emphasizes U.S. leadership and engagement, although Japan's strategy differs in how the region is geographically defined, extending to the east coast of Africa. Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy aims to establish a regional order not dominated by China, seeking new partners to counter China's influence. Japan and India are collaborating on the Asia Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) to develop economic linkages between Asia and Africa. Tokyo's focus in the Indo-Pacific is on infrastructure improvement, trade, and governance programs, in contrast to the Trump Administration's strategy which includes military elements. The Abe government aims to increase security cooperation as part of its Indo-Pacific strategy, releasing documents guiding national defense efforts. The 2019 National Defense Program Guidelines emphasize Japan's defense efforts independently of security cooperation with the United States, focusing on strengthening defense program and security cooperation with other countries. Japan emphasizes its defense capability as the ultimate guarantor of its security and aims to enhance capabilities in traditional security domains like land, air, and sea. The country also focuses on new domains such as cyber, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum. Japan places more emphasis on cooperation with Australia and India, rather than South Korea, while deepening defense cooperation with the United States to ensure China does not pose a threat. Japan has been strengthening its alliance with the United States for the past two decades, updating defense guidelines, allowing for collective self-defense activities, and pushing for broader engagement. Despite differences with U.S. foreign policy under the Trump Administration, Japan prioritizes its security strategy with the U.S. Many in Japan are concerned that President Trump's approach to North Korea may overlook Tokyo's primary concerns. Japan has concerns about North Korea's missile capabilities and the fate of abducted Japanese nationals. They are disappointed with the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord and TPP. Japan led efforts to salvage the TPP-11 agreement. In 2019, Japan reached a limited trade agreement with the U.S. but is uncertain about auto tariffs. In 2020, Japan will renegotiate its burden-sharing arrangement for U.S. military forces stationed on its territory. Japan's 2019 Medium Term Defense Program outlines a five-year expenditure plan of \u00a527,470 billion (US$250 billion), with a focus on modernizing weapons technology. This includes replacing old F-15 jets with F-35As, introducing STOVL F-35s, procuring a new type of destroyer, and retrofitting an Izumo-class helicopter carrier. The 2019 Medium Term Defense Program outlines Japan's plan to modernize its military with new weapons technology, including F-35 jets, destroyers, and retrofitting a helicopter carrier. Japan is also expanding its missile defense systems and increasing personnel levels by about three percent. This demonstrates Japan's commitment to enhancing its Self Defense Forces capabilities and taking on more security responsibilities. Japan is actively expanding security partnerships beyond the United States, with Australia being a key partner. Ties with Australia have become more institutionalized, with various economic and security pacts signed, including a $40 billion gas project. Both countries have agreements on security cooperation and equipment compatibility, making cooperation more accessible. Despite past WWII history, efforts have been made to strengthen the relationship. In 2014, Japanese Prime Minister Abe addressed the Australian parliament, expressing condolences for WWII history. In 2018, Abe visited Darwin, marking a significant gesture. Japan and Australia aim to maintain a stable Indo-Pacific region. Despite differences, they work towards closer defense ties. Japan and Australia aim to maintain a stable Indo-Pacific region through closer defense ties. Abe has pursued cooperation with India and Australia, supporting bilateral dialogues, mutual concerns, and educational exchanges. Japan and India have strengthened their relationship through mutual respect for democratic institutions, shared strategic and economic interests, and increased bilateral cooperation in response to China's assertive actions. Japanese investments in India, such as the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor project, play a significant role in providing regional alternatives to China's BRI. Prime Ministers Abe and Modi reaffirmed their commitment to economic and defense cooperation at the 13th annual India Japan Summit in October 2018. Joint military exercises between Japan and India now include army and air force components. Japan and India have expanded joint military exercises to include army and air force units in addition to the annual Malabar naval exercise. The primary challenge to establishing a quadrilateral arrangement is engaging India in a broader security framework. Japan has maintained economic and diplomatic engagement with ASEAN countries for several decades and has expanded the security dimension of its relationships with Southeast Asian countries under Abe's leadership, with a focus on maritime security with Vietnam. Japan, under Abe's leadership, has focused on maritime security with Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. They have participated in regional fora, deployed their Coast Guard to work with ASEAN countries, and promoted cooperation in anti-piracy, counter-terrorism, cyber security, and humanitarian assistance. Japan has also deepened ties with NATO, participating in exercises in the Baltic Sea and supporting efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. India supports NATO capacity building programs and endorses the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy. Despite its interest in closer ties with the US, India maintains a nonalignment posture and seeks balance in its relations with the US and China. India sees China as a powerful rival and is concerned about its growing presence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region. Prime Minister Modi envisions a free and open Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Modi envisions a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific, engaging with various countries in the region to balance China's influence. India's approach differs from the US' strategy by emphasizing inclusivity, not targeting any specific country, and avoiding dominance. India's foreign policy under Modi is seen as dynamic, aiming to turn its Look East policy into action. Under Modi, India is transforming its Look East policy into an Act East policy, with the inaugural Singapore-India-Thailand Maritime Exercise (SITMEX) in September 2019 seen as a demonstration of intra-Asian security networking. India's role as the western anchor of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific is questioned due to its focus on strategic autonomy and perceived lack of capacity to counterbalance China. Many in India view the U.S.-centric Indo-Pacific conception as excluding India's strategic interests to the west. Modi's victory in the 2019 elections has strengthened his leadership domestically. Modi's victory in the 2019 parliamentary elections has empowered him domestically and globally. This could lead to a stronger stance against Chinese assertiveness and closer ties with the United States. However, India's engagement with Russia and Iran may limit its alignment with America's interests. India welcomes the U.S. Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy but hesitates to confront China directly. Defense budget growth has been significant, but as a percentage of GDP, expenditures have decreased. India's defense budget for 2019-2020 allocates over half for salaries and pensions, with 70% going to the Indian Army. Modernization efforts are slow, with much equipment classified as \"vintage.\" Capital outlays have decreased, leading to a reliance on defense imports, mainly from Russia. Stalled reforms and ad hoc decision-making hinder modernization efforts. India is seeking to diversify its defense suppliers, including purchases from Israel and the United States. Despite interest in engaging with regional powers in the Indo-Pacific, the 2019 Modi/BJP election win is expected to continue New Delhi's multilateralist approach to international politics in Asia. Relations with China, Russia, and Iran could present challenges for strategic objectives. India's politics in Asia focus on stable relations with all powers, including China and Russia. It is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and has a strategic partnership with Japan as part of its \"Act East\" policy. India also engages in trilateral dialogues with the US and Japan, conducting naval exercises in the Bay of Bengal. Defense engagement with Australia is supported by a 2006 Memorandum. India-Australia defense engagement is supported by the 2006 Memorandum on Defence Cooperation and the 2009 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation. India's relations with China are tense due to border disputes, China's support for Pakistan, and growing influence in the Indian Ocean region. New Delhi is wary of Beijing's attempts to contain Indian influence regionally and globally. China's Belt and Road Initiative, particularly projects in Pakistan, are seen as a display of hegemonic intentions by many in India. Despite tensions with China over border disputes and Beijing's support for Pakistan, India maintains its largest trade partnership with China. New Delhi emphasizes an \"inclusive\" vision for the Indo-Pacific region and has cooperated with China on global trade and climate change issues. The \"Wuhan spirit\" from a 2018 summit aimed to manage differences through dialogue, with subsequent informal summits continuing this approach. India also maintains close ties with Russia for defense imports and energy resources, despite the enactment of the CAATSA in 2017. India's major arms purchases from Russia, including the S-400 air defense system, could lead to U.S. sanctions under CAATSA. India has friendly relations with Iran but stopped importing Iranian oil in response to U.S. sanctions. India's investment in Iran's Chabahar port is crucial for future trade with Central Asia. Australia is responding to increasing geopolitical uncertainty and the rise of China in the Indo-Pacific region by maintaining a strong alliance relationship with the United States, increasing defense spending, and seeking strategic partnerships with Japan, India, and others. Australia sees itself deeply embedded in the Indo-Pacific region, as outlined in the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper. Australia's Indo-Pacific strategy is shaped by its geography and broader interests. The region is seen as maritime, strategic, and geo-economic, with a focus on multi-polarity and connectivity. Australia values the Free and Open Indo-Pacific concept but is primarily concerned with maintaining a region that is open, inclusive, and respectful of sovereignty. Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds emphasized the importance of a peaceful resolution of disputes without coercion or force. Australia's vision for the Indo-Pacific region includes peaceful dispute resolution, open markets for trade and ideas, and strong economic and security ties. The country's perception of China has shifted due to concerns about Chinese influence in domestic affairs, leading to measures to counter this influence. Australia has taken measures to counter China's growing influence, including passing new laws on espionage and foreign interference. They have also blocked Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei from involvement in their 5G network. Australia is particularly concerned about Chinese political engagement, investment, and influence operations in the Pacific Islands. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull expressed concern about China establishing military bases in the region. Australia has increased its focus on the South Pacific in response to Chinese development aid to Pacific island states. This includes Prime Minister Morrison's visits to Vanuatu and Fiji, increased aid to Pacific island states, and joint development of the Lombrum naval facility on Manus Island. The Pacific Islands receive 31% of Australia's foreign assistance budget. Australia, New Zealand, and the United States held a Pacific Security Cooperation Dialogue in June 2018. Australia, Japan, and the United States discussed security issues and cooperation with Pacific Island countries in the Pacific Security Cooperation Dialogue in June 2018. Responding to China's influence, Australia is focusing on economic engagement in the Pacific and developing alternatives to China's Belt and Road initiative. The three nations share the need for sustainable infrastructure development in Asia, with estimates suggesting $26 trillion needed by 2030. Australia's 2017 DFAT white paper highlighted the importance of trade in the Indo-Pacific region. The DFAT white paper highlighted the use of trade and investment for strategic influence and commercial advantage in the Indo-Pacific region. Export Finance Australia supports infrastructure development in the Pacific through loans and insurance options. In 2018, the US, Australia, and Japan signed a Memorandum of Understanding for joint infrastructure investment in the region. The United States, Australia, and Japan signed a Trilateral Memorandum of Understanding to support infrastructure investment in the Indo-Pacific region, aiming to enhance digital connectivity and energy infrastructure. This initiative is seen as a response to China's regional ambitions. Australia also backs the Pacific Islands Forum for cooperation among Pacific nations. The Pacific Islands Forum aims to enhance cooperation among Pacific governments. Australia views the United States as its key strategic partner in the Asia-Pacific region, demonstrated through military exercises. Concerns have arisen in Australia about its relationship with the U.S. under President Trump's leadership, but support for the ANZUS Alliance remains high among Australians. The 2019 Lowy Institute poll found that 73% of Australians support the ANZUS Alliance with the U.S. due to shared values. A study from the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney suggests a need for collective defense in the Indo-Pacific to counterbalance China's growing strength. The 2019 Australia-U.S. Ministerial consultations highlighted the importance of alliances and partnerships for regional security. The rotational deployment of U.S. Marines in Darwin reached 2,500 personnel in 2019, strengthening the alliance and deepening engagement with regional partners. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced joining the U.S.-led effort to protect shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. Australia's budget for 2019-20 focuses on enhancing regional security and defense capability, with a commitment to grow the Defense budget to two percent of GDP by 2020-21. The Australian government will allocate $38.7 billion in 2019-20 for defense, with a total investment of over $200 billion in defense capabilities by 2028. This includes acquiring key weapons systems such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and P-8A Poseidon aircraft. The Royal Australian Air Force has received 2 F-35A Joint Strike fighters out of a total order of 72. Australia is also acquiring nine Hunter class frigates and 12 Shortfin Barracuda submarines to enhance defense capabilities and interoperability with allies. Australia is enhancing its defense capabilities by acquiring key weapons systems and vehicles, including 12 Shortfin Barracuda submarines, 211 Combat Reconnaissance Vehicles, and unmanned maritime patrol aircraft. The country is also increasing security cooperation with other Asian states in response to shifts in geostrategic dynamics, as seen in joint military exercises with India and Japan. This reflects common concerns about a rising China and the relative decline of U.S. engagement in the region. The exercises between Australia and India highlight shared concerns about China's rise and its impact on the Indo-Pacific strategic order. This shift in regional security architecture moves towards security networks among middle powers in Asia, complementing their ties with the United States. Australia is pursuing deeper partnerships with Indo-Pacific democracies like Japan, Indonesia, India, and South Korea to strengthen economic, security, and people-to-people links. Australia is strengthening relationships with Indo-Pacific countries through cooperation and people-to-people links. They are committed to trilateral dialogues with the United States and Japan, as well as with India and Japan. Australia is open to working with partners in plurilateral arrangements and has been developing economic and security cooperation with Vietnam, including upgrading their relationship to a \"Strategic Partnership.\" Bilateral trade between Australia and Vietnam grew by 19.4% in 2018. Naval ships visited Cam Ranh Bay in May 2019 as part of increasing naval cooperation between nations. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison visited Vietnam in August 2019, discussing tensions in the South China Sea with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. France and the UK have deepened their strategic posture in the Indo-Pacific, supporting U.S. interests through relations, arms sales, and military cooperation. France and the UK are strengthening defense capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region by networking with like-minded nations to maintain regional stability and uphold international norms. This aligns with the United States' goal of deterring challenges to security norms, such as China's activities in the South China Sea and North Korea. European countries have also deployed naval vessels to enforce UN Security Council resolutions. France has extensive interests in the Indo-Pacific region, with 1.6 million French citizens living in French territories and a 9 million square kilometer exclusive economic zone. They have military installations in Djibouti and the UAE, deploying about 7,000 military personnel in the region. France collaborates with Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in defense arrangements. The French Territory of New Caledonia, with a population of approximately 270,000, voted to remain part of France in a 2018 referendum. It holds 25% of the world's nickel reserves. French President Macron expressed concerns about China's growing influence in the region and plans to organize a meeting of Pacific island nations in 2020. France faces challenges in realizing its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific due to competition for regional influence and domestic factors. France's defense activities in the Indo-Pacific region have deepened in recent years due to various factors, including concerns about China's growing influence. The French government's defense strategy for the Indo-Pacific aims to maintain ties with territories in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean while developing strategic relations with key regional states like India, Australia, Japan, and Vietnam. The French government's defense strategy in the Indo-Pacific region focuses on addressing strategic dynamics such as the China-U.S. competition, the decline of multilateralism, and the shrinking geostrategic space. Their priorities include defending sovereignty, ensuring security through cooperation, and maintaining free access to the commons. During Macron's visit to India in March 2018, France and India expanded their strategic partnership, agreeing to hold biannual summits and signing agreements for reciprocal logistics support. They aim to deepen bilateral ties based on shared principles of democracy, freedom, rule of law, and human rights. Additionally, a Joint Strategic Vision of India-France Cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region highlights their shared concerns about emerging challenges in the region. India also signed a deal with France to purchase 36 Dassault Rafale multi-role aircraft. France and India have strengthened their strategic partnership, with India purchasing 36 Dassault Rafale aircraft from France. France is also enhancing its defense relationships with Australia, Japan, and Vietnam, aiming to promote stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Macron and Abe agreed to increase cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, while Australia and France are collaborating on cyberterrorism and defense. Additionally, France was awarded a contract to build submarines for Australia. Minister Abe agreed to increase cooperation with France to promote stability in the Indo-Pacific during his visit in October 2018. France and Vietnam signed a Defense Cooperation Pact in 2009 and upgraded to a Strategic Partnership in 2013. The UK is also focusing more on the Indo-Pacific, possibly due to Brexit, seeking expanded trade relations in the region. UK Secretary of State for Defence Gavin Williamson emphasized the importance of standing united with allies to counter threats during the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore in 2018. The UK is working on a strategic approach to the Indian Ocean region, focusing on security, stability, and environmental sustainability. In 2018, Royal Navy ships were deployed to the Indo-Pacific region, and a new naval support facility was opened in Bahrain. HMS Queen Elizabeth may be deployed to the Pacific in 2020. In August 2018, HMS Albion sailed near the disputed Paracel Islands, prompting China to protest. China strongly protested the UK's operation in the Indo-Pacific region, calling it a provocation. The UK has ties to several states in the region and participates in regional security groups like the Five Power Defence Arrangement. The UK has also shown interest in establishing new military bases in Southeast Asia, with Brunei and Singapore being potential locations. In 2013, Australia and the UK signed a new Defence and Security Cooperation Treaty to enhance bilateral defense cooperation. Australia also agreed to purchase nine new Type 26 frigates from UK defense contractor BAE Systems. In August 2017, the UK and Japan agreed on a Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to strengthen their global security partnership. The two nations hold regular Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meetings. The UK has been increasing its presence in the Indo-Pacific region through various military exercises and cooperation with countries like Japan and France. This engagement could potentially serve as an alternative to U.S. leadership in the region as countries hedge against a rising China. ASEAN members are also closely watching these developments. ASEAN members are concerned about the evolving strategic dynamics in the region, particularly the potential for extended rivalry between the US and China. New Indo-Pacific formulations raise worries about weakening ASEAN's role in regional discussions. The group faces challenges due to diverging views among its members and decision-making by consensus. Individual ASEAN members have responded by increasing defense spending. ASEAN members have responded to new regional dynamics by expanding defense spending and adopting Indo-Pacific visions. In July 2019, ASEAN leaders agreed on the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, influenced by plans from the US, Japan, and India. ASEAN aims to maintain its \"ASEAN centrality\" in Asian regionalism. ASEAN has traditionally been a diplomatic hub in East Asia, convening powers to discuss security and economic issues. The US Administration reassured ASEAN of its importance in the Indo-Pacific, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasizing ASEAN's central role in shaping the region's diplomatic, security, and economic arrangements. The Indo-Pacific Outlook statement highlighted ASEAN's significance in leading the economic and security architecture of the region. ASEAN is urged to lead in shaping the economic and security architecture of the region, without creating new mechanisms but enhancing existing ones. Cooperation with other regional mechanisms is encouraged in specific areas of interest. Four key areas of cooperation in the Indo-Pacific are identified: maritime cooperation, connectivity improvement, meeting the 2030 U.N. Agenda for Sustainable Development, and economic cooperation including trade facilitation, digital economy, small and medium enterprises, and addressing climate change and disaster risk management. ASEAN plays a key role in regional security by convening various forums with other governments, including the ASEAN Regional Forum and East Asia Summit. They have taken on a more active security role in recent years, with initiatives like the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus. ASEAN, comprising States, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Russia, has become more active in hosting multilateral dialogues and exercises, signaling a desire to maintain independence from dominant external powers. China's attempts to influence ASEAN members based on their interests have been noted. Since 2013, ASEAN has been negotiating with China to establish a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea, rejecting proposals like pledging to avoid military exercises with \"outside\" countries. Indonesia plays a key role in promoting Indo-Pacific concepts, positioning itself as a bridge between the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. Despite leading the Non-Aligned Movement, Indonesia is cautious about deepening security ties with the US or China. Indonesia has deepened security cooperation with the US, focusing on expanding defense capabilities and maritime security. Despite plans to increase military spending, Indonesia remains cautious about aligning too closely with either the US or China. The country is also involved in South China Sea tensions due to its delicate relationship with China. The relationship between Indonesia and China is characterized by deep economic interdependence but significant strategic mistrust. Periodic violence against the Indonesian-Chinese community complicates Jakarta-Beijing relations. A 2018 Pew survey showed a decline in Indonesians' positive view of China, with 53% holding a favorable opinion. Singapore is a key security partner of the US in Southeast Asia, aiming to balance between major powers in the region. Singapore acts as a balancer between major powers in the region, participating in defense partnerships while remaining cautious of anti-China rhetoric. Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan emphasized the need for cooperation between the US and China, warning against viewing China as an adversary to be contained. Singapore was the last nation to agree to ASEAN's Indo-Pacific Outlook statement, considering it unproductive. Singapore, as a balancer between major powers in the region, remains cautious of anti-China rhetoric. Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan emphasized the need for cooperation between the US and China, warning against viewing China as an adversary to be contained. Singapore was the last nation to agree to ASEAN's Indo-Pacific Outlook statement, considering it unproductive and potentially raising tensions with China and the United States. Balakrishnan expressed skepticism towards the Trump Administration's FOIP concept, stating that it lacks sufficient resolution. Despite this, Singapore has worked on developing new security arrangements, including a close partnership with Australia for military training facilities expansion and enhanced intelligence sharing. Singapore has expanded training access in Australia and enhanced intelligence sharing, including in counter-terrorism. They held a trilateral naval exercise with India and Thailand in the Andaman Sea, making it an annual event. Singapore is negotiating with India for access to live-fire drills facilities. They maintain strong security ties with the United States through the 2005 \"Strategic Framework Agreement,\" allowing U.S. military access to Singapore facilities on a rotational basis. Singapore has a strong security relationship with the United States, allowing U.S. military access to facilities on a rotational basis. The U.S. Navy coordinates warship deployment and logistics in the region from a logistical command unit in Singapore. Singapore is a significant market for U.S. military goods, with over $37.6 billion in defense articles exported since 2014. Singapore military personnel participate in training and exercises at U.S. military bases, and Singapore has operated fighter jet detachments in the U.S. for 26 years. Singapore has a strong security relationship with the United States, allowing U.S. military access to facilities. Singapore also has an extensive relationship with Taiwan, including a security agreement for troops training. Despite adhering to a one-China policy, Singapore has managed to maintain strong relations with Beijing while pushing back against problematic Chinese behavior. Singapore has worked to smooth ties with China, possibly as a hedge against U.S. disengagement from the region. In 2016, Singapore supported an international tribunal's ruling against China's claims in the South China Sea. Vietnam has increased its defense capabilities and military budget significantly from 2009 to 2019, including purchasing new military equipment from Russia. This was in response to China's actions in the South China Sea, allowing Vietnam to project power and defend its maritime interests. Vietnam has bolstered its defense capabilities by purchasing new military equipment from Russia, engaging in maritime military diplomacy, and cooperating with countries like the United States, Japan, and India to counterbalance the strategic environment. The United States has provided Vietnam with military assistance, including coast guard patrol boats, to enhance its maritime security capacity. The United States has expanded its assistance to Vietnam by transferring a decommissioned U.S. Coast Guard Hamilton-class cutter and providing Scan Eagle Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and T-6 trainer aircraft. In March 2018, the USS Carl Vinson visited Da Nang, marking the first U.S. aircraft carrier visit since the Vietnam War. Vietnam's cooperation with the United States' Indo-Pacific strategy is limited due to its \"omnidirectional\" foreign policy approach. Vietnam follows a \"clumping bamboo\" strategy in its foreign policy, maintaining ties with various countries including the United States, Japan, India, and China. Despite increasing rivalry with Beijing, Vietnam considers its relationship with China as crucial and often coordinates its diplomatic and military actions with China in mind. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner, and the two countries share similar political systems and world-views. Vietnam's foreign policy includes maintaining ties with various countries, including the United States, Japan, India, and China. Despite rivalry with China, Vietnam values its relationship with China and coordinates its actions with China in mind. Vietnam's \"Three Nos\" defense policy limits military alliances, aligning with one country against another, and foreign military bases on its soil. This approach may hinder Vietnam from fully partnering with the Trump Administration's Indo-Pacific strategy if aimed against China, but Vietnam has shown flexibility in defense cooperation in the past. Vietnam's foreign policy involves maintaining ties with various countries, including the United States, Japan, India, and China. Despite rivalry with China, Vietnam values its relationship with China. The country's defense policy limits military alliances and foreign military bases on its soil. Vietnam is expected to quietly expand cooperation with the United States and its partners in the absence of major shocks. U.S. allies and partners are developing closer strategic relations in the Indo-Pacific to hedge against China's rise. Congress needs to consider how the U.S. should respond to these emerging intra-Asian strategic relationships. Some analysts question if the Trump Administration's skepticism of allies is impacting U.S. ability to work with Japan, South Korea, and Australia in developing new security arrangements. Concerns have been raised about future alliance arrangements due to requests for increased monetary contributions. The Administration's lack of interest in multilateral trade agreements like the TPP may also affect perceptions of regional allies. Congress may consider U.S. key interests in the region and the role of cooperation with allies in promoting these interests in the region's new security architecture. The role of U.S. allies in promoting U.S. interests in the region's new security architecture is a key concern. Political developments in countries like the Philippines, Thailand, and India raise questions about Congress's role in shaping U.S. strategy in the region. The Trump Administration's approach and the balance between American values and interests are also important considerations for Congress. Congress has consistently guided U.S. policy in Asia through legislation like the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018. It emphasizes the importance of U.S. leadership in the Indo-Pacific region and the need to assess the impact of military spending and security arrangements on this goal."
