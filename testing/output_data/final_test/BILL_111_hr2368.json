    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2009\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program, established within the Environmental Protection Agency, aims to promote water-efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting WaterSense labeled products in the marketplace as preferred technologies. The WaterSense program promotes water-efficient technologies and services to reduce water use and ensure product performance. It also aims to enhance public awareness of the WaterSense label and establish performance standards for labeled products. Proper installation and maintenance of WaterSense plumbing products and irrigation systems are emphasized for optimal performance. The WaterSense program requires certified professionals to maintain product integrity, update criteria regularly, provide data on market shares, estimate water and energy savings, and seek public input on category changes. Prior to establishing or revising a WaterSense category, specification, or installation criterion, provide notice to interested parties and the public of any changes, along with an explanation and responses to comments. Lead time should be given before the effective date for new or significant revisions. The WaterSense program allows for the identification and implementation of voluntary approaches to improve water efficiency in various sectors. Appropriations of $7,500,000 for fiscal year 2010, $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year are authorized. The WaterSense program authorizes appropriations of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2013 and beyond, adjusted for inflation. Federal procurement of water efficient products is addressed in Section 3. In Section 3, federal procurement of water efficient products is defined, including terms like \"agency,\" \"WaterSense product or service,\" \"WaterSense program,\" and \"FEMP designated product.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the criteria for water efficiency ratings and designations under relevant programs. The procurement of water efficient products by federal agencies must meet specific requirements, such as using WaterSense or FEMP designated products. WaterSense plumbing products should ideally be installed by certified plumbers. Certification guidelines do not exist for WaterSense products, but they should be installed, maintained, and audited by a WaterSense-certified irrigation professional. Exceptions to procuring WaterSense products include cost-effectiveness and availability issues. The agency must include criteria for WaterSense products and FEMP designated products in procurement specifications for water consuming products and systems. Additional measures for reducing water consumption should also be considered, such as water reuse and recycling technologies. The procurement specifications must include criteria for WaterSense products and FEMP designated products. Water reuse, recycling technologies, leak detection, and waterless products should be considered to reduce water consumption. WaterSense and FEMP products must be prominently displayed in federal catalogs. The Environmental Protection Agency must issue regulations within 180 days of this Act's enactment to ensure that buyer's functional requirements consider energy, water, and wastewater cost savings for WaterSense and FEMP designated products. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like Administrator, eligible entity, incentive program, and residential water efficient product or service for the Early Adopter Water Efficient Products Incentive Programs. The term \"residential water efficient product or service\" refers to products or services for single-family or multifamily residences that are rated for water efficiency by the WaterSense program or an approved incentive program. Categories include faucets, irrigation technologies, water treatment devices, toilets, and showerheads. Eligible entities for allocation must establish an incentive program. The Administrator establishes an incentive program for residential water efficient products or services. Entities must apply for an allocation and assure it will supplement existing funds. The amount allocated is determined annually based on program needs. The Administrator establishes an incentive program for residential water efficient products or services. Entities must apply for an allocation based on population served, targeted population, program effectiveness, and prior year's unused allocation. Funds allocated must be used effectively by the entity. Entities allocated funds under the incentive program can use up to 50% for establishing and running incentive programs. They are encouraged to promote fixture recycling programs. Financial incentives can be given to consumers meeting program requirements, with the entity having the option to delegate administration to other organizations. The incentive amount is determined by the entity. The allocation under subsection (c) for residential water efficient products, available tax incentives, consumer behavior change costs, and consumer expenditures for product installation. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2010-2014 totaling $450,000,000."
