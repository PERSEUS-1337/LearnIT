    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hydrogen Fuel Cell Commercialization Act of 1995\". Congress recognizes the limitations of fossil fuels and the need for research and development in new energy sources like hydrogen, which can be extracted from water and solid waste. Inefficiencies in hydrogen production are a barrier to its widespread use, prompting the need for a multiyear research initiative. A demonstration-commercialization project is proposed for efficient hydrogen fuel production using solid waste and a photovoltaic facility. The current Federal effort for hydrogen fuel development is deemed inadequate. The project aims to produce hydrogen for fuel cells, with by-products of electric power, heat, and pure water. The purposes of this Act are to direct the Secretary of Energy to conduct a research, development, and demonstration-commercialization program for hydrogen production and usage, provide advice from academia and the private sector, and ensure immediate implementation of demonstration-commercialization projects. In this Act, the Department refers to the Department of Energy, a demonstration-commercialization project involves producing hydrogen from waste for fuel cells using specific facilities, and the Secretary refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy shall conduct a hydrogen energy research, development, and demonstration-commercialization program to enable the private sector to demonstrate the feasibility of using hydrogen for various applications. Priorities for Federal funding will be established based on private sector hydrogen activities. The Secretary of Energy will solicit proposals for research and development activities related to hydrogen within 180 days of enacting an appropriations Act. Proposals may be considered from contractors managing department facilities, with awards to be made within the same timeframe. The Secretary of Energy will award financial assistance for worthy research proposals within 180 days of submission, requiring a 25% cost sharing commitment from non-Federal sources. The non-Federal requirement may be reduced or eliminated for research of basic or fundamental nature. The Secretary may reduce the non-Federal cost sharing requirement for development or demonstration proposals if necessary due to technological risks and to align with the goals of the Act. The Act outlines the non-Federal commitment required for projects, including cash, personnel, services, equipment, and facilities. Before providing financial assistance, consultation with the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce is necessary to ensure consistency with international agreements. The Act requires industry participants to certify efforts to obtain non-Federal funding for projects and prohibits duplication of programs by the Secretary. SEC. 6. DEMONSTRATION-COMMERCIALIZATION PROJECT. The Secretary will assist in developing and operating a project with cost sharing not exceeding 50 percent. The non-Federal share includes cash, personnel, services, equipment, and other resources. SEC. 7. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. The Secretary will facilitate the exchange of nonproprietary technology and information among industry, academia, and government agencies to benefit the U.S. economy. Additionally, a central depository for technical information and technology transfer will be established. SEC. 8. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\nThe Secretary must provide Congress with a detailed report on the Department's hydrogen research program every 18 months, including an analysis by the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel and recommendations for program improvements.\n\nSEC. 9. COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION. SEC. 9. COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION.\n\nThe Secretary will coordinate hydrogen research activities with other federal agencies and consult with the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel. Authorization of appropriations for research, development, and demonstration projects: $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1997, $35,000,000 for fiscal year 1998, and $40,000,000 for fiscal year 1999. For the demonstration-commercialization project: $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1997 and $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1998."
