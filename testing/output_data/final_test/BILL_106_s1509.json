The Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 should be strengthened by including all Federal programs that emphasize the value of work in a demonstration program of an Indian or Alaska Native organization. This initiative should have the support of officials with policymaking authority from the Department of the Interior and other relevant Federal agencies.
