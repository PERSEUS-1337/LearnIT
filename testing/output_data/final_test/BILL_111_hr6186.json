    "content": "The \"Cutting Earmarks And Savings Enforcement (CEASE) Act\" establishes a discretionary deficit reduction account under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The \"CEASE Act\" establishes a deficit reduction Discretionary Account under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, maintained by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Each entry in the Account corresponds to subcommittees of the Committee on Appropriations and consists of the deficit reduction Balance. Amounts credited to the Account are based on reductions in new budget authority proposed by Members or Senators through amendments to appropriation bills. The \"CEASE Act\" establishes a deficit reduction Discretionary Account under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Amendments to appropriation bills can result in reductions in new budget authority, which are credited to the deficit reduction Balance. The Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or Senate credits amounts of new budget authority and outlays equal to reductions resulting from amendments to appropriation bills for deficit reduction. The chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or Senate will only count portions of amendments agreed to that are designated for deficit reduction, including earmarks. The chairman will maintain a tally of adopted amendments reflecting increases in deficit reduction. The tally of amendments adopted will reflect increases and decreases in budget authority in the bill as reported to its House, available to Members or Senators during bill consideration. The calculation of savings in deficit reduction accounts in the House of Representatives and Senate involves counting budget authority and outlays against the allocation provided to the Committee on Appropriations. The 302(b) allocation for a subcommittee's appropriation bill is reduced by the budget authority and outlays when the bill is engrossed. The term 'appropriation bill' includes general or special bills, as well as supplemental, deficiency, or continuing appropriations through fiscal year 2011 or later. Establishment of mandatory deficit reduction account under Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate establish a 'deficit reduction Mandatory Account' divided into entries for committees receiving allocations under the budget resolution, excluding the Committee on Appropriations. Each entry includes the 'First Year deficit reduction Account' and the 'Five Year deficit reduction Account'. Entries only include amounts credited under the calculation of Account Savings in the House and Senate. Upon the engrossment of any bill by the House of Representatives or Senate, the budget authority and outlays shall be counted against the allocation provided to the committee that reported the bill. If an amendment reduces mandatory budget authority, the Member or Senator offering the amendment may specify the reduction amount. Upon the engrossment of any bill by the House of Representatives or Senate, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget shall credit reduction amounts to the applicable entry balances. Upon the engrossment of any bill, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget credits reduction amounts to entry balances, with net reductions in budget authority and outlays from amendments agreed to by the House or Senate being computed accordingly. The chairman of the Committee on the Budget in the House of Representatives and Senate must track amendments that increase or decrease budget authority in a bill. This information must be available to Members or Senators during bill consideration. The term 'appropriation bill' includes general or special appropriation bills, as well as bills for supplemental, deficiency, or continuing appropriations through fiscal year 2011 or later. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENT. The table of contents in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is amended to include new items related to discretionary and mandatory deficit reduction accounts."
