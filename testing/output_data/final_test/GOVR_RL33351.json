    "content": "The United States has an estimated 11 million unauthorized aliens, with 500,000 more entering each year. Around 1 million aliens are apprehended annually trying to enter illegally. Many come for economic opportunities or to escape strife, but some are criminals or terrorists. This leads to a black market for fraudulent documents, which can be used by criminals and terrorists to evade law enforcement. Some argue that making it harder for unauthorized aliens to find jobs in the United States would deter criminals and terrorists from staying in the country. The conflict in political will between preventing illegal entry of potential threats and providing labor for industries has been a longstanding issue, dating back to the arrival of Irish immigrants in the mid-1800s. The difficulty in distinguishing between unauthorized aliens and potential terrorists or criminals raises concerns about national security. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of reducing the unauthorized alien population in the United States without disrupting the economy. It raises questions about the effectiveness of current laws and enforcement methods, and whether other agencies should be involved in immigration enforcement. The report provides an analysis of immigration enforcement in the United States, covering various aspects such as detention, removal, alien smuggling, document fraud, worksite enforcement, and border patrolling. It also discusses the role of state and local law enforcement in immigration enforcement and compares resources allocated to different enforcement activities. The report analyzes immigration enforcement in the United States, covering detention, removal, alien smuggling, document fraud, worksite enforcement, and border patrolling. It discusses resource allocation for different enforcement activities and highlights issues related to the Department of Homeland Security's structure. Different workload measures are used for each activity, making comparisons challenging. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, immigration enforcement priorities changed. The report analyzes enforcement activities pre and post FY2001 using agent work hours data from the Department of Homeland Security's Performance Analysis System. Data is limited to FY1992 through FY2003 due to a switch in accounting systems in 2004. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) switched to TECS, making data from 2004 onwards incomparable with previous years. Immigration enforcement priorities changed after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Data for FY2004 is incomplete in both PAS and TECS systems due to a switch in accounting systems. Immigration enforcement includes regulating violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act, involving civil and criminal provisions. Immigration inspectors have a dual role of enforcement and adjudicative functions. Immigration inspectors have a dual role of enforcement and adjudicative functions, responsible for keeping out those who seek to harm U.S. interests while letting bona fide travelers in. Denying entry does not necessarily mean a violation of the INA unless fraud is involved. Some argue that denying benefits to aliens is an enforcement function, while others see it as purely adjudicative. Immigration enforcement is part of a comprehensive homeland security strategy. Immigration enforcement is part of a comprehensive homeland security strategy that unifies law enforcement operations. Former INS Commissioner James Zigler emphasized the need to focus on terrorists and national security threats, not economic refugees. Immigration enforcement has shifted towards anti-terrorism efforts post-9/11, with a significant number of foreign-born terrorists violating immigration laws. Since 1993, terrorists in the United States have violated immigration laws, suggesting that stricter enforcement could disrupt their plans. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) grants immigration officials authority to interrogate aliens, make arrests, conduct searches, and inspect applicants for admission without a warrant. This law makes no distinction in its enforcement. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) grants immigration officials authority to enforce laws without distinction between different types of employees. Specific DHS personnel, including border patrol, are designated for law enforcement activities. Important immigration enforcement legislation includes the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which addresses illegal immigration control and employer sanctions. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 addressed illegal immigration control and employer sanctions. Subsequent legislation such as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and USA Patriot Act of 2001 further enhanced immigration enforcement measures. The Enhanced Border Control and Visa Reform Act of 2002, Homeland Security Act of 2002, National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, and REAL ID Act of 2005 implemented various measures to enhance immigration enforcement, including the development of electronic data systems, transfer of INS functions to DHS, expansion of grounds for inadmissibility and deportation, and establishment of guidelines for removal cases. The Enhanced Border Control and Visa Reform Act of 2002, Homeland Security Act of 2002, National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, and REAL ID Act of 2005 implemented measures to enhance immigration enforcement, including border infrastructure improvements, verification of legal status for driver's licenses, and deportation for terrorism-related grounds. Questions have been raised about the distinction between interior and border enforcement, with some viewing interior enforcement as a continuum of border enforcement. Certain aspects of interior enforcement, such as fugitive taskforces and investigations of alien slavery, do not require close coordination between DHS Customs and Border Protection. In FY2004, CBP referrals only accounted for 23% of all ICE criminal investigations. A GAO report in October 2004 found that ICE has incorporated all objectives of the INS interior enforcement strategy to strengthen homeland security. The strategy prioritized detention and removal of criminal aliens, dismantling alien smuggling operations, addressing community complaints about illegal immigration, combating immigrant benefit fraud, and addressing unauthorized employer use. The strategy aimed to deter illegal immigration, prevent immigration-related crimes, and remove those illegally in the United States. Two ICE offices, the Office of Investigations (OI) and the Office of Detention and Removal (DRO), are responsible for immigration interior enforcement functions. OI addresses smuggling, benefit fraud, community complaints, and worksite enforcement, while DRO identifies and removes criminal aliens with some assistance from OI. The compliance unit within ICE's National Security Investigations Division analyzes data from various databases to identify potential violators. After September 11, 2001, the USBP focused on preventing the entry of terrorists and weapons of mass destruction by targeting known smuggling operations. Intelligence and surveillance operations were directed at detecting and deterring terrorist entry. The USBP focuses on preventing terrorist entry and alien smuggling from significant interest countries. They coordinate intelligence with Canadian and Mexican authorities. Despite increased border enforcement, unauthorized aliens continue to enter the US. The INA includes criminal and civil components for violations such as alien smuggling and lack of legal status. Being illegally present in the U.S. is a civil violation, leading to deportation through administrative processes. Criminal violations of the INA include felonies and misdemeanors prosecuted in federal courts, such as bringing in and harboring undocumented aliens, illegal entry, and reentry of previously deported aliens. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) combined \"exclusion\" and \"deportation\" proceedings into a single removal proceeding under INA \u00a7237, which specifies six broad classes of deportable aliens including those who commit certain criminal offenses, fail to register, are security risks, become a public charge, or vote unlawfully. In removal proceedings, an immigration judge determines if an alien is removable after receiving a notice to appear. Removal proceedings are the exclusive procedure for determining if an alien should be removed from the United States, with exceptions like expedited removal. Those who are removed may face bars to reentry, and deportation is considered a civil, not criminal, process without the right to counsel or a jury. Deportation is not considered punishment, leading to limited rights such as no counsel, jury trial, or strong due process protections. Congress can introduce new immigration consequences retroactively. Expedited removal applies to aliens without proper documentation or who committed fraud, allowing for immediate removal without further review unless seeking asylum or fearing persecution. detained until removal. Expedited removal applies to aliens without proper documentation or who committed fraud, allowing for immediate removal without further review unless seeking asylum or fearing persecution. Aliens subject to expedited removal must be detained until they are removed and may only be released due to medical emergency or if necessary for law enforcement purposes. The Institutional Removal Program (IRP) allows removal proceedings for aliens convicted of crimes to be conducted in federal, state, and local prisons. Aliens must complete their criminal sentences before being removed from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issues a notice to appear (NTA) outlining charges against the alien to commence the removal proceeding. In removal proceedings, an ICE attorney must prove charges in the NTA, witnesses are presented, and the immigration judge rules on the alien's removability or eligibility for relief. Failure to appear results in removal in absentia and inadmissibility for five years. Appeals can be made to the BIA and then to a federal court. Most removed aliens do not undergo formal removal. Most aliens who are removed do not go through formal removal proceedings in front of an immigration judge. They are usually given the option to depart voluntarily from the United States, with voluntary departure available for aliens from contiguous territories. If they do not take this option, they may be subject to formal removal proceedings in front of a DOJ immigration judge, with ICE's Office of Detention and Removal managing their custody and removal. Voluntary departure allows aliens to leave the US without formal removal proceedings. They must request it before, during, or after proceedings, with specified departure time and possible conditions. Failure to depart results in penalties and ineligibility for 10 years. It is cheaper than formal removal as the government doesn't cover repatriation costs. The National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) was designed to apprehend and remove aliens who have failed to comply with removal orders, especially those convicted of crimes. The program aims to enforce every final removal order issued, targeting fugitive cases and prioritizing absconders. Despite these efforts, a significant number of non-detained aliens fail to leave the United States as ordered each year. The number of absconders has increased from 376,003 in FY2002 to 536,644 in FY2005, a 43% rise in three years. The increase may be linked to the rise in final removal orders issued. The Criminal Alien Program targets identifying and apprehending criminal aliens in various prisons to ensure their removal. The number of removals of criminal aliens has declined since FY2000, with a peak of 1.9 million removals in that year. The decline in total removals was mainly due to a decrease in voluntary departures. ICE and INS have historically struggled to identify all removable imprisoned aliens, leading to concerns about released aliens committing new crimes. The number of formal removals increased significantly after FY1996 due to more crimes being deportable offenses. The peak was in FY2005 with 204,193 aliens removed. The increase in FY2003 was due to streamlining the immigration appeals process by the Attorney General. The percentage of formal removals from the United States increased steadily between FY1996 and FY2003, then slightly decreased in FY2004. In FY1996, 4.2% of all removals were formal, compared to 17.6% in FY2003. Noncriminal aliens have comprised the majority of formally removed aliens since FY1996, with 42.7% of formally removed aliens being criminal in FY2005. The percentage of formal removals from the United States increased steadily between FY1996 and FY2003, then slightly decreased in FY2004. The three most common reasons for formal removals are attempted illegal entry, criminal grounds, and not in status. The government's ability to remove unauthorized aliens has been an ongoing issue for Congress. The proportion of formally removed aliens who were previously removed increased almost threefold between 1995 and 2004. There are an estimated 11 million unauthorized aliens in the United States. The INS had 1,944 on-duty special agents in June 2002. In June 2002, the INS had 1,944 on-duty special agents, fewer than the Dallas police department. There were 1,365 special agents to investigate fraud, smuggling, enforcement operations, and support local task forces. ICE agents are responsible for locating and arresting removable aliens, with approximately 4,784 unauthorized aliens per special agent in 2002. The number of ICE special agents increased from 5,449 in FY2003 to 5,769 in FY2005. Since the creation of DHS, it is unclear how much time ICE special agents spend on immigration enforcement compared to former U.S. Customs Service tasks. The number of agents dedicated to immigration enforcement may have increased, but the impact is unknown. Immigration court efficiency affects alien removal, with concerns about backlog in the Board of Immigration Appeals prompting changes by then Attorney General John Ashcroft. Federal appeals courts have seen a rise in immigration cases between FY2000 and FY2005. Between FY2000 and FY2005, immigration cases before federal appeals courts increased significantly. The workload of the courts also rose, with some judges criticizing the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) for shifting work to their courts. When a federal appeals judge overturns an immigration judge's decision, the case is sent back for a new hearing, prolonging the removal process and using more resources. This delay also impacts detention resources if the alien is being held. Deportation of long-term residents can be controversial due to established community ties and potential backlash. Some countries refuse to accept the return of nationals who entered the US as children, leading to challenges for those being deported. The deportation of long-term residents can be contentious due to community ties and challenges with some countries refusing to accept their nationals. The INA provides authority to detain aliens awaiting removal, with some subject to mandatory detention. Parole and bond decisions are not reviewable, and detained aliens often have committed crimes in the US. Detained aliens in the United States include those who have committed a crime, served their sentence, and are undergoing removal proceedings. The Office of Detention and Removal (DRO) in ICE is responsible for their daily detention, with mandatory detention required for certain criminal cases under the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). Mandatory detention is required for certain criminal and terrorist aliens who are removable, pending a final decision on removal. Detainees are categorized as required, high priority, medium priority, or lower priority, with higher priority aliens detained before lower priority ones. The USA-PATRIOT Act amended the INA to require detention of aliens involved in terrorist activities. In June 2005, 87% of detention bed space was filled with mandatory detainees, leading to a scarcity of bed space and the need for better management and alternative forms of detention. A lack of bed space can result in more released aliens not appearing for removal hearings or leaving the country after receiving final removal orders. To address this issue, DHS has implemented a pilot program in Hartford, Connecticut. The DHS pilot program in Hartford, Connecticut, expanded to Atlanta and Denver in March 2004, detains aliens with final removal orders to ensure their departure from the US. Despite an increase in DRO officer positions, actual hires were limited due to financial management issues, leading to a lack of officers to detain and remove aliens. Between FY1994 and FY2001, the noncitizen detention population steadily increased, with a slight decrease in FY2001-2002 and a steady rise until FY2004. A hiring freeze in ICE and DRO from March 2004 to May 2005 resulted from financial management issues, leading to no actual hires. The daily population decreased in FY2004-2005 but increased in FY2006, reaching 20,594, a 129% increase since FY1996. The growth in detained population post-FY1998 is attributed to increased detention space, not arrests. The increase in detained population post-FY1998 is due to more detention space, not more eligible detainees. Funding for detention exceeds the funded bedspace, leading to a need to reallocate funds. There is ongoing concern about insufficient detention space for noncitizens, especially with more classes subject to mandatory detention. The availability of detention space for lower priority detainees has been impacted by mandatory detention policies. Concerns have been raised about decisions to release aliens being based on space availability rather than individual case merits, leading to disparities in different geographic areas. The increase in noncitizens in DHS detention has raised questions about equitable policies. The increase in noncitizens in DHS detention has raised questions about the cost and resource imbalance in detaining noncitizens. ICE's funding and accounting difficulties, lack of coordination with CBP, and strain on resources have impacted detention and removal capabilities. There is no requirement for CBP to notify ICE of apprehension initiatives, leading to challenges in allocating detention resources. Similarly, ICE is not obligated to inform CBP of initiatives that may affect operations. Improved coordination between ICE and CBP may have reduced the negative impact of resource imbalances in detention and removal capabilities. However, DRO's removal functions are ultimately governed by appropriations, limiting the agency's ability to address resource constraints. INA \u00a7274 specifies criminal penalties for alien smuggling. INA \u00a7274 prohibits alien smuggling, with penalties for bringing in aliens illegally, transporting them within the US, harboring them, or aiding in their entry for immoral purposes. Alien smuggling is a transnational crime involving multiple countries, often with the alien's consent. Alien smuggling involves transporting aliens across borders with their consent, while human trafficking exploits aliens for long-term profits through exploitative arrangements like prostitution or forced labor. Trafficked aliens are considered victims under immigration law, while smuggled aliens may face criminal prosecution and deportation. Investigations into alien smuggling and trafficking are complicated by language barriers, humanitarian issues, and logistical challenges. Unlike drug trafficking cases, certain investigative techniques cannot be used due to the involvement of humans. Alien smuggling poses a significant risk to national security and public safety, with potential ties to terrorist activities. Criminal organizations profit billions from international alien smuggling and sex trafficking, using the funds to finance other illegal enterprises like drug and weapon trafficking. Witnesses, often unauthorized aliens, are crucial for prosecution but may fear retaliation. Unlike drug trafficking, human involvement complicates investigations. Alien smuggling generates billions in criminal revenues and leads to collateral crimes such as kidnapping, assault, robbery, and identity theft. Smugglers extort ransom from hostages and operate unsafe \"safe houses\" for aliens. Unsafe vehicles used by smugglers contribute to traffic accidents and border deaths. Alien smuggling leads to collateral crimes such as kidnapping, assault, robbery, and identity theft. Smugglers extort ransom from hostages and operate unsafe \"safe houses\" for aliens. Unsafe vehicles used by smugglers contribute to traffic accidents and border deaths. Alien smuggling-related activities may be prosecuted under various criminal statutes, including immigration document fraud and bribery. ICE reported seizing $7.8 million from alien smuggling investigations in FY2005. The Government Accountability Office found that a lack of coordination between the USBP and INS investigations program led to overlapping jurisdictions and autonomous operations. The abolishment of the INS and transfer of functions to DHS may have addressed some issues. ICE works to dismantle large-scale alien smuggling operations, but coordination between agencies is unclear, as seen in a compromised sting operation involving ICE and CBP. ICE collaborates with other law enforcement agencies to identify and dismantle transnational smuggling organizations, coordinating efforts within DHS and with foreign governments. They focus on investigating alien smuggling and are developing strategies that include critical incident response teams and asset seizure. ICE collaborates with other law enforcement agencies to identify and dismantle transnational smuggling organizations, focusing on alien smuggling and developing strategies to combat smuggling of aliens, drugs, and contraband. The agency places a significant emphasis on targeting smuggling organizations that pose threats to national security, as terrorists may align themselves with these networks to gain entry into the United States undetected. Factors such as increased sophistication in criminal enterprises have created an environment where terrorist and smuggling efforts may combine to pose a significant threat to national security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) focuses on combating smuggling organizations that pose a threat to national security, as terrorists could exploit these networks to enter the United States. The U.S. Border Patrol is responsible for intercepting smuggled aliens between ports of entry, with a focus on organizations linked to countries supporting terrorist groups like al Qaeda. ICE and CBP work together to combat smuggling organizations, with ICE handling cases involving significant scope or violence. The USBP refers cases to ICE based on intelligence analysis, and a recent GAO report highlighted the need for clarification of roles in anti-smuggling activities. ICE and CBP signed an MOU in 2004, with ICE taking on the responsibility of supporting and funding anti-smuggling units. ICE and CBP signed an MOU in 2004, with ICE taking on the responsibility of supporting and funding anti-smuggling units. ICE would lead certain designated cases and Joint Terrorism Task Force cases, while USBP would handle border-related interdiction activities. Both agencies are jointly responsible for sharing information and intelligence, with a need for a more comprehensive agreement on their working relationship. The MOU between ICE and CBP in 2004 established their interconnected missions in combating alien smuggling. However, there is a lack of tracking mechanism for cases referred to ICE by CBP, leading to missed opportunities in identifying large smuggling operations. Communication issues have also been reported between the two agencies during smuggling investigations. Other federal agencies like the FBI, DOJ, and Department of Treasury also play a role in combating alien smuggling due to its link with document fraud. The Department of State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security is involved in anti-smuggling efforts to protect travel documents. The Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, CIA's Office of Transnational Issues, Department of Defense's NSA, and the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) collaborate to combat alien smuggling by providing analytical assessments, interdiction support, and information sharing to counter migrant smuggling, trafficking of persons, and clandestine terrorist travel. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) focuses on prevention, investigation, and protection related to smuggling activities. Concerns about the former INS' ability to combat alien smuggling have carried over into ICE, with issues such as lack of field intelligence staff and program coordination hindering anti-smuggling efforts. The ability of DHS to combine alien smuggling and money laundering investigations has aided in alien smuggling investigations. ICE can pursue money laundering charges related to smuggling due to the authorities of the former U.S. Customs Service. However, there have been reports of a lack of coordination between ICE and CBP, leading to inefficiencies in alien smuggling investigations. The line between humanitarian assistance and alien smuggling is not always clear, as seen in cases like the Reverend John Fife's conviction for alien smuggling in the sanctuary movement. In July 2005, volunteers from No More Deaths were arrested for transporting unauthorized aliens to receive medical care in Tucson, Arizona. Humane Borders also provides water stations in the desert and created maps to warn migrants of the risks of illegal border crossings. Critics argue that Humane Borders is aiding and abetting. Immigration fraud involves document fraud and benefit fraud, with document fraud including counterfeiting identity documents and benefit fraud involving misrepresentation to obtain immigration benefits. The INA addresses immigration fraud through various measures. The INA and U.S. Criminal Code address immigration fraud through various measures, including making misrepresentation a ground for inadmissibility and criminalizing the production and use of fraudulent immigration documents. Immigration fraud is widespread in the United States, with document fraud increasing after the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Large-scale black market enterprises provide counterfeit immigration documents to unauthorized alien workers. It is estimated that 11.1 million unauthorized aliens are residing in the U.S., many of whom are likely committing document fraud. Immigration fraud is a significant issue in the United States, with document fraud being a common method used by unauthorized aliens. The 9/11 Commission revealed that several hijackers were able to enter the country using forged documents, highlighting flaws in the immigration system. The 9/11 Commission highlighted the need for more diligent enforcement of immigration laws to intercept or deport potential hijackers. Investigations of immigration fraud focus on facilitators and criminal organizations involved in illegal schemes. Over time, resources for fraud investigations have declined, with fewer special agents working on cases. The INS faced challenges in combating immigration benefit fraud and document abuse due to insufficient staff and lack of integrated information systems. Investigations were hindered by different information systems at INS service centers and district offices, making it difficult to detect patterns and potential fraud schemes. The cuts in fraud investigations between FY1992 and FY2003 were generally across the board. Investigations into counterfeit documents, large-scale illegal schemes, and immigration benefit fraud have all decreased. There is a lack of coordination between USCIS and ICE in fraud and national security investigations. USCIS established the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security to handle national security and criminal \"hits\" on aliens. The GAO reported coordination issues between USCIS and ICE in handling benefit fraud cases due to limited investigative resources. This has led to a decline in investigator work years allocated to document and benefit fraud, impacting enforcement efforts against purveyors facilitating other violations of law. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 added provisions to the INA prohibiting unlawful employment of aliens to deter unauthorized immigration by reducing the magnet of employment. Some argue against targeting purveyors of false identification for unauthorized aliens, while others emphasize the importance of investigating the black market in counterfeit documents and benefit fraud to combat international terrorists, organized crime syndicates, and alien smuggling rings. Employers must verify new hires' work eligibility by examining identity and work documents to avoid penalties under employer sanctions. ICE Office of Investigations enforces these provisions, while anti-discrimination laws protect U.S. citizens and work-authorized aliens from discrimination based on national origin or immigration status. OSC in the U.S. Department of Justice enforces these anti-discrimination provisions. The U.S. Department of Justice began full enforcement of employer sanctions provisions in 1988, with a focus on educating employers and enforcing penalties against violators. Policies governing enforcement have evolved over the years, with changes implemented in 1991 by then-INS Commissioner Gene McNary. In 1991, INS launched a six-month initiative to strengthen enforcement of employer sanctions, focusing on administrative and criminal penalties for violators. INS investigators were directed to prioritize employer sanctions, criminal aliens, and fraud cases, with a focus on employer sanctions-related fraud. Worksite enforcement resources were to be used for enforcement activities, not employer education. The initiative was extended indefinitely in 1992, and President Clinton issued a memorandum in 1995 regarding worksite enforcement. President Clinton's memorandum in February 1995 emphasized worksite enforcement and employer sanctions to deter illegal immigration. The Administration targeted employers and industries hiring illegal immigrants. Funding increases for interior enforcement, including worksite enforcement and employment eligibility verification, were requested and approved for FY1996. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) established pilot programs for employment eligibility confirmation and reduced acceptable documents for I-9 forms. Employers were given a \"good faith\" defense option. In 1998, INS changed its approach to worksite enforcement in response to complaints about their tactics during raids. The new procedures incorporated best practices and aimed to improve public support for worksite enforcement operations. In 1999, INS introduced a new interior enforcement strategy with five priorities, two of which focused on worksite enforcement. INS believed that disrupting smuggling organizations (Priority 2) and removing undocumented workers (Priority 5) were interconnected. By dismantling smuggling operations, access to exploitable labor would be limited, and anti-smuggling efforts could lead to identifying employers and industries involved in hiring undocumented workers. The new interior enforcement strategy by INS in 1999 focused on working with employers to improve compliance with employment verification requirements and prosecuting those who violate the law. They targeted criminal employer cases, patterns of knowingly employing unauthorized workers, and employers who abused their workers. INS conducted large-scale audits of I-9 forms, such as in \"Operation Vanguard\" targeting the meatpacking industry. Operation Vanguard, launched in 1998, involved checking I-9 forms and employment records of meatpacking plant workers in Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. INS developed lists of employees with unverified work authorization, which employers then arranged interviews with INS. Mark Reed stated that this approach was more effective than past workplace raids and arrests. Operation Vanguard, launched in 1998, involved checking I-9 forms and employment records of meatpacking plant workers in Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. INS developed lists of employees with unverified work authorization, which employers then arranged interviews with INS. Mark Reed stated that this approach was more effective than past workplace raids and arrests. However, Operation Vanguard prompted a strong political backlash and was ultimately ended. Reed, now with a consulting firm, offered retrospective views on the operation, stating that it demonstrated an efficient capability to bar unauthorized workers but was not good government. The implementation of Vanguard deprived meatpacking plants of the ability to remain competitive, posing a major threat to the livelihood of the community. Interior enforcement resources were redirected from traditional program areas after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Interior enforcement resources were redirected from traditional program areas to national security-related investigations post-9/11. Criminal employer cases became subordinate to removing unauthorized workers from critical infrastructure facilities. ICE headquarters issued a 2003 memorandum emphasizing critical infrastructure investigations, requiring approval for non-critical infrastructure worksite enforcement. ICE and the Department of Labor share responsibility for enforcing unlawful employment of aliens. The Department of Labor (DOL) plays a key role in enforcing labor standards to deter unauthorized employment by depriving employers of financial advantages. In 1992, DOL's Employment Standards Administration (ESA) entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with INS to improve cooperation in issuing warning notices to employers for violations of employment eligibility verification requirements. The ESA's role in enforcing labor standards was limited to reviewing employers' I-9 forms and reporting results to INS. A new MOU in 1998 clarified the enforcement roles of ESA and INS, allowing ESA investigators to inspect employer compliance with I-9 requirements only in directed investigations. The 1998 MOU limited ESA enforcement to directed investigations, avoiding discouraging complaints from unauthorized workers. ESA investigators do not inquire about immigration status or issue warnings during compliance inspections. Serious violations are promptly referred to INS. This MOU is currently less relevant due to ICE's focus on critical infrastructure facilities. Employers violating INA provisions on unlawful employment of aliens may face civil or criminal penalties. Employers may face fines for violations of I-9 paperwork requirements or knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens. ICE can issue a Notice of Intent to Fine (NIF), leading to civil money penalties, settlement, or dismissal. Employers engaging in a pattern of hiring unauthorized aliens may also face fines and imprisonment. Data from FY1999 to FY2003 shows a decrease in NIFs issued and fine collections, attributed to policy changes and resource reallocations. INS's 1999 enforcement strategy de-emphasized non-criminal employer cases. The 1999 interior enforcement strategy shifted focus to criminal cases over non-criminal employer cases, leading to a decrease in worksite enforcement activities. The decrease in criminal cases presented for prosecution from FY1999 to FY2000 is puzzling, possibly due to resource reallocations and post-9/11 national security priorities. Underreporting may have also contributed to the decline in enforcement measures between FY2001 and FY2002. The worksite enforcement program faces challenges such as legal standards for sanctioning employers and fraudulent documents. INA \u00a7274A prohibits employers from knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens and requires verification of employee work authorization. Compliance is determined if documents appear genuine, and good faith compliance provides a defense against charges of hiring unauthorized aliens. The widespread availability of fraudulent documents makes it difficult to prove that an employer knowingly hired an unauthorized alien, leading to challenges in worksite enforcement. A 1996 amendment to INA \u00a7274A provides employers with a good faith defense against technical violations. Congressional interest in worksite enforcement has increased due to the large unauthorized alien population, with security concerns raised post-2001 terrorist attacks. President Bush proposed a new temporary worker program in January 2004, which included increased workplace enforcement. Congress is now focusing on worksite enforcement policy issues, such as the need for additional resources to improve program performance. The discussion revolves around worksite enforcement, employment eligibility verification, and the effectiveness of current verification systems like the I-9 system and the Basic Pilot program. Policy questions include whether to revise or replace the current systems. Options being discussed include making the Basic Pilot program mandatory for some employers, requiring tamper-proof work authorization for job seekers, and potential changes to penalties for employers violating laws on unlawful employment of aliens. Debate surrounds the effectiveness of current verification systems and whether penalties should be increased or repealed entirely. The need for increased and enforced worksite enforcement to deter unauthorized alien labor is highlighted. Suggestions include involving other federal agencies like the Department of Labor and Social Security Administration in aiding DHS's efforts. However, expanding immigration enforcement roles for these agencies is controversial and may divert them from their primary missions. The coordination between immigration agencies and other federal agencies like the Department of Labor is sometimes problematic. ICE has been criticized for impersonating other agencies to locate unauthorized aliens, leading to concerns about immigrant workers distrusting safety officials. The Department of Labor faces challenges in enforcing labor standards due to immigrant workers' distrust of safety officials, which hinders their cooperation in reporting violations. This distrust stems from fears of retaliation by employers or deportation by immigration authorities. In the late 1990s, the INS experimented with Operation Vanguard, using SSA's work records to identify unauthorized aliens. This operation was criticized for violating workers' privacy rights and targeting Hispanics. SSA stopped allowing INS to check employee records unless there was reasonable cause. The INS faced criticism for worksite enforcement in Nebraska's meat packing plants and Georgia's onion fields. The INS developed a new interior enforcement strategy focusing on criminal aliens and smugglers. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has data that could help DHS identify unauthorized alien workers through a Nonwork Alien File containing social security numbers issued to aliens without work authorization. However, determining work status would require significant resources and may not be cost-effective. Updating work status is challenging for both SSA and DHS. The SSA and DHS face challenges in updating work status due to data issues and lack of a common identifier. Public resistance to SSA's increased role in enforcing immigration laws is a concern. No-match letters sent to employers to address discrepancies between W-2 forms and SSA records have raised attention, but receiving a letter does not necessarily indicate fraudulent SSN use. The SSA implemented a new policy of sending no-match letters to employers with discrepancies in employee records. This led to an increase in complaints and controversy, with many aliens leaving their jobs or being fired. Due to the backlash, SSA changed their policy and sent out fewer no-match letters for tax year 2002. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires inspection of aliens seeking entry into the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act mandates inspections of aliens seeking entry into the United States, which can occur at a preinspection site abroad or upon arrival. Immigration officers have the authority to question individuals, search their belongings, and conduct primary inspections, which involve a brief interview and document check. Inspections aim to determine admissibility, with most occurring during the primary inspections process. During secondary inspections, suspicious travelers are extensively questioned and their documents further examined. Immigration inspectors enforce various criminal and immigration statutes, intercept fraudulent documents, drugs, weapons, and criminal aliens attempting entry into the United States. During secondary inspections, immigration inspectors spend 13% of their time on enforcement activities, generating cases referred to ICE for investigation. The number of cases peaked in 2002 at 1,782, dropping to 1,028 in FY2003. Inspectors play a crucial role in intercepting smuggling activities. Inspectors play a crucial role in intercepting smuggling activities, including humans, narcotics, and contraband. Immigration inspectors use various systems and databases to identify potentially inadmissible aliens, with over 207,000 aliens intercepted in FY2003 and over 254,000 in FY2002. Since FY2002, over 254,000 aliens were intercepted, raising concerns post-9/11 attacks about terrorists entering on temporary visas. Congress has enacted laws for information sharing and databases to screen potential threats, such as the REAL ID Act of 2005. The implementation of these measures remains a key policy question. The US-VISIT program aims to enhance border security by tracking entry and exit data, but critics question its effectiveness in monitoring suspicious foreign nationals. Concerns have been raised about Canadians and Mexicans with border crossing cards not being subject to US-VISIT requirements, potentially allowing terrorists and criminals to evade detection. Despite challenges in implementation, officials believe US-VISIT will be successful based on apprehensions and denials of entry. The US-VISIT program, aimed at enhancing border security, is currently implemented at land POEs, vetting only 2.7% of travelers. The majority of travelers exempt from the program are US citizens, Mexicans with Laser Visas, visa-exempt Canadians, and Legal Permanent Residents. DHS' OIG expressed concern about the high number of exempt travelers. The US-VISIT program exempts certain travelers, including Mexican nationals with a BCC, visa-exempt Canadian nationals, and Mexican nationals with a Laser Visa staying within a certain distance from the border. These exemptions are due to extensive background checks conducted on Laser Visa applicants. The US-VISIT program exempts certain travelers, including Mexican nationals with a BCC, visa-exempt Canadian nationals, and Mexican nationals with a Laser Visa staying within a certain distance from the border. The Administration claims that the Laser Visa document provides extra security at ports of entry, but equipment to read and scan the documents is not available at every port. The Border Patrol is responsible for detecting and preventing aliens from entering the US without inspection. The USB's primary mission is to detect and prevent the entry of terrorists, weapons of mass destruction, and unauthorized aliens from coming into the country, and to interdict drug smugglers and other criminals between official ports of entry. The USBP patrols 8,000 miles of the international borders with Mexico and Canada and the coastal waters around Florida and Puerto Rico, with over 97% of all illegal alien apprehensions occurring at the Southwestern border. About 90% of USBP agents are deployed along the Southwest border with Mexico. The USBP's \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" policy aims to deter border crossers and reroute illegal traffic to harsher areas, giving agents a tactical advantage. The new Border Patrol National Strategy focuses on interdicting terrorists and has five main objectives. The USBP's new strategy focuses on deterring illegal entries, apprehending smugglers, leveraging technology, and reducing crime in border communities to achieve operational control over the border and address the threat of terrorists using smuggling networks. The new USBP strategy aims to achieve operational control over the border by emphasizing a hierarchical command structure and rapid deployment of agents in response to emerging threats. Intelligence plays a crucial role in assessing risks and targeting enforcement efforts effectively. The new USBP National Strategy focuses on generating intelligence through advanced surveillance systems and coordinating with other agencies. It tailors strategies for different operational theaters and aims to make border crossing more challenging for illegal aliens. The impact of the \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" strategy is difficult to measure, but the number of apprehended aliens increased steadily from 1994 to 2000. The presence of agents and resources along the border doubled, leading to an increase in apprehensions of unauthorized aliens. Apprehensions peaked at 1.68 million in 2000 and declined to 931,557 in 2003, possibly due to the \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" strategy. The reduction in apprehensions of unauthorized aliens in FY2005 may be due to the economic recession and rising unemployment, making it harder for illegal aliens to find low-paying jobs. Increasing staffing may not necessarily increase the effectiveness of the USBP. DHS has limited interior investigators compared to state and local law enforcement officers, leading to agreements to strengthen interior enforcement of immigration law. The DHS has agreements with localities to deputize law enforcement officers for enforcing immigration law since 1996. The agreements allow law enforcement personnel to perform immigration functions with proper training and knowledge of federal laws. Proponents argue that these agreements help DHS enforce immigration law more effectively. The initiative to expand DHS agreements with local law enforcement is seen as a way to enhance national security by enabling the arrest of potential terrorists and foreign criminals. However, opponents argue that this could strain the relationship between law enforcement and minority communities, leading to reduced resources and inconsistent application of immigration law. The expansion of DHS agreements with local law enforcement is aimed at enhancing national security by enabling the arrest of potential terrorists and foreign criminals. However, concerns have been raised about the strain on resources and inconsistent application of immigration law across jurisdictions. Workload measures for different types of immigration enforcement activities are presented, but comparing these measures is challenging due to differences in staff time devoted to each task. The text discusses the hours spent on various tasks by Special Agents and Immigration Agents from 1992 to 2003. It highlights the switch in accounting systems from INS' PAS to TECS in 2004, making data comparison difficult. Interior enforcement activities include detention, removal of illegal aliens, alien smuggling investigations, worksite enforcement, and trafficking investigations. Between FY1992 and FY2003, the number of workyears devoted to interior enforcement activities varied. The peak was in FY1999 with 2,081 workyears, mainly focused on locating and arresting criminal aliens. Workyears for worksite enforcement decreased inconsistently over the years. Enforcement activities, including worksite enforcement and fraud investigations, decreased from FY1992 to FY2003. Workyears for worksite enforcement dropped from 18.1% to 3.5%, while fraud investigations decreased from 15.3% to 7.7%. However, time spent on status violations and non-investigative work increased. ICE faced funding shortages in FY2004 and FY2005, impacting resources for immigration enforcement. Criminal alien cases have historically received the largest proportion of work hours. Between FY1992 and FY2003, the number of workyears devoted to criminal alien cases fluctuated, peaking at 811 workyears in FY1999 and decreasing to 740 workyears in FY2003. The proportion of time spent on criminal alien cases varied, ranging from 31.5% in FY1992 to 41.6% in FY2002 before decreasing to 39.1% in FY2003. The percentage of time devoted to criminal alien cases rose to 41.6% in FY2002, then decreased to 39.1% in FY2003. The number of workyears devoted to criminal aliens and removals are highly correlated. An increase in resources for criminal alien investigations could result in more removals, but there may be limits to the impact of additional resources. Increasing arrests of criminal aliens would add to the workload of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and the need for detention bedspace. The growth of the criminal alien workload in the 1990s limited resources available for employer cases. Time spent on employer cases accounted for less than 18% of total investigation workyears from FY1992 through FY2003. Hutchinson noted that the criminal alien workload consumed more investigative hours than any other enforcement activity. Worksite enforcement saw fluctuations in time spent from FY1992 to FY2003, with a decline in employer cases after FY1997. By FY2003, worksite enforcement accounted for only 3.5% of total investigation workyears. The INS changed its worksite enforcement approach in response to complaints, leading to a decline in fraud investigations from FY1992 to FY2003. Investigations dropped from 15.3% to 7.7% of interior enforcement workyears, with actual workyears decreasing from 210 to 146 over the same period. The number of workyears dedicated to alien smuggling varied over the years analyzed, with a peak in FY1999 and FY2000 and a decline after FY2001. The proportion of interior enforcement hours devoted to alien smuggling was smallest in FY1997 and largest in FY2001. In FY2003, 279 workyears were allocated to smuggling cases. In FY2003, 279 workyears were devoted to smuggling cases, accounting for 14.7% of all interior enforcement workyears. Resources and time dedicated to alien smuggling are significant when considering other investigative programs. The number of hours spent on status violators nearly tripled between FY1992 and FY2000, with a doubling of overall investigative time and resident unauthorized alien population. In FY1992, 3.3% of hours were spent on status violations, increasing to 6.7% in FY2003. Hours for status violators declined between FY2000 and FY2001, then rose between FY2001 and FY2003. In the most recent data year, 6.7% of investigative hours were on status violators, despite an estimated unauthorized population of almost 10 million. Administrative and non-investigative task hours more than doubled from FY1992 to FY1998, from 205 workyears to 477 workyears. The percentage of hours devoted to administrative tasks increased from 14.9% to 23.2%, the highest proportion for any year. In 1999, INS released its interior enforcement strategy, possibly leading to an increase in non-investigative hours. Administrative and other hours rose due to database development, including the entry/exit system mandated in IIRIRA in 1996. In FY2003, 23% of hours were spent on administrative tasks. The time devoted to miscellaneous tasks remained under 1% until FY2002 and FY2003, then increased. The number of hours for inspection duties fluctuated between FY1992 and FY2000, with a steady increase overall. The total number of hours worked by immigration inspectors fluctuated over the years, reaching its lowest level in FY2003. The majority of their time is spent on primary inspections, with a small percentage dedicated to enforcement activities. In contrast, the number of hours worked by USBP agents patrolling the border almost doubled between FY1997 and FY2002. The number of USBP workyears patrolling the border almost doubled between FY1997 and FY2002, reaching 6,096 workyears. There was a slight decrease in workyears between FY2002 and FY2003, but a dramatic increase between FY2003 and FY2005, with 8,018 workyears spent on enforcement efforts in FY2005. Interestingly, an increase in workyears does not always result in more apprehensions, as seen in the fluctuation of numbers between FY1997 and FY2005. Between FY1997 and FY2005, the number of USBP workyears patrolling the border increased significantly, reaching 8,018 workyears in FY2005. Despite this increase, the number of apprehensions only rose by 3%, possibly due to factors like the economic recession and increased border security measures. The \"Prevention through Deterrence\" strategy may be reaching a critical mass, inhibiting illegal migrants from entering the country. Additional agents may not have a significant impact on apprehensions. Between FY1997 and FY2003, resources for enforcement between ports of entry increased significantly, with a more modest increase in resources for inspections and interior enforcement. Inspection hours varied, with increases between FY1999 and FY2000, while interior enforcement hours saw fluctuations. Workyears spent on interior enforcement were highest in FY1999. Inspection hours fluctuated between FY2000 and FY2003, with a substantial decrease in enforcement activities in FY2001. Between FY1997 and FY2003, enforcement activities increased, decreased substantially in FY2001, and then increased again in FY2002. The number of inspector enforcement hours decreased between FY2002 and FY2003. Comparing FY1997 with FY2003, the USBP hours almost doubled, while interior enforcement hours increased slightly, and inspection hours fell. The time spent on enforcement activities almost doubled from 141 workyears to 271 workyears. The impact of DHS's enforcement activities has raised questions. Questions have been raised about the impact of DHS's organizational structure on immigration enforcement. Issues include problems inherited from the former INS, the time needed for a new department to function smoothly, and the separation of immigration enforcement functions into different agencies like CBP and ICE. Despite challenges, there are benefits to combining agencies in the new department, such as ICE pursuing money laundering charges related to smuggling and document fraud. ICE pursued money laundering charges related to smuggling and document fraud through the Financial Investigations Division, a capacity that did not exist in INS. GAO reports highlighted challenges in INS management, including lack of clearly defined roles, overlapping responsibilities, ineffective resource use, and inadequate systems and processes. The GAO noted challenges faced by INS in implementing its interior enforcement strategy, with a historical focus on border enforcement over interior enforcement. INS claimed lack of staff for interior enforcement goals without systematic assessment. GAO testified in 2003 on the need for high-level action to address challenges in the Interior Enforcement program. In 2003, GAO testified about challenges in the Interior Enforcement program, including the presence of criminal aliens, growing alien smuggling operations, and unauthorized aliens using fraudulent documents for employment. A 2004 report found management issues in DHS similar to those in the former INS, with unclear guidelines leading to disagreements between ICE and CBP. INS had outdated databases and paper-based systems, as highlighted in various GAO and DOJ Inspector General reports. In response to outdated systems and databases used by immigration officials, Congress passed the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 after the 2001 terrorist attacks. The act mandated the integration of immigration data systems and databases, including federal law enforcement and intelligence information for visa decisions and alien removal. Coordination among agencies is seen as crucial for effective U.S. immigration policy. Applicants for visa checks face challenges due to incompatible databases and territorial data sharing among relevant agencies. Some advocate for a real-time, interagency database accessible to consular officers and law enforcement for better screening. However, concerns about cost, time, and complexity of developing interoperable databases persist, along with uncertainty about the most suitable biometric identifiers for screening aliens. Success of this technology hinges on universal inclusion of all visa applicants and those seeking admission. The creation of ICE and CBP led to a division of immigration enforcement activities, with ICE handling investigations, intelligence, detention, and removal, while CBP focuses on inspections and border patrol. Both agencies heavily rely on each other for enforcement efforts, with CBP initiating actions that are often completed by ICE. Concerns about data sharing, interoperability, and privacy arise as the scope of a real-time interagency database for visa checks expands. ICE and CBP work together for immigration enforcement, with CBP initiating actions that ICE completes. Rivalries between the two agencies hinder coordination. DHS requires ICE to coordinate with CBP and USCIS for interior enforcement. USCIS handles adjudication functions previously done by INS. INS and Customs investigators merged into ICE, with INS' detention program now under ICE's DRO. ICE and Customs investigators merged into ICE, bringing their own cultures and procedures. Congressional attention has focused on the division of ICE and CBP, with concerns also raised about the interaction between USCIS and ICE. INS' approach to benefit fraud was fragmented, lacking guidance on investigating high-priority cases. ICE and USCIS handle benefit fraud investigations, with ICE focusing on large cases referred by USCIS. The DHS Office of the Inspector General found organizational structure issues in merging CBP and ICE, leading to coordination problems. The report highlighted coordination problems between ICE and CBP due to structural issues, staffing shortfalls, and lack of authority. This led to conflicting priorities, separate planning processes, and field staff being accountable to different chains of command. The report identified coordination issues between ICE and CBP, with separate chains of command and a clear institutional barrier. Operational coordination and information sharing shortfalls have led to negative relations, competition, and mistrust. The integration of DHS has not progressed as expected, with people stating current problems are unresolvable due to the unnatural separation of functions. DHS responded to the recommendation to merge ICE and CBP, citing costs and loss of productivity during the transition. The report highlighted concerns about the potential merger of ICE and CBP, citing issues such as a large span of control, fear of dominance, and diminished roles for key officials. Secretary Chertoff recommended a new management structure instead of a merger to improve coordination and reduce bureaucracy. The OIG recommended innovation over massive reorganization to address coordination issues between ICE and CBP. ICE reported a decline in investigative coordination due to CBP referring cases to other agencies without notifying ICE, leading to compromised investigations. CBP is developing its own investigative capabilities, but both agencies assert that all cases should be referred to ICE for investigation. ICE and CBP agents were placed in ICE's intelligence program, responsible for collecting and analyzing immigration-related intelligence. CBP established its own intelligence program, leading to overlapping intelligence requirements. However, coordination between ICE and CBP needs improvement, with limited collaboration beyond intelligence received from other agencies. The primary means of sharing intelligence is through TECS, which lacks the ability to highlight trends or anomalies. Most CBP personnel lack clearance to access critical information entered by ICE into TECS. The OIG concluded that the reliance on this system is problematic. The reliance on TECS by ICE inhibits timely and effective information exchange for immigration enforcement activities. Resource allocation plays a significant role in enforcing immigration laws, with some advocating for a legalization program to reduce the unauthorized population. Others argue that the U.S. has not fully tried immigration enforcement, suggesting a different approach is needed. The United States has not fully engaged in immigration enforcement beyond border enforcement, particularly worksite enforcement. Most aliens come for economic opportunities and family reunification. DHS backlog and per-country ceilings impact immigration. Some argue legal immigration reform is key to reducing illegal immigration. Congressional action needed to change per-country ceilings. Some argue that a guest worker program could decrease illegal immigration by creating opportunities for immigrants to work in the United States. Others believe that better worksite enforcement and document fraud prevention could also reduce unauthorized migration. A combination of a guest worker program and increased worksite enforcement may be the solution. One possible option to reduce the unauthorized alien population is to increase coordination and information sharing with federal agencies like the Social Security Administration and Department of Labor. Another approach could involve local law enforcement agencies in enforcing immigration laws, but concerns exist about potential distractions from primary missions. Enforcement of immigration laws against long-term unauthorized aliens can be controversial due to their ties to communities, potential economic disruptions, and backlash from the populace. Balancing reducing the unauthorized population with safeguarding the economy and maintaining goodwill is challenging. The complexity of immigration enforcement policy is influenced by maintaining goodwill among the populace, resource constraints, and management issues in DHS."
