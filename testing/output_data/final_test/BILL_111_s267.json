    "content": "The Act titled \"Summer and Year-Round Jobs for Youth Stimulus Act of 2009\" may be cited as the official name. It focuses on providing summer and year-round jobs for youth. Congress finds that a $1 billion investment in summer and year-round employment for economically disadvantaged youth can create up to 1 million jobs and stimulate local economies. There is a growing need for job opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth, as shown by increased unemployment rates in December 2008. The unemployment rate for African-American 16 to 19-year-olds increased to 33.7 percent, as compared to 28 percent in December 2007. Research from Northwestern University shows that every $1 a youth earns has an accelerator effect of $3 on the local economy. Summer and year-round jobs for youth help supplement the income of families living in poverty and provide valuable work experience for economically disadvantaged youth. Summer jobs under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 serve as an introduction to the world of work for economically disadvantaged youth.
