    "content": "Meeting highway capacity needs while protecting the environment is a challenging task for many states. To receive federal highway funding, states must meet environmental requirements such as demonstrating conformity with plans to control emissions under the Clean Air Act. Failure to demonstrate conformity or inadequate air quality plans can result in denial of funds. Additionally, all highway and transit projects must undergo environmental impact reviews under NEPA before receiving federal funds for final project design, property acquisition, or construction. Other common environmental impacts include water pollution from contaminated runoff. Environmental impacts from highway construction include water pollution and loss of natural habitat. Mitigation measures are required for federal approval of funds. Congress has established programs to address conflicts between transportation needs and environmental quality. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century authorized $218 billion for federal highway and transit programs from FY1998 to FY2003. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) allocated $9 billion for air quality projects and authorized tax benefits for cleaner fuels. It also addressed water pollution from highway runoff and funded environmental research and advanced vehicle technologies. Funding allocation and conformity with air quality requirements are key issues for federal highway programs. Stakeholders are debating extending the time frame for conformity to control emissions and streamline the environmental review process for federal highway projects. There are concerns about compromising environmental protection, while some advocate for increased funding for air quality projects to meet stricter federal standards. The report discusses stakeholders' interest in various environmental issues related to highway construction and travel, including air quality standards, water pollution mitigation, surface transportation impacts, and advanced-vehicle technologies. It also addresses tax benefits for renewable fuels and exemptions for low-emission vehicles from HOV lane requirements. This resource document provides background information for Congress on pollution mitigation efforts but will not be updated. Slower growth in motor fuels excise tax revenues affects funding for surface transportation infrastructure and environmental needs. Robust gasoline sales in the previous authorization cycle led to a substantial increase in trust fund revenues, allowing Congress to expand highway and transit programs. The current authorization cycle faces funding challenges due to slower growth in motor fuel excise tax revenues, limiting available funds for highway and transit programs, including environmental activities. TEA-21 established discretionary spending guarantees to ensure a minimum level of funding for these programs. The TEA-21 authorization cycle faces funding challenges for environmental programs due to slower growth in motor fuel excise tax revenues. Guaranteed funding is protected from budget reductions, but traditional discretionary funding for environmental programs has not been fully supported by Congress in recent appropriations. This raises questions about how funding for environmental programs should be secured for their implementation. Motor vehicles have improved in cleanliness over time. Motor vehicles have become cleaner with stricter emission standards since 1965, but increased vehicle miles traveled offset some pollution reductions. Vehicles remain major sources of air pollution, contributing to poor air quality in metropolitan areas and making it challenging for states to meet emissions limits for National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Meeting public needs for highway capacity while controlling emissions is a significant issue for states with nonattainment areas. The availability of federal highway funding in certain areas depends on states conforming to emissions budgets for motor vehicles in air quality plans. Congress has authorized the use of funds for projects reducing vehicular emissions, with a focus on the CMAQ program. Federal transit funding supports the purchase of clean fuel buses, and tax benefits promote renewable alcohol-based fuels. States can allow single-occupant use of low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes to incentivize their use. The Clean Air Act requires states to demonstrate transportation plans conform to air quality plans to maintain federal standards. Section 176 prohibits federal funding for projects in nonattainment areas unless they conform to state plans. Many states face challenges in meeting conformity as air quality requirements become stricter. The Clean Air Act mandates that transportation plans align with air quality standards to receive federal funding. States must show conformity with air quality plans, and projects in nonattainment areas must adhere to state regulations to receive funding. States are encountering difficulties in meeting conformity requirements as air quality standards become more stringent. There is increasing support for states to have more time to demonstrate conformity with air quality standards due to various challenges such as emissions from SUVs and light trucks, increased vehicle miles traveled, court decisions tightening conformity rules, and upcoming stricter federal air quality standards. Metropolitan areas may risk losing highway and transit funds unless they reduce emissions to show conformity. The rules for conformity require states to reduce emissions to maintain access to federal highway funds, limiting funding for new projects that could reduce emissions. Concerns have been raised about how conformity requirements may impact federal surface transportation programs. Congress established the CMAQ program to address air quality concerns in transportation planning decisions. The CMAQ program, established under ISTEA in 1991, aims to reduce vehicle miles traveled, congestion, and emissions to improve air quality. It is a significant source of federal funding for air quality projects, with support for increasing funding levels. Congress initially authorized $6 billion for CMAQ from FY1992 to FY1997, and an additional $8.1 billion from FY1998 to FY2003 under TEA-21. Funding is available for reducing emissions in nonattainment areas. The CMAQ program, established under ISTEA in 1991, aims to reduce vehicle miles traveled, congestion, and emissions to improve air quality. Congress authorized $8.1 billion for CMAQ from FY1998 to FY2003 under TEA-21. Funding is available for projects that reduce traffic congestion and assist states in complying with air quality standards. States with nonattainment areas receive CMAQ funds based on pollution severity and population, while states without such areas receive 0.5% of the total annual apportionment for eligible transportation projects. States can also transfer a portion of their CMAQ funds to other highway programs with higher priority. The CMAQ program, established in 1991, aims to reduce emissions and improve air quality. Funding is available for transportation control measures, with mass transit projects receiving the most funding. Questions have been raised about the program's effectiveness in reducing emissions to help states comply with air quality standards. Reauthorization may involve modifying the program to enhance its impact. The National Academy of Sciences studied the effectiveness of CMAQ projects in reducing emissions to help states comply with air quality standards. The study found that while individual projects had small emission reductions and were less cost-effective than other measures, collectively they could help states attain and maintain NAAQS in borderline compliance areas. The National Academy of Sciences recommended modifications to the CMAQ program to improve its effectiveness in helping states comply with NAAQS in borderline areas. Some argue for shifting focus to reducing traffic congestion overall, while others suggest amending the funding formula to benefit states with no air quality issues but facing congestion. Rising congestion and longer commutes have led to support for these changes among transportation stakeholders. Proponents of the CMAQ program argue that continued use of funds for air quality projects in areas close to meeting standards could still be beneficial. They suggest that upcoming stricter federal standards will increase the need for emission reductions. However, the current funding formula does not account for new areas that will be in nonattainment with these standards, requiring changes during reauthorization. Transit projects can help improve air quality by reducing vehicle emissions. Transit agencies have purchased cleaner-burning fuel buses to control emissions, but funding originally set aside for this purpose was redirected. Despite this, many agencies still choose to buy clean fuel buses with federal funds. The proposal to establish dedicated funding for clean fuel buses has sparked controversy among those who believe local agencies should have the discretion to decide. The Clean Fuels Formula Grant Program allows transit agencies to acquire low-emission alternative-fueled buses through competitive grants based on fleet size, passenger miles, and air pollution severity. Eligible technologies include CNG, LNG, biodiesel, battery power, alcohol-based fuel, and hybrid electric power. This program has sparked controversy among those who argue for local agency autonomy in bus selection. The Clean Fuels Formula Grant Program authorized $200 million annually for alternative-fueled buses from FY1999 through FY2003. $100 million was guaranteed funds, while the other $100 million was discretionary. Congress has not allocated the discretionary funds and redirected the guaranteed funds to traditional bus improvement projects. Transit agencies' purchases of alternative-fueled buses with the redirected funds are unknown. Transit agencies receive federal funding to purchase clean fuel buses, with up to 80% covered by federal transit programs. They can receive up to 90% funding for buses using alternative fuels to comply with Clean Air Act requirements. Major programs like Capital Investment Grants and Loans have funded the purchase of alternative-fueled buses. The Federal Transit Administration provides funding for transit agencies to purchase clean fuel buses, with up to 80% covered by federal programs. Alternative-fueled buses have been a significant recipient of funding, with an average of 34% of federal funding from FY2000 to FY2002 going towards them. Air quality concerns often drive transit agencies to choose clean fuel buses despite their higher costs. Transit agencies in metropolitan areas prioritize purchasing clean fuel buses to comply with federal air quality standards under the Clean Air Act. Factors influencing their decision include improving public perception, increasing ridership, and state/local mandates or incentives for alternative fuels. Economic considerations also play a role, with agencies looking to maximize past investments in refueling infrastructure for alternative-fueled buses. Transit agencies that have previously invested in alternative-fueled buses are more likely to purchase more in the future, while those that have not are less likely due to the need for additional refueling infrastructure. Federal funding from FY2000 to FY2002 shows the amount obligated to assist in bus purchases, excluding matching funds from agencies. Alternative fuels include compressed natural gas, liquified natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, methanol, ethanol, and electric. The funding for alternative-fueled buses has exceeded the original authorization, leading to debates on the necessity of exclusive funding for their purchase. Critics argue that stricter standards for diesel engines will soon make them as clean as alternative fuels like CNG. Some critics argue that upcoming cleaner diesel buses may eliminate the need for reserving transit funds for alternative-fueled buses to reduce emissions. However, environmental groups are skeptical that cleaner diesel engines will emit as little as alternative fuels. They advocate for dedicated funding for alternative-fueled buses to maintain air quality standards. The federal government incentivizes renewable alcohol-based fuels to reduce tailpipe emissions. Alcohol-based fuels, derived from renewable sources like ethanol, have the potential to reduce tailpipe emissions and improve air quality. However, they can be more volatile and result in higher evaporative emissions during refueling. The preferential treatment of these fuels in the U.S. tax code is controversial, with benefits set to expire in 2007. Alcohol-based fuels produced from petroleum, natural gas, or coal are not eligible for these tax benefits. Ethanol, primarily derived from corn, is a renewable fuel that is commonly blended with gasoline to produce \"gasohol.\" It is also used as an additive in reformulated gasoline to meet Clean Air Act requirements. During winter, Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) is used to reduce carbon monoxide emissions, with ethanol added to increase octane levels. Ethanol is commonly blended with gasoline to create gasohol, with excise tax reductions based on the ethanol blend percentage. The current tax reduction is 5.2 cents per gallon for gasohol with at least 10% ethanol, 4.0 cents per gallon for blends with at least 7.7% ethanol, and 3.0 cents per gallon for blends with at least 5.7% ethanol, below the current tax rate of 18.4 cents per gallon for ordinary gasoline. Tax benefits for the sale of ethanol are needed to make it competitive with other fuel additives and conventional fuels. Proponents argue that ethanol improves air quality, reduces vehicle emissions, lowers U.S. dependence on foreign oil, and supports corn farmers. Opponents view gasohol tax benefits as a subsidy for ethanol. Opponents argue that gasohol tax benefits are essentially a subsidy for the ethanol industry, reducing overall revenues for the Federal Highway Trust Fund. Key issues for reauthorization include extending tax benefits, adjusting the excise tax reduction and income tax credit, and allocating alcohol fuel tax revenues. HOV lanes reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality by promoting efficient vehicle operation. Congress approved a novel approach in TEA-21 for using ethanol. In TEA-21, Congress approved using HOV lanes for air quality by allowing low-emission vehicles with one occupant. This authority expired in 2003, with debates on renewing and expanding it to include more vehicles. Concerns exist about potential traffic congestion if the benefit is expanded. The law allowed low-emission vehicles to use HOV lanes, specifically those certified as \"inherently low-emission vehicles\" (ILEV) until September 30, 2003. States had the authority to revoke this policy if HOV lane congestion increased. EPA created the ILEV category to promote vehicles with minimal emissions, only those running on alternative fuels without evaporative emissions qualify. There is a limited availability of ILEVs, such as CNG, LNG, or electric vehicles, that can use the HOV lane benefit. There is interest in expanding this benefit to hybrid vehicles to encourage sales of cleaner vehicles and improve air quality. allowing hybrids in HOV lanes with one occupant may not significantly increase congestion where there is excess lane capacity. HOV lanes may face congestion in the long-term if the popularity of ILEVs, such as hybrids, increases. Highway activities can also impact water quality by depositing hazardous substances into waterways. Highway runoff is a nonpoint source that is challenging to control compared to point sources. States seeking federal funds for highway construction must consider these potential impacts. When seeking federal funds for new highway construction, states must consider the impacts of highway runoff on water quality and wetlands during the environmental review process required by NEPA. Mitigation measures like storm water management systems may be necessary to prevent pollution. If wetlands are lost due to construction, mitigation \"banks\" may be required to offset these losses, as preferred by TEA-21. Costs for water pollution mitigation and wetland replacement are typically included in the total project costs. Many highways were built before current requirements for pollution control measures. Many waterways near highways are contaminated from runoff, requiring environmental restoration. Congress allows states to use federal highway funds for mitigation projects. Eligibility is under the Surface Transportation Program and Transportation Enhancements set-aside. States cannot use funds allocated for specific needs like interstate maintenance. The Surface Transportation program gives states flexibility for environmental restoration. The Surface Transportation Program allows states to use federal highway funds for environmental restoration and pollution abatement projects related to water quality impacts from highway travel. This includes projects like storm water treatment systems. Funds can only be used during reconstruction of existing highways. The Surface Transportation Program allows states to use federal highway funds for environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities during highway reconstruction. States are not required to track how funds are used for these activities, but may voluntarily provide this information. States may voluntarily report spending $19 million in Surface Transportation Program funds on environmental projects from FY1998 to mid-FY2003. However, actual expenditure could be higher due to incomplete data. States also allocate federal funds for new highway construction to meet water pollution mitigation requirements, likely surpassing funds spent on older highways. Data on specific funding amounts are unavailable as states do not typically separate mitigation costs from total construction expenses. Key Policy Issues for the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Program include increasing the limitation on environmental restoration spending, establishing a reporting mechanism for tracking STP funds used for mitigation, and allowing funds to address water pollution from highway runoff. States have flexibility in funding various projects under the program. States have the flexibility to fund a wide variety of projects under the Surface Transportation Program. They must set aside 10% of their annual apportionment for \"transportation enhancements\" that improve the multimodal, environmental, cultural, or aesthetic aspects of the nation's surface transportation system. Congress modified the definition of enhancements to include water pollution mitigation from highway runoff. Some criticisms have been raised about using federal highway funds for enhancements not directly related to transportation infrastructure needs. States can spend enhancements funds on categories like bicycle paths, pedestrian walkways, and historic preservation. The most funded categories under the Transportation Enhancements Act include bicycle paths, pedestrian walkways, historic preservation, and landscaping. Water pollution mitigation projects have received a small percentage of funding, with states spending $66 million on these projects by mid-FY2003. This amount is more than three times the spending on similar projects using general Surface Transportation Program funds. Federal contribution to projects, including pollution mitigation, is typically limited to 80%. The Surface Transportation Program allows states to calculate the nonfederal share of Transportation Enhancements based on individual projects or multiple projects. Federal funds from other agencies can also be used to cover the nonfederal share, allowing the federal share of a project to be as high as 100%. Some argue for a diversity of activities supported by enhancements funding. Some argue that certain enhancements funded by federal highway funds are ineffective and should only be spent on surface transportation infrastructure improvements. Limitations on funds due to declining revenues have sparked support for reducing transportation enhancements funding. If funding is cut, states can still use Surface Transportation Program funds for pollution mitigation projects. Research and development activities supported by federal highway funds primarily focus on improving the function and safety of the nation's surface transportation system to meet travel needs. Some argue for more funding towards environmental research and development to address the impacts of vehicular travel on air and water quality, while others believe that highway capacity and safety should remain the main focus of research. TEA-21 authorized the Secretary of Transportation to establish an environmental research program. TEA-21 authorized the Secretary of Transportation to establish a Surface Transportation-Environment Cooperative Research Program to examine the relationship between transportation systems and the environment. Funding limitations have hindered the implementation of advanced vehicle technologies and environmental research programs. The Surface Transportation-Environment Cooperative Research Program authorized by TEA-21 has not received funding for implementation. Congress has not allocated funds for the Advanced Vehicle Technologies Program as authorized, hindering the development of environmental technologies for the national transportation system. Only $10 million out of the $250 million authorization has been appropriated. The $250 million authorization for the Surface Transportation-Environment Cooperative Research Program has only seen $10 million appropriated by Congress, limiting project implementation. Funded projects focus on low and zero emission technologies like hybrid, all-electric, and fuel cell power trains. Stakeholders express concerns about the lengthy environmental review process for highway construction projects, with some advocating for revisions to speed up project delivery while environmental organizations worry about potential weakening of environmental protections. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts before final decisions are made. This includes providing a detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for proposed actions affecting the environment. The EIS must analyze project alternatives, describe the affected environment, and assess environmental consequences. The EIS must demonstrate appropriate comments were solicited from relevant agencies and the public. An EA must be prepared if significant impacts are unclear, leading to an EIS if impacts are identified. Projects with no significant impacts are excluded from EA or EIS requirements and processed as a Categorical Exclusion. State agencies must comply with these regulations. State agencies must provide documentation to the Federal Highway Administration to prove a project qualifies as a Categorical Exclusion (CE). Final design, property acquisition, or construction cannot proceed until a CE is classified, a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is approved for an Environmental Assessment (EA), or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is approved. Only about 3% of federally funded highway projects require an EIS due to significant environmental impact, receiving 9% of federal highway funds. These projects are typically large, costly, and have a significant impact on the environment. The Federal Highway Administration indicated that major highway projects can take between 9 and 19 years, with the preliminary design and environmental review process lasting one to five years. Congress included provisions in TEA-21 to streamline the environmental review process for highway projects to reduce approval time and speed up fund delivery. The Department of Transportation has not issued final regulations to implement streamlining on a national scale despite taking administrative actions. The Clinton Administration's streamlining proposal in 2000 was criticized for not fully meeting TEA21 requirements and potentially causing project delays. The Bush Administration withdrew the proposal in 2002, awaiting Congress's decision on surface transportation reauthorization. President Bush issued an executive order to expedite environmental reviews for high-priority transportation projects. Hearings were held in Congress to address streamlining issues in surface transportation reauthorization. Despite expectations, final streamlining regulations have not been implemented, leading to calls for further legislative action to speed up project delivery. Interest in further legislative action to expedite project delivery and meet public demands for transportation infrastructure."
