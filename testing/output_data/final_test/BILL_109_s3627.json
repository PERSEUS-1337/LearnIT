    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mercury Market Minimization Act of 2006\". Congress finds that mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States have mercury in their blood at levels that could endanger babies. Around 630,000 children born annually in the U.S. are at risk of neurological issues due to mercury exposure, primarily from contaminated fish. The EPA reports that as of 2004, 44 states have fish advisories covering millions of lake acres and river miles, with freshwater advisories being statewide in 21 states. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is to minimize global mercury use and releases to achieve reduced contamination levels in the environment. Mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant affecting water bodies near industrial sources and remote areas. Free trade of mercury and mercury compounds on the world market is prevalent. The world market encourages the use of mercury outside the United States, especially in artisanal gold mining. Mercury use is declining in the US due to process changes in manufactured products, but remains substantial in the developing world. The European Union is the largest source of mercury exports globally and is enacting legislation to prohibit mercury exports. The United States is a net exporter of mercury, having exported more than it imported from 2000 to 2004. Banning mercury exports will impact the market availability and promote affordable alternatives in the developing world by 2011. The text chunk \"PROHIBITION ON SALE, DISTRIBUTION, OR TRANSFER OF MERCURY BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OR DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\" can be condensed to \"Ban on mercury sale, distribution, or transfer by US government agencies.\" \"Ban on sale, distribution, and transfer of elemental mercury by US government agencies.\" The prohibition on the sale, distribution, and transfer of elemental mercury by US government agencies does not apply to transfers to specific facilities established under section 12(c)(3). SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON EXPORT OF MERCURY. Section 12 of the Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits the export of elemental mercury from the United States effective January 1, 2010. The President may also prohibit the export of any mercury compound as necessary to enforce this ban and prevent subversion. The President must notify Congress if exercising authority to prohibit the export of mercury compounds from the US. The notification must describe the compounds and provide a justification for the prohibition. Additionally, storage capacity for excess mercury must be established to implement the export prohibition. The President must establish storage capacity for excess elemental mercury and mercury compounds to implement export prohibitions. Regulations will govern the establishment and operation of storage facilities. Subsection (a) does not apply to this provision."
