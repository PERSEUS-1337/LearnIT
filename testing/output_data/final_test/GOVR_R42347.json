Indicators like high rates of healthcare-associated infections and low adherence to guidelines show room for improvement. For instance, HAIs cause around 100,000 deaths annually, costing billions. Studies reveal low rates of recommended care for both children and adults. The 2010 National Healthcare Quality Report highlights suboptimal care, especially for low-income and minority groups. The quality of healthcare in the U.S. is suboptimal, particularly for low-income individuals and certain minority groups. Quality of care varies geographically, with high-quality, low-cost hospitals often being larger and located outside of the South. Efforts to improve healthcare quality have been inconsistent, with a focus on increasing provider accountability. Efforts to enhance provider accountability in healthcare include payment incentives, public reporting of performance data, and quality assurance through regulation and accreditation. These approaches aim to improve quality, drive market share, and demonstrate cost-efficient performance. Regulatory oversight and accreditation serve an oversight function and encourage providers to change their behavior for better outcomes. This report focuses on payment incentives and public reporting in healthcare, which rely on quality measurement to improve provider performance. Policymakers are addressing measurement needs by supporting health services research and developing quality measures in areas where they are lacking. Improving healthcare quality involves addressing measurement needs and supporting policies for a trained workforce, health information technology, and evidence-based research. It is also linked to broader goals like reducing disparities, improving affordability, and community health. Congressional interest in enhancing healthcare quality continues. The report discusses ongoing congressional interest in improving healthcare quality, especially through federal programs like Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VHA, and IHS. Significant legislative activity has been seen, including the ACA, which focuses on financing and delivery of care to enhance quality. The report highlights the role of quality measurement in policies to hold providers accountable and presents selected policies addressing quality measurement. The curr_chunk discusses policies for provider accountability through quality measurement, payment incentives, and public reporting of performance data. These policies rely on quality measures to assess provider performance and monitor progress. Health services research, including comparative effectiveness research, helps identify desired outcomes and evaluate interventions' effectiveness. Comparative effectiveness research (CER) can help identify desired outcomes by providing evidence on treatment options. Policies to enhance provider accountability through payment incentives or public reporting may be limited without clear outcomes. The application of policy approaches using quality measures is key to bringing about desired changes. Considerations for using quality measures in policies include the availability of a comprehensive set of measures. The effectiveness of policies based on quality measurement relies on the availability of a comprehensive set of quality measures that span diseases, care settings, and provider types. The National Quality Forum emphasizes the need for developing quality and cost measures to ensure transparency in care value and support performance-based payment and quality improvement. Identifying measure gaps is crucial for developing a comprehensive set of quality measures in healthcare. The HHS convened a committee to address measure gap domains and sub-domains, as part of a larger effort to enhance measure development and endorsement. Critical measure gaps were identified in HHS quality programs, with the ACA expanding the scope of these initiatives. Policies with an accountability component should be based on measures supported by strong evidence, particularly in clinical process quality measures. Quality measures should be based on strong research evidence showing that the process leads to improved clinical outcomes, with a focus on randomized trials. High performance on quality measures may not always result in better clinical outcomes. NQF-endorsed measures are preferred for accountability policies, but the endorsement process is lengthy. The endorsement process for NQF-endorsed measures is lengthy, affecting availability for end users like HHS. Policymakers may need to balance the need to move programs forward with waiting for endorsed measures. Different types of quality measures are available, including structure, process, outcome, and patient experience of care. There is a shift towards using primarily outcome and patient experience measures, as noted by CMS. Quality measurement is crucial in payment incentive and public reporting, with a focus on outcome and patient experience measures. Comparing provider performance is essential for accountability and improvement, relying on provider-specific information for distinctions and monitoring. Quality measurement is vital in payment incentive and public reporting policies to enhance provider accountability. Policymakers support the development of measures, including comparative performance information, to reward higher-quality performance, guide payment incentives, improve provider performance, and help patients choose the best care. Despite the increasing focus on these policies, questions persist about the actual impact of quality measurement on care quality. Experts suggest that systematic surveillance efforts are needed to understand trends and facility differences in performance. Consumers may value access, provider availability, cost, and choice, which may not align with policymakers' definition of quality. Emphasis is on transitioning to a payment system based on higher-quality, lower-cost care. Transitioning from volume-based or fee-for-service payment to value-based purchasing incentivizes providers to deliver higher quality care at lower cost through payment adjustments and performance-based incentives. This shift promotes joint clinical and financial accountability among healthcare providers. Payment incentives in healthcare may be based on quality measures, creating directive or non-directive incentives to modify care delivery processes. The Medicare program plays a role in modifying payment through incentives to improve quality. The discussion focuses on payment incentives in healthcare aimed at improving quality or value, rather than altering resource use. The Medicare program offers opportunities for value-based purchasing approaches and payment modifications at the federal level. Other coverage and financing arrangements outside federal control do not provide similar opportunities for policymakers. The federal government, primarily through the Medicare program, has opportunities for implementing value-based purchasing approaches and payment modifications in healthcare. Other coverage and financing arrangements, such as those provided by the Indian Health Service, do not offer the same opportunities for policymakers. Medicare's influence on healthcare organization and finance has been significant over the last 40 years. CMS has implemented initiatives to transform Medicare into an active purchaser of quality healthcare. The impact of payment incentives on cost and quality remains unclear, with little evidence supporting the success of financial incentives in improving primary healthcare quality. Additional studies are needed in this area. Payment incentives in the Medicare program may provide valuable data for private insurers considering similar approaches to reduce costs and improve quality of care. The Congressional Budget Office highlighted the need for substantial changes to payment and delivery systems for value-based payment programs to be effective. Adjustments to payment or performance-based payments are ways to achieve these incentives. Payment adjustments in healthcare can be made through predetermined factors or non-payment for specific care costs. Adjustments can include reductions in charges or annual payment updates for various reasons such as incomplete activities or failure to meet performance thresholds. Payment incentives may also be based on individual performance or improvement over time. In healthcare, performance-based payments are given to providers based on their performance compared to others. In Medicare, payments are made budget-neutral, with money redistributed based on performance. Providers may also receive fees for non-direct care services to incentivize their provision. In healthcare, providers may receive performance-based payments for care coordination and chronic disease management under fee-for-service Medicare. These payments can be per-beneficiary, per-month fees, and may be at-risk if cost targets are not met. Payment incentives can be blended, combining different approaches to incentivize quality care delivery. The Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative proposed a blended payment model with fee-for-service, performance-based incentives for quality care, and care coordination payments. Policymakers aim to enhance provider accountability through public reporting of performance information. Public reporting of performance information is defined as the objective measurement and public disclosure of physician and hospital performance. The objectives include increasing accountability, maintaining standards, and stimulating improvements in care quality. Public reports aim to encourage consumer participation in decision making. The impact of public reporting on consumer decision making and quality improvement efforts is uncertain, but efforts are underway in the Medicare program to make performance information publicly available. The theory behind public reporting of performance information includes correcting information imbalances between providers and consumers in healthcare services. However, releasing inaccurate information could harm providers' reputations. Assumptions include consumers' desire to use the data for decision-making. The public provision of performance information in healthcare is expected to facilitate informed decision making among consumers, leading to increased market share for better performing providers. This feedback loop would financially reward higher performing providers and fuel professional desire to improve care. The public provision of performance information in healthcare aims to facilitate informed decision making among consumers. Factors influencing consumer decision-making include characteristics of the performance information itself, consumer characteristics, and external factors. However, data shows low public awareness of performance information sources, with limited relevance in some cases. Consumers may find performance information in healthcare to be of limited relevance, as it must be applicable to their conditions and clearly differentiate between high and low-quality care. Consumer decision-making is influenced by various factors such as referrals, hospital location, and cost, which may outweigh the use of performance information. Public reporting aims to aid informed decision-making but faces challenges in consumer awareness and relevance. Public reporting of performance information in healthcare aims to motivate quality improvement activities by providers and facilitate consumer participation in informed decision-making. However, studies show that consumers are not effectively utilizing this information, with only a small percentage accessing quality data about hospitals and physicians. Factors such as the presentation of information and consumer preferences like hospital location may contribute to this lack of engagement. The impact of public reporting on motivating providers to improve quality is uncertain. The release of performance information in healthcare may not directly improve clinical process quality measures. However, hospitals that received public performance reports took steps to improve quality in response. Many hospitals initiated quality improvement efforts upon learning about public reporting from others before receiving their own feedback."
