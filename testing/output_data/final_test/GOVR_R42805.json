    "content": "Federal water projects operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation have specific authorized purposes identified by Congress. They can provide water storage for municipal and industrial use under the Water Supply Act of 1958, but congressional approval is required for modifications that significantly impact the original project purposes. The extent of modifications allowed without approval remains undefined. The ambiguity surrounding modifications without approval for federal water projects operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has become a contentious issue, especially during severe droughts. There is increasing interest in changing operations at federal facilities to meet municipal and industrial (M&I) demands, with potential reallocation of storage at dams in various states. This reallocation may lead to controversy due to the shift in benefits and stakeholders served. Litigation may arise from these issues. The reallocation of water in Lake Lanier by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has led to litigation and conflicting court decisions. The report analyzes legal challenges and outcomes related to water allocation under the Water Supply Act, as well as data on reallocations in various projects and legislative options. The report analyzes legal challenges and outcomes related to water allocation under the Water Supply Act, as well as data on reallocations in various projects and legislative options for Congress. The federal role in M&I water supply development is generally constrained, with states and local entities recognized as having the primary responsibilities. The federal government's investments in water resources infrastructure focus on flood control, navigation, irrigation, and hydropower projects. Congress authorizes the Corps to undertake construction of dams and water resources infrastructure through project-specific legislation. The Corps evaluates requests for water supply storage at its facilities based on existing authority for a particular project and general authority. The Corps operates dams and reservoirs to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. Congress includes project authority in water resources legislation, such as Rivers and Harbors acts. Project-specific authority is limited to a particular project and cannot be applied to others. There are 133 Corps multi-purpose reservoirs in 26 states with 11.1 million acre-feet of storage. Construction of large federal dams has slowed since the 1960s due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Recent reservoir planning focuses on balancing objectives for existing reservoirs and managing for new goals. Congress has granted the Corps general authority to provide water supply for municipal and industrial use at any facility. The Flood Control Act of 1944 grants the Corps limited authority to reallocate M&I water supply temporarily. Questions arise when this authority is used for permanent reallocations without specific consideration by Congress. The report focuses on the Corps' implementation of permanent M&I allocations under the WSA and how courts have interpreted the Corps' actions. The WSA was enacted to provide federal assistance for water supply development. The Water Supply Act (WSA) authorizes federal assistance for water supply development, including water storage in reservoir projects for municipal and industrial use. The WSA allows the Corps to include storage in reservoir projects to meet M&I water needs, with costs shared equitably among all project purposes. Congress placed limitations on the Corps' authority despite the broad scope of the WSA. The Water Supply Act allows the Corps to provide storage space for municipal and industrial use in reservoir projects, with limitations set by Congress on modifications that could impact the project's original purposes. The Corps has discretion to determine if a modification requires congressional approval, leading to legal ambiguity. In 1977, the Corps developed guidance for determining when reallocations in reservoir projects are insignificant, not needing congressional approval. Reallocation for domestic, municipal, or industrial water supply purposes is considered insignificant if it does not exceed 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet. This guidance introduced numeric criteria, unlike earlier guidance. The Corps issued a legal memorandum in 2012 stating it would evaluate its authority under the WSA based on actual operational changes and impacts. Out of 134 Corps reservoirs with M&I water storage, 44 reservoirs have M&I storage authority from the WSA, totaling less than 640,000 AF in reallocations. Lake Texoma has seen the most reallocated storage for M&I use, with over 50,000 AF reallocated through four discretionary actions by the Corps. The Corps reallocated 103,003 AF of water at Lake Texoma, including a 77,400 AF transfer from hydropower to M&I use approved in 1985 without congressional approval. The Corps found the transfer would not significantly harm the lake's purposes and stayed below the 15% usable storage criterion, except at Cowanesque Lake. The reallocation of water supply at Cowanesque Lake represents almost 30% of storage and was authorized under the Corps' discretionary authority. The evaluation of reallocations and their impact on authorized purposes is a general concern, with the sufficiency of Corps analyses being questioned. The CRS report discusses reallocation analyses for water supply at Corps facilities, including Lake Lanier and Lake Cumberland. Unauthorized withdrawals at Lake Cumberland have not been stopped, and the extent of unauthorized withdrawals at other Corps facilities is largely unknown. Litigation dating back to 1990 has addressed the Corps' authority to reallocate water. In 1990, federal appellate decisions addressed the Corps' authority to reallocate storage at Lake Lanier under project-specific and general legislation. Various laws expanded the Corps' considerations for operating decisions at ACF reservoirs, including fish and wildlife protection, water quality, and recreation, in addition to original purposes like navigation and flood control. Lake Lanier also supplies water to the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Corps reallocated storage space in Lake Lanier from hydropower to water supply in the 1980s, leading to disputes over water supply operations in the Atlanta area. Multiple lawsuits have been filed regarding the Corps' actions in the ACF, with recurring issues including the authorized purposes of Lake Lanier for flood control, hydropower, and navigation. In the 1990s, Alabama and Florida filed suit against the Corps over water withdrawals approved for Georgia, alleging unauthorized reallocation of storage in ACF reservoirs. Parties later entered the ACF Compact to negotiate a resolution. In the 1990s, Alabama and Florida sued the Corps over water withdrawals for Georgia, leading to the ACF Compact negotiations. The ACF Compact ended in 2003 without a final agreement. In 2000, the Southeastern Federal Power Customers sued the Corps in the D.C. case. In 2003, a settlement agreement was reached in the D.C. case involving Georgia and the Corps, prompting Alabama and Florida to challenge it. Alabama and Florida also intervened in the D.C. case to oppose the settlement agreement. In 2003, a settlement agreement was reached in the D.C. case involving Georgia and the Corps. Alabama and Florida intervened to oppose the agreement, leading to a preliminary injunction granted in the Alabama case. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals later vacated the injunction, finding no imminent harm or likelihood of success for Alabama and Florida. In 2000, the Governor of Georgia requested increased water releases from Lake Lanier until 2030 for Atlanta's water supply. Georgia sued the Corps in 2001 for not responding to the request. The Corps denied the request, citing the need for additional legislative authority. The Court of Appeals overturned the district court's decision in the Georgia I case, allowing Florida and SeFPC to intervene. The district court allowed Florida and SeFPC to intervene in the Georgia I case, which was suspended pending the resolution of a similar case in Alabama. Multiple lawsuits with similar claims were filed since 2006, leading to the consolidation of all pending cases related to the ACF dispute, except for the D.C. case which had already reached the appellate court. The D.C. case involved a dispute brought by Southeastern Federal Power Customers (SeFPC) regarding the Corps' water storage contracts at Lake Lanier. A settlement agreement was reached between Georgia and the Corps, providing for two 10-year contracts allocating storage space for municipal use. The Corps allocated storage space to Georgia for municipal use, with the agreement requiring between 210,858 and 240,858 acre-feet of water storage for 10 years, renewable once. The reallocation may require Congressional approval or judicial recognition. The Corps recommended reallocating 207,000 acre-feet of storage in Lake Lanier from hydropower to local consumption, which may need Congressional approval. In 2002, the Corps denied Georgia's request for water reallocation due to substantial withdrawals from Lake Lanier, requiring additional Congressional authorization. The D.C. Circuit reversed a settlement agreement approval, citing examples of the Corps recognizing limits on its discretion under the WSA. The requests mentioned constituted a significant portion of Lake Lanier's total storage. The court deemed it unreasonable to allow the Corps to make major modifications to Lake Lanier without congressional approval, citing that reallocating over 22% of the total storage space for local consumption constitutes a major operational change. The settlement agreement could not violate a statute, and the court held that the reallocation was a significant alteration that required approval. The court ruled that the reallocation of water storage space at Lake Lanier for local consumption, amounting to 22% of total storage, was a major operational change that required Congressional approval. The agreement could not be enforced as Congress did not authorize the change, and the court emphasized that even a 9% change from the status quo was significant. The cases from Alabama, Georgia I, Georgia II, and Florida were consolidated and transferred to the federal district court in Florida for convenience. The federal district court for the Middle District of Florida consolidated cases from various cities after a remand from the D.C. Circuit. The court found that the Corps' actions at Lake Lanier constituted a major operational change and criticized their measurement methods. The court emphasized that the cumulative effect of all changes must be considered. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit overturned the district court's decision in the consolidated cases regarding the Corps' authority at Lake Lanier. The court reviewed administrative reports to determine the Corps' project-specific authorizations, noting that the planned reservoir would provide increased water supply to Atlanta. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit overturned the district court's decision in the consolidated cases regarding the Corps' authority at Lake Lanier. The court reviewed administrative reports to determine the Corps' project-specific authorizations, noting that the planned reservoir would provide water supply to Atlanta. The Park and Newman Reports listed benefits such as power, navigation, and flood control, with water supply considered a prospective benefit. Congress adopted both reports in its legislation for Lake Lanier, with the Corps' Definite Project Report emphasizing flood control, hydroelectric power, navigation, and increased water supply for Atlanta as primary purposes of the Buford Project. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit overturned the district court's decision regarding the Corps' authority at Lake Lanier. The court examined the Buford Manual for the project, which remains in effect today, and the PAC Report recommended reallocation of storage space in Lake Lanier for water supply but was never finalized due to resistance and a lawsuit. The 11th Circuit overturned the district court's decision on the Corps' authority at Lake Lanier. The court found that challenges to the Corps' actions were not ripe for review under the Administrative Procedure Act due to the lack of final agency action. Despite efforts, the Corps was unable to finalize its decision-making process, and temporary allocations did not establish rights. The 11th Circuit overturned the district court's decision on the Corps' authority at Lake Lanier, stating that challenges to the Corps' actions were not ripe for review under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court recognized the Corps' efforts to reach a final decision on water storage allocations since the mid-1980s and noted that temporary allocations did not establish rights. The 11th Circuit overturned the district court's decision on the Corps' authority at Lake Lanier, stating that challenges to the Corps' actions were not ripe for review under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court emphasized that the Corps erred in rejecting Georgia's request for increased releases from Lake Lanier, as water supply was a significant anticipated benefit for Atlanta's growing water supply requirements. The 11th Circuit overturned the district court's decision on the Corps' authority at Lake Lanier, stating that challenges to the Corps' actions were not ripe for review under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court emphasized that the Corps erred in rejecting Georgia's request for increased releases from Lake Lanier, as water supply was a significant anticipated benefit for Atlanta's growing water supply requirements. The Newman Report explained that locating the reservoir above Atlanta would increase the minimum flow in the river, reinforcing and safeguarding the metropolitan area's water supply. The court clarified that the reference to water supply as an 'incidental benefit' was not meant to confer a subordinate status, and the discussion of water supply as a benefit did not exclude it as a project purpose. The court clarified that water supply was not intended to be a subordinate use at Lake Lanier, as flood control was also considered an authorized purpose. The lack of storage allocated for water supply did not mean it was not authorized, similar to navigation which had no specified storage allocation. The court also explained that requesting Georgia to contribute financially for water supply would not have made sense, as the Corps could provide it essentially without cost. The court found that Georgia was not likely to be charged for construction costs of a project that replaced its existing water supply, as the Corps could provide water supply essentially without cost. The court rejected the Corps' claim of deference under the Chevron doctrine, stating that it would go against the will of Congress. The 11th Circuit rejected the Corps' interpretation of the Buford Project, stating that Congress clearly intended water supply as an authorized purpose. The Corps' inconsistent application of its interpretation was highlighted, with instances of identifying water supply as authorized in the past but reversing this stance in 2002. The court reversed its interpretation in 2002 and acknowledged the Corps' evolving views on its authority to allocate storage in Lake Lanier for water supply. The court remanded the issue to the Corps to reexamine Georgia's request in light of its authorization under specific legislation, instructing the Corps to find a balance for Atlanta's water supply while minimizing power impact. The court identified unanswered questions for the Corps regarding water supply authority under WSA, including calculations for water supply, impact on hydropower, defining major operational changes, and accounting for return flows. The analysis should provide future guidance regardless of the outcome for Georgia's request. Other courts are not bound by the D.C. Circuit's decision on these issues. The 11th Circuit clarified the preclusive effect of the D.C. Circuit decision on collateral estoppel, which prevents parties from re-litigating issues already resolved in prior legal proceedings under certain circumstances. The 11th Circuit clarified the preclusive effect of the D.C. Circuit decision on the WSA's interim reallocations of storage, emphasizing that project-specific authorities for water supply are separate from the WSA. The court noted that the D.C. Circuit's decision on a 22% reallocation limit may not apply in the 11th Circuit, and the analysis could change based on this distinction. The 11th Circuit instructed the Corps to complete its analysis and issue a final judgment on its authority under project-specific legislation and the WSA within one year. The Corps has the legal authority to accommodate Georgia's request for increased withdrawals but has not made a final decision until the operations manual updating process is complete. The Corps announced plans in October 2012 to update the operations manual, claiming authority to accommodate Georgia's request for downstream withdrawals from Lake Lanier. Georgia's request for increased water supply would minimally impact hydropower generation. The Corps also asserted authority to grant direct withdrawals under relocation agreements and general authorities, including the WSA. The Corps interpreted the WSA's prohibition on major operational changes or significant effects on project purposes. The Corps announced plans to update the operations manual to accommodate Georgia's request for downstream withdrawals from Lake Lanier. They interpreted the WSA's prohibition on major operational changes or significant effects on project purposes as changes that fundamentally depart from Congressional expectations for a project. The Corps identified its process for evaluating water supply requests under the WSA, ensuring that the operation of ACF projects aligns with Congressional intent. The Corps identifies quantity and terms for water storage contracts under the WSA, focusing on operational changes and impacts to project purposes when evaluating requests. The Corps evaluates requests under the WSA to determine if they align with Congressional intent for the project. The legal dispute in the ACF involves the Corps' operational authority over Lake Lanier and Buford Dam. Phase 2 of the litigation addresses environmental claims beyond the scope of this report. Parties may seek a legislative solution to resolve these issues. The U.S. Supreme Court has not addressed the matter. The U.S. Supreme Court has not addressed the issues raised by the Water Supply Act (WSA). In June 2006, the Court declined to review an 11th Circuit decision in the Alabama case, stating that it did not involve a controversy between states but rather a dispute between states and a federal agency. The Court would only hear arguments regarding the dispute if a new lawsuit is filed by one state against another state or if a party appeals a circuit court's decision and the Court accepts the case for review. The Court also declined to review the D.C. case in January 2009, allowing the D.C. Circuit decision to stand. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the 11th Circuit's decision in the Alabama case in June 2006 and the D.C. Circuit's decision in January 2009. The Court may consider a dispute if decisions differ between circuit courts, as seen in the ACF cases. The Court did not intervene in the case, with the DOJ opposing review at this time. The Court and DOJ argued that the scope of the Corps' authority under the Water Supply Act was not definitively pronounced, suggesting that Congress or the Court should address such questions. The authority and limitations under the WSA are statutory issues controlled by Congress, which can amend the WSA to provide more specific guidance on agency discretion to reallocate water. Congress may amend the authorized purposes of specific projects, like Lake Lanier, to clarify water allocation. This would override any court interpretations of the Water Supply Act. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply has been controversial, with concerns raised about reallocations at other facilities and future evaluations. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention or litigation. Congress may amend project purposes to clarify water allocation, potentially overriding court interpretations of the Water Supply Act. The Corps' discretionary authority for M&I reallocation at federal facilities is a growing policy issue. Questions arise about how reallocations are handled, including multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and unauthorized withdrawals. Current policies reflect decisions and tradeoffs that may need reexamination as more reallocations are requested, especially regarding the transition to permanent M&I reallocations. The transition to M&I reallocation at federal facilities raises questions about stakeholder interests, federal charging for storage space, and the role of the federal government in municipal water supply. Challenges include addressing climate change effects on water supply, evaluating current water infrastructure operations, and determining the national interest in water policy. The difficulty of enacting changes to federal facilities due to a wide range of opinions and affected constituencies."
