    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cape Fox Land Entitlement Adjustment Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that Cape Fox Corporation is an Alaska Native Village Corporation organized under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act for the Native Village of Saxman. Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres, unlike other village corporations in southeast Alaska. Cape Fox was also restricted from selecting land within six miles of Ketchikan to protect the watersheds. Cape Fox Corporation, an Alaska Native Village Corporation, was restricted from selecting land within six miles of Ketchikan under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This limitation prevented the corporation from accessing valuable timber land, industrial sites, and commercial property, leaving only nonproductive land available for selection. Cape Fox Corporation's land selections were limited by the presence of the Annette Island Indian Reservation within its selection area, as mandated by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This restriction affects only Cape Fox, requiring adjustments to Sealaska Corporation's selections to prevent split estates. The Sealaska Corporation holds title to subsurface land in areas of the Tongass National Forest, creating split estates that need resolution. The Act allows for the conveyance of Tongass National Forest land to Cape Fox and Sealaska to address land entitlement issues without major impacts on forest resources. Adjustments to Cape Fox's selections under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act are facilitated by this Act. The Act allows for the conveyance of Tongass National Forest land to Sealaska to address land entitlement issues in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the public interest. Cape Fox is waived from selecting 160 acres of Federal land. Selection and conveyance can occur outside the exterior boundary. Cape Fox may select approximately 99 acres of surface estate of Tongass National Forest land outside its current exterior boundary. The land description includes various sections totaling 99 acres. Upon selection, Cape Fox will also receive conveyance of the subsurface estate. Upon conveyance of the surface estate to Cape Fox, the Secretary of the Interior will convey the subsurface estate to Sealaska. The conveyances to Cape Fox and Sealaska must be completed within 180 days of receiving written notice of Cape Fox's selection. SEC. 5. EXCHANGE OF LAND BETWEEN CAPE FOX AND THE TONGASS NATIONAL FOREST. The Secretary of Agriculture will exchange Federal land with Cape Fox for Tongass National Forest land. Cape Fox will identify land for exchange within 60 days of the enactment of the Act. Cape Fox will identify land for exchange with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior within 60 days of the Act. The identified land, previously conveyed to Cape Fox, will comprise approximately 2,900 acres in compact tracts abutting National Forest System land. The land identified for exchange with the Secretary of Agriculture includes a public trail easement designated as \"D\" on the map. The value of the easement will be considered in determining the total value of land conveyed to the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture will assess if the land identified by Cape Fox is of equal value to the land described in subsection (b). If not, additional Cape Fox land will be identified for exchange to equalize the value, which must be contiguous to National Forest System land. The Secretary of Agriculture will attempt to enter into an agreement with Cape Fox to exchange Federal land within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The exchange will involve the surface and subsurface estate, subject to valid existing rights and provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Secretary of the Interior will complete the interim conveyance to Cape Fox after the exchange agreement is signed. The Secretary of the Interior will finalize the interim conveyance of Federal land to Cape Fox within 180 days of the exchange agreement being signed. SEC. 6. EXCHANGE OF LAND BETWEEN SEALASKA AND THE TONGASS NATIONAL FOREST. Upon conveyance of Cape Fox land in the exchange under section 5 and relinquishment by Sealaska of specified land, the Secretary of the Interior will convey Federal land to Sealaska. Sealaska will select approximately 9,329 acres from Tongass National Forest for exchange. Sealaska, after receiving notice from Cape Fox, must select land for exchange within 60 days. The selected land should be in no more than 2 contiguous tracts abutting Cape Fox's land. The conveyance to Sealaska will include surface and subsurface estate, subject to existing rights and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act provisions. Sealaska must select land for exchange within 60 days, abutting Cape Fox's land. The Secretary of Agriculture will determine if the selected land is of equal value and may adjust the amount for agreement. The land to be exchanged includes the subsurface estate under Cape Fox land, additional subsurface estate under Tongass National Forest, and rights to additional subsurface estate of Tongass National Forest land. The Secretary of Agriculture aims to finalize the exchange agreement with Sealaska within 90 days of land selection. The exchange will involve conveying Tongass National Forest land to Sealaska as per the 1991 agreement. The Secretary of the Interior will then complete the interim conveyance of selected Federal land to Sealaska. The exchange agreement between the Secretary of Agriculture and Sealaska must be finalized within 90 days of land selection. Sealaska will receive Tongass National Forest land, with the interim conveyance of Federal land to Sealaska to be completed within 180 days. This agreement will modify the Sealaska Corporation/United States Forest Service Split Estate Exchange Agreement ratified in 1992. SEC. 7. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. The exchanges in this Act must be of equal value, with Cape Fox and Sealaska providing estimates of land value to the Secretary of Agriculture. They must convey title evidence satisfactory to the Secretary for lands conveyed to the United States. Parties are not liable for hazardous substances in the land due to conveyance under this Act. The Act does not affect ANCSA selections. Any conveyance of Federal land to Cape Fox or Sealaska under this Act will be considered as land conveyed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The total acreage of land entitlement for Cape Fox and Sealaska will not change. They will be responsible for any land exchanged or conveyed under this Act, but not for any land received. The exchanges will lead to the issuance of conveyances to Native Corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and land transferred to the United States will become part of the Tongass National Forest. The maps referred to in this Act will be maintained in the Forest Service Region 10 Regional Office in Juneau, Alaska. Land conveyed to or selected by the State of Alaska under the Alaska Statehood Act shall not be eligible for selection or conveyance without the state's consent. Federal land conveyed to Cape Fox or Sealaska under this Act will be subject only to the reservation of public easements. The Secretary of Agriculture will add an equal number of acres to old growth reserves on the Tongass National Forest as are transferred out of Federal ownership under this Act. Authorization of appropriation for value estimation, land exchange costs, road rehabilitation, habitat and timber stand improvement under the Department of Agriculture. Authorization for land surveys and conveyances under the Department of the Interior."
