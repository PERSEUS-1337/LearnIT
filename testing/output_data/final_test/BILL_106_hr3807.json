Congress finds that over 35 percent of northeastern US families rely on oil for winter heating, facing price increases in 1989, 1996, and 1999, causing hardship for various groups including those on fixed incomes, rural residents, the elderly, farmers, truckers, and governments. The Act aims to ensure adequate stocks of home heating oil in the Northeast to meet winter demand and prevent sudden price increases, caused by insufficient supplies accumulated by importers, refiners, and wholesalers.

Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to include a voluntary plan for a home heating oil reserve in the Northeast. Importers, refiners, and wholesalers in the Northeast must develop voluntary plans to maintain minimum heating oil inventories to stabilize energy markets and protect consumers from price fluctuations. Plans should be submitted to the Secretary for approval. Importers, refiners, and wholesalers in the Northeast must submit voluntary plans to the Secretary within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary will certify plans likely to achieve the Stable Oil Supply Home Heating Act's purposes and issue a statement for those that are not likely to succeed. A report must be submitted within 240 days of enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the findings and reasons for certifying or failing to certify each plan submitted by importers, refiners, and wholesalers. A defense to antitrust actions is available for actions taken in developing or carrying out a certified voluntary plan under subsection (a).

The Secretary shall submit an annual report to Congress on the implementation of voluntary plans certified under this section, focusing on compliance by importers, refiners, and wholesalers serving the Northeast market with regards to home heating oil supply adequacy. \"Establishes a home heating oil reserve for the Northeast region.\" The Secretary will issue an order for the establishment of a private home heating oil reserve in the Northeast if a certified plan is not implemented within 300 days. The Secretary will monitor supply levels to ensure each importer, refiner, and wholesaler has sufficient inventory available for retailers or consumers in the Northeast.

Regulations will be established to enforce this requirement, including civil penalties. The Secretary will establish civil penalties and cooperate with State energy authorities to enforce the requirement for importers, refiners, and wholesalers to sell excess inventories of home heating oil at the end of each winter season. Implementation will support the maintenance of a competitive petroleum industry, and a report to Congress will be submitted within 22 months of enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the implementation of the section regarding home heating oil supply buildup, along with specific compliance details by importers, refiners, and wholesalers.
