    "content": "The war in Afghanistan, now in its 10th year, is a multi-faceted joint effort aimed at ending the insurgent threat and establishing lasting stability. For the Afghan government, it is a struggle for survival against the Taliban, while for the Afghan people, it is the latest cause of instability in 30 years of conflict. The war in Afghanistan involves struggles for survival against insurgent groups, limited economic development, and corruption in official government structures. The U.S. government leads the international military effort to ensure security and deny safe haven to terrorists. Regional states like India, Russia, Pakistan, and Iran are also involved in the conflict. The war in Afghanistan is critical for India, Russia, Pakistan, and Iran, as it impacts security and power balance in the region. NATO members are involved in defeating terrorist networks and ensuring regional stability. The Obama Administration has increased focus and resources on the war since 2009. The U.S. government's core goals for the war in Afghanistan have remained unchanged since March 2009: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and prevent their return. President Obama announced a surge of military and civilian personnel to Afghanistan in December 2009, with plans to begin withdrawing U.S. forces on a \"conditions-based\" basis in July 2011. NATO allies expressed support for transitioning security responsibility to Afghans by the end of 2014 at the NATO Lisbon Summit in November 2010. President Obama confirmed U.S. commitment to this transition and a long-term U.S.-Afghan strategic partnership in December 2010. Obama confirmed U.S. commitment to transition by 2014 and a long-term U.S.-Afghan strategic partnership. General David Petraeus credited hard work of ISAF troops and Afghan partners for security improvements. President Obama acknowledged gains but noted fragility. U.S. faces decisions on engagement in Afghanistan, including refining national interests and determining end-state. The curr_chunk discusses determining diplomatic, economic, and military approaches in Afghanistan, coordinating international efforts, and prioritizing the Afghanistan war in a constrained fiscal environment. Congress can oversee these issues through funding, policy shaping, confirming officials, oversight hearings, and reporting requirements. The war in Afghanistan was triggered by the September 11 attacks. The current war in Afghanistan was primarily caused by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, amidst a backdrop of decades of Afghan history including communist rule, the Soviet invasion, civil war, and the Taliban regime. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 to support a communist regime, leading to armed resistance by Afghan mujahedin groups. The U.S. government covertly supported the mujahedin through the CIA. Soviet forces withdrew in 1989, and the Taliban, dominated by ethnic Pashtuns, gained power in 1994. The Taliban, led by Mullah Omar, seized control of Kandahar in 1994 and Kabul in 1996, ruling much of Afghanistan until 2001. The civil war led to over a million deaths, displacement of millions, and destruction of infrastructure. The U.S. military intervention was prompted by the 9/11 attacks linked to al Qaeda operating under Taliban protection in Afghanistan. Following the 9/11 attacks linked to al Qaeda operating under Taliban protection in Afghanistan, President George W. Bush demanded Taliban action. When the Taliban refused to hand over the terrorists, the U.S. launched military operations in Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, with the goal of disrupting terrorist activities and attacking the Taliban regime's military capability. The planning process for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) was condensed, based on Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's vision of defense transformation. Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) was based on Donald Rumsfeld's defense transformation vision, emphasizing technology and precision weaponry for smaller ground forces. CIA worked with Afghan opposition groups, while U.S. operations used special forces and air support, showcasing joint military capabilities. The UK and Australia also contributed forces, leading to the quick downfall of the Taliban regime. The Taliban regime quickly fell in 2001, with key leaders fleeing to Pakistan. The new Afghan leadership faced challenges in consolidating a fractured state with limited resources, dealing with threats from resurgent al Qaeda and Taliban forces, as well as local powerbrokers vying for influence in the post-Taliban era. In December 2001, the United Nations launched the Bonn Process in Germany to establish the Afghan Interim Authority after the fall of the Taliban regime. Hamid Karzai was elected as the head of the new government in June 2002. After the fall of the Taliban regime, a loya jirga in June 2002 elected Hamid Karzai as head of the Afghan Transitional Authority. A new constitution was adopted in January 2004, followed by Karzai's election as president in October 2004. National Assembly elections took place in September 2005. The post-Taliban period brought varied experiences for Afghan people, with some seeing an end to repressive rule, others finding opportunities to return home, and some facing new instability due to insurgent presence and poppy cultivation. Strategy-making for Afghanistan is complex due to the various stakeholders involved, including the Afghan government, NATO, the U.S. government, insurgent groups, and regional leaders. Military strategy is intertwined with broader grand strategy for the country's security and progress. The strategic vision for Afghanistan is complex due to the wide range of activities undertaken by stakeholders, including security, civilian capacity-building, rule of law, and economic development. President Hamid Karzai's views are crucial as he leads a centralized state structure. President Karzai has emphasized Afghan sovereignty as the key theme of his strategic vision for Afghanistan. This was highlighted at the January 2010 London Conference where he emphasized \"Afghan leadership, Afghan ownership.\" He has called for Afghan control over private security companies and emphasized the Afghan state's monopoly on the use of force. Additionally, he has advocated for Afghan leadership in detention and prosecution activities. The U.S. government's strategy for Afghanistan has evolved from immediate military aims post-9/11 attacks to a comprehensive approach. The Bush Administration did not conduct a thorough strategic review for the war in Afghanistan. Under the Bush Administration, the war in Afghanistan was overshadowed by the focus on Iraq. Limited resources were committed to stabilize the post-Taliban order. In September 2008, President Bush announced a \"quiet surge\" with additional U.S. Marines and NATO troops to provide security and protect Afghanistan's infrastructure. Under the Obama Administration, efforts in Afghanistan focused on providing security, protecting infrastructure, and supporting democratic institutions. This included developing security forces, involving Afghan tribes, deploying civilian agency experts to improve governance and economy, and assisting Pakistan in defeating Taliban and al Qaeda fighters. President Obama emphasized increased leadership attention to the war in Afghanistan. President Obama's comprehensive policy review in Afghanistan led to the deployment of 17,000 additional U.S. forces. The review included consultations with Afghanistan, Pakistan, key Allies, and international organizations, resulting in a new strategy for both countries. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke was appointed to oversee the implementation of the new strategy. In March 2009, President Obama appointed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke as Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP) to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in the region. The strategy included reversing Taliban gains, supporting Afghan government, training security forces, deploying civilian expertise for governance and economic development, and promoting reconciliation with insurgents. In May 2009, General David McKiernan was asked to resign from his roles as ISAF Commander and U.S. Commanding General. In May 2009, General David McKiernan was asked to resign from his roles as ISAF Commander and U.S. Commanding General. His successor, General Stanley McChrystal, conducted a \"60-day initial assessment\" of the mission in Afghanistan, seeking fresh thinking and eyes for the mission. The assessment characterized the situation in Afghanistan as serious. GEN McChrystal's assessment of the situation in Afghanistan highlighted the need for a comprehensive counter-insurgency campaign to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum. He emphasized the importance of supporting responsive governance, increasing Afghan National Security Forces to 400,000, and improving partnership with ISAF forces at all levels. In Fall 2009, the Obama Administration conducted a review of strategy and resource options for the war in Afghanistan based on GEN McChrystal's Initial Assessment and classified resource recommendations. The review aimed to balance achieving results to protect U.S. national interests with improving partnership with ISAF forces and changing operational culture. During the strategy review in Fall 2009, U.S. officials debated on the approach to the war in Afghanistan, balancing national interests with commitment levels. Some advocated for a narrow focus on counter-terrorism, while others supported a \"CT-plus\" approach with additional emphasis on training Afghan forces. President Obama confirmed the core goal of disrupting and defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan in his December 2009 speech at West Point. In his December 2009 speech at West Point, President Obama outlined the objectives of the effort to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 U.S. troops and emphasized the need to deny al Qaeda a safe haven, reverse the Taliban's momentum, and strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government. The United States would also work towards an effective partnership with Pakistan. President Obama announced in his speech a partial timeline for the war in Afghanistan, stating that the United States would begin transferring forces out of the country in July 2011. This measure aimed to create urgency for progress among Afghans, but the specifics of the drawdown were not clarified. Troop contributions from different countries were noted to have varying caveats and capabilities, making them not completely interchangeable within the coalition. In June 2010, President Obama replaced GEN McChrystal with General David Petraeus as the top commander in Afghanistan. The arrival of GEN Petraeus did not trigger a strategic review, but he gradually refined ISAF's approaches. In late 2010, the Obama Administration conducted the Afghanistan Pakistan Annual Review (APAR) to gauge progress in the campaign. President Obama confirmed the core goal in a December 2010 speech. President Obama confirmed the core goal of disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He emphasized the importance of Afghan-led nation-building efforts and outlined key elements of the strategy, including targeting the Taliban, supporting Afghan security forces, and promoting political reconciliation. Progress against al Qaeda was noted, with a focus on addressing terrorist safe havens in Pakistan. President Obama highlighted progress in pressuring al Qaeda and clearing areas from Taliban control in Afghanistan. He announced a transition to Afghan-led security by 2014 and a new enduring strategic partnership with the U.S. to be detailed in 2011. In early 2011, the Obama Administration was working on refining conditions for Afghanistan in 2014 and drafting a vision for a long-term U.S.-Afghan strategic partnership. NATO, as the sponsor of ISAF, plays a central role in Afghanistan. The U.S. government has a significant leadership role in both ISAF and NATO, shaping their strategies. The United States plays a significant leadership role in shaping NATO and ISAF strategy in Afghanistan. NATO issued a strategic vision in 2008 with guiding principles and objectives for success in the region. The 2008 NATO strategic vision outlined objectives for success in Afghanistan, focusing on stability, self-sufficiency of Afghan forces, and good governance. However, specific strategies for achieving these goals were not clearly defined. In October 2009, GEN McChrystal briefed NATO Defense Ministers on his Initial Assessment, receiving broad support for a counterinsurgency approach with priorities including focusing on the Afghan population and building the capacity of Afghan security forces. In 2010, NATO approved a new strategic concept for transitioning security responsibility to Afghans and expressed support for a sovereign, democratic, and stable Afghanistan. They reaffirmed their long-term commitment and established a robust partnership with the Afghan government. The insurgencies in Afghanistan are diverse, with various aims and ties to al Qaeda and Pakistan. Criminal networks, including drug lords and government officials, support the insurgencies, alienating the Afghan people. International practices have unintentionally empowered malign actors, fueling support for the insurgencies. The main insurgent groups include the Taliban, the Haqqani network, and Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin. The insurgent groups in Afghanistan, including the Taliban, the Haqqani network, and Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, aim to control the Afghan population and drive coalition forces out of the country. They receive support from foreign fighters and have safe havens in Pakistan for their leadership. Al Qaeda plays an indirect role in the insurgency by providing funding, facilitation, and ideological support. The security climate in Afghanistan remains challenging. The security climate in Afghanistan follows cyclical patterns based on seasons, with the spring poppy harvest season drawing workers away from insurgency. Changes in security trends are best evaluated year-to-year, with an upswing in security incidents noted since mid-2006 when NATO assumed security responsibility. In 2006, insurgents intensified attacks to weaken NATO political will. By Fall 2010, kinetic events increased by 300% since 2007. In early 2011, insurgent groups sought to make a more significant impact, with high-profile attacks killing 116 Afghan civilians in four weeks. ISAF officials expected continued attacks, including assassination attempts. The Taliban, a network rather than a single organization, emerged from the Afghan civil war in the 1990s. Mullah Mohammed Omar, the de facto leader, is believed to be leading the organization from Pakistan. In July 2010, he instructed his forces to fight coalition forces, target Afghan government supporters, recruit workers with access to coalition facilities, and acquire heavy weapons. The group is known as the Quetta Shura Taliban, based in Pakistan. The Taliban receives support from Pakistani officials, including the ISI, in logistics, medical, and training assistance. They have a presence in Kandahar and all of Afghanistan's provinces, operating shadow governments to deepen control. The Haqqani network is closely associated with the Taliban, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani. The Haqqani network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and now reportedly led by his son Sirajudin, operates from North Waziristan in Pakistan's FATA region. They use this base to plan and launch attacks on Afghan and coalition forces in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces have not taken action against them in this area. The network's main focus in Afghanistan is the eastern provinces. The Haqqani network operates in eastern provinces of Afghanistan, using them as launching pads for attacks on Kabul. They have close ties with al Qaeda and possibly with Lashkar-e Taiba. Another major Afghan insurgent group is Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who received aid from the U.S. government in the past. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a key ally during the civil war, sought refuge in Iran before leading the HiG insurgent group in Afghanistan. HiG operates in the northeast, focusing on resource-rich provinces. They have a political wing and have proposed a peace plan to the Afghan government. Tensions with the Taliban have led to clashes in northeastern Afghanistan. In northeastern Afghanistan, two groups are clashing for influence, with criminal patronage networks posing a significant challenge to stability. These networks link powerbrokers, criminal bosses, and government officials, skimming state revenues and fueling insurgencies directly or indirectly by alienating the Afghan people. Former ISAF Commander GEN McChrystal highlighted the impact of powerbrokers on stability, emphasizing the abuse of power by corrupt officials as a key factor eroding confidence in the Afghan government. The Afghan people's \"crisis of confidence\" in the government, along with insurgencies, poses a threat to the overall mission. Powerbrokers are seen as networks of relationships used to wield influence, with the Afghan Threat Finance Cell contributing to understanding. ISAF Commander GEN Petraeus emphasized the need to build on security gains in 2010. ISAF Commander GEN Petraeus stressed the importance of combating corruption and criminal patronage networks in Afghanistan to build on security gains. Concerns have been raised about the extent of corruption within the Afghan government, with Kabul Bank facing allegations of missing funds used for property purchases and political patronage. Kabul Bank is under scrutiny for allegedly using funds for property purchases and political patronage, including ties to Afghanistan's political leadership. Patronage networks are prevalent at sub-national levels, providing access to revenue streams and international border crossings. The U.S. government has channeled funding through Kabul Bank for Afghan salaries, raising concerns about corruption and influence in Afghanistan. The international community faces tough questions about balancing influence at sub-national levels in Afghanistan. Local powerbrokers like Ahmed Wali Karzai exert leverage through patronage and resources from higher levels of the Afghan system. The challenges and remedies for this issue cannot be easily localized. Ahmed Wali Karzai (AWK) of Kandahar province wields extensive personal influence despite lacking significant official authority or resources. He faces allegations of involvement in the poppy trade, maintaining a private militia, illegally seizing land, and monopolizing business sectors. AWK's actions have led to inter-tribal tensions, but he is seen as effective in getting things done and has a close relationship with the CIA. Formal evidence of wrongdoing is lacking. General Abdul Razziq, the Afghan Border Police commander in Spin Boldak, Kandahar province, is believed to have the patronage of Provincial Council Chairman Ahmed Wali Karzai. Razziq is accused of profiting from skimming state revenues at the border crossing and ensuring loyalty within his forces by favoring his own Achekzai tribe members. Many international practitioners acknowledge these allegations. General Abdul Razziq, the Afghan Border Police commander in Spin Boldak, Kandahar province, is seen as a controversial figure within his own Achekzai tribe and by international civilian and military practitioners. Despite being labeled a \"thug,\" Razziq was praised for his effectiveness in military operations against the Taliban in Kandahar city. The international community faces the dilemma of whether to rely on this partnership for expedience or address the potential consequences later on. Governor Gul Agha Sherzai of Nangarhar Province, supported by President Karzai, is seen as a dynamic leader who has organized a Peace and Reconciliation Jirga to reintegrate former fighters. He distributes patronage selectively, funded by revenues from the Torkham Gate border crossing and drug labs. Governor Gul Agha Sherzai of Nangarhar Province is known for his efforts to combat drug labs and maintain stability in the region, despite some controversial actions. International funding in Afghanistan has been mismanaged, leading to resentment among the Afghan people and fueling insurgency. The ISAF Commanders have acknowledged the problem of corruption in Afghanistan, which has been exacerbated by errors and has led to the recruitment of insurgents. GEN Petraeus emphasized the need to address corruption in contracting and procurement activities to support Afghan officials. A House Committee report highlighted issues with the \"host nation trucking\" contract, which is crucial for the U.S. supply chain in Afghanistan. The Senate Armed Services Committee found that private security contractors in Afghanistan were linked to warlords involved in criminal activities like murder and bribery. The international effort in Afghanistan has evolved since the removal of the Taliban regime, but the country still lacks resources for substantial progress. The international community supports Afghanistan due to its lack of resources. The \"lead nation\" model was adopted in 2002, assigning coordination responsibilities to five countries for different areas of Afghan administration. The Afghanistan Compact, finalized in 2006, formalized the commitment between the Afghan government and the international community. The Afghanistan Compact, finalized in January 2006, shifted responsibility to Afghanistan with international support. It established pillars for security, governance, and economic development, overseen by the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) co-chaired by Afghan and UN representatives. UNAMA, established in 2002 by UN Security Council Resolution 1401, has an annual mandate emphasizing civilian assistance coordination. It leads international civilian efforts and cooperates with ISAF and NATO for civil-military coordination in support of Afghan-led development and stabilization. UNAMA has faced criticism for its coordination of international community efforts in non-security areas. President Karzai emphasized Afghan ownership and leadership in prioritizing and implementing development projects through the Kabul Process. The Kabul Process emphasizes Afghan leadership and ownership in securing, stabilizing, and developing the country, with the international community providing support and partnership. NATO supports Afghan-defined programmes through ISAF, established after the Bonn Conference in 2001 under a UN mandate to provide security in Kabul and surrounding areas. The UK initially led the force. The United Kingdom initially led the ISAF force established after the Bonn Agreement in December 2001. NATO took over the ISAF mission in August 2003, marking its first significant out-of-area deployment. NATO invoked Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty for the first time in response to the 9/11 attacks, paving the way for future operations in Afghanistan. The UN Security Council expanded the ISAF mandate in October 2003. The UN Security Council expanded the ISAF mandate in October 2003 to support the Afghan government in maintaining security outside Kabul. The current UN mandate extends ISAF's authorization for 12 months beyond October 13, 2010, with a mission to reduce insurgency, support Afghan National Security Forces, and improve governance and socio-economic development for sustainable stability. ISAF expanded its geographical scope in four stages to support Afghan efforts in securing Kabul and its surroundings. Led by a four-star combined headquarters in Kabul, ISAF assumed responsibility for different regions in Afghanistan, with NATO providing political direction for the mission. Europe (SHAPE), based in Mons, Belgium, and led by Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis, provides strategic command and control. NATO's Joint Force Command Headquarters in Brunssum, The Netherlands, under SHAPE, has overall operational control and administrative responsibilities. ISAF, reporting to SHAPE through Joint Forces Command-Brunssum, has in-theater operational command. The creation of ISAF Joint Command (IJC) in October 2009 aimed to improve unity of command within ISAF and unity of effort in Afghanistan. The ISAF Joint Command (IJC) was created in 2009 to focus on day-to-day operations in Afghanistan, led by Lieutenant General David Rodriguez. It works in partnership with Afghan and international counterparts to conduct comprehensive operations to neutralize the insurgency. The NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan (NTM-A) was established in November 2009 to strengthen NATO's assistance to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). NTM-A, led by Lieutenant General William Caldwell, supports the Afghan government in developing and sustaining the ANSF, and works in coordination with NATO nations, international organizations, donors, and non-governmental organizations. The NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan (NTM-A) supports the Afghan government in developing and sustaining the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). ISAF oversees six Regional Commands (RC) in Afghanistan, led by various countries, with troop contingents from NATO Allies and non-NATO partners totaling approximately 132,000 troops from 48 countries as of February 3, 2011. NATO has faced challenges in securing sufficient troop contributions. NATO has struggled to secure troop contributions for ISAF due to cost considerations and national caveats imposed by troop-contributing countries. As of April 2010, 27 ISAF contributors had placed caveats, with 20 limiting operations outside of assigned locations. Caveats are influenced by domestic political constraints. Troop-contributing countries impose national caveats on their troops in ISAF, hindering commanders' flexibility and impacting ISAF's relationship with Afghan National Security Forces partners. The U.S. government has urged ISAF troop contributors to drop national caveats. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan help develop Afghan provincial governments' capacity and capabilities. ISAF's area of responsibility expanded geographically, assuming responsibility for PRTs in new areas. As of early 2011, ISAF maintains PRTs in 28 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, with varying sizes, compositions, and focuses. Examples include the Swedish-led PRT in Balkh province, primarily a Swedish military unit with some U.S. and Finnish civilian experts, and the Turkish-led PRTs in Wardak and Jowzjan provinces, led by diplomats focusing on civilian activities. The PRTs in Afghanistan are led by various countries, with a focus on relationships with provincial political leadership and reconstruction projects. The British-led PRT in Helmand province is the largest, co-located with the UK military contingent. The PRT in Uruzgan province is re-organized under the ISAF flag after the Dutch forces' drawdown. U.S.-led PRTs have also undergone changes. The U.S.-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan have evolved over the years, with contributions from the Netherlands, the United States, and Australia. Originally military organizations, they now have a civilian lead and a military commander, with increased civilian staff. Evaluations of their success vary among practitioners and observers. Some argue that PRTs have not been resourced sufficiently to meet requirements, especially for Allies like Lithuania. Senior Afghan officials criticize PRTs for not coordinating enough with Afghan authorities. President Karzai has accused PRTs of setting up \"parallel governments\" in the countryside and called for their dismantling in 2011. Afghan officials also claim that international resources channeled through PRTs are frequently \"lost.\" The NATO Alliance is represented in Kabul by a Senior Civilian Representative (SCR), who reports to NATO's political leadership. In 2010, Ambassador Mark Sedwill became the new NATO SCR and worked closely with ISAF Commander GEN McChrystal. McChrystal and Ambassador Sedwill worked closely together, holding briefings, meetings with Afghan officials, and coordinating presentations for NATO. They also integrated efforts among key international actors and facilitated the appointment of Ambassador Simon Gass as the new NATO SCR in Afghanistan. The U.S. government presence in Afghanistan has significantly increased in recent years. The government footprint in Afghanistan has grown substantially, with changes in military and civilian command structures. The U.S. military presence adapted as the NATO ISAF mission evolved, with special operations forces established in 2001 and a two-star U.S. Army Division Headquarters in 2002. In 2003, a U.S.-led three-star Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan was set up in Kabul. In 2007, the Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan (CFC-A) was deactivated, leading to the establishment of the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A) reporting to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). In 2008, United States Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) was activated to streamline command and control for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, with the ISAF Commanding General also serving as the USFOR-A Commanding General. The USFOR-A Commanding General has operational control of U.S. conventional forces at ISAF's Regional Commands, CSTC-A training mission, and some U.S. Special Operations Forces. General Petraeus reports to SACEUR Admiral Stavridis as head of ISAF and to General Mattis as head of USFOR-A. As of January 1, 2011, there were 96,700 U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, with 78,400 assigned to ISAF. U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan have increased significantly over time, with additional Brigade Combat Teams being deployed. In January 2008, President Bush approved a one-time deployment of 3,200 additional Marines. These forces were later replaced by a Marine Air Ground Task Force in November 2008. The U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan grew substantially starting in 2009, with approval for additional troops by both the Bush and Obama administrations. Legal agreements were put in place for both ISAF and U.S. forces, confirming their status in the country. The 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations granted Defense a status equivalent to Embassy staff. The Joint Declaration in 2005 between Presidents Karzai and Bush reaffirmed U.S.-Afghan strategic partnership for security, democracy, and prosperity. The Declaration in 2005 reaffirmed the U.S.-Afghan strategic partnership for security, democracy, and prosperity, including commitments to security sector reform, counterterrorism operations, and intelligence-sharing. It also ensured continued access to Bagram Air Base for U.S. military forces and coalition forces' freedom of action for military operations. Afghan leadership has shown interest in coordinating operations with ISAF and U.S.-led forces. In August 2008, President Karzai called for a review of foreign forces in Afghanistan and formal status of forces agreements. In January 2009, GIRoA sent a proposed draft agreement to NATO outlining terms for NATO forces in Afghanistan. Talks in 2011 may revise the legal basis for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. U.S. civilian presence in Afghanistan has increased in recent years. The civilian presence in Afghanistan has significantly increased in personnel and U.S. government agencies. Efforts are being made to better organize the U.S. government internally and integrate international civilian expertise with military efforts. Capacity-building challenges in Afghanistan require additional expertise, especially in governance. In Afghanistan, there was a call for an interagency surge to address governance deficits. Major General Schloesser and Major General Weigt emphasized the need for civilian advisory teams. Experts recommended sending experienced officials to mentor Afghans in governance roles. A proposal for a civilian surge to support governance at provincial and district levels was outlined by the U.S. Embassy in Kabul in late 2008. The \"civilian surge\" initiative in Afghanistan, led by Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, saw a rapid increase in U.S. civilian personnel from 300 to over 1,100 by early 2011. Personnel from various government agencies were deployed to support provincial and district-level governance, including areas like rule of law. The U.S. Embassy Kabul is reinforcing its staff, with some personnel serving in growth areas like rule of law. Civilian agencies are facing challenges in meeting the demand for expertise in Afghanistan, with limited deployable personnel. Agencies are exploring solutions to address this issue, such as offering deployment opportunities to members of the Foreign Agricultural Service. The U.S. Embassy Kabul is increasing staff, including members of the Foreign Agricultural Service, to meet demand for expertise in Afghanistan. However, there are challenges in deploying personnel with relevant experience, as many new hires lack familiarity with their organization and Afghanistan. There is a risk of losing accumulated Afghanistan experience from temporary hires, as there are limited mechanisms for transitioning them to permanent agency staff. In 2009, a significant change was introduced by creating U.S. \"Senior Civilian Representative\" (SCR) positions to streamline the chain of command for U.S. civilians working under Chief of Mission authority in Kabul. The SCR is responsible for reporting up to the next higher level, aiming to elevate the civilian effort and ensure better unity of effort among agencies. This marks a shift from the previous role of State Department Political Advisors. During the war in Iraq, the State Department faced challenges meeting the demand for Political Advisors (POLADs) for military commanders. The Department of Defense hired civilians with political-military backgrounds to fill this role. The SCR structure has caused tensions among U.S. civilian agencies, as field personnel often reach back directly to their home organizations in addition to utilizing the SCR chain. Some observers suggest Afghanistan as a test case for integrated U.S. national power. Civil-military integration in Afghanistan shows innovations but also cultural differences causing tensions. Military sees civilian efforts as slow, while civilians worry about military rushing ahead. The integration of civilian and military efforts in Afghanistan has led to the need for clear division of labor. Innovative arrangements, such as the \"Board of Directors\" concept, have been implemented to foster greater integration between civilian and military leaders. The Brigade Commander makes decisions in the security arena, while civilian officials make decisions in governance and development. Group consultation on various issues is common, but a sharp division of labor between military and civilian teams has emerged. Some military staffs are eager to hand off non-security responsibilities to civilians, while some civilian teams seek undisputed leadership in those efforts. This emphasis on division of labor can lead to gaps in understanding and approach. The State Department's Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) deployed civilian planners to Afghanistan to improve cooperation between military and civilian officials. They established the Executive Working Group (EWG) to unify U.S. Government efforts in Afghanistan across security, governance, development, and information. The Executive Working Group (EWG) in Afghanistan includes senior leaders from the U.S. Embassy, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, and ISAF Regional Commands. It is supported by the Integrated Civilian-Military Action Group (ICMAG) and focuses on specific issues like borders. The structure promotes closer civil-military integration and involves non-U.S. personnel in Working Groups. The forum convenes regularly with ISAF and Embassy senior leadership. The U.S. civil-military planning in Afghanistan has made progress with the creation of the Integrated Civilian-Military Campaign Plan in 2009, aimed at closer integration. However, decision-making has been slow, with more focus on discussing issues rather than resolving them. The 40-page document by GEN McChrystal outlined 11 transformative effects for combined civil-military efforts in Afghanistan, focusing on areas like justice, governance, agriculture, and reintegration. The strategy did not provide a comprehensive vision for Afghanistan but emphasized the practice of civil-military planning. Efforts were being made to update the U.S. Civil-Military Campaign Plan to align with the ISAF campaign plan. The stand-up of the ISAF Joint Command in October 2009 created a planning partner for Embassy officials working on governance and development at sub-national levels. In 2009 and 2010, extensive planning for operations in Helmand and Kandahar provinces, as well as civil-military support in key districts across Afghanistan, saw increased Embassy participation. A lack of dedicated personnel hindered full involvement in planning activities, with civilian planners from S/CRS assisting the Embassy. The campaign in Afghanistan involves long-term planning efforts with civilian planners from S/CRS contributing significantly. It is a multi-faceted joint, combined, and civil-military effort focusing on governance, development, and security. Operation Omid is the operational-level operation implementing the campaign plan across Afghanistan. Operation Omid is an operation in Afghanistan that implements the campaign plan, focusing on geographical prioritization and full integration of security, governance, and development efforts in key locations. It aims to focus and synchronize efforts, involving Afghan counterparts in combined planning efforts. The Operation Omid plan involved the Ministries of Defense and Interior, as well as international civilian partners, in a joint planning effort. It included Afghan civilian and security ministry officials, police and army commanders, and their international counterparts. The plan underwent revisions over the next year. The Operation Omid plans underwent their first revision in late 2010, with a focus on Operation Moshtarek in the central districts of Helmand province, heavily populated by Pashtuns and known for poppy-growing. The six districts were chosen for their population density and importance in commerce routes. Planning involved Kabul-based Ministers, Governor Mangal, Afghan army and police commanders, and international partners. Operation Omid plans were revised in late 2010, focusing on Operation Moshtarek in Helmand province. Governor Mangal, Afghan army and police commanders, and international partners were involved in planning. President Karzai approved \"clearing\" operations, successfully removing Taliban fighters. Operation Hamkari in Kandahar province was the second large-scale manifestation of Operation Omid. Operation Hamkari in Kandahar province faced challenges due to its status as the Taliban's spiritual home. Political power was concentrated in the hands of key figures like President Karzai's half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai. President Karzai's half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, held strong de facto authority in Kandahar province, leading to unequal opportunities for political and economic participation. Efforts for Operation Hamkari were extensive, with President Karzai personally conducting shaping activities to disrupt insurgent networks and lay the groundwork for responsive governance. In early 2011, efforts were made to establish a civilian government presence in Kandahar city and surrounding networks. A new district governor, police chief, and government employees were working in Arghandab district. ISAF and Afghan partners were conducting a \"winter campaign\" to strengthen security forces and governance. The upcoming spring fighting season was expected to bring increased Taliban activity. In early 2011, ISAF and Afghan partners planned to expand security bubbles in Central Helmand, Kandahar, Kabul, Wardak, Logar, Nangarhar, Paktia, Paktika, and Khowst provinces to facilitate freedom of movement and trade. Efforts were also focused on decimating the Haqqani network in eastern Afghanistan and reducing Taliban presence in Baghlan province. Herat was identified as a candidate for early security measures. President Obama set the \"July 2011\" marker for transition in Afghanistan, leading to confusion among practitioners and observers. President Karzai's policy positions and NATO plans shaped the transition process until 2014. Karzai introduced the concept of Afghan sovereignty and transition, influencing NATO and U.S. strategic planning. President Karzai outlined a plan for Afghanistan to lead military operations and ensure security within five years, with the concept of transition from ISAF to ANSF being a key part of NATO's operational plans. The NATO Defense Ministers approved a Strategic Concept for Phase IV \"Transition\" in Bratislava, allowing ISAF to work with Afghan partners to codify the process. The January 2010 London Conference on Afghanistan supported the development of a plan for phased transition to Afghan security lead province by province, emphasizing a shared commitment to create conditions for rapid transition. The London Conference Communiqu\u00e9 set a timeline for provinces to transition to ANSF lead by late 2010 or early 2011, with ISAF moving to a supporting role. Conditions for transition were discussed in Tallinn, broadening decision-making criteria to include governance and development factors. Follow-on consultations in Kabul focused on ensuring a stable environment for durable security. The talks focused on elaborating a concept paper for Inteqal (transition) endorsed by ISAF leaders and key Allied troop-contributing nations. The goal was to announce the transition underway by the end of 2010, with Afghan forces assuming full security responsibility by the end of 2014. Transition decision-making will be guided by key principles. Transition decision-making will be conditions-based, signaling a progressive shift in the role of the international community from supporting to enabling the Afghan government and ANSF. The Joint Afghan NATO Inteqal Board in Kabul assesses and recommends timelines for transitioning geographic areas and institutions. President Karzai aimed to announce the first provinces for transition in March 2011. Security efforts, including counter-terrorism and growing the Afghan National Security Forces, are crucial for the success of the campaign in Afghanistan. Differences in opinion revolve around the importance of security versus other efforts, as well as the timing and sequencing of these efforts. Rebuilding the ANSF is essential due to decades of war and mismanagement, with the goal of transitioning security responsibility to Afghan forces. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) include the Afghan National Army (ANA), Afghan National Police (ANP), and National Directorate of Security (NDS). The ANA is divided into six ground forces Corps Headquarters located in different regions of Afghanistan. The Afghan National Army (ANA) follows the European model with a two-star headquarters and subordinate brigades. The ANA Air Force (ANAAF) was previously known as the ANA Air \"Corps\" and has a history dating back to 1924. Despite facing challenges, the ANAAF had 50 aircraft as of September 2010 with plans for expansion. The Afghan National Army Air Force (ANAAF) had 50 aircraft in September 2010, with plans to increase to 146 by 2016. The aircraft included helicopters, airlifters, and fixed-wing jets. The Afghan National Police (ANP) consists of various units such as the Afghan Uniform Police (AUP), Afghan Border Police (ABP), Afghan National Civil Order Police (ANCOP), and Counternarcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA), each with specific law enforcement responsibilities. Target endstrengths for the army and police have grown over time. The Bonn Agreement set low targets for the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) at 70,000 and 62,000 personnel respectively, totaling 132,000. There were debates on increasing these numbers, with suggestions ranging from 250,000 to 600,000 total forces, considering the country's population and insurgency factors. In 2008, there were debates on increasing the Afghan National Army (ANA) size to 250,000, with Minister of Defense Wardak advocating for a larger force. By 2009, ISAF Commander GEN McChrystal proposed a total target endstrength of 400,000 troops for the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). The Board endorsed increasing ANA and ANP targets to 134,000 and 109,000 by October 2010, and to 171,600 and 134,000 by October 2011. As of February 2011, over 270,000 ANSF were assigned, including 152,000 ANA and 118,000 ANP. Discussions were ongoing to raise the total target endstrength for October 2012 to 378,000, including 208,000 ANA and 170,000 police. Minister of Defense Wardak proposed sizing the ANA based on future security challenges. Minister of Defense Wardak proposed sizing the ANA based on future security challenges, suggesting equipping the force with a mix of capabilities for current and future needs. Command and control arrangements have been adapted for joint counterinsurgency efforts with coalition forces. The extent to which the proposed endstrength increase reflects a detailed analysis of Afghanistan's forces' requirements over time is unclear. The Afghan government established Operations Coordination Centers (OCCs) at regional and provincial levels to coordinate ANA, ANP, and NDS operations. OCCs serve as physical facilities for monitoring and coordinating operational activities, with a focus on information sharing rather than command authority. Staffing challenges have been noted by ISAF officials. The Operations Coordination Centers (OCCs) at regional and provincial levels coordinate ANA, ANP, and NDS operations. OCC-P members reach out to ANA brigades and ANP provincial command centers, while OCC-R members reach out to ANA Corps and ANP regional command centers. The ANA generally leads OCCs, which may be located in police facilities. Observers question the OCC construct's suitability post-COIN. Transitioning from domestic to external concerns may not be difficult, as OCC coordination relationships complement formal service command relationships. Training Afghan forces has been a key international concern since the Taliban's fall, with efforts showing increased cohesion over time. The international community, led by the U.S., has worked towards greater cohesion in training Afghan security forces since the Bonn Conference in 2001. Lead nations were assigned responsibilities in different security areas, with the U.S. overseeing ANA development and Germany leading police sector development. The Afghan government took over formal lead responsibility in 2006, with the U.S. creating the Office of Military Cooperation-Afghanistan in 2002 to train the ANA. In 2005, the U.S. government restructured its ANSF training efforts, shifting responsibility for supporting Afghan police development to the Department of Defense, renaming the Office of Military Cooperation-Afghanistan (OMC-A) to the Office of Security Cooperation-Afghanistan (OSC-A). OSC-A was later re-designated as the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A) and assigned to U.S. Central Command. NTM-A was established in 2009 to support institutional training for Afghanistan's army and police. The Commander, LTG Caldwell, was also the Commanding General of CSTC-A. NTM-A oversees training from basic to senior levels, aiming to transition responsibility to Afghans. Constraints included a lack of experienced trainers due to ongoing conflict, but as the Afghan National Security Forces grew, this pressure eased. The training of Afghan security forces has evolved over time, with a focus on both institutional training and on-the-job training with coalition support. Teams vary in size, composition, and focus, with U.S. and NATO teams now under the ISAF Joint Command for better coordination. Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) work with the Afghan army, while Police OMLTs (POMLTs) mentor Afghan police and may plan missions with them. Multiple countries provide OMLTs, with the majority from the United States. As of October 2010, 11 countries were providing Police Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (POMLTs), with the majority from the United States. There was a shortfall of trainers for the Afghan National Army (ANA) in November 2010, with a need for more embedded training teams. The use of small embedded training teams to coach and mentor host nation units is different from unit partnering, which involves full coalition units building relationships with host nation security force units. In late 2008, some Afghan officials were skeptical about unit partnering, with Defense Minister Wardak opposing the concept, arguing that Afghan units should stand on their own. Despite this, a U.S. brigade-sized Task Force took the initiative to partner with the Afghan National Army (ANA) by sending a tactical command post to co-locate with the ANA Corps headquarters for two weeks every month. In 2009, GEN McChrystal called for enhanced partnering efforts with Afghan units, emphasizing living, eating, and training together 24/7. Co-locating units has since grown substantially, with some ISAF and Afghan army brigades deploying commanders to work closely with ANA Corps headquarters. Partnering efforts between ISAF and Afghan National Army (ANA) have shown positive results, leading to increased competency in Afghan army units. This has allowed ISAF to shift focus towards Afghan National Police and Border Police. Partnering with Afghan police forces may require co-location at police stations and coordination for missions with dispersed units. Partnering between ISAF and ANSF commanders yields dividends by establishing close relationships, allowing for accountability and oversight. However, a major downside is the quantity of forces required for intensive partnering, which is typically temporary. The ISAF Joint Command evaluates the operational effectiveness of ANSF units and their leadership using a classified assessment system. The ANA is considered the most capable force, with strong leadership emerging as a key strength. There is pressure to develop new leaders due to a demographic gap in personnel ages, which will take time to address fully. The Afghan National Army (ANA) faces challenges in developing new leaders due to a generational gap in personnel ages. The ANA Air Force has shown capabilities, particularly with their Mi-17 helicopter fleet, but still relies on U.S. and ISAF forces for logistics, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and air support. The Afghan National Police is considered to be lagging in operational effectiveness. The Afghan National Police faces challenges with corruption, job purchasing, and alienation of the Afghan people. The Afghan Border Police lags behind in development and faces issues with capacity, corruption, and border security. The Afghan Border Police struggles with securing Afghanistan's extensive borders, which span nearly 3,500 miles of difficult terrain. Minister of Defense Wardak acknowledges the impossibility of fully securing the border. Efforts to improve border protection include better trained personnel, aerial reconnaissance, and quick response forces. Integration among security forces is improving, but there are still cultural barriers and a lack of trust between the army and police. The Afghan security forces aim for effectiveness and community acceptance, with a focus on ethnic balance. The Afghan National Army is seen as a national institution due to its diverse composition and willingness to serve anywhere in the country. The appointment of Bismillah Khan Mohammadi as Minister of Interior is seen as a potential bridge between different security forces. In the post-Taliban years, the Afghan army aimed for ethnic balance, with Pashtuns under-represented and Tajiks over-represented. Efforts are being made to recruit more Pashtuns from the south to address this imbalance. The Afghan Local Police (ALP) program, established in August 2010 by President Karzai, aims to create organized local groups to provide security for their communities under the Ministry of Interior's command. General Petraeus estimated over 3,000 participants in 17 sites in February 2011, with plans for significant program expansion. ALP is seen as similar to the traditional Pashtun institution of \"arbakai\" for village defense. In 2006, the coalition supported the creation of the Afghan National Auxiliary Police (ANAP) program as a temporary measure in southern Afghanistan. The locally recruited force had minimal training and oversight, leading to criticism from practitioners and observers. The program was later deemed a \"short-cut\" attempt by a CSTC-A Commanding General. In 2008, a program was dismantled after being criticized as a \"short-cut\" by an RC-East senior official. ISAF then launched a community guard program under GEN McKiernan to address security concerns, focusing on protecting Highway 1 from insurgent attacks. The program involved community-based councils selecting and training participants to serve in their local areas. The Afghan Public Protection Program (\"AP3\") was implemented in Wardak province to address security concerns due to a lack of police presence. U.S. Special Operations Forces partnered closely with AP3 teams, leading to the growth of community defense programs by 2009. The program required a significant commitment from coalition forces and focused on guarding fixed sites in local communities. The Community Defense Initiative (CDI) and Local Defense Initiative (LDI) were established in less-populated areas with little formal ANSF or coalition force presence. CFSOCC-A collaborated with ISAF and Afghan officials to support these efforts. The National Directorate of Security (NDS) also initiated local self-defense programs in northern provinces. In 2009 and 2010, it became evident that no single institution had a complete overview of all security initiatives. The Afghan Local Police program was established to consolidate various local defense initiatives and address concerns about creating new warlords. It was formalized with clear Afghan and ISAF agreement in 2010, following meetings between President Karzai and GEN Petraeus. Despite the lack of a comprehensive overview of all existing self-defense bodies, the ALP aimed to bring together known coalition and Afghan local self-defense programs. The ALP program, established in 2010, aimed to consolidate coalition and Afghan local self-defense programs with oversight from community shuras. ISAF dedicated forces to support CFSOCC-A in these efforts, with GEN Petraeus willing to allocate more resources if needed. Counter-terrorism activities targeting insurgent leaders in Afghanistan have increased under Petraeus' leadership since June 2010. Since June 2010, under GEN Petraeus' leadership, ISAF has increased efforts in counter-terrorism activities, with a focus on increasing intelligence assets and Afghan Special Operations Forces' capabilities. President Karzai has expressed concerns about civilian casualties resulting from coalition military operations. President Karzai has expressed concerns about civilian casualties in Afghanistan, particularly regarding night raids and incidents with significant civilian casualties. In March 2011, he contacted President Obama after nine children were mistakenly killed by coalition helicopters. Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged Karzai's concerns during a testimony before the House Appropriations Committee. To address President Karzai's concerns about civilian casualties in Afghanistan, ISAF Commanders have issued Tactical Directives to limit the circumstances for deadly force application. GEN McKiernan emphasized the importance of minimizing civilian casualties and applying proportionality, restraint, and discrimination in the use of firepower. Specific conditions for searches and entries were set to ensure adherence to these principles. In July 2009, GEN McChrystal issued a revised Tactical Directive emphasizing judicious restraint and the need for an ANSF lead in searches. The Directive stressed training to minimize deadly force and highlighted the risks of excessive force leading to an alienated population. It limited the use of air-to-ground munitions and indirect fires against residential compounds to specific conditions. In August 2010, GEN Petraeus issued a revised Tactical Directive to address concerns about restrictive rules of engagement. Subordinate commanders were not allowed to impose stricter restrictions without approval. Emphasis was placed on judicious use of force, with the requirement to ensure no civilians were present before approving strikes. The counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan faces challenges due to the porous Afghanistan-Pakistan border, allowing insurgents to find safe haven in Pakistan. Efforts have been made by the U.S. government and ISAF to work with Pakistani counterparts to address this issue. The Government of Pakistan has limited control over the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) bordering Afghanistan, further complicating the cross-border insurgency problem. The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) bordering Afghanistan have a semiautonomous status dating back to British rule. The area serves as a staging area for militants preparing to fight in Kashmir and Afghanistan. The Pashtun population on both sides of the border has historical ties, with more Pashtuns living in Pakistan. Pakistan has vested interests in Afghanistan due to its shared ethnic and geopolitical connections. The Government of Pakistan has a general interest in ensuring Afghanistan as a regional ally to balance against India. Pakistani support for Afghan mujahedin and the Taliban has strained Afghan-Pakistani relations. Pakistan has tried to stabilize the border with Afghanistan by making peace deals with local power brokers, like Baitullah Mahsud in 2005. In mid-2006, Islamabad made a peace deal with insurgents in North Waziristan, agreeing to end military operations in exchange for a halt in attacks on government officials. However, these deals did not bring stability, leading the U.S. to encourage Pakistani military action against insurgent strongholds. The Pakistani government faces challenges in taking action against Afghan insurgents on its territory due to limited military capabilities, political will, and control over rogue elements of the ISI. The Obama Administration has emphasized the need for Pakistan to be a stronger partner in combating safe havens for insurgents. President Bush authorized U.S. military cross-border operations into Pakistan in 2008, using ground troops or Predator drones. NATO's policy for ISAF does not include cross-border strikes, with Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stating that NATO forces will not cross into Pakistani territory unless in self-defense. The focus of drone strikes in Pakistan shifted from South Waziristan to North Waziristan, targeting TTP and Haqqani network leaders. Under the Obama Administration, drone attacks increased significantly, yielding operational benefits in Afghanistan. NATO forces do not conduct cross-border strikes into Pakistani territory. The use of drone strikes in Pakistan has led to local residents wanting al Qaeda and outsiders to leave their communities, potentially sparking protests and destabilizing the government. Critics point to civilian casualties caused by the strikes, which could generate disaffection with Pakistan's political leadership. There has been increased Pakistani military operations against domestic insurgent threats and growing coordination among Pakistani, Afghan, and ISAF forces. In early 2011, the question was whether Pakistani forces would target the Haqqani network in North Waziristan. The U.S. government confronted Pakistani authorities in July 2008 over ties between ISI members and the Haqqani network. This led to Pakistani military operations in FATA, notably in Bajaur agency in August 2008. Operations in Bajaur were compared to Fallujah, Iraq, post-operation. In late 2009, following the death of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mahsud, the Pakistani military launched an offensive in South Waziristan agency, targeting the TTP stronghold. Subsequent operations were carried out in Orakzai agency in 2010, Kurram agency, and currently in Mohmand agency, primarily focusing on the TTP. The Pakistani operations disrupted insurgent networks but highlighted the need for improvement in counterinsurgency \"soft\" skills. By late 2008, U.S. ground forces in eastern Afghanistan reported improved tactical-level coordination with Pakistani forces to combat the enemy at the border. Three-way operational-level planning sessions were regularly held by early 2011 to coordinate operations on both sides of the border. Pakistani military operations in Bajaur and Mohmand agencies in Pakistan complemented Afghan and ISAF operations in Kunar province in Afghanistan. In Kunar province, Afghan and ISAF operations were coordinated to \"squeeze\" insurgents. Good governance was emphasized by Afghan officials, international practitioners, and observers. President Karzai highlighted the importance of effective governance, while President Obama confirmed its significance in U.S. strategy for Afghanistan. Clare Lockhart emphasized the need for a functioning state for stability. There is a lack of consensus on the relationship between governance and security efforts in Afghanistan. Some officials believe that security creates the conditions for governance to flourish automatically, while others argue that governance requires concerted efforts similar to those in the security realm. There is a lack of consensus on the importance of good governance for Afghanistan's future stability, with a focus on countering corruption. President Obama and President Karzai have both emphasized the need to address corruption to restore faith in leadership. President Karzai emphasized at the January 2010 London Conference that fighting corruption would be a key focus of his second term. He committed to punishing wrongdoers and rewarding those who avoid corruption, aiming to end impunity and promote the rule of law and democracy in Afghanistan. However, there is disagreement on the extent to which corruption threatens the country's stability. The need for capacity-building in Afghanistan is driven by challenges in human capital due to years of war and displacement. Some Afghans lack the skills and education to work effectively in the post-Taliban era. However, there may be officials willing to serve in areas affected by insurgencies once security conditions improve. Many educated Afghans prefer working for the international community due to higher salaries and fewer obstacles compared to government positions. They cite the need to pay bribes for ministry jobs and low salaries as deterrents to working for Afghan ministries. Many educated Afghans prefer working for the international community due to higher salaries and fewer obstacles compared to government positions. Some coalition officials point out that the standards for serving in the Afghan government only need to meet basic requirements. For example, senior officials communicate with coalition partners using PowerPoint, while small units can use hard copies of terrain maps for planning. In 2009, in Sarkani district, Kunar province, an Afghan ministry representative described his background and work, stating he did not need much support for his efforts. In Sarkani district, Kunar province, an Afghan ministry representative, who acquired education during displacement in Pakistan, built relationships with tribal leaders and relied on traditional justice mechanisms. He maintained records without a computerized system and traveled throughout the province with a bicycle requested in 2009. Capacity-building efforts focused on filling organizational tables at the sub-national level in 2009 and 2010. Provincial and district governments in Afghanistan include representatives from Kabul-based line ministries to support the centralized political system. The District Delivery Program (DDP) in Afghanistan, supported by international partners, aims to establish a basic government presence in key districts. This initiative focuses on building core capabilities for effective provincial and district-level service. The District Delivery Program in Afghanistan aims to establish core capabilities for effective provincial and district-level service. Capacity alone may not be sufficient, as Afghan officials' accountability and responsiveness are crucial. The U.S. government and international community are working to encourage Afghan accountability and prevent corruption. The establishment of the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force Shafafiyat in 2010 has helped in fostering transparency within ISAF. The establishment of the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force Shafafiyat in 2010 aims to foster transparency within ISAF by addressing corruption issues and promoting accountability among Afghan and international practitioners. Shafafiyat's mission includes understanding and combating corrupt practices, integrating anti-corruption efforts with external partners, and ensuring an anti-corruption focus in ISAF's operations. The Afghan government holds officials accountable through appointments and removals, often based on patronage networks overseen by President Karzai. The Afghan government, led by President Karzai, has historically appointed officials based on patronage networks. However, recent efforts have been made to support merit-based appointments, with the issuance of a Sub-National Governance Policy in 2010 emphasizing accountability to the people in various administrative levels. The Afghan government, under President Karzai, has introduced measures to promote merit-based appointments in key positions. Provincial governors will still be political appointees, but deputy provincial governors and district governors will now be hired based on merit. In 2010, President Karzai shifted the responsibility for appointing senior ministry officials and governors' staff to the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission, aiming to reduce favoritism in appointments. The Afghan government, with support from the United States and international partners, has implemented initiatives to combat corruption. This includes training the Anti-Corruption Unit and working with the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Afghan Sensitive Investigative Unit to investigate and prosecute corrupt officials. The Afghan Major Crime Task Force (MCTF) was created with mentoring from the FBI and U.K. SOCA to focus on major crimes like corruption, narcotics, and kidnapping. The Anti-Corruption Unit's work is supported by the Afghan Threat Finance Cell (ATFC) established in 2008 to trace funding for insurgency. The Anti-Corruption Unit's work is supported by the Afghan Threat Finance Cell (ATFC), which includes representatives from various agencies. In Summer 2010, Mohammad Zia Salehi, head of administration for the Afghan National Security Council, was arrested on corruption charges. President Karzai launched an investigation into the officials involved in Salehi's arrest and released him from confinement. In August 2010, Senator John Kerry emphasized the importance of the SIU and MCTF during a visit to Kabul. President Karzai endorsed the units, highlighting Afghan sovereignty and independence from foreign interference. The ACU's activities were suspended in September 2010. In September 2010, the ACU's activities were suspended, and corruption charges against Salehi were dropped. Local shuras are seen as a way for Afghan people to hold officials accountable, with IJC Commander LTG Rodriguez emphasizing their importance. These councils, supported by international engagement, can bring about change in cases lacking evidence for prosecution. They reflect Afghan communities' tradition of self-organization and regulation. Local shuras in Afghanistan play a crucial role in self-regulation and inclusiveness within the population. These councils, including Community Development Councils (CDC), support programs like the National Solidarity Program (NSP) to empower Afghan communities in their own development. Despite the Afghan Constitution calling for district council elections, they have been indefinitely postponed. The presence of shuras is vital in a society lacking other checks and balances due to years of conflict. The National Solidarity Program (NSP) empowers Afghan communities through Community Development Councils (CDCs) to manage their own development projects. CDCs prioritize and propose projects for MRRD approval, with full transparency to prevent corruption. Over 26,000 CDCs have been elected, with over 55,000 project proposals approved and 45,000 projects completed. CDCs continue to serve their communities even after NSP projects are finished, providing ongoing support and dispute resolution. The Afghanistan Social Outreach Program (ASOP) creates temporary district-level councils through a caucus-based process to elect community leaders for project execution. These councils are distinct from the National Solidarity Program's Community Development Councils, focusing solely on fostering community engagement in development projects. The ASOP program establishes district-level councils to elect community leaders for project execution, aiming to address public needs and conflicts in coordination with the District Governor. Initially slow, the program received support from the US and UK in Wardak and Helmand provinces. By 2009-2010, IDLG's ASOP program expanded its role in Helmand and Kandahar provinces, facilitating activities like district council elections in Nawa, Helmand province. In Nawa, residents actively participated in electing a 35-member council. Taliban insurgents assassinated three council members, but the council reconvened and selected a new chairman. In another instance, community leaders protested against corruption in Manogai district, Kunar province. The elders in the region signed a petition to remove the Governor, leading to his replacement. The shura organized into a district-level body and elected members to serve on a formal council. Shinwari tribe elders pledged opposition to the Taliban after engaging with coalition elements. The Shinwari elders took a bold stand against corruption and illegal activities, supporting the Afghan people. The international community struggled to define its role in supporting the Afghan government while holding it accountable. The ISAF mandate emphasizes supporting the Afghan government, reflecting the importance of host nation support in counter-insurgency efforts. In practice, the \"support GIRoA\" shorthand can lead practitioners astray. A platoon leader in Afghanistan closely associated with Afghan officials, but local residents expressed skepticism and fear towards them, leading to the belief that ISAF was part of the problem. Officials have suggested supporting GIRoA judiciously and engaging directly with the people to gauge popular views. The Counterinsurgency Guidance by GEN Petraeus emphasized building relationships with a wide range of individuals. Practitioners highlight the impact of international practices on graft and corruption, stressing the need for better understanding of where funding goes. USFOR-A established Task Force 2010 in Summer 2010 to address these issues. Task Force 2010 was established by USFOR-A in Summer 2010 to address U.S. contracting practices and their impact. Rear Admiral Kathleen Dussault led the Task Force initially, emphasizing the importance of the initiative. General Petraeus issued \"COIN Contracting Guidance\" in September 2010, highlighting the risks of insufficient oversight in contracting practices in Afghanistan. The Guidance called for making contracting a priority and gaining understanding from local officials. Efforts to support Afghan economic development are crucial for stabilization. Development activities aim to meet basic needs and lay the groundwork for long-term economic viability, reducing the need for international support in the future. Commanders prioritize understanding local officials and contract recipients to ensure effective use of funds. Efforts to support Afghan economic development are crucial for stabilization. The international community must decide on the best ways to provide support for sustainable economic growth in Afghanistan. President Obama emphasizes that nation-building is the responsibility of the Afghans themselves. The U.S. government is working on a comprehensive economic strategy to support the counterinsurgency campaign, promote economic stabilization, and help establish sustainable Afghan institutions. The international community must decide on the best ways to support sustainable economic growth in Afghanistan. President Obama emphasizes that nation-building is the responsibility of the Afghans themselves. Charting out an economic strategy may help clarify the roles of other international partners in Afghanistan's development. Afghanistan faces challenges due to 30 years of war and disruption, hindering its growth and exposure to global opportunities. The international community's presence in Afghanistan over the last ten years has distorted the labor market and made providing assistance more challenging. Efforts to support development have improved with the Afghan government leading the way through the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) issued in 2008. The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) outlined key areas of development important to the Afghan government, organized around three pillars: security, governance, and economic/social development. The ANDS also addressed cross-cutting issues like regional cooperation and anti-corruption. The lack of prioritization was seen as a weakness, but efforts for greater coherence were made through the Kabul Process under President Karzai's administration. The development efforts in Afghanistan are focused on new National Priority Programs in agriculture, human resources, and economic/infrastructure development. The Ministry of Finance is leading this organizational framework, with a clear vision for the country's future economy, including revenue sources like agriculture, border crossings, and mineral resources. The Department of Defense and the U.S. Geographical Survey found that Afghanistan has valuable mineral resources like iron, copper, cobalt, gold, and lithium worth one trillion U.S. dollars. However, managing the extractive industry requires significant infrastructure. Experts recommend improving transportation and energy networks to support economic development in Afghanistan. The focus of economic strategy in Afghanistan should be on rehabilitating and expanding regional transport and energy networks, including road and rail corridors linking Afghanistan with its neighbors in Central Asia. Developing the labor force through vocational training and higher education is also crucial for creating more job opportunities in both public and private sectors. President Karzai emphasized the need to improve the skill base of the labor force at the January 2010 London Conference. Generating a broad vision of Afghanistan's future labor force and its evolution over time is crucial for shaping new training and educational programs. Rationalizing public sector and international community salaries can help rebalance economic incentives for skilled labor. There is a need to foster an Afghan government capable of managing its own budget. In 2010, the London Conference participants pledged to increase Afghan government's share of international aid to 50% within two years, contingent on improvements in financial management, corruption reduction, and capacity building. International community often avoids Afghan ministries due to limited capacity and corruption concerns. Some suggest imposing stringent accountability mechanisms on Afghan ministries to prevent corruption and channel funding through them, despite the potential for delays and increased opportunities for corruption. The international community's approach to development assistance has evolved over time, moving away from direct project implementation towards streamlined accountability measures to reduce corruption opportunities. The international community's approach to development assistance has evolved towards streamlined accountability measures to reduce corruption opportunities. Efforts have been made to consult closely with Afghan interlocutors to identify local needs and involve Afghan officials in decision-making processes, such as launching initiatives like the \"CERP as a budget\" program. The BCT provided a sum of money to Afghan officials at provincial and district levels, who prioritized requirements and created budgets based on the total sum available. Afghan officials were more careful and prioritized their needs when given discretion over the funding. The evolution in thinking about development assistance has been non-linear and incomplete, with reports of progress in project completion and spending. Many practitioners focus on demonstrating \"results\" in quantitative form to higher headquarters and Congressional oversight committees. There is a growing awareness of power structures and patronage networks in Afghanistan that benefit from international assistance. The early post-Taliban years saw neglect due to disparate donors, limited oversight, and lack of functioning Afghan institutions. Analyzing who benefits from each dollar spent is a challenging task. Understanding who benefits from each dollar spent is a challenging task, but it is crucial to ensure that funding does not end up in the wrong hands. General Petraeus emphasized the importance of being mindful of the impact of spending and funding only those who align with our values. Reintegration and reconciliation are seen as essential components of the campaign effort in Afghanistan, with a focus on distinguishing between the two terms. The distinction between reintegration and reconciliation in the Afghan campaign effort is not clearly defined. Some view reintegration as focusing on low-level fighters and reconciliation on senior insurgent leaders, while others associate reintegration with individual decision-making and reconciliation with decisions by insurgent leaders. The logical relationship between reintegration and reconciliation is uncertain, with no agreed theory on how pulling lower-level fighters off the battlefield would impact higher-level conflict settlement. President Karzai's role in the Afghan government is significant in this context. President Karzai is seen as the leading voice on reintegration and reconciliation in Afghanistan. He advocates for bringing back \"upset brothers\" into society and differentiates between hardcore insurgents and those willing to return home. His support for reconciliation may stem from uncertainty about Afghanistan's future and international commitment. The U.S. government supports Afghan-led processes for reconciliation and reintegration, with President Obama emphasizing the need for former fighters to renounce violence and accept the Afghan Constitution. President Karzai's advocacy for reconciliation is driven by uncertainty about Afghanistan's future and international commitment. Key events in 2010, such as the National Consultative Peace Jirga, pushed reintegration and reconciliation to the forefront of the political stage. In June 2010, the National Consultative Peace Jirga (NCPJ) convened 1,600 delegates from Afghanistan to promote consensus on a path towards peace. The event's Resolution praised President Karzai's efforts for peaceful reconciliation and called for a formal reintegration program and the establishment of a high peace council. In July 2010, the Kabul Conference participants endorsed the outcomes of the NCPJ, highlighting Afghan society's strong will for political reconciliation to end the conflict. In September 2010, a new 70-member High Peace Council was established to facilitate reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan. President Karzai signed a decree in June 2010 for the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP), which was endorsed in July 2010. The program includes social outreach and demobilization components to encourage fighters and local communities to participate. The Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP) includes demobilization to remove fighters and their weapons, accountability through registration and vetting, and peace consolidation with training and employment opportunities for former fighters. Afghan leadership with international support and community involvement are key principles. Approximately 1,000 former fighters have formally joined the program, with silent reintegration also observed. The APRP aims to address the needs of local communities and reintegrating fighters through improved security, trustworthy security forces, responsive government officials, and inclusive shuras. Reconciliation in Afghanistan is seen as an ongoing process rather than a one-time formal negotiation. Reconciliation in Afghanistan is an ongoing and fluid process due to challenges from multiple insurgencies. Communication channels between insurgents and society members are continually open, with informal efforts to test the climate. Final decisions are likely made by President Karzai, possibly with a small group of advisors. The High Peace Council focuses more on outreach and exploration rather than conducting formal talks. The High Peace Council in Afghanistan is focusing on outreach and exploration rather than sensitive negotiations. Concerns have been raised about the inclusiveness of the reconciliation process, particularly regarding the potential alienation of non-Pashtuns and the exclusion of progressive elements from society. There are worries that a Taliban-influenced political order may not respect certain groups. Some are concerned that a Taliban-influenced political order may not respect Afghan women's rights. Others emphasize the importance of involving the Afghan people in the reconciliation process. Timing of reconciliation efforts is debated, with some suggesting insurgent leaders will only consider talks when they believe defeat is inevitable. Some argue that insurgent leaders may only negotiate from a position of strength, while others believe progress in building security forces and government stability is crucial for successful talks. Debates on Afghanistan's political system have occurred alongside discussions on reconciliation. Experts suggest a decentralized political order may align better with Afghan history. However, decentralization could empower former insurgent leaders. Contingency operations involve strategy, plans, and execution. The Obama Administration has implemented a system of assessments to measure progress in Afghanistan and Pakistan. President Obama emphasized the importance of clear metrics and accountability in evaluating the strategy. The Obama Administration has implemented assessments to measure progress in Afghanistan and Pakistan, emphasizing clear metrics and accountability. Congress mandated regular \"1230 reports\" on security and stability in Afghanistan, including a comprehensive strategy description and detailed sections on NATO, ANSF, PRTs, and counter-narcotics efforts. The 1230 reports on security and stability in Afghanistan cover various focus areas such as ANSF, PRTs, counter-narcotics activities, corruption, and regional considerations. These reports provide detailed descriptions comparing current conditions with the previous reporting period but lack information on progress benchmarks, campaign logic, and timelines for further progress. They also tend to lag behind current strategic thinking, with the most recent report covering the period from April 1 to September 30, 2010, reflecting the 2009 ISAF campaign plan. NATO's ISAF campaign plan was under revision since Summer 2010 to reflect conditions on the ground and guidance from General Petraeus. Congress imposed a new reporting requirement in 2009 for the President to submit a policy report on Afghanistan and Pakistan, in addition to DoD's 1230 reports. This new requirement included clear objectives and metrics to assess progress. The Administration submitted an initial report on September 24, 2009, outlining eight objectives of U.S. policy towards Afghanistan and Pakistan, including disrupting terrorist networks, enhancing civilian control in Pakistan, and developing Pakistan's counterinsurgency capabilities. The Administration outlined objectives for U.S. policy towards Afghanistan and Pakistan, including involving the international community to stabilize both countries, building Afghan National Security Force capacity, and transitioning security responsibility to the Afghan government by July 2011. The legislation required subsequent reports to assess progress towards these objectives and any necessary modifications. The Administration submitted metrics reports in March 2010 and October 2010 to assess progress towards objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Some recipients on the Hill have criticized the reports for lacking clear strategy and measurable progress indicators. The Administration conducted its own review of progress in Afghanistan and Pakistan in fall 2010, known as the Afghanistan and Pakistan Annual Review (\"APAR\"). The results were not shared with Congress, but a five-page summary was provided, confirming the core goal set by President Obama in 2009. The overview paper highlighted successful components of the strategy and emphasized the ongoing challenge of achieving success. The APAR summary confirmed the core goal set by President Obama in 2009 for Afghanistan and Pakistan, highlighting successful components of the strategy and emphasizing the challenge of achieving durable and sustainable gains. The APAR was intended as a diagnostic assessment of progress, focusing on reviewing progress to date rather than proposing remedies. High-level discussions were used to assess the trajectory and pace of progress. The actual APAR results were not released, making it difficult to gauge the conclusions. The Obama Administration has suggested progress in the campaign, but the actual APAR results were not released, making it hard to determine the conclusions reached. Some observers note the lack of clarity on how much progress is considered sufficient. The Obama Administration has suggested progress in the campaign in Afghanistan and Pakistan, focusing on descriptions of lines of activity rather than specific endstates. A refined statement about the desired \"endstate\" in Afghanistan would include minimum conditions for sustainable stability and a timeframe for achieving them. Without a clear vision of success, it is challenging to assess progress towards sustainable stability and determine the necessary future efforts. President Karzai has emphasized the importance of addressing political, economic, and security conditions for genuine sustainability. President Karzai and the Obama Administration support an Afghan-led reconciliation process, emphasizing renouncing al Qaeda and violence, and accepting the Afghan Constitution. Some suggest accelerating reconciliation efforts for a minimally acceptable settlement in the near future to save resources and lives. Others argue that reconciliation should be part of the campaign but must address key issues for lasting success. Key issues for lasting success include addressing concerns of northern, non-Pashtun Afghans wary of Taliban influence, involving Afghan women in reconciliation discussions, and seeking active input from people across the country. The High Peace Council has taken initial steps towards engagement. The High Peace Council, established in September 2010, is engaging the population by visiting provinces. Genuine Afghan participation depends on community-level debate and input. The strength and resilience of the Afghan state, including the balance between centralization and decentralization, will determine its ability to absorb potentially dissonant factors. The 2010 Sub-National Governance Policy 302 aimed to devolve some authorities to the sub-national level for better state functioning. Some experts argue for a decentralized structure in Afghanistan to reflect its history. Power is wielded through criminal patronage networks, alienating many Afghan people and hindering stabilization efforts. Efforts to combat corruption have received support from various U.S. government agencies and international partners. Efforts to combat corruption in Afghanistan have involved various U.S. government agencies and international partners, including specialized Afghan bodies like the Anti-Corruption Unit and the Major Crime Task Force. Task Forces like Shafafiyat and Spot Light have been established to support anti-corruption efforts and improve international practices. The importance of fostering good governance and limiting corruption in the overall campaign has been emphasized by the Afghan and U.S. governments, but critical policy debates remain unresolved. The role of the international community in supporting Afghan anti-corruption efforts, especially in transitioned locations, remains unresolved. Questions arise regarding the footprint and activities of international forces, as well as the support from international civilian organizations. The international community's supporting role in Afghan transition, particularly in locations with limited ISAF presence, is crucial for ensuring irreversible progress. In provinces like Panjshir, where local security is well-established, deliberate transition decisions must be made amidst political pressure for visible progress. The plans for balancing resources between transitioning provinces and operational main efforts, including Kandahar and Helmand provinces in the south, are crucial for Afghanistan's stability. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) are key to a successful transition process, with a target endstrength of 305,600 by October 2011, potentially increasing to 378,000 by October 2012. Discussions are ongoing regarding troop numbers and fundamental questions. In October 2012, debates on troop numbers in Afghanistan overshadow more critical issues like the country's future security force requirements and sustainability. Congress should address these unresolved issues, including assessing future security challenges and the roles of different forces. Options for sustaining the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in the future involve Afghan government support, international assistance, and potential demobilization. Observers also highlight the need to consider Afghanistan's economic prospects and the government's ability to generate revenue and manage budgets. The Afghan Local Police (ALP) program is also a focus for ISAF and Administration officials. The Afghan Local Police (ALP) program, approved by President Karzai, creates organized local groups for community security under Ministry of Interior command. Officials aim to expand the program beyond 3,000 participants, drawing on Afghan tradition for self-defense. This initiative is seen as crucial in resisting insurgent encroachments in areas with limited reach by formal ANSF and coalition partners. The Afghan National Auxiliary Police, poorly supervised and disbanded, raised concerns about becoming armed proxies of local powerbrokers. Coalition forces struggle to oversee the program due to the high demand for U.S. Special Operations Forces. Future plans for the ALP include absorption into the formal ANSF or alternative training and employment opportunities. President Obama has committed to a responsible drawdown of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and supports transitioning security responsibility to Afghans by the end of 2014. Options for the Afghan Local Police (ALP) include competition for resources, maintaining current roles with oversight, disbanding formations, or providing alternative employment opportunities to prevent disaffection among participants. The criteria for the first tranche of U.S. troop drawdown in Afghanistan and the proposed decision point for the second tranche are key questions for Congress to explore. Experts differ on whether significant progress by July 2011 should lead to a redeployment of troops or a significant drawdown if conditions do not improve. The relationship of future drawdown decisions to the transition process and ISAF's role in transitioning locations is also a point of contention among experts. Experts have differing opinions on the role of unit partnering in the transition process in Afghanistan. U.S. and Afghan officials are committed to a long-term strategic partnership, with negotiations scheduled for 2011. Congress may need to consider the extent of U.S. security commitments and the legal basis for the presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 mandated the President to provide an economic strategy for Afghanistan, supporting counterinsurgency efforts and promoting economic stabilization. Crafting this strategy may raise concerns about mission creep but could also help define the role of the U.S. by highlighting areas suitable for private sector involvement. Congress may need to explore these issues further. The importance of a viable economic strategy for Afghanistan to the success of the campaign, balancing near-term needs with sustainable development, addressing the impact of development assistance on criminal patronage networks, increasing civilian agency commitment for government and development support, and the significance of Pakistani military action against insurgent safe havens in Pakistan for the success of the campaign in Afghanistan. President Obama emphasized the need for action against insurgent safe havens in Pakistan. ISAF Commander General Petraeus and ISAF Joint Command Commander Lieutenant General Rodriguez believe progress can still be made in Afghanistan even without Pakistan taking tougher action against Afghan militants. Encouraging Pakistan to undertake operations and build durability in the Afghan system is crucial. The uncertainty remains whether Pakistan will target Afghan Taliban strongholds on their soil. The extent of Pakistani reluctance to undertake military operations against Afghan Taliban in North Waziristan agency of FATA is unclear. The question arises whether durable stability in Afghanistan can be achieved while Afghan Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan. Progress in Afghan security forces and governance may offset slow progress against safe havens. NATO observers believe in this approach. The success of NATO in Afghanistan is seen as crucial for the Alliance's ability to conduct out-of-area missions and address 21st-century security challenges. Failure in Afghanistan could potentially lead to the end of the Alliance. It is important to consider what constitutes a \"NATO success\" in Afghanistan and how it differs from ensuring Afghanistan's own success. Defense practitioners and analysts will likely continue to assess these issues. Defense practitioners and analysts are likely to seek lessons from U.S. military prosecution in Afghanistan and Iraq for future force shaping. Congress may need to consider the capabilities required for complex contingency operations, the impact of contractors on force size, and the role of media reports in shaping perceptions. Media reports from the field, such as the documentary Restrepo, highlight the intense combat experiences of U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan. Experts note a growing civil-military divide in the U.S. and question the support available for returning servicemembers and their families. Afghanistan serves as a test case for inter-agency collaboration and the application of U.S. national power. The Afghanistan effort showcases challenges in inter-agency collaboration, with distinct agency cultures hindering cooperation. Congress should assess the civil-military distribution of labor and factors contributing to the effectiveness of multi-agency task forces like the Afghan Threat Finance Cell. Addressing the \"clash of cultures\" among agencies may be improved through shared training programs. The curr_chunk discusses the need for programs supporting shared training and educational experiences among U.S. government agencies and contractors in complex contingencies. It also highlights the importance of finding the right balance of roles and missions. Several CRS reports are referenced on topics such as the cost of war operations, Afghanistan narcotics, casualties, private security contractors, and defense logistical support contracts. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various issues related to Afghanistan and Pakistan, including governance, security, elections, foreign assistance, and the use of private security contractors by the Department of Defense in Afghanistan and Iraq. CRS Report R41484, Afghanistan: U.S. Rule of Law and Justice Sector Assistance, by Liana Sun Wyler and [author name scrubbed], is a report on U.S. assistance in Afghanistan's justice sector."
