    "content": "The Act titled \"Johnson-O'Malley Supplemental Indian Education Program Modernization Act\" aims to amend the Johnson-O'Malley Act of 1934 by adding a section for the modernization of the supplemental Indian education program. The Act aims to modernize the supplemental Indian education program by defining key terms like elementary school, eligible entity, eligible Indian student, and Indian tribe. The Act defines key terms such as Indian tribe, secondary school, Secretary, and Tribal College or University. The Secretary will establish a program in coordination with the Director of the Bureau of Indian Education for contracts and monitoring. An eligible entity can enter into contracts to provide educational benefits to eligible Indian students. The funds must be used for programs like remedial instruction, STEM courses, and school supplies to benefit the students. An eligible entity can enter into contracts to provide educational benefits to eligible Indian students. The funds must be used for curricular programs, dropout prevention activities, equipment for professional trade skills training, and college preparation programs. The amount received is based on the number of eligible Indian students. The Secretary determines the number of eligible Indian students of an eligible entity using data from the Bureau of the Census or the National Center for Education Statistics within 1 year of enactment of the section. After publishing a report, the Secretary will reconcile data with entities under a contract to determine the accurate number of eligible Indian students. The Secretary will use data from the fiscal year before the application year to determine the number of eligible Indian students for each eligible entity. For new contractors, the Secretary will use data from the first year of recognition as an eligible entity after fiscal year 2012. The eligible entity must use data from the school districts it serves for the first year of the contract period. An entity educating eligible Indian students in a public school with prior contracts will receive an amount equal to or greater than previous contracts for at least 2 years after the contract start date. The Secretary will recommend legislation to restore funding for contracts per Indian student to 1995 levels. Geographic coverage and participation of eligible entities will be maximized in contract agreements. The Secretary will also aim to increase participation of eligible entities to the fullest extent possible. The Secretary will consult with Indian tribes and school districts with eligible Indian students to determine interest in administering services under the Act. Preference may be given to tribal organizations, including Tribal Colleges or Universities, in entering into contracts to benefit more students and professionals. The Secretary will provide an annual assessment of the program established under subsection (b) in the Department of the Interior's budget request each fiscal year. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary for necessary funds to implement this section."
