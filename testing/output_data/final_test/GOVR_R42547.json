    "content": "Twenty-first century criminals increasingly rely on the Internet and advanced technologies for their criminal activities, as stated by Europol's Organized Crime Threat Assessment. The FBI considers high-tech crimes to be the most significant crimes in the United States, including identity theft, payment card fraud, and intellectual property theft. Policy makers are focused on equipping the federal government with the necessary tools to combat cybercrime while protecting privacy rights. Cyber criminals have evolved their practices to make crimes more profitable, victimizing individuals and organizations motivated by self interest and profit. The annual cost of cybercrime globally is estimated at $113 billion, with public health and national security consequences. U.S. officials face challenges in identifying perpetrators of cyber incidents, ranging from lone actors to criminal networks or nation states. The challenge of actor attribution is further compounded by the evolving nature of cyber threats. The challenge of actor attribution in cybercrime is complicated by the anonymity of the digital realm. Understanding the motivations behind cybercriminals, whether driven by greed, recognition, or ideological motives, is crucial in distinguishing between cybercrimes, cyber attacks, cyber espionage, and cyber warfare. Congress has long been concerned about cyber threats, with a focus on the federal government's role in ensuring cybersecurity. This report delves into cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber warfare, questioning the need for clear distinctions between these threats. It highlights issues with measuring and tracking cybercrime and suggests that a better understanding could help policymakers assess the adequacy of law enforcement resources. Various definitions of cybercrime exist, proposed by industry experts and scholars. Cybercrime definitions vary in specificity and breadth, with Symantec Corporation defining it as any crime committed using a computer or network. Key elements include where, why, and who is involved in malicious activities. Government definitions and the debate on a common definition are also discussed. The concept of cybercrime involves the physical and digital domains, with distinct boundaries between the two worlds. Despite the lack of clear borders in cyberspace, crimes like point-of-sale skimming connect the digital and physical realms through sophisticated fraud techniques. Cybercriminals use skimming devices to copy credit card information from card slots on readers or ATMs. The stolen data can be retrieved physically or transmitted over a network. Some cybercrimes require more technological expertise, like phishing and DDoS attacks, compared to \"point and click\" crimes like cyber stalking. These technologically advanced crimes are more rooted in the virtual world. Cybercrimes involve computers and advanced technologies in various roles, such as being victims, tools for committing crimes, or storing evidence. The virtual element distinguishes cybercrimes from traditional offenses, which could be considered real-world crimes without the virtual component. Location is crucial in understanding cybercrimes, as they are essentially digital versions of traditional crimes. Cybercrimes, which involve virtual or cyberspace elements, can be compared to traditional crimes like identity theft. Criminal intent and outcome are similar in both physical and cyber arenas. For example, stealing personally identifiable information can occur through different mechanisms but with the same goal of profit. In real-world cases, criminals steal wallets or mail containing personal information. In one instance, defendants were charged for stealing mail with credit debit cards and using them without authorization. In another case, men were sentenced for stealing credit and debit cards from mailboxes in affluent neighborhoods. In September 2013, two Romanian nationals were sentenced for participating in a multimillion-dollar scheme to remotely hack into U.S. merchants' computers and steal payment card data. They installed keystroke loggers on POS systems to capture credit card information from over 100,000 victims, selling it for profit. Law enforcement struggles to keep up with cybercrime developments. Law enforcement faces challenges in prosecuting cybercrimes due to outdated laws, with computer fraud not considered a predicate offense for racketeering. Organized criminals are increasingly using advanced technologies for their operations, including cybercrimes. The Obama Administration has acknowledged the need for updated laws to combat cybercrimes effectively. Organized crime involves traditional and cybercrimes. The Obama Administration suggests updating RICO provisions to include computer fraud as a predicate offense. Cyber criminal organizations have been targeted under civil RICO for offenses like wire fraud and bank fraud. In June 2014, the GameOver Zeus botnet was disrupted by an international law enforcement effort led by the FBI, targeting online banking information theft. Criminals use mules to move money out of the US and an administrator of GameOver Zeus was indicted for various charges. The cyber world allows for anonymity and easy business transactions, enabling criminals to target more victims. The growth of Internet users has also increased criminal activities online. Cybercrime has seen a significant increase, with frauds and schemes now being carried out remotely. Criminals and victims are often located in different physical locations, posing jurisdictional challenges for law enforcement. Defining cyberspace and setting boundaries for permissible behavior within it is crucial in combating cybercrime. The National Security Presidential Directive 54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 (NSPD-54/HSPD-23) defines cyberspace as the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors. The U.S. military and Department of Defense have adopted similar definitions of cyberspace. The definition of cyberspace, as outlined in NSPD-54/HSPD-23, is utilized by the U.S. military and Department of Defense. Cyberspace is a constructed world that can be modified, where criminal actors operate in both the physical world and cyberspace, impacting victims in both realms. Cybercrime involves malicious activities carried out in cyberspace, but criminals and victims exist in the physical world. Cybercrime involves malicious activities in cyberspace, with criminals motivated by profit, notoriety, or gratification. The distinction lies in the actor's intent, as some actions may appear similar but have different motivations. The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks can cause confusion in categorizing actions as cyber crime. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace discusses the challenge of attribution in cyber attacks, noting organized crime groups targeting the financial sector, state sponsors seeking data theft, and terrorist groups aiming to impact the US. The FBI categorizes cyber threats into organized crime groups focusing on cybercrime, state-sponsored espionage targeting intellectual property theft, and malicious activities like hacking and online predators. This classification may exclude lone actors but is discussed under the umbrella of cybercrime in government definitions. The FBI categorizes cyber threats into organized crime groups focusing on cybercrime and state-sponsored espionage targeting intellectual property theft. State-sponsored actors may have different motivations, such as gaining a competitive advantage or undermining a rival nation's security. The distinction between theft of trade secrets and state secrets is crucial for understanding cybercrime incidents. Terms like cyber attack and cyber war are often used loosely, blurring the motives of state actors. Terms like cyber espionage and cyber attack are sometimes interchanged, causing confusion in governing structures. Overuse of terms like cyber war may sensationalize cybercrimes that are threats to public security but not necessarily threats to a rival nation's security. Cybercrime poses significant threats to public and economic security, costing consumers billions annually and undermining confidence in the financial system. Criminal networks use cyber technologies for sophisticated frauds, defrauding individuals and businesses of billions of dollars. For example, Central European cybercrime networks alone have defrauded U.S. entities of about $1 billion in a year. In a cyber fraud scheme, individuals from various countries allegedly defrauded buyers on Internet marketplaces by posting non-existent high-value items. Victims were duped out of over $3 million. Another network of hackers from Estonia, Russia, and Moldova hacked RBS WorldPay, withdrawing $9.4 million using counterfeit payroll debit cards. In a cyber fraud scheme, hackers withdrew over $9.4 million from ATMs in multiple countries in under 12 hours. Cyber espionage involves unauthorized access to confidential information for intelligence or financial gains, posing threats to national security. Cyber espionage targeting trade secrets poses significant threats to the US, leading to financial burdens for companies. The use of technology for spying is not new, and cyber spying can escalate to criminal or even potentially an act of war. The hacking of computer systems used in the design of the U.S. military's Joint Strike Fighter raises concerns about potential military surveillance or disruption. The lack of clear attribution complicates categorizing the hacking as criminal activity or part of an economic espionage campaign. Officials from China deny responsibility for cyber attacks, stating that all forms of hacking are illegal in China. Incidents in Estonia, Georgia, and Iran have sparked discussions on cyber warfare. In 2007, Estonia experienced DDOS attacks, with some IP addresses traced to ethnic Russians within the country. The lack of a clear definition of cyber attacks and attribution to a nation state led some to view the Estonian attacks as more of a cyber riot than a war. The Estonian cyber attacks were seen as a cyber riot or cyber terrorism, with one conviction in court. This was followed by strategic cyber attacks in Georgia in 2008 during a Russian military incursion, leading to discussions on network warfare. Investigations revealed that the cyber attacks in Georgia in 2008 originated from Russian hacking forums, targeting Georgian Internet sites. The Stuxnet worm, discovered in Iran in 2010, raised concerns about cyber warfare capabilities of nation states due to its sophisticated nature. Stuxnet was designed as a cyber weapon to target specific systems, blurring the lines between cyber weaponry and other cyber threats like espionage or cybercrime. This complexity makes it challenging for investigators to attribute cyber incidents accurately. Activity in cyberspace can complicate attribution for investigators, distinguishing between cybercrime and other threats. Law enforcement faces challenges in tracing threats to their source, determining if the actor is a criminal, terrorist, or state actor posing a national security risk. For instance, the \"Nitro\" attacks in 2011 targeted companies in the chemical industry with malicious emails containing the PoisonIvy Trojan. The PoisonIvy Trojan allowed hackers access to company computers, enabling them to steal intellectual property for competitive advantage through industrial espionage. The attack was attributed to a computer system in China owned by an individual named Covert Grove. The FBI attributed the breach at Sony Pictures Entertainment to North Korea in December 2014. The attack involved destructive malware, theft of proprietary information, and rendered thousands of computers inoperable. The hack disrupted the company's business operations and led to debates about the true source of the breach. The FBI attributed the Sony Pictures Entertainment breach to North Korea in 2014, citing malware and infrastructure similarities to previous attacks. However, experts question the evidence linking North Korea to the breach, highlighting challenges in cyber attribution. The FBI and Department of Defense are enhancing efforts to attribute cyber threats to specific sources and motives. Through initiatives like the Next Generation Cyber Initiative, they aim to connect with critical infrastructure components and extract hackers' digital signatures to identify malicious actors in cyber incidents. This focus on attribution is crucial for addressing cyber threats effectively. The online collective \"Anonymous\" operates with personal anonymity and the free flow of information. It is a loosely formed organization that is difficult to categorize, with fluid membership and a focus on damage control and prevention rather than attribution. Anonymous is a loosely formed online collective with fluid membership and various motivations for participation. In 2008, they gained attention for their hacktivist actions against the Church of Scientology in response to attempts to suppress leaked content. In response to the Church of Scientology's attempts to suppress leaked content, Anonymous engaged in various forms of protest, including online activities like prank calling and hosting proprietary documents, as well as physical protests outside Scientology compounds. They also initiated DDoS attacks against companies like PayPal and Mastercard in support of Wikileaks. Anonymous hacked into HBGary's servers to expose sensitive information after the security firm planned to reveal the identities of Anonymous leaders to the FBI. Anonymous has been involved in various incidents of data exposure for political and social reasons. In 2011, they targeted online child pornography sites, taking down over 40 websites and exposing nearly 1,600 members. Some compare Anonymous to non-state insurgents using asymmetric warfare tactics. Their goals may differ from traditional insurgencies, with suggestions that they seek independence. Anonymous, a loosely connected organization, is debated to be online activists, hacker criminals, or cyber insurgents. The U.S. government has treated them as a criminal entity, indicting and arresting individuals associated with hacking incidents. In March 2012, individuals associated with Anonymous were indicted for hacking incidents, including the attack on Angel Soft's website using a 'low orbit ion cannon'. The Department of Justice also cited the hacking of Stratfor and theft of confidential information. In December 2013, 13 individuals pleaded guilty in federal court to charges related to their role in Anonymous's DDoS attack on PayPal after WikiLeaks released State Department cables. This led to \"Operation Avenge Assange,\" where Anonymous coordinated DDoS attacks against PayPal and other companies. The U.S. government lacks an official definition of cybercrime that distinguishes it from crimes in the physical world. Cybercrime is often described in terms of computer, Internet, or technology-related offenses by government officials, law enforcement, and policy makers. There is no overarching definition for cybercrime, and federal law enforcement agencies define it based on their jurisdiction. Various agencies like the FBI and Secret Service investigate cybercrimes, but there is no single lead investigative agency designated for combating cybercrime. The FBI, Secret Service, and other agencies investigate high-tech crimes, including cybercrimes like hacking, intellectual property violations, child exploitation, fraud, and healthcare scams. The FBI's Cyber Division handles these cases, often working with other divisions. The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is a partnership between the FBI and NW3C that addresses cybercrimes. The FBI and Secret Service, along with other agencies, investigate cybercrimes such as hacking, intellectual property violations, and fraud. The Secret Service focuses on protecting the nation's financial infrastructure and payment systems. They have established a Cyber Intelligence Unit and task forces to combat cyber-related crimes. The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime defines cybercrime as malicious activities falling into four categories: security breaches, fraud, child pornography, and copyright infringements. While the US is a signatory, it has not adopted the exact definition. DOJ prosecutes cases with a cyber component without explicitly defining cybercrime. Prosecutions often fall under the computer fraud statute. The Department of Justice prosecutes cybercrimes under various statutes, including the computer fraud statute and other related laws. While there is no clear definition of cybercrime, specific activities are prosecuted under different statutes such as fraud, identity theft, and copyright infringement. The need for a precise definition of cybercrime may vary depending on the purpose, with a focus on defining specific criminal activities rather than a broad umbrella term. The need for a clear definition of cybercrime is essential to combat the expanding range of cyber threats. While specific activities like identity theft are considered crimes regardless of whether they are committed in the real world or via cyber means, defining cybercrime separately can help in creating targeted policies. Definitional clarity is crucial for government agencies and businesses to design effective strategies in combating cyber threats. A clear definition of cybercrime is crucial for policymakers to understand the strategies needed to combat cyber threats effectively. Defining cybercrime separately from other cyber threats can aid in creating targeted policies and evaluating the impact of countermeasures. This information is essential for Congress to conduct oversight on agencies' efforts to combat cybercrime and make informed decisions on appropriations for combating cyber threats. The United States lacks a specific national strategy solely focused on combating cybercrime. Instead, broader strategies with cybercrime components are in place. Policymakers and Congress may question the need for a distinct cybercrime strategy versus incorporating it into wider cybersecurity or organized crime strategies. The conceptual framework of cybercrime influences the best approach to address modern cyber threats, whether as a national security or public security issue. A strategy focused on countering national security threats, including cyber threats, may be more appropriate for confronting cybercrime. Categorizing cybercrime activities under different security threats may be challenging due to the variety of crimes and actors involved. An \"all threats\" approach specific to the cyber domain, focusing on actor attribution, has been suggested as a starting point for addressing cybercrime. A strategy addressing cybercrime should focus on actor attribution and clearer rules for responding to attacks. Existing methods for responding to attacks differ based on the identity and motivation of the actor. Attribution in the cyber world can be challenging, as different actors may use similar techniques. The Appendix presents current U.S. strategies and international conventions. Policy makers evaluate the effectiveness of existing tools in enhancing actor attribution and countering cybercrime threats. The interplay between multiple strategies may provide a framework for effective crime fighting in the digital domain. Congressional oversight can highlight gaps in strategies and assess their compatibility. The threat of cybercrime is underestimated, with malicious actors in cyberspace identified as a top threat. However, comprehensive data on cybercrime incidents and their impact are lacking. The lack of exact numbers on the scope of cybercrime makes it challenging to assess the threats posed by cyber criminals. Issues like the expanding range of cybercrimes, the overlap with traditional crimes, and the lack of a clear definition hinder accurate measurement and tracking of cybercrime. Various estimates on the prevalence and costs of cybercrime exist, but they differ in the range of criminal activities and victim populations they consider. The Ponemon Institute's 2014 Cost of Cyber Crime Study is one such example. The Ponemon Institute's 2014 Cost of Cyber Crime Study estimates that the median cost of cybercrime to select organizations is $9.7 million annually, with a slight increase from the previous year. Results from the 2014 Global Economic Crime Survey show that 7% of U.S. organizations lost at least $1 million to cybercrime, while 19% lost $50,000-$1 million. The 2014 Cost of Cyber Crime Study by the Ponemon Institute estimated that organizations lost $9.7 million annually to cybercrime. 19% of U.S. organizations lost $50,000-$1 million. McAfee and the Center for Strategic and International Studies recognized the challenges in defining cybercrime and estimated that it accounts for about 0.8% of global GDP and 0.64% of the United States' GDP. The prevalence of data breaches is a significant issue in cybercrime. The Identity Theft Resource Center reported an increase in data breaches in 2014, with the highest number since 2005. Symantec observed malicious Internet activity globally, with the United States ranking as the top country for malicious botnets in 2013. The report on cybercrime prevalence and impact does not provide data on all forms of cybercrime in specific countries. Self-reporting of cybercrime may lead to an underestimation of the true breadth and impact of victimization. Some victims may not be aware that a crime has occurred, while others may be unwilling to report it. Financial organizations may also prefer not to disclose cybercrime losses. Companies and individuals may be hesitant to report data breaches due to fear of damaging their reputations and potential loss of support. Self-report surveys on cybercrime may lead to an overestimation of the threat, as individuals tend to only report positive losses, skewing the average errors towards an upward bias. The reliability of self-reported victimization data in cybercrime is affected by uneven reporting to different entities such as consumer protection agencies, credit bureaus, and law enforcement. This can distort overall estimates of victimization, leading researchers to suggest measuring the extent of the cybercrime problem as a ratio of consumer losses to reported incidents. One researcher emphasizes that the harm experienced by cybercrime victims is the true measure of the problem, rather than the profits gained by hackers. Surveys promoting cybercrime as easy money can mislead newcomers and cause more harm than profit. Policy makers may need to evaluate the threats posed by cybercriminals, including the costs to individuals and businesses. Defining cybercrime parameters is crucial for a comprehensive study to assess the breadth of the threat. Policy makers need to assess federal law enforcement's tools and resources to combat cybercrime threats. Congress examines cybercrime and federal resources in the context of cybersecurity. Understanding the true nature of cyber threats can help Congress ensure relevant resources are in place. The appendix presents current U.S. strategies and international conventions related to cyber threats. The Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, also known as the Five Strategic Initiatives, addresses cyber security as a whole and emphasizes the importance of organizing, training, and equipping in cyberspace. It acknowledges the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals' tools and techniques. The Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, known as the Five Strategic Initiatives, focuses on protecting DOD networks, partnering with other sectors, building relationships with allies, leveraging the cyber workforce, and combating cybercrime through the Defense Cyber Crime Center. The Obama Administration released the Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in July 2011, highlighting transnational organized crime as a national security concern. The strategy identifies 10 primary threat categories posed by transnational organized crime and outlines six key priority actions to counter these threats. The Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime, released by the Obama Administration in July 2011, addresses the threats posed by transnational organized crime. It emphasizes the importance of shared responsibility and outlines actions the United States can take to protect against these threats, including enhancing intelligence sharing, protecting the financial system, and disrupting drug trafficking. The strategy also highlights the significant role of cybercrime in enabling criminal networks and emphasizes the need for international cooperation and partnerships. The Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime, released by the Obama Administration in July 2011, emphasizes the importance of shared responsibility and outlines actions to protect against threats. It highlights the significant role of cybercrime in enabling criminal networks and the need for international cooperation. A key concern is the shortage of investigators with expertise to analyze digital evidence, hindering cybercrime investigations. Many threats identified in the strategy may overlap with cybercrime, such as intellectual property theft through illegal computer intrusions. Various crimes related to financial fraud and identity theft may also fall under threat categories outlined in the strategy. The Obama Administration's Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime highlights the role of cybercrime in criminal networks and the need for international cooperation. The International Strategy for Cyberspace focuses on U.S. engagement with partners to address cyber issues, including cybercrime, while emphasizing fundamental freedoms and privacy. The strategy to combat cybercrime emphasizes international cooperation, building norms of behavior, and protecting national networks. It outlines principles for nations to support, including the prosecution of cybercriminals and cooperation in criminal investigations. The strategy also includes policy priorities such as extending law enforcement collaboration and rule of law. The United States' strategy for combating cybercrime focuses on international cooperation, encouraging participation in cybercrime conventions, and directing legislation towards combating illegal activities. The National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace aims to enhance online security and privacy through an \"Identity Ecosystem.\" The Administration proposed an \"Identity Ecosystem\" to authenticate online identities and digital devices, enhancing security and supporting forensics for recovery and attribution. Encouraging vendors to adopt enhanced standards for user verification and data storage, the strategy aims to protect online information. The Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime, established in 2001, aims to combat crimes committed through the Internet and information networks. It is the first international treaty on cybercrime, with 47 countries as signatories and 31 having ratified it. Signatories must define criminal offenses for security breaches, fraud, child pornography, and copyright infringements. The Convention on Cybercrime requires signatories to establish procedures for detecting, investigating, and prosecuting computer crimes, including offenses related to security breaches, fraud, child pornography, and copyright infringements. There is a debate about the need for a global standard to address cybercrime, with some suggesting that harmonizing legislation could enhance international cooperation, while others have reservations about supporting a global standard. Some have reservations about a global standard for combating cybercrime, questioning the feasibility of global coordination and potential conflicts with national laws. The Global Internet Freedom Task Force aims to enhance global Internet freedom by monitoring human rights abuses and increasing Internet access in developing countries. Financial support is needed to increase Internet availability in the developing world. Creating mirror sites and tools to bypass country firewalls can help expand access. The International Strategy for Cyberspace and Global Internet Freedom initiatives differ from DOD doctrine, which focuses on cyberspace as a war-fighting domain. Sovereignty in cyberspace is a debated topic, with countries having the authority to regulate their portion of the Internet. Definitions of computer-based crime vary by domestic standards, and what one country sees as Internet freedom, another may view as cybercrime. National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace addresses these issues. The 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, issued by the Department of Homeland Security after 9/11, prioritizes five components for securing cyberspace: a national response system, threat reduction program, awareness and training program, securing governments' cyberspace, and international cooperation. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace focuses on improving U.S. response to cyber incidents, reducing damage, threats, and vulnerabilities from cyber attacks, including cybercrime, and preventing cyber attacks. It also emphasizes international cyberspace security cooperation."
