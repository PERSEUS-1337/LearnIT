In FY2001, $100.4 million was allocated for NTIA, with $11.4 million for salaries, $45.5 million for TOP grants, and $43.5 million for public telecommunications facilities. Both TOP grants and public facilities programs saw significant funding increases.

It also mentions the protection of the judiciary's budget from presidential alteration. The President must transmit the judiciary's proposed budget to Congress unchanged, a process in place since 1939. The Judiciary's total appropriation in FY2001 was $4.25 billion, divided into more than 10 accounts. Two accounts fund the Supreme Court, one for operational expenses and the other for building maintenance. Justices traditionally address budget needs before appropriations subcommittees, focusing on salaries and expenses. The Architect of the Capitol then requests funds for the Court's building and grounds. The Supreme Court receives a small portion of the Judiciary's overall funding, with only $45.1 million allocated in FY2001. The majority of the Judiciary's budget goes towards the lower federal courts, particularly the Salaries and Expenses account for the U.S. Courts of Appeals and District Courts, which covers various judicial salaries and expenses. The Judiciary's budget includes funding for lower courts, Defender Services, Fees of Jurors, U.S. Court of International Trade, Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, Federal Judicial Center, and U.S. Sentencing Commission. The budget request is reviewed by the Judicial Conference before being presented to Congress. The Judiciary's budget does not appropriate funds for special courts like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, U.S. Tax Court, and U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Construction of federal courthouses is also not funded within the Judiciary's budget. Funding for federal courthouse construction typically comes from the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations bill.

The Judiciary requested $20.7 million annually for additional security officers and $10.6 million annually for more deputy U.S. Marshals. The President authorized $1.25 million for protective window film installation. The President authorized the transfer of $19.7 million for heightened security in courthouses, including converting part-time court security officers to full-time and maintaining enhanced perimeter patrols. Additionally, $31.5 million was allocated for disaster recovery and security needs, with $10.0 million designated for enhancing security at the Supreme Court building. The President allocated $4.0 million for a supervisory deputy marshal to coordinate security in each judicial district and circuit. The funding transfers to the Judiciary were made under the Emergency Response Fund without additional congressional action. The second $20 billion allocation, including $31.5 million for the Judiciary, required congressional passage and was attached to the FY2002 Department of Defense appropriations bill. Congress approved significantly more funding for the Judiciary than proposed by the President. The Judiciary received significantly more funding than proposed by the President, including $30.0 million for security enhancements at the Supreme Court, $57.5 million for court security, $5.0 million for emergency communications equipment, and $2.9 million for other expenses. The Judiciary received $2.9 million for security enhancements at the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building in Washington, D.C. Congress approved a total FY2002 budget of $4.61 billion for the Judiciary, an 8.4% increase over FY2001 funding. This amount is $69.4 million less than the House-approved budget and $111.5 million more than the Senate-passed amount. For Other Judicial Services, Congress approved $3.59 billion for FY2002, a 7.1% increase over the previous year. The Judiciary had requested $3.74 billion, an 11.4% increase. The Defender Services account received $500.7 million, a 15.3% increase over FY2001 funding. The Judiciary had requested $521.5 million, a 20.1% increase. The Defender Services account funds federal public defender and community defender organizations, as well as panel attorneys appointed under the Criminal Justice Act. The Judiciary requested a $521.5 million budget, with $35.1 million sought for an increase in panel attorney pay to $113 an hour. This was in response to hourly rates of $75 in-court and $55 out-of-court, which were deemed insufficient to cover overhead costs. House-Senate conferees agreed on increasing panel attorney pay to $90 per hour for FY2002, effective by May 1, 2002.

This decision was made alongside a cost-of-living pay increase for Members of Congress and executive branch officials. The Judiciary requested a 3.4% pay increase for judges in January 2002, citing a decline in purchasing power. Unlike automatic adjustments for Members of Congress and executive branch officials, judicial pay increases require specific authorization from Congress.

The State Department, established in 1789, has a mission to advance and protect US interests worldwide. It represents over 50 US agencies in 180 countries, with a total FY2001 appropriation of $6.6 billion. The majority of its budget is allocated for Administration of Foreign Affairs, including salaries, diplomatic security, and overseas building maintenance. The Foreign Relations Authorization within P.L. 105-277 allowed for the consolidation of foreign policy agencies. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and the United States Information Agency (USIA) were abolished and merged into the Department of State in FY1999. International broadcasting functions were transferred to the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). The BBG includes various broadcasting entities with a FY2001 appropriation of $441.4 million. Security issues have been a top priority since the 1998 terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies, leading to increased funding for embassy security. In 1999, the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel reported on embassy security needs. Congress authorized $900 million annually for embassy security from FY2000 to FY2004. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, 50 embassies and consulates closed temporarily, with three embassies evacuated. The State Department recommended embassies stock up on antibiotics and may close facilities if local populations become dangerous.
