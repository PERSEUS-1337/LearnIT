    "content": "Four cotton-producing African countries - Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali - propose the complete elimination of trade-distorting domestic support and export subsidies for cotton in WTO negotiations. They suggest ending cotton export subsidies over three years and production-related domestic support over four years starting from January 1, 2005. A transitional financial compensation mechanism is also proposed for affected developing countries. Cotton subsidies are a crucial issue to resolve before DDA negotiations can be concluded, as cotton production is vital for West and Central African countries. Cotton production is vital for West and Central African countries, accounting for 5-10% of GDP in Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali. It also contributes to around 30% of total export earnings in the region. In the United States, cotton production plays a significant role in the agricultural economy, with 0.034% of GDP attributed to cotton production and 1.4% of total merchandise exports coming from cotton. The cotton sector in the United States employs over 173,000 people on farms and generates $40.1 billion in revenue, representing 3.8% of GDP. The US is the world's largest cotton exporter, with 2003 exports estimated at 2.9 million metric tons. West and Central African countries are low-cost producers of cotton, with Benin's production cost at 31 cents per pound in 2001. China is the largest cotton producer and importer globally. The economic rationale for the African cotton initiative is based on the analysis by ICAC, estimating annual losses of $9.5 billion for cotton producers in developing countries due to subsidies depressing world cotton prices. World cotton prices were at their lowest in 30 years at 42 cents per pound in 2000/2001, affecting revenues of the poorest African countries. Subsidizing countries shield their producers from price declines. The United States, China, EU countries, Turkey, Brazil, and Egypt provided subsidies to their cotton producers in 2001/02. ICAC simulated the impact of removing U.S. subsidies, showing lower production and higher prices in the short term. Removing subsidies led to a decrease in U.S. cotton production and an increase in international cotton prices. The removal of cotton subsidies in various countries led to higher international prices per pound of cotton, with increases of 6 cents in 1999/00, 12 cents in 2000/01, and 22 cents in 2001/02. Despite initial price increases being offset by shifting production to non-subsidizing countries, the removal of subsidies had a net positive effect on world cotton prices by 3 cents in 1999/2000, 6 cents in 2000/01, and 11 cents in 2001/02. Weak consumer demand and competition from synthetic fibers also contributed to the slow growth in world cotton consumption. The ICAC reported that fibers, technology, the strong U.S. dollar, and new cotton production areas contributed to the increase in world cotton supply in 2001. A World Bank report highlighted the impact of subsidies on cotton producers in the WCA region, estimating revenue gains of $250 million a year for WCA farmers. Oxfam also raised concerns about revenue losses to African farmers from U.S. cotton subsidies, with both organizations supporting the African cotton initiative. The U.S. played a significant role in supporting the African cotton initiative by proposing a comprehensive agreement to reduce subsidies and tariffs on farm products and eliminate barriers on manufactured goods. The U.S. Trade Representative identified various factors affecting the cotton industry, including competition from synthetic fibers, economic slowdown, and favorable weather conditions leading to higher yields. Barriers such as trade-distorting domestic support, high tariffs on cotton and textiles, and non-tariff barriers were also highlighted. The United States proposed a comprehensive initiative to address subsidies, tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and other obstacles in the cotton industry. The National Cotton Council of America supported linking WTO negotiations on cotton with textile trade negotiations. U.S. Senators from cotton-producing states opposed the African cotton initiative. A group of U.S. Senators from cotton-producing states expressed opposition to the African cotton initiative, stating that it could harm U.S. cotton interests and distract from multilateral agricultural trade reform. Adoption of the initiative could result in cotton producers no longer receiving payments under the 2002 farm bill programs linked to production. The 2002 farm bill's new counter-cyclical payments (CCP) program, linked to commodity prices, could be affected by the African cotton initiative. Cotton producers received $721 million in loan deficiency payments in FY2002, with estimated CCP payments for cotton in FY2003 totaling $1.247 billion. Direct payments in FY2003 are estimated at $428 million. Credit guarantees for cotton exports, around $234 million in FY2002, could also be impacted. The U.S. proposal to reduce cotton subsidies as part of trade-distorting domestic support could have significant consequences for cotton. The U.S. proposal aims to reduce trade-distorting domestic support for agricultural products, including cotton, and eliminate export subsidies. This could lead to changes in export credit guarantees for cotton and other products. Reducing U.S. cotton subsidies could benefit farmers in African and other low-cost cotton producers. Reducing U.S. cotton subsidies could have mixed economic effects. While U.S. consumers may benefit from lower prices for cotton products, taxpayers would no longer have to pay for support to cotton producers. However, cotton producers, industries related to cotton production, and rural communities could be negatively impacted. Workers in various sectors such as ginning, transportation, and marketing could also be affected. Those impacted may oppose subsidy elimination and demand adjustment assistance. The African cotton initiative remains on the WTO negotiating agenda. The African cotton initiative is a key issue in WTO negotiations, with African countries pushing for a separate approach to addressing cotton subsidies. The United States, however, wants to include cotton subsidies in broader negotiations. Brazil is challenging US cotton subsidies at the WTO, which could lead to changes in US subsidy programs or retaliatory tariffs. Interested Members of Congress will closely monitor the WTO agriculture negotiations, the African cotton initiative, and the WTO cotton dispute in 2004."
