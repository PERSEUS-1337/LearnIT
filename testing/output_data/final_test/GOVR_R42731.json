    "content": "The FY2013 budget deficit is projected to be $845 billion, or 5.3% of GDP. Despite a decline in deficits, current fiscal policies are unsustainable, with deficits expected to continue. Restoring fiscal balance will require spending cuts, revenue increases, or a combination of both. Policymakers are considering options for raising federal revenues, including a potential carbon tax. In the 113th Congress, Senators Sanders and Boxer introduced legislation for a carbon tax starting at $20 per ton of CO2 emissions, rising 5.6% annually. Representative Waxman and Senator Whitehouse also proposed a carbon tax requiring emitters to purchase \"carbon pollution permits\" from the Treasury Department, seeking feedback on tax levels and revenue usage. In the 113th Congress, Members proposed various carbon price systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some countries have had carbon taxes for over 20 years. However, some Members of Congress oppose a federal carbon tax due to concerns about negative economic impacts. Other policy considerations, such as environmental concerns, may also influence the discussion on implementing a carbon tax. The combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, has led to a 40% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels over the past 150 years. This increase in CO2 is contributing to current and future climate change. Many economists argue that fossil fuel prices do not reflect the true costs of greenhouse gas emissions, leading to market failures and inefficient consumer behavior. Energy consumers may make choices not in society's best interest by consuming more GHG emitting fuels if prices do not reflect climate change costs. Carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs are proposed to correct this market failure by placing a price on carbon emissions. The preference between the two approaches depends on controlling GHG emissions or costs. Placing an emissions fee on CO2 could stimulate lower emissions and innovation in new technologies. A carbon tax or fee approach could drive lower emissions and innovation in new technologies. Tax revenues could support various objectives like deficit reduction or replacing existing taxes. The report discusses carbon tax design, implementation, policy considerations, and key issues related to tax revenues. When establishing a carbon tax, key decisions include the point and rate of taxation. The point of taxation determines who pays based on emissions or inputs, but doesn't reveal who bears the cost. Greenhouse gas emissions come from various sources like smokestacks, vehicles, households, and livestock. When determining sources for a carbon tax, policymakers must balance comprehensiveness with administrative complexity and costs. CO2 emissions are easily verified from large stationary sources like power plants, while smaller sources can calculate emissions based on fossil fuel consumption. Other greenhouse gases like methane present challenges in measurement and control. When considering sources for a carbon tax, policymakers must balance comprehensiveness with administrative costs. While CO2 emissions from large stationary sources are easily verified, other greenhouse gases like methane may be more difficult to measure. Limiting the tax scope to sectors emitting large percentages of total U.S. GHG emissions or using reliable proxies in the production-to-emission chain could be options to consider. Alternatively, taxing potential emissions at specific chokepoints in the fossil fuel market could also be effective. A carbon tax could be applied at sources required to report GHG emissions to EPA, covering 85-90% of U.S. emissions. Fossil fuel combustion, including petroleum refineries, petroleum importers, and coal mines, accounts for almost 80% of total U.S. GHG emissions. Policymakers could apply a carbon tax at specific chokepoints in the fossil fuel market for effective regulation. A carbon tax could be applied at various points in the natural gas production-consumption chain, covering entities such as petroleum refineries, coal mines, and natural gas sector entities. This would include wellheads, points of import, and end-users to address CO2 emissions effectively. A carbon tax could be applied at different points in the natural gas production-consumption chain, including wellheads and natural gas processors, to address CO2 emissions effectively. This tax could cover nearly 100% of CO2 emissions from combustion and some CH4 emissions from natural gas systems. A carbon tax could be based on estimated revenues to reduce budget deficits or tied to climate change objectives, such as the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) representing the marginal cost of climate change. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is used to determine the rate of damages from emissions, including ocean acidification and other effects. Estimating the risks of greenhouse gas emissions is challenging due to uncertainties and the need to place monetary values on various goods and services. Time further complicates valuation, as it requires considering what society should pay now to prevent future damages. Precise estimation of emission-related risks for setting tax rates is difficult, leading to alternative approaches for addressing climate change. An alternative approach to addressing climate change involves basing the tax rate on estimates of the carbon price needed to meet specific GHG emissions targets. Estimates of carbon prices have varied dramatically, making it challenging to reach political agreement on the target emissions and tax rate. Some propose starting a carbon tax at a low rate, increasing annually for predictability and to hedge against carbon emissions risks. Different fossil fuels emit varying amounts of CO2, with coal emitting 80% more than natural gas and 28% more than crude oil. This leads to different tax rates based on emissions intensity. The differences in emissions intensity between fossil fuels would result in varying tax rates in a carbon tax regime. Consumers may see price changes due to carbon taxes affecting fuel prices in complex ways, leading to shifts in preferences towards cheaper fuels. The actual price increases from carbon taxes depend on how they are applied and whether consumers modify their behavior. Producers, midstream entities, and consumers may change behavior in response to a carbon tax, aimed at reducing GHG emissions. The tax raises prices on emission-generating products, encouraging suppliers to reduce emissions and consumers to buy less. Policymakers consider carbon taxes for various benefits like increased revenues, reduced deficits, and improved economic efficiency. A carbon tax is a policy instrument that sets a cost per unit of emissions to reduce GHGs. It relies on market efficiencies to maximize cost-effectiveness and may apply to various GHGs, not just CO2. The tax aims to make producers and consumers reduce emissions and buy less, potentially raising revenues. The report focuses on a generic carbon tax option's potential to raise revenues and reduce the federal budget deficit. It evaluates the tax based on criteria such as adequacy, economic efficiency, equity, operability, and political feasibility. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) evaluated a hypothetical cap-and-trade program in 2011, estimating auction revenues generated from CO2 emission allowances. The allowance price was projected to start at $20 per metric ton of CO2 in 2012, increasing annually by 5.6%. The CBO estimated that a carbon tax regime could raise $1.2 trillion over the 2012 to 2021 budget window. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress proposed a carbon tax on various fuels and materials. The proposed carbon tax would start at $10 per ton of CO2 emissions, increasing annually until U.S. emissions are reduced to 20% of 1990 levels. It aims to reduce the federal deficit by $480 billion over 10 years. Previous proposals have estimated significant revenue generation from carbon taxes, with one suggesting a tax of $23 per ton starting in 2018 could raise $1.1 trillion by 2025. The RFF study found that electricity demand and natural gas prices significantly impact carbon tax revenue, with the influence increasing as the tax rate rises. Variations in assumptions regarding future electricity demand and fuel prices led to different estimates of potential revenue, with a $25/mtCO2 tax rate in 2020 showing a $10 billion revenue difference across scenarios. A $40/mtCO2 tax rate could generate a revenue range of almost $20 billion in 2020. Figure 3 illustrates these findings. The study concluded that a $40/mtCO2 tax rate could generate almost $20 billion in revenue by 2020. However, there is a concern about the declining tax revenues in the electricity sector after 2030 due to a shift towards low-carbon energy sources. This raises questions about the reliability of carbon tax revenue over time. Researchers debate the balance between reducing carbon emissions and maintaining a steady revenue stream. The imposed taxes may lead to minimal changes in market behavior. Researchers discuss how producers and consumers might respond to a tax on GHG emissions by reducing emissions or switching to lower-emission goods and services. A carbon tax could enhance economic efficiency by internalizing the costs of emitting GHGs into market prices, leading to a more optimal mix of goods and services. A tax on activities producing pollutants like GHG emissions can lead to more economically efficient outcomes. It could be more effective than a tax discouraging beneficial activities. Implementing a smaller tax on new activities, such as potential carbon emissions, may be less disruptive to production and consumption. However, setting an optimal carbon tax rate is challenging and could result in efficiency costs. A stand-alone carbon tax without offsetting other taxes may increase distortions in the production process. The implementation of an efficiency-enhancing carbon tax is challenging due to existing distortionary taxes in the system. Taxes are considered distortionary as they alter free market decisions by changing relative prices of goods and services. Governments prefer to tax products with inelastic demand to minimize distortions and generate revenue. Some taxes, like income and payroll taxes, are argued to be distortionary as they discourage beneficial activities. Many economists argue that high tax rates are distortionary, discouraging employment and investment. Lowering taxes on a broader base can minimize inefficiencies, such as pollution. Consumers are more sensitive to higher tax rates, leading to greater efficiency losses. Economists argue that not paying for the full cost of pollution, like GHG emissions, is a market failure. Levying a charge on GHG emissions through a pollution discharge fee could internalize external costs into market prices, increasing market efficiency by discouraging harmful activities. A carbon tax would discourage pollution that imposes costs on others who do not benefit from the activity, such as future generations and developing countries. It would encourage energy consumers to switch to cleaner fuels, use energy more efficiently, and prefer lower-priced products with less emission tax. Setting the tax at the right level is crucial for improving economic efficiency. Setting the right carbon tax rate is crucial for improving economic efficiency by equilibrating the tax rate to the harm of GHG emissions. Estimating the effects and placing a monetary value on them is controversial and reliable only over a wide range, making consensus on the \"right\" rate unlikely to emerge. The equity or fairness of taxes can be evaluated by looking at how different parties are affected, known as the economic incidence of the tax. The economic incidence of a tax is how it is divided among different parties. Economists evaluate equity in tax policy through vertical and horizontal equity, as well as individual and generational equity. The trade-off between economic efficiency and equity is also considered. Vertical equity suggests that those with greater ability to pay should contribute more. Carbon taxes can be regressive, impacting lower-income households more due to a higher percentage of income spent on energy-related goods. This regressivity can affect the political feasibility of the tax instrument. The political feasibility of carbon taxes can be influenced by factors such as the coalition of advocates for low-income people and opponents of energy taxes. Design elements like using carbon tax revenues to reduce other taxes or redistribute to lower-income households can reduce regressivity. Horizontal equity examines if tax treatment is equivalent for taxpayers with similar characteristics. Some argue that taxes should be based on the benefit an individual receives from the taxed activity to avoid violating individual equity. A carbon tax can be seen as a form of \"benefit taxation\" on the benefit the carbon source receives from polluting the atmosphere. The distribution of taxation burdens and benefits from government spending across generations is also a concern. Taxation and benefits from governmental spending across generations are a concern, especially in relation to the federal deficit and GHG-induced climate change. A carbon tax could potentially promote generational equity by addressing climate change and reducing the deficit. However, the impact on current and future generations' wealth and productivity is complex. Some argue that investing in technology may be more beneficial for future generations than implementing a carbon pricing mechanism. Increased investments today could lead to higher consumption levels with minimal benefits for future generations. Increased investments today may result in increased consumption, providing minimal benefits for future generations and foregoing the opportunity to address climate change impacts. Some tax options may present logistical challenges, especially when implementing a carbon tax. Proponents of carbon taxes argue that they are administratively simpler compared to other emissions control alternatives. The relative advantage of a carbon tax depends on the design of the instrument alternatives under scrutiny. Any new tax would require new administrative systems. A carbon tax system could leverage existing administrative structures in the United States, with the EPA already collecting emissions data for about 90% of GHG emissions. However, coordination across agencies would be needed for effective implementation. Policymakers should consider how a carbon tax aligns with other objectives like pollution control and national security. A carbon tax may conflict with efforts to make fossil fuels more affordable and could disadvantage a U.S. GHG reduction scheme compared to cap-and-trade approaches. There are concerns about potential adverse effects on business activity and revenue, leading some countries to exempt energy-intensive sectors from carbon taxes. Emissions \"leakage\" could occur if businesses relocate operations. A carbon tax could lead to emissions \"leakage\" if businesses move operations overseas to avoid the tax. The outcome depends on factors like fuel mixes, power production efficiencies, and border taxes. Transparent tax policies are seen as fair, as taxes paid are understood by those responsible. Some prefer carbon taxes over cap-and-trade due to the complexity and opaqueness of the latter. Congress could design a simple or complex carbon tax framework, including subsidies or exemptions for the fossil fuel industry or certain consumers. Policymakers could provide subsidies or exemptions to the fossil fuel industry or certain consumers, enact incentives for fossil fuel production, and allow tax credits for carbon sequestration projects. Transparency could be a political liability for a carbon tax, and stakeholders may oppose it due to higher energy costs. The costs of a cap-and-trade program would be harder to estimate as the market determines emission allowance prices. Opposition to a carbon tax comes from energy-intensive manufacturers, farmers, and regional energy interests, especially those with assets tied to coal and oil. The impact on profitability and deficit reduction depends on the tax's magnitude, market factors, and assumptions about the deficit. CBO projected a $6.8 trillion deficit under current law, but $9.1 trillion under an alternative scenario. Enacting carbon tax options could affect these projections. Enacting a $20/mtCO2 carbon tax could significantly reduce future budget deficits, with potential reductions of 17% or 13% depending on the scenario. This assumes that all carbon tax revenue would be used for deficit reduction. Carbon tax revenues can be used for various policy goals, but using it for deficit reduction means sacrificing other objectives. Policymakers face trade-offs in allocating these revenues, such as minimizing economy-wide costs, alleviating costs for different groups, and supporting specific policy goals like climate change mitigation or energy efficiency. Discussing all possible uses and trade-offs is beyond the report's scope. Three possible options for carbon tax revenues are discussed, including returning them to households to alleviate financial burden. A 2007 study found that households and businesses would bear the majority of costs under a carbon pricing regime, with businesses likely passing on some costs to consumers through higher prices. Unpassed costs could impact labor wages or owners. A carbon tax could impact consumers through higher prices, affecting labor wages or capital returns. Lower-income households may bear a disproportionate tax burden, with a regressive outcome. Redistribution of carbon tax revenues could mitigate this impact, with different rebate mechanisms showing varying effects on household incomes. A lump-sum rebate of carbon tax revenues can be progressive, benefiting lower-income households more than higher-income brackets. A payroll tax rebate could reduce regressivity, but those without individuals in the workforce would not benefit. Including Social Security recipients in the rebate would enhance progressivity. Both types of rebates increase after-tax income for lower-income households and decrease it for higher-income households. Using carbon tax revenues to reduce payroll taxes benefits middle-income households. Using carbon tax revenues to finance lump-sum rebates to households can increase after-tax income for middle-income households, with lower-income households seeing a decrease. This policy is most beneficial for the lowest-income households. Alternatively, offsetting other distortionary taxes with carbon tax revenues can reduce or eliminate the costs associated with a carbon tax. Distribution studies of a carbon tax rely on modeling assumptions, such as energy expenditure patterns across income groups. The distribution of a carbon tax can be less regressive if it impacts owners of capital more than labor. Higher income households, who derive more income from capital, are affected more. Lower income households, relying on transfer payments, are less affected. Different policy choices for carbon tax revenues show that lump-sum redistribution is more progressive. Lump-sum redistribution of carbon tax revenues is more progressive, while reducing payroll taxes is less regressive than reducing income or capital taxes. Concerns about economy-wide costs of a carbon tax include potential GDP reduction due to increased energy costs. Economic effects depend on factors like tax magnitude and design. Studies suggest using carbon tax revenues to offset other taxes can mitigate economic impacts. Using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in distortionary taxes is the most economically efficient use of the revenues, yielding the greatest benefit to the economy overall. This strategy, known as revenue recycling, may result in a \"double-dividend\" of reduced greenhouse gas emissions and lower market distortions. Studies suggest that this approach can reduce economy-wide costs. The economic literature generally finds that revenue recycling from a carbon tax may reduce economy-wide costs, but not eliminate them entirely. Some studies suggest that in certain scenarios, a carbon tax and revenue recycling could increase Gross Domestic Product. However, the potential benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions are often not included in these calculations due to uncertainty. For example, one study projected a decrease in GDP and employment when carbon tax revenues were used for deficit reduction, lump-sum transfers, or reducing payroll taxes. Using carbon tax revenues to reduce tax rates on capital income can increase employment and GDP, but may not fully offset the burden on low-income households. Carbon-intensive industries would be disproportionately affected in a U.S. carbon tax system, as seen in the debate over H.R. 2454 in 2009. Industry carbon intensity is determined by both direct and indirect CO2 emissions. Carbon tax would pose a challenge for trade-exposed industries due to international competition. Policymakers could distribute a portion of the tax revenues to these industries, as seen in H.R. 2454 where they would have received 15% of the emission allowance value through 2025. Some questioned if the allotted resources were enough for the program. Policymakers could consider a border adjustment mechanism to supplement a carbon tax scheme, as proposed in H.R. 2454. This mechanism would require importers of energy-intensive products from countries with insufficient carbon policies to submit \"international reserve allowances\" for entry into the United States, posing administrative challenges and trade concerns. A carbon tax is proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and generate revenue for various policy objectives, including deficit reduction. Revenue projections are uncertain due to market factors, but a $20/mtCO2 tax could generate around $90 billion in the first year. The tax could impact budget deficits, but the extent varies depending on the tax scope and rate. A carbon tax could impact budget deficits, with varying effects depending on the baseline assumed. Policymakers may face pressure from stakeholders for a share of tax revenues, with households bearing a significant burden. Lower-income households would be disproportionately affected without revenue recycling. Specific industries may also face unequal impacts. Using tax revenues to offset burdens may limit support for other objectives like deficit reduction. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion account for almost 79% of total U.S. GHG emissions. The table lists potential points in the economy for a carbon tax, with varying numbers of entities involved. For example, the 500 largest natural gas producers accounted for 94% of total U.S. production in 2007. The table estimates the percentage of total U.S. GHG emissions subject to a carbon price with different tax applications, including natural gas wells. This could cover CO2 emissions from natural gas combustion and non-combustion related emissions like CH4. Two carbon tax bills were introduced in the 112th Congress, aiming to establish a carbon tax on domestic and imported goods. In the 111th Congress, several market-based proposals were introduced to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon tax, cap-and-trade, and hybrid approaches. These bills aimed to generate revenue for deficit reduction and provide dividends to individuals. Several bills in the 111th Congress proposed distribution formulas for carbon tax revenue or emission allowance value. Only three bills explicitly allocated funds for deficit reduction: H.R. 2454 (Waxman-Markey), S. 1733 (Kerry-Boxer), and S. 2877 (Cantwell). Kerry-Lieberman draft legislation also included a percentage of emission allowance value for deficit reduction."
