    "content": "Hospitals offer outpatient health care services in various settings, including outpatient departments, clinics, and ambulatory surgery centers. These facilities may be on or off the hospital campus. Different health care professionals treat patients, and how services are categorized and reimbursed varies by payor. Medicaid covers outpatient hospital services as a mandatory benefit for most beneficiaries, with expenditures totaling $11.5 billion in FY2006. States use various reimbursement methods for outpatient hospital services, including flat per-visit rates, fee schedules for surgery, and cost-based payments for specialized services. In 2002, half of the states based their reimbursement on hospital-specific costs, while 11 states used Medicare groupings for some services in 2006. Medicaid payments for institutional services like hospitals are subject to certain limitations. The Medicaid upper payment limit (UPL) rule sets a cap on how much hospitals and nursing homes can be reimbursed for services, based on what Medicare would pay. This rule applies to inpatient and outpatient facility care, but not professional services. Hospitals receive payments for outpatient services through Medicare's outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS), which covers facility costs for procedures performed in outpatient departments. The outpatient services provided by hospitals are paid under different methods than those covered by the Medicare outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS). Off-campus outpatient facilities meeting provider-based requirements are considered part of a hospital and paid under alternative methods, impacting Medicare and Medicaid payment amounts and beneficiary benefits. The proposed rule aims to limit the definition and scope of these payment methods. The proposed rule aims to limit the definition and scope of Medicaid outpatient services in hospital clinics, facilities, or rural health clinics. Federally reimbursable services would be restricted to those recognized by Medicare, provided by outpatient hospital facilities meeting specific standards, and not covered under other Medicaid benefit categories. The UPL for privately operated outpatient hospital facilities would be tied to Medicare payment estimates. The UPL calculation for services under the new Medicaid outpatient services definition would be based on hospital-specific ratios from Medicare cost reports. Privately operated clinics not part of a hospital would have two UPL calculation methods: a defined percentage of Medicare payments or a comparison of Medicare payment amounts for equivalent Medicaid services. The UPL calculation for Medicaid outpatient services is based on specific fee schedules or encounter rates. Excluded services defined by Medicaid statute must be excluded from the clinic UPL calculation. CMS believes this rule won't significantly change current practices in most states. The reimbursement methods used by 32 states over four years were analyzed, with only one state minimally affected by the rule. The rule was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid outlays by $0.3 billion over 5 years and $0.7 billion over 10 years. A 2008 report projected a $2.1 billion loss in four states over five years due to the rule. CMS argues that the current definition of outpatient hospital services in regulations overlaps with other covered Medicaid benefits, leading to higher payments for identical services. CMS finds the current definition of outpatient hospital services to be overly broad, encompassing services outside the normal responsibility of outpatient hospital departments. Some states may need to reclassify services under new definitions. CMS also noted the need for clarification on calculating Medicare comparable UPLs for outpatient and clinic services in private facilities. The CMS does not provide guidance on how to estimate Medicare comparable UPLs for services like dental care. Some states use their own hospital cost reports, which may not accurately reflect Medicare payment ratios. CMS considers Medicare cost reports as a more accurate measure. Comments on the proposed rule include concerns about DSH allotments and supplemental payments to providers treating low-income patients. Opponents argue that the proposed rule's new definition of OPH services could limit DSH payments to hospitals, impacting Medicaid children and children's hospitals. The regulation excludes federal matching dollars for OPH programs, contradicting the Medicaid EPSDT provision. The Medicaid EPSDT provision is being challenged by opponents of the rule, who argue that excluding federal matching dollars for OPH programs providing required diagnostic and treatment services may impact Medicaid children and children's hospitals. Concerns are raised about the use of Medicare's cost-to-charge ratios in calculating the UPL for private providers, as it may not accurately account for hospitals with different patient mixes. Children's hospitals and hospitals with nontraditional charge structures may struggle to comply with the new UPL requirements. The new UPL requirements may limit beneficiary access to certain services previously offered under OPH benefits in some states. Concerns were also raised about the exclusion of certain services like physical therapy for outpatients from the new definition of OPH services for Medicaid. Compliance with the UPL for private facilities and the availability of optional PT benefits under Medicaid were also highlighted as issues of concern. The comment letter raised concerns about the confusion regarding compliance with the UPL for OPH services and potential violations of the one-year moratorium on certain rules. The proposed OPH services rule incorporates new definitions from previous rules, leading to uncertainty among commenters. The final rule on cost limits for public providers is criticized for contravening the moratorium on implementing public provider rules. Commenters also argue that the OPH services rule violates the moratorium on the GME rule due to UPL calculations excluding GME costs. Procedural concerns include objections to the rule's administrative impact on state Medicaid programs and hospital revenues. Commenters dispute CMS's decision that no regulatory impact analysis was needed, citing lack of notification and data for affected parties. Certain commenters raised technical objections to the proposed UPL methodologies, including concerns about the exclusion of beneficiary co-payment and coinsurance amounts. The statement by CMS regarding the cost-to-charge ratio and its impact on hospital outpatient services was deemed inaccurate. The comment period of 30 days, instead of 60, also hindered informed comments from interested parties. The proposed rule for hospital outpatient services under Medicare OPPS was criticized for allowing efficient hospitals to retain APC-based payments above service costs. Concerns were raised about the impact on critical access hospitals and the methodology for establishing UPL for freestanding clinic services. The final rule, issued on November 7, 2008, made significant changes in response to feedback. CMS excluded proposed regulatory language on Medicaid upper payment limits for outpatient hospital and clinic services in privately operated facilities due to a moratorium. 12 states have submitted pending amendments to comply with the new regulation. Legislation to delay implementation of the rule was introduced in the 110th Congress. The spending bill passed by the Senate included a moratorium on administrative actions regarding the OPH services rule until April 1, 2009. However, subsequent legislation excluded this moratorium. P.L. 110-252 was enacted on June 30, 2008, and further legislation also established a moratorium on the OPH services rule. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 prohibited the Secretary of Health and Human Services from taking any action until after June 30, 2009. The moratorium on implementing the final regulation for outpatient hospital facility services was extended until after June 30, 2009. This, along with other Medicaid rules, would increase federal spending by $105 million in FY2009. On May 6, 2009, CMS issued a proposed rule. CMS issued a proposed rule on May 6, 2009 (74 Federal Register 21292) to rescind the Medicaid outpatient services rule entirely. The rule would reinstate the previous definition of outpatient hospital services and remove provisions related to Medicare's OPPS, hospital outpatient services, and Medicaid service categories. Additionally, the rule would eliminate requirements for Medicaid's definition of outpatient services and withdraw provisions on the calculation of the UPL for outpatient hospital and clinic services. The proposed rule by CMS aims to rescind the Medicaid outpatient services rule entirely, reinstating the previous definition of outpatient hospital services and removing provisions related to Medicare's OPPS and Medicaid service categories. Public comments on this proposed rule will be accepted until June 1, 2009."
