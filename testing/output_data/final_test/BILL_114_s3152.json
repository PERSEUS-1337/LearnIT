    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act\" and addresses the treatment of qualified equity grants. The \"Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act\" amends Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow qualified employees to defer income on qualified stock transfers. No income is included in the first taxable year when the rights of the employee in the stock are transferable or not subject to forfeiture. Qualified stock transfers under the \"Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act\" are included in the employee's income in the taxable year that includes the earliest of the stock being sold, the employee becoming excluded, the stock becoming tradable on the market, or 7 years after the stock rights become transferable. Qualified stock refers to stock provided by a corporation in connection with employee services, received in the year the corporation was eligible. The term 'qualified stock' excludes stock that can be sold for cash or received in lieu of stock from the corporation when employee rights are transferable or not at risk of forfeiture. An 'eligible corporation' is defined as a corporation eligible for such stock. The term 'corporation' is defined as a corporation where no stock is tradable on the market and at least 80% of employees have equal rights to receive qualified stock. Employees have rights and privileges with respect to stock determined similarly to section 423(b)(5). Employees are not disadvantaged in receiving qualified stock if the number of shares available to all employees is not equal, as long as each employee receives more than a de minimis amount. Employees have rights and privileges regarding qualified stock, with certain exclusions for specific employees. For calendar years before 2017, special rules apply to the distribution of qualified stock among employees. The term 'qualified employee' refers to individuals who are not excluded employees and agree to meet requirements set by the Secretary to ensure withholding requirements are met for qualified stock under chapter 24. Excluded employees are individuals excluded from this definition within a corporation. An \"employee\" in a corporation includes individuals who are 1-percent owners, former or current chief executive officers, chief financial officers, or individuals related to them as per section 318(a)(1). The election for qualified stock must be made within 30 days after the employee's rights in the stock become transferable or no longer subject to forfeiture, as per the shareholder disclosure rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The election for qualified stock must be made within 30 days after the employee's rights in the stock become transferable or no longer subject to forfeiture. Limitations apply if the qualified employee has made a previous election or if the stock is readily tradable on an established securities market. Controlled groups of corporations are treated as one entity for this purpose. Any corporation transferring qualified stock to an employee must notify the employee that they can defer income on the stock. The amount of income recognized at the end of the deferral period will be based on the stock's value when the employee's rights in the stock become transferable or are no longer subject to forfeiture. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified stock for which an election is made under section 83(i) as wages. The qualified stock will be treated as wages received on the earliest date described in section 83(i)(1)(B) and in an amount equal to the income included under section 83 for the taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified stock for which an election is made under section 83(i) as wages. The qualified stock will be treated as wages received on the earliest date described in section 83(i)(1)(B) and in an amount equal to the income included under section 83 for the taxable year. Additionally, the rate of tax for certain stock under section 83(i) shall not be less than the maximum rate of tax in effect under section 1. Coordination with other deferred compensation rules includes the election to apply deferral to statutory options. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified stock for which an election is made under section 83(i) as wages. This qualified stock will not be treated as nonqualified deferred compensation solely because of an election under 83(i). The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified stock as wages under section 83(i). Employers failing to provide notice of tax consequences under section 83(i)(5)(B) may face a penalty of $100 per failure. The amendments made by this section impose a penalty of $100 for each failure to provide notice of tax consequences, not exceeding $50,000 in a calendar year. The amendments apply to properties with non-transferable rights and substantial risk of forfeiture before January 1, 2017, with notice requirements effective after December 31, 2016."
