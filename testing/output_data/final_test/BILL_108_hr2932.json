    "content": "The \"Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2003\" includes sections on the short title, findings, and purpose. It also addresses the safety and use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in agriculture. The Congress recognizes the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, which could limit treatment options for common infections and hinder the response to terrorist attacks involving bacterial infections or a large influx of patients. The Congress acknowledges the public health threat of antibiotic resistance due to overuse in human medicine and agriculture. Steps have been taken to curb antibiotic overuse in human medicine, but not in agriculture. The National Academy of Sciences reported in March 2003 that reducing antimicrobial use in human medicine alone will have little impact on the current situation. The nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in agricultural animals contributes to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in people. Over 70% of antibiotics used in the US are fed to farm animals for nontherapeutic purposes, such as growth promotion and to compensate for poor farming conditions. Unlike human use, animal use of antibiotics typically does not require a prescription. The report from \"Clinical Infectious Diseases\" in June 2002 recommended limiting antimicrobial use in agriculture to therapy for diseased animals and prophylaxis in herds or flocks. A US Geological Survey in March 2002 found antibiotics in 48% of tested streams. Almost half of tested streams downstream from agricultural operations contained antibiotics. A study linked resistant strains of Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli to antibiotic use in animals. Consumer Reports found high levels of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in poultry products. Further studies showed similar results in other meat products. The New England Journal of Medicine urged a ban on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in October 2001. In 1999, the European Union banned feeding medically important antibiotics to animals for nontherapeutic use. This led to a decline in resistant bacteria levels without impacting animal health, productivity, food safety, or meat prices. The National Academy of Sciences estimated that antibiotic-resistant bacteria cost the US $4-5 billion annually in 1998. The National Academy of Sciences estimated that eliminating antibiotics as feed additives would cost each American consumer less than $5 to $10 per year. Various organizations support legislation to phase out nontherapeutic antibiotic use in farm animals. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires drugs to be proven safe before approval. The FDA has modified the drug approval process for antibiotics to consider resistant bacteria as a safety concern. However, many antibiotics used in animal production were approved before this consideration, and the FDA has not set a schedule to review these approvals. Certain non-routine antibiotic uses in animal agriculture are deemed necessary to prevent disease. The Act aims to preserve medically important antibiotics by phasing out their nontherapeutic use in food-producing animals. It also focuses on ensuring the safety of critical antimicrobial animal drugs. The term 'critical antimicrobial animal drug' is defined as a drug intended for use in food-producing animals composed of specific types of antibiotics or drugs used in humans to treat or prevent disease caused by microorganisms. The term 'critical antimicrobial animal drug' refers to a drug used in food-producing animals containing specific antibiotics or drugs used in humans to treat or prevent disease caused by microorganisms. Applications for such drugs must meet certain criteria, including the absence of clinical signs of disease in the animal for purposes like growth promotion or routine disease prevention. The text chunk discusses the phased elimination of nontherapeutic use in animals of critical antimicrobial animal drugs important for human health, with a focus on demonstrating no harm to human health due to antimicrobial resistance. The subsection applies to nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in food-producing animals, requiring withdrawal of approval after 2 years unless certain conditions are met. The subsection applies to nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in food-producing animals, requiring withdrawal of approval after 2 years unless specific conditions are met, ensuring no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance. The subsection mandates the withdrawal of approval for nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in food-producing animals after 2 years, unless specific conditions are met to prevent harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance. The application for a critical antimicrobial animal drug must be submitted to the Secretary under section 505(b). Approval of nontherapeutic use in food-producing animals of the drug will be rescinded 2 years after the application submission, unless specific conditions are met to prevent harm from antimicrobial resistance. The application for a critical antimicrobial animal drug must be submitted to the Secretary under section 505(b). Approval of nontherapeutic use in food-producing animals of the drug will be rescinded 2 years after the application submission, unless specific conditions are met to prevent harm from antimicrobial resistance. The Secretary must make a final determination that there is no harm to human health due to the development of antimicrobial resistance from the drug's use. SEC. 201. Collection of data on critical antimicrobial animal drugs is added to Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Manufacturers of critical antimicrobial animal drugs or animal feed containing such drugs must submit a report to the Secretary by July 1 each year. The report should detail sales from the previous year, including quantities sold for each type of food-producing animal and the claimed purpose of use. Manufacturers of critical antimicrobial animal drugs or animal feed must submit a report to the Secretary annually, detailing sales from the previous year, including quantities sold for each type of food-producing animal and the purpose of use. The Secretary will make this information available to the public while protecting confidentiality. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will take effect on January 1, 2005."
