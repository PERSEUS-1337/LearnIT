    "content": "The dispute, originating in the 1960s, escalated in 2004 when Delta Airlines reduced service at DFW Airport. Southwest Airlines rejected an offer to operate long-distance flights from DFW and sought to remove Wright/Shelby restrictions. DFW and American Airlines lobbied to keep the restrictions, while Southwest argued for their removal. The report discusses the arguments for and against removing Wright/Shelby restrictions on aviation in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. The region is served by DFW and Love Field airports, ranking 4th and 55th nationally. There has been minimal public interest in the issue outside of the local area. DFW and Love Field airports in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area rank 4th and 55th nationally for passenger enplanements. DFW enplaned 24.6 million passengers while Love Field enplaned around 2.8 million in FY2003. Both airports are vital to the regional economy, with American based at DFW and Southwest based at Love Field. American is the largest airline in the U.S. with an 18% market share, while Southwest is the most profitable airline with revenues of $6.5 billion in 2004. American Airlines had revenues of $18.6 billion in 2004, with a net loss of $761 million. They dominated air traffic at DFW, accounting for over 71% of all passengers. Delta had a 17% share, United Airlines had 2%, and Southwest had a 97% market share at Love Field. Continental Express accounted for the remaining 3% of passengers. The regional market is controlled by a small number of major air carriers. Southwest Airlines is the most successful carrier post-deregulation, known for offering low fares and maintaining low operating costs. It has expanded significantly since the 1980s, with a route system that has been imitated by other carriers. Southwest Airlines expanded dramatically in the 1990s with a national route system. Operating as a point-to-point carrier, it faces limited competition at Love Field, with only Express Jet providing service. The Wright/Shelby Amendments restrict direct service from Love Field to 7 states, impacting Southwest's ability to compete with DFW-based carriers in major markets. Passengers can reach Southwest cities from Dallas but must change planes at another destination. Express Jet, a Continental Airlines affiliate, provides service between Love Field and Houston Bush International. Due to regional air carrier exemption, flights beyond 7 states must use aircraft with 56 seats or less. Legend Airlines attempted national service in the late 1990s but failed. American Airlines, a legacy carrier, offers international service from DFW and other hubs like Chicago and Miami, connecting passengers worldwide. American serves major U.S. cities on its own aircraft or affiliated regional carriers. American Airlines, originally headquartered in New York, moved to DFW in the mid-1970s. Despite being financially successful in the 1980s and 1990s, it has consistently lost money since September 11th. Delta, based in Atlanta, also faced financial challenges at DFW post-9/11. Other carriers at DFW primarily use the airport as a feeder to their hub-and-spoke systems. Efforts have been made to attract low-cost carriers like Airtran and Jet Blue to the airport. Delta Airlines restructured in 2004, closing its DFW hub, cutting jobs, and reducing operations. Currently, Delta operates at a much smaller scale at the airport with 21 departures per day using 4 gates, compared to 258 departures per day and 28 gates in October 2004. Delta Airlines restructured in 2004, closing its DFW hub and reducing operations to 4 gates at the airport. Since deregulation in 1978, multiple airline hubs have either consolidated or ceased to exist. Observers predicted Delta would struggle to compete with American at DFW and eventually scale down or abandon its hub. The timing of Delta's withdrawal coincides with DFW's ongoing construction of major capital projects. Delta Airlines restructured in 2004, closing its DFW hub and reducing operations to 4 gates at the airport. DFW's ongoing capital improvement program will cost $2.7 billion, raising airport debt levels to $3.8 billion. Delta's withdrawal will decrease revenue by $50 million annually, prompting the airport to seek new revenues to avoid debt payment issues. In January 2005, DFW announced financial incentives for a new carrier to take over at least 10 gates left by Delta. DFW offered incentives including free rent and up to $22 million in aid, but no airline has taken up the offer. DFW blames Southwest's removal of the Wright/Shelby Amendments for the lack of interest. Uncertainty about the future of these amendments is a major concern for carriers. However, other market factors and the financial state of the airline industry also play a role. Legacy airlines are not looking to create new hubs, and low-cost carriers typically do not establish hubs. American Airlines' competitive position at the airport is another important factor to consider. American Airlines is a strong competitor at the airport, with established hubs in major cities like Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. Southwest believes that the Dallas Ft. Worth region could support increased flights out of Love Field without significant negative effects on DFW. Regional growth would create new opportunities for both airports. DFW argues against the Houston model, stating it already provides more service and competitive fares. They believe splitting resources between two airports would be inefficient. DFW hired economists to analyze the impact of Delta hub closure, predicting a significant decrease in economic activity, job loss, and wage reduction. The closure of Delta's hub at DFW Airport resulted in a loss of over 7,000 jobs, a decrease in wages of $344 million annually, and a loss of $58 million in tax revenue. The airport also suffered a $35 million loss in 2005 due to reduced landing and concession fees. The authors predict it will be challenging to fill the 24 vacant gates left by Delta, with Southwest Airlines not moving flights to DFW and other carriers hesitant to serve the airport. Input-output analysis was used to assess the economic impact, showing the potential long-term underutilization of DFW's gates and terminals. The economic impact of Delta's hub closure at DFW Airport included a loss of over 7,000 jobs, $344 million in annual wages, and $58 million in tax revenue. The closure also led to a $35 million loss in airport revenue in 2005. Input-output analysis was used to assess the impact, revealing potential long-term underutilization of DFW's gates and terminals. Economic analyses for large public projects like stadiums often face scrutiny, with opponents hiring their own economists to provide alternative views. The assumptions in the analysis are frequently questioned, with some observations appearing less dramatic when considering the overall regional economy. In 2003, the Dallas-Ft. Worth region saw a $524 million increase in wage disbursements, with Delta's pullback accounting for less than 3/10ths of one percent of total local salaries and wages. The economic impact of Delta's hub closure at DFW Airport included a loss of over 7,000 jobs, $344 million in annual wages, and $58 million in tax revenue. A second study by aviation consulting firm SH&E focused on how aviation activity in the region might change as a result of the repeal of the Wright/Shelby amendments, showing potential negative effects on DFW and the regional economy. Southwest expanding its activity at Love Field under two growth scenarios was considered a worst-case outcome. The SH&E study presents findings that air traffic at Love Field could triple, international traffic at DFW would decrease, domestic destinations served from DFW would be reduced, and DFW could lose up to 35% of its annual passengers. The study suggests retaining the Wright/Shelby amendments to concentrate future aviation growth at DFW to avoid underutilization and financial implications for the region. The Campbell-Hill Aviation Group study suggests that repealing the Wright/Shelby amendments could result in economic penalties of $2.4 billion for North Texas and $4.2 billion for the nation. Limited competition at DFW leads to above-market fares, impacting the region and the nation as a whole. Southwest Airlines has initiated its own study on the effects of repealing the amendments. The study highlights limited competition at DFW leading to above-market fares, assuming Southwest could compete in 15 city-pair markets. Lower fares are expected to attract new airline traffic to North Texas, with positive economic impacts. The study does not address potential infrastructure investments needed for increased traffic. American Airlines has also commissioned a study on the matter. The EclatConsulting study commissioned by American Airlines challenges the Southwest-supported Campbell-Hill study, suggesting it overstates the benefits of increased Southwest service at Love Field. The report indicates that removing the Wright/Shelby restrictions could lead to significant changes in American's DFW hub system, potentially reducing service to small cities and international destinations. The study, like others on the topic, is based on assumptions, including the idea that American would shift service from DFW to Love Field. DFW is concerned about paying off its bonded indebtedness if it loses airline service due to a Wright/Shelby restriction repeal. The potential financial impact on DFW compared to Love Field is debatable, as other airports have experienced significant reductions in air service in the past. Indianapolis is currently facing the loss of ATA as a major presence at the airport, similar to other cities that have experienced airline collapses. While DFW may go through short-term challenges, the airport is not expected to suffer serious long-term economic repercussions. The biggest threat to DFW's financial health is the long-term stability of American Airlines, the largest carrier at the airport. The rationale for airport infrastructure is to protect American Airlines' market position and DFW's financial health. Love Field's limitations on gates and noise concerns restrict expansion. Southwest aims to expand services. Southwest aims to expand services at Love Field with their quiet Boeing 737-700 aircraft, welcoming new competitors but concerned about potential relaxation of restrictions affecting their competitors like American Airlines. American fears losing Dallas traffic if Southwest expands nationally from the downtown airport. American currently owns three gates at Love Field. American Airlines owns three gates at Love Field but does not currently use them. It is uncertain if American could establish a smaller hub at Love Field without facing inefficiencies. Serving two airports in close proximity could have negative financial implications for DFW. No other major airline has expressed interest in serving Love Field if restrictions are lifted. It is more likely that additional airlines would add regional or large jet services at the airport. American Airlines believes the Love Field Master Plan would become irrelevant if restrictions are repealed, a view not shared by others. In the event of a Wright/Shelby repeal, the Love Field Master Plan may become irrelevant, causing local opposition due to noise concerns. Regional opinions are mixed, with American and Southwest employees likely to engage in local debate. Local newspapers and websites reflect support for both sides. Local newspapers and local politicians are extensively covering the debate over Wright/Shelby, indicating a lack of consensus on the issue. Members of the congressional delegation have differing views on the repeal, with some supporting it and others opposing it. Legislation has been introduced in both the 108th and 109th Congress regarding direct air service between Love Field and airports in Tennessee. Legislation has been introduced in the 109th Congress to repeal the Wright/Shelby Amendments, but no further action has been taken. In the Senate, a bill has been introduced to amend the existing provisions to include 43 states as allowable service points, including Puerto Rico. Legislation in the 109th Congress includes bills to repeal the Wright/Shelby Amendments and add Puerto Rico as an allowable service point. Another bill opposes lifting the restrictions and proposes closing Love Field three years after enactment. A provision in the Senate-passed Transportation Appropriations Bill would add Missouri to states eligible for direct service to Love Field. The Senate Committee has a hearing scheduled on the Love Field dispute. It is uncertain if further action will be taken on these bills during the 1st Session of the 109th Congress. Southwest Airlines believes that the legislation introduced in the 109th Congress supports expanding direct service to Love Field beyond the current restrictions. They argue that the departure of Delta from the market creates a need for additional low fare service, which they are best positioned to provide if relieved from the Wright/Shelby restrictions. DFW Airport disagrees, suggesting that Southwest should either offer long distance service from DFW or accept the current limitations. Southwest Airlines believes legislation should allow them to expand service from Love Field beyond current restrictions due to Delta's departure. DFW Airport argues Southwest should offer long-distance service from DFW or abide by existing limitations to attract new carriers. The debate revolves around the impact on airport economics and regional interests. The debate over Wright/Shelby repeal or modification is seen as a local issue by some in the region, emphasizing the importance of considering local aviation needs. Deregulation in 1978 has made the airline industry highly competitive, with airlines adjusting their services based on marketing strategies. While some airports have operating restrictions, such as Reagan Washington National and New York La Guardia, they are less restrictive than Love Field. The rationale for removing Wright/Shelby restrictions aligns with the goal of deregulation: promoting the unrestricted flow of air commerce. Policymakers must consider whether exceptions to deregulation, like the Wright/Shelby Amendments, should be maintained. The debate surrounds whether exceptions to deregulation, like the Wright/Shelby Amendments, should be kept in the national aviation system or if local concerns should dictate their repeal or modification."
