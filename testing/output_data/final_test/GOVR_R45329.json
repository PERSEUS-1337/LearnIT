    "content": "Afghanistan has been a key focus of U.S. foreign policy since the 9/11 attacks, with efforts to support the Afghan government and security forces against the Taliban and ISIS. The U.S. and NATO have deployed troops and provided billions in aid for development. The U.N. convened Afghan leaders in Bonn, Germany to establish a democratic government. Taliban representatives were not invited. An interim administration led by Hamid Karzai was formed, followed by a loya jirga in 2002 and another in 2003 to endorse a new constitution. Karzai won the first presidential election in 2004, with parliamentary elections in 2005. Despite sporadic Taliban attacks, most fighters fled to Pakistan, leading to an Islamist insurgency there. Pakistan's security institutions aided the Afghan Taliban, providing safe haven to its leadership. Despite democratic development in Afghanistan, the American effort appeared \"off course\" by 2007, leading President Obama to increase American forces to combat the Taliban insurgency. The surge in Afghanistan improved security metrics, but uncertainty grew as Afghan forces took over security in 2013 amid a drawdown of U.S. and international forces. The 2014 presidential election was marred by fraud allegations, leading to the formation of a fragile unity government. The NATO-led ISAF mission was replaced by the RSM in 2015. The killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in 2016 showed Taliban vulnerabilities to U.S. military capabilities. President Trump announced a new strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia in 2017, featuring a tougher line against Pakistan, a larger role for India, expanded targeting authorities for U.S. forces, and around 3,000 additional troops. This came after the Taliban expanded their control in rural areas and briefly seized the provincial capital of Kunduz in 2015. President Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia in 2017 included around 3,000 additional troops and tougher measures against Pakistan. The strategy has been criticized for lacking details and perpetuating a dangerous status quo. It remains unclear how much the new strategy has impacted the dynamics on the ground in Afghanistan, as Taliban-controlled territory has continued to grow. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) reported in July 2018 that 56% of districts are under government control or influence, the lowest level in two years. The Taliban has made gains in rural areas and urban centers, briefly capturing two provincial capitals in 2018. They have shown the ability to conduct operations across the country and inflict significant casualties on Afghan forces. The U.S. military has classified figures related to Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) performance in 2017. The Trump Administration is considering direct talks with the Taliban, signaling a shift in American policy. Preliminary discussions between U.S. and Taliban officials have taken place, but the Afghan government may oppose negotiations where they are not the lead. Disputes between Afghan leaders may escalate before upcoming elections in 2018 and 2019. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress has played a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards Afghanistan. U.S. military forces were deployed under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force to combat the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and the local Islamic State affiliate. The Taliban regime collapsed after two months of combat operations, and U.S. operations in Afghanistan continue under this resolution. Members of Congress have proposed various measures to replace the AUMF. After the fall of the Taliban, U.S. efforts in Afghanistan focused on humanitarian support, stabilizing the country, and building a democratic government. The 2002 Afghanistan Freedom Support Act authorized $3.8 billion for various assistance programs, including counter-narcotics and security measures. Congressional oversight and directives were established to guide U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. The U.S. efforts in Afghanistan post-Taliban focused on humanitarian aid, stabilization, and democracy building. Congressional oversight mandated reports on the progress in Afghanistan, with attention shifting back to Afghanistan as conditions deteriorated. Congressional provisions included funding authorization, reporting requirements, and conditions similar to other legislation for aid to Afghanistan. The 2008 establishment of a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) by Congress mandated quarterly reports on funds for Afghan reconstruction. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act added more reporting requirements, including biannual reports on progress in Afghanistan. The FY2015 NDAA required a report on \"Enhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan.\" Since June 2015, biannual reports titled \"Enhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan\" have been submitted as required by Congress. In addition to these ongoing reports, one-time reports on specific issues have been mandated in appropriations and defense authorization bills. Congress has allocated $126.3 billion for relief and reconstruction in Afghanistan since FY2002, with efforts to condition assistance funds due to inadequate reforms during the Karzai administration. The Foreign Relations Committee recommended conditioning a higher proportion of U.S. assistance on specific reforms by the Afghan government. Congress has imposed directives and conditions on security and development assistance to Afghanistan through appropriations measures. FY 2019 appropriations bills would prohibit funds for activities involving corruption, narcotics trafficking, or human rights violations. The Secretary of State must certify that the Afghan government is governing democratically and protecting women's rights before obligating funds. Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. assistance to Afghanistan, including prohibiting funds for activities involving corruption, narcotics trafficking, or human rights violations. There are additional conditions such as the Leahy Laws, which prohibit security assistance to foreign security forces that violate human rights. Congress has also shaped bureaucratic structures for U.S. policy on Afghanistan, authorizing positions like a coordinator and special envoy, although some proposals have faced objections. In 2009, the Obama Administration appointed Richard Holbrooke as the first Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Various congressional proposals have addressed the office, which was closed by the Trump Administration in 2017. Some measures have sought to limit or end the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan, with growing support in the House of Representatives from 2009 to 2014. House bills have called for a responsible end to the war in Afghanistan. Since 2009, congressional proposals have aimed to limit or end the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan, with increasing support in the House of Representatives. House bills calling for a responsible end to the war in Afghanistan gained more cosponsors over the years. Congressional interest in Afghanistan has grown since the Trump Administration's South Asia strategy announcement in 2017. The 115th Congress has seen a rise in proposed and enacted Afghanistan-related legislation."
