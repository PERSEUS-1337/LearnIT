    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Kosova Peace, Democracy, and Human Rights Act of 1995\". The Constitution of Yugoslavia described Kosova as one of its constituent units. The Albanian majority in Kosova had their political rights curtailed in 1989. The autonomous status of Kosova was revoked without their consent. The Parliament and Government of Kosova were abolished in 1990. A referendum on independence for Kosova in 1990 had 87 percent support. In May 1992, a Kosovar national parliament elected Dr. Ibrahim Rugova as President. Reports of Serbian ethnic cleansing in Kosova were received, with over 100,000 ethnic Albanians removed from their jobs. Serbia announced a policy to colonize Albanian land in Kosova in January 1995. The government in Belgrade has severely restricted ethnic Albanians in Kosova from accessing education in their language, leading to reports of arrests and beatings by Serbian police. Observers from the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe were expelled in 1993, and Serbia has ignored UN Security Council Resolution 855. Several international human rights organizations have documented an increase in humanitarian abuses in Kosova following the departure of observers from the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Congress provided for a US Information Agency cultural center in Prishtina, Kosova, but security conditions have prevented its establishment. President Clinton warned Serbia about potential conflict in Kosova and stated that issues, including Kosova, must be addressed before lifting UN sanctions. He announced conditions for lifting sanctions without consulting Congress, excluding improvements in Kosova. Conditions for lifting international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro do not include improvements in Kosova. SEC. 3. POLICY. The United States policy regarding Kosova includes resolving the situation before lifting sanctions on Belgrade, allowing self-governance for the people of Kosova, reinstating terminated employees based on ethnicity, and reopening the education system to all residents regardless of ethnicity. All residents of Kosova, including the majority ethnic Albanian population, should have the right to educate their youth in their native language. Restrictions on the termination of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro until certain conditions are met. Restrictions on sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro cannot be lifted without President's certification of progress towards Kosova's self-governance or international protectorate, and meeting requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. The President must certify progress towards Kosova's self-governance or international protectorate, and meet requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 before lifting sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. Key conditions include substantial improvement in human rights, allowing international observers back, and permitting the elected government to function. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The President must submit a report to Congress within 60 days of this Act's enactment on the situation in Kosova, including the impact of Serbia's policies on the majority population, measures for humanitarian assistance, and recommendations for potential international protectorate. The President must report to Congress on establishing an international protectorate for Kosova with the UN Security Council and EU, monitoring the situation, securing democratic self-government, and the status of US efforts to establish a cultural center in Prishtina. The report to Congress includes information on the establishment of a cultural center in Prishtina, Kosova, and details on visits by personnel from the United States Embassy in Belgrade to Kosova in the past year."
