    "content": "The \"Regulatory Fair Warning Act of 1999\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The Congress finds that federal regulations serve important goals such as protecting the environment and public health. Regulations must be accessible to the public to ensure fairness and prevent sanctions for violations based on misleading information from officials. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment grants Americans the right to access regulations and understand their meanings before facing any deprivation of liberty or property. Effective procedures for protecting this right can enhance regulation effectiveness and ensure fair enforcement, benefiting Americans. Agencies providing access to regulations and accurate information before imposing sanctions will promote transparency and compliance. Access to regulations and understanding requirements will promote legality, fairness, and justice in enforcing Federal regulations. SEC. 3. BAN ON IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS BY AGENCIES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. Section 558 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to prohibit agencies from imposing sanctions on a person for violating a rule if the rule was not printed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Federal Register, known to the person, or knowable through a reasonable investigation. Sanctions are also prohibited if the rule did not provide fair warning or if the person acted in reasonable reliance on written information for retrospective sanctions.
