    "content": "The \"Nonnative Wildlife Invasion Prevention Act\" aims to establish a risk assessment process to prevent the introduction of nonnative wildlife species that could cause economic, environmental, or health harm in the United States. The Secretary of the Interior will establish regulations for assessing the risk of nonnative wildlife species proposed for importation into the United States. Factors considered will include the species identity, geographic source, and establishment or spread. The Secretary of the Interior will establish regulations for assessing the risk of nonnative wildlife species proposed for importation into the United States, considering factors such as the species identity, geographic source, and potential harm to the economy, environment, and wildlife in the United States. The Secretary of the Interior will establish regulations for assessing the risk of nonnative wildlife species proposed for importation into the United States, considering factors such as pathogenic, parasitic, or free-living species that may accompany the proposed species, consultation with various stakeholders, and ensuring a scientifically credible risk assessment process. Deadlines for proposing and publishing final regulations are also specified. The Secretary of the Interior will establish regulations for assessing the risk of nonnative wildlife species proposed for importation into the United States. Final regulations, an initial list, and prohibitions will be published in the Federal Register. Assessing risk must begin within 37 months of the Act's enactment. The Act and regulations will not affect possession of legally imported individual animals, even if later prohibited. SEC. 4. LIST OF APPROVED SPECIES. The Secretary must publish a list of nonnative wildlife species approved for importation within 36 months of the Act's enactment. The list excludes species prohibited under section 5 or by other laws. The Secretary can revise the list, including nonnative species based on scientific and commercial findings. The Secretary will publish a request for proposals for nonnative wildlife species importation within 60 days of the Act's enactment, based on scientific and commercial data. The Secretary will accept proposals for nonnative wildlife species for 10 months after publishing a request. Before issuing the initial list, there will be a 60-day period for public comments on the proposed list. After publishing a request, the Secretary will accept proposals for nonnative wildlife species for 10 months. Following this, there will be a 60-day public comment period on the proposed list. The Secretary will then publish an initial list and provide an opportunity for public comments on proposed inclusions of nonnative wildlife species. The Secretary assesses the risk of nonnative wildlife species for importation and makes a determination. Approved species are added to the list, while unapproved species are not allowed unless permitted under section 7. The Secretary determines whether nonnative wildlife species should be included on the list of unapproved species under section 5 or requests additional information from the proposer. The determinations made are published in the Federal Register and made available online. The Secretary determines inclusion of nonnative wildlife species on the list of unapproved species under section 5. The Secretary publishes a list of nonnative wildlife species prohibited or restricted from entering the US, including species listed as injurious wildlife and those not approved for importation. Any person can petition to add or remove species from the list. The Secretary will review petitions to add or remove nonnative wildlife species from the list, allowing for public comment and publishing the determination in the Federal Register. In case of emergency, the Secretary has the authority to temporarily prohibit certain species. If an emergency arises due to a nonnative wildlife species posing a serious threat to the US economy, environment, or health, the Secretary can temporarily list it as unapproved. A final decision must be made within 180 days and published for public access. SEC. 6. PROHIBITIONS AND PENALTIES. Prohibitions under section 6 include not importing nonnative wildlife species without approval, violating permit terms, possessing or selling prohibited species, and releasing illegally imported wildlife. The penalties for violating the prohibition on breeding or selling nonnative wildlife species include civil and criminal penalties as described in the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981. Law enforcement personnel enforcing this section are exempt from these penalties. Law enforcement personnel enforcing this section are exempt from penalties. This section will take effect 37 months after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary may issue permits for importation for educational, scientific research, or zoological purposes. Fees for permits are also addressed. The Secretary establishes fees to recover costs of assessing risk of nonnative wildlife species. A Nonnative Wildlife Invasion Prevention Fund is created to deposit fee amounts for implementing the Act. Nonnative wildlife species are treated as nonmailable matter. SEC. 9. Nonnative wildlife species listed under section 4 are considered nonmailable under title 39, United States Code. SEC. 10. Relationship to State Law. SEC. 10. RELATIONSHIP TO STATE LAW.
