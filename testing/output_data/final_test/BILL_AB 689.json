    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The department may refuse to issue, suspend, or revoke a certificate of registration for failure to pay fines or violations of regulations. The department can reverse its decision if substantial grounds are found. Regulations must be adopted by the department. The department must adopt regulations for an appeals process for contesting refusal, suspension, or revocation of a certificate of registration. The regulations will specify a maximum time period for reapplication, not exceeding three years. These regulations are not subject to certain government code sections. The secretary will classify violations of the Food and Agricultural Code as \"minor,\" \"moderate,\" or \"serious,\" with corresponding penalties. The penalty schedule applies to civil and administrative penalties. The department will announce the adoption of the penalty schedule on its website. Section 27581.4 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to allow for civil actions against violators, with penalties not exceeding $10,000. Money recovered will be deposited in either the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund or the county's general fund. Section 27583 of the Food and Agricultural Code allows for an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 to be levied against those who violate the chapter or its regulations, instead of facing prosecution. The penalty amount is determined by the penalty schedule adopted by the department. Section 27583.2 of the Food and Agricultural Code outlines the process for notifying a person charged with a violation and their right to request a hearing to appeal an administrative penalty levied by the secretary. The notice includes details of the violation, the penalty amount, and the method of notification. The process for notifying a person charged with a violation includes sending notice by certified mail to the person's address, agent for service of process, or last known address. The person charged has the right to appeal the proposed action by requesting a hearing within 20 days of receiving the notice. The secretary must schedule a hearing within 45 days of a request, allowing the person charged to review evidence and present their own. If no hearing is requested, the secretary can proceed with the proposed action. A decision must be issued within 30 days of the hearing. The secretary must notify the county commissioner of violations and penalties assessed. If a commissioner levies an administrative penalty, the secretary may recover reasonable costs incurred in administering the appeal hearing. Revenues collected will be deposited into the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund for departmental use. Before an administrative penalty is imposed, the charged person must receive written notice of the violation, proposed penalty amount, and the right to request a hearing. The notice is sent by certified mail to the charged person's address provided by the department, agent for service of process, or last known address if others are unavailable. The notice sent to any address specified shall be considered received, even if delivery is refused. The person charged has the right to appeal by requesting a hearing within 20 days. If a hearing is requested, it must be scheduled within 45 days, with notice given at least 10 days before. Failure to appear at the hearing may result in the commissioner prevailing in the proceedings. The commissioner must issue a decision within 30 days of the hearing, which is effective immediately. The person charged with a violation can appeal the decision to the secretary within 30 days of receiving a copy of the commissioner's decision by following specific procedures. The appellant and the commissioner can present the record of the hearing and a written argument to the secretary within 10 days of filing the appeal. The secretary may allow oral arguments if requested when written arguments are submitted, with at least 10 days notice given for the oral argument. The secretary decides the appeal based on the hearing record, written evidence, and argument received. If substantial evidence supports the commissioner's decision, the secretary affirms it. A written decision is rendered within 45 days of the appeal date or 15 days of oral arguments. The secretary may affirm, modify, or reverse the commissioner's decision on appeal. The penalty can be adjusted to align with the penalty schedule, but cannot exceed the original proposed amount. Failure to request a hearing with the commissioner forfeits the right to appeal to the secretary. If the proposed action is upheld, the commissioner can impose an administrative penalty and recover reasonable costs for the hearing. Revenue from penalties goes to the county's general fund for the commissioner's use. The commissioner must report violations with penalties to the secretary. Section 27584 of the Food and Agricultural Code states that if a respondent agrees to stipulate to a proposed action in an administrative case, they must submit a signed stipulation and payment of the penalty within 45 days. Failure to do so may result in the commissioner or secretary filing a final decision for payment of the penalty with the superior court. No fees will be charged for this service. After exhausting appeal and review procedures, the secretary or commissioner may file a final decision directing payment of an administrative penalty with the superior court. No fees will be charged for this service."
