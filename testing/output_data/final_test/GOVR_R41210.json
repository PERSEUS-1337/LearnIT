    "content": "The President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law on March 23, 2010, followed by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 on March 30, 2010. These laws make significant changes to health insurance markets and the Medicaid program. The Medicaid law raises income eligibility levels, adds benefits, increases federal payments, and includes new requirements for quality care. CHIP funding is extended through FY2015 with states required to maintain current program structures. Major changes are grouped into eligibility, benefits, financing, program integrity, demonstrations, and miscellaneous areas. Appendix A provides a detailed implementation timeline. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) issued a cost estimate on March 20, 2010, for ACA and HCERA, estimating a reduction in federal budget deficits by $143 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. This estimate includes $124 billion in reductions and revenue from health care provisions and $19 billion in spending reductions from education. Key Medicaid and CHIP provisions are outlined in the report. The health reform law aims to reduce federal deficits by $118 billion over the 2010-2019 period. It requires states to expand Medicaid eligibility to individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level, the largest expansion since 1965. The federal government will cover 100% of costs for these newly eligible individuals from 2014 to 2016, decreasing to 90% by 2020. The health reform law mandates states to expand Medicaid eligibility to individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government will cover 100% of costs for these newly eligible individuals, decreasing to 90% by 2020. States must maintain current Medicaid and CHIP eligibility levels through 2013 for adults and 2019 for children. The law includes provisions for outreach, enrollment, and benefit reforms, such as new mandatory and optional benefits like free-standing birth clinics and health homes for persons with chronic conditions. The health reform law includes options for states to expand home and community-based services as an alternative to institutional care. Payment and financing reforms in the law involve increases in federal matching payments for newly eligible individuals, reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments, expenditure reductions for prescription drugs, reductions in inappropriate hospital expenditures, and increases in primary care physician payment rates. Additionally, the law provides increased funding for the territories to establish exchanges. The health reform law provides funding for territories to establish exchanges and offers federal funds for premium and cost-sharing assistance. It also increases Medicaid spending caps and the FMAP rate for territories. Additionally, the law includes program integrity reforms such as enforcement tools, data reporting requirements, and initiatives to improve Medicaid program integrity. The health reform law includes funding for Medicaid program integrity, nursing home accountability, demonstrations, pilot programs, and CHIP-related provisions. It aims to improve transparency, quality, and cost of services in Medicaid and CHIP programs. Future appropriations for CHIP may be insufficient, leading to children obtaining coverage through exchanges or Medicaid. States may receive higher federal matching rates for CHIP services starting in FY2016 if new funding is provided. States must maintain CHIP eligibility levels through FY2019 to receive federal matching funds for Medicaid. The law also includes Medicaid and CHIP reforms to improve care coordination and develop new payment models. The Medicaid Innovation Center develops new payment and service delivery models to reduce Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP expenditures while maintaining quality of care for beneficiaries. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program with various eligibility pathways, including mandatory and state optional groups like pregnant women, children, and individuals with disabilities or over age 64. The Medicaid program covers various groups such as pregnant women, infants, and individuals with disabilities or over age 64. The Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid eligibility by adding new mandatory and optional groups, and modifying existing eligibility criteria. The Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid eligibility by creating new mandatory groups for nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals not enrolled in Medicare. This results in an estimated 16 million increase in Medicaid enrollment by FY2019. The Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid eligibility for nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals not enrolled in Medicare. It establishes 133% of FPL as the new mandatory minimum Medicaid income eligibility level, with an income disregard of 5% FPL. Additional federal financial assistance will be provided to states for those in the new eligibility group. The Affordable Care Act increases Medicaid eligibility for nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) with a 5% income disregard. States have the option to expand coverage up to 133% FPL until 2014, with certain restrictions on who can be covered. States have the option to expand Medicaid coverage for nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals up to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) until 2014. This includes new eligibility groups and allows for different income counting methodologies. States can also determine presumptive eligibility for certain individuals. States have the option to expand Medicaid coverage for nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals up to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) until 2014, including new eligibility groups and presumptive eligibility for certain individuals. Medicaid's financial eligibility requirements set limits on income and assets for participation, with specific guidelines on calculation by states. Under the ACA, income and asset limitations for Medicaid eligibility vary by state and population group. Asset tests and certain income disregards will no longer be used for certain individuals, with the new income test based on MAGI. The ACA changes Medicaid eligibility criteria to be based on MAGI, which includes AGI plus certain income sources. Income disregards are no longer used, but a 5% reduction is applied to countable income. MAGI also determines premium and cost sharing amounts. Under the ACA, Medicaid eligibility is now based on MAGI, which includes AGI and certain income sources. States cannot apply assets or resources tests for populations determined by MAGI. Certain groups are exempt from MAGI income eligibility determinations, and prior Medicaid income counting rules still apply for specific groups like the elderly and disabled individuals. Under the ACA, Medicaid eligibility is now based on MAGI, which includes AGI and certain income sources. States cannot apply assets or resources tests for populations determined by MAGI. MAGI does not affect eligibility determinations for certain programs, such as Express Lane, Medicare low-income subsidies, or Medicaid long term care services. Individuals enrolled in Medicaid on January 1, 2014, who become ineligible due to MAGI rules will remain eligible until March 31, 2014, or their next redetermination date. They can then purchase insurance through state exchanges with subsidies. The law requires that transitioning to MAGI for Medicaid eligibility should not result in the loss of eligibility for those who would have been eligible for Medicaid before March 23, 2010. State use of MAGI for income eligibility will not affect Medicaid application processing or rules on countable income sources. These provisions generally take effect on January 1, 2014, or earlier if a state chooses to transition sooner. Medicaid benefits are defined by federal statute and regulations, covering a wide range of medical services. Medicaid benefits are defined by federal statute and regulations, covering a wide range of medical services. Some benefits are mandatory for the majority of Medicaid populations, while others are optional at the state's discretion. States have the option to enroll certain groups in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit plans instead of traditional Medicaid. Enrollees in the new eligibility group up to 133% FPL will receive benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage. Section 1937 excludes certain groups from mandatory enrollment in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage, including individuals with special medical needs and medically frail individuals. Some individuals with disabilities who do not qualify for Medicaid under the current eligibility criteria may qualify under a new eligibility group, exempting them from mandatory enrollment in benchmark coverage. This allows them access to more comprehensive state plan services, including long-term care benefits. The health reform law includes a Medicaid eligibility maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement to ensure that states do not make their eligibility standards more restrictive than those in effect as of March 23, 2010. The MOE requirements apply to adult populations until the exchanges are fully operational. The Medicaid eligibility maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement ensures states maintain current standards until exchanges are fully operational. MOE will continue for Medicaid eligible children under age 19. States can expand eligibility without affecting compliance. Exemptions are available for certain adult populations above 133% FPL during budget deficits. The MOE exemption for states with budget deficits applies from certification submission to the Secretary through December 31, 2013. States must set Medicaid income eligibility thresholds using MAGI levels not lower than current levels. The Secretary can waive Medicaid or CHIP provisions to ensure states protect beneficiaries. States must have a case review system for each child in foster care under the federal foster care program. The case review system for children in foster care must include a permanency plan and transition plan for youth aging out of the system. States can provide foster care up to age 21, with specific options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, support services, and employment. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funds for independent living services, while the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program requires states to develop programs for youth in foster care. The state child welfare agency and Medicaid must collaborate to develop a plan for overseeing health care services for children in foster care. The plan should ensure that children's health care needs are met, and medical information is shared. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care must include designating someone to make health care decisions if needed. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care must include designating someone to make health care decisions if needed, such as executing a health care power of attorney or similar document recognized under state law. States must certify that foster care adolescents also receive education on the importance of designating a health care decision maker and how to execute such a document. The health reform law mandates a collaborative health care oversight plan between the state child welfare agency and Medicaid agency. The collaborative plan between the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency ensures health-care related components of the transition plan for youth aging out of foster care are met. Youth ages 19 or 20 may qualify for Medicaid coverage through various eligibility pathways, including those recently discharged from the child welfare system. The health reform law adds a new mandatory Medicaid eligibility group for individuals under 26 years old who were in foster care and not eligible under existing groups. States can make presumptive eligibility determinations for these individuals and they are exempt from enrollment in Medicaid benchmark plans. The health reform law adds a new mandatory Medicaid eligibility group for individuals under 26 years old who were in foster care. Benchmark and benchmark equivalent plans are allowed as an alternative to regular Medicaid benefits. Spousal impoverishment protections provide relief for spouses of nursing home Medicaid applicants. The health reform law includes a new mandatory Medicaid eligibility group for individuals under 26 who were in foster care. Spousal impoverishment protections aim to help community spouses retain income and assets to prevent impoverishment. Medicaid law requires states to apply these protections to nursing home care applicants and certain home and community-based services. The health reform law introduces a mandatory Medicaid eligibility group for individuals under 26 who were in foster care. Spousal impoverishment protections now apply to applicants seeking certain home and community-based services under Medicaid. States must also use the HCBS state plan benefit option as an eligibility pathway for certain individuals with long-term care needs. The health reform law introduces a new optional Medicaid eligibility category for nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with income above 133% of FPL. States have the option to cover these individuals based on their income, with eligibility determined by MAGI. The health reform law allows states to offer Medicaid coverage to nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with income above 133% of FPL. Family planning services are a mandatory benefit for most beneficiaries of childbearing age, and states can provide these services to populations not eligible for traditional Medicaid through special waivers. The new law allows states to provide Medicaid coverage for family planning services and supplies to individuals with income up to the highest level applicable to pregnant women covered under Medicaid or CHIP state plans. States can also offer presumptive eligibility for these services and must include them in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans. This provision is effective immediately. In 2005, Congress passed the DRA, allowing states to extend HCBS to Medicaid beneficiaries under the HCBS state plan option without requiring a waiver. Eligibility criteria for Section 1915(i) services were limited to those with income below 150% of poverty and meeting state's needs-based criteria, which could not be more stringent than criteria for institutional care. The new law allows states to extend access to HCBS services to individuals with income up to 300% of the SSI benefit rate under certain waivers. It also established a new eligibility pathway under Section 1915(i) and allows states to provide full Medicaid benefits to this new group. States can target the Section 1915(i) benefit to specific populations based on defined criteria and coverage areas. The new law under Section 1915(i) allows states to offer different packages of services to various target groups of beneficiaries for five-year periods. States can tailor the provision of HCBS to specific populations and adjust the benefits for each group. Phased-in enrollment and services are permitted within the initial five-year period. Under the new law, states can offer different packages of services to specific groups of beneficiaries for five-year periods, with phased-in enrollment and services allowed. States are no longer allowed to cap the number of eligible persons, and can modify their needs-based criteria without prior approval if enrollment exceeds projections. Individuals will remain eligible until they no longer meet the state's former criteria. The new law allows states to offer home and community-based services beyond the statutory list, with approval from the Secretary. The Secretary must establish a system to enroll eligible individuals in Medicaid or CHIP through a standard application form. States can use their own forms as long as they align with the Secretary's, or use supplemental forms for eligibility determination. States are required to develop a secure electronic interface for eligibility verification for health subsidy programs. The Secretary must ensure applicants receive notice of eligibility or ineligibility based on consistent information. Effective January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2014, states must establish procedures for online enrollment in Medicaid or CHIP, enroll individuals identified by exchanges, screen ineligible applicants for exchange coverage, and utilize electronic signatures. (P.L. 111-148 : \u00a72201) The state Medicaid and CHIP agencies must ensure secure electronic interfaces for eligibility determinations and enrollment in Medicaid, CHIP, or premium assistance. They should coordinate Medicaid and CHIP coverage with exchange plans, conduct outreach to vulnerable populations, and may enter agreements with exchanges for premium assistance eligibility. Residents eligible for premium assistance for a qualified health benefits plan under an exchange must meet specific requirements to reduce administrative costs and eligibility errors. The Medicaid and CHIP agency must comply with streamlined enrollment procedures, and states must establish a website linking Medicaid to state exchanges by January 1, 2014. Certain groups can be enrolled temporarily based on a preliminary determination of likely Medicaid eligibility before formally applying for coverage. The health reform law allows states to permit hospitals to make presumptive eligibility determinations for Medicaid eligible populations based on likely eligibility criteria. Presumptive eligibility begins when a qualified provider determines eligibility and ends when a formal determination is made or if the individual fails to apply for Medicaid. Eligibility determinations must follow guidance set by the Secretary, similar to current presumptive eligibility rules. States can enroll individuals for a limited time before Medicaid applications are processed. Claims during presumptive eligibility are not reviewed for improper payments. Effective January 1, 2014. States must report changes in Medicaid enrollment starting January 2015. States must report enrollment estimates of \"newly enrolled\" individuals in Medicaid by fiscal year, disaggregated by various categories. They must also report on outreach and enrollment processes as specified by the Secretary. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress on total new enrollment in Medicaid by state and provide recommendations for improvement. Traditional Medicaid benefits are defined in federal statute and regulations. The benefits of Medicaid are outlined in federal statute and regulations, covering a wide range of acute and long-term care services. Additional benefits include premium payments for coverage through Medicaid managed care or employer-sponsored insurance, as well as Medicare premium and cost-sharing support for dual eligible individuals. States have the option to provide Medicaid through benchmark coverage similar to CHIP, offering various plan options. Benchmark and benchmark-equivalent coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries can be less generous than traditional Medicaid but may have requirements that make it more generous than private insurance. It can be provided in sub-state areas and limited to certain subpopulations. Newly eligible individuals with income below 133% FPL are required to have this coverage, with exemptions for certain subgroups. Prior to ACA, benchmark-equivalent coverage included basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, and preventive care designated by the Secretary. Benchmark and benchmark-equivalent coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries must include at least 75% of the actuarial value of available coverage under the selected benchmark option for specific additional benefits. This coverage also includes Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services, access to services provided by rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers, and medically necessary transportation to and from providers. Some states have experience with benchmark benefits under Medicaid, with CMS approving 10 benchmark packages. The health reform law modifies benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit packages available under Medicaid. Plans must include family planning services and essential benefits as of specific dates. Essential health benefits include ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health services, prescription drugs, and more. The health reform law mandates that benchmark and benchmark-equivalent Medicaid plans cover essential health benefits such as family planning, mental health services, prescription drugs, and pediatric services. Non-Medicaid managed care plans must comply with mental health services parity requirements. EPSDT services coverage is considered to meet the requirements. The health reform law allows states to offer premium assistance with wrap-around benefits to Medicaid eligible individuals when cost-effective. Beneficiaries are not required to enroll in employer plans and can disenroll if needed. The health reform law requires states to pay premiums and cost-sharing exceeding current Medicaid program rules, including coverage for care in birthing centers and separate payments to providers. Effective as if included in CHIPRA, states must comply with these provisions. Under the health reform law, Medicaid beneficiaries under 21 are entitled to EPSDT services, including preventive care and screenings. Medicaid adults may also receive preventive services through an optional benefit. The law expands coverage to include clinical preventive services recommended by the USPSTF. Beginning January 2013, states will receive a one percentage point increase in their FMAP for certain preventive services covered under Medicaid with no cost-sharing for beneficiaries. Pregnancy-related services, including prenatal, delivery, postpartum care, family planning, and counseling for tobacco cessation for pregnant women, are mandatory benefits under Medicaid. Beginning on October 1, 2010, Medicaid will cover tobacco cessation services for pregnant women, including FDA-approved agents and counseling recommended in clinical guidelines. Cost-sharing for these services will be prohibited, and states may receive a one percentage point increase in their FMAP for covering these services if they opt for the new optional adult preventive care benefit. States have the option to offer hospice services under Medicaid, with Medicaid beneficiaries who elect to receive such services waiving the right to other services related to their terminal illness. ACA allows payment for hospice services for Medicaid children without foregoing coverage for other treatments. Personal care attendants assist individuals with disabilities in daily living activities. Under current law, states can cover personal care services like personal care attendant services through various optional statutory authorities. These include the personal care state plan benefit, self-directed personal care state plan benefit, home and community-based services state plan benefit, HCBS Waiver, and Research and Demonstration Waivers. States have flexibility in determining the extent of these benefits, but each authority has rules limiting how they can be extended to Medicaid beneficiaries. The health reform law allows states to offer consumer-directed personal care attendant services to Medicaid beneficiaries with increased match rate. States can provide home and community-based attendant services as an optional benefit to eligible individuals. Services include assistance with daily living tasks and health-related activities. The health reform law allows states to offer consumer-directed personal care attendant services to Medicaid beneficiaries with an increased match rate. Services include assistance with daily living tasks, health-related activities, and transition costs. Attendants must be qualified and may include family members. States must collaborate with a state-established council and provide services on a statewide basis in the most integrated setting. The health reform law allows states to offer consumer-directed personal care attendant services to Medicaid beneficiaries with an increased match rate. A health home, also known as a medical home, provides patients with access to a primary care medical provider to improve patient health outcomes through coordinated care. Physician-guided, patient-centered care is expected to enhance patient adherence. The Affordable Care Act allows states to establish health homes for Medicaid enrollees with chronic conditions, providing coordinated care to reduce hospitalizations, unnecessary tests, and patient safety risks. These medical homes offer care coordination and management in physician offices for patients with chronic conditions like mental health disorders, asthma, and diabetes. Patients eligible for health homes under the Affordable Care Act must have at least two chronic conditions, be at risk of a second chronic condition, or have a serious mental health condition. They can designate providers like physicians, clinics, or health teams to receive comprehensive care management and coordination. The provider must offer services such as care management, coordination, health promotion, transitional care, patient and family support, referral to community services, and use of health information technology. States will be reimbursed by the federal government at a 90% FMAP for the first eight fiscal quarters. States can choose their payment schedules for providers. The state plan must include referrals from hospitals, coordination across services, monitoring arrangements, and reports on the quality of the health home option. Starting January 1, 2011, the Secretary may award planning grants to states for developing their health homes. The Secretary may award planning grants to states for developing health home programs starting January 1, 2011. States must match the federal contribution, and total payments will not exceed $25 million. An independent entity will evaluate the program's impact on reducing hospital admissions, emergency room visits, and skilled nursing facility admissions. The evaluation must be presented to the Secretary and Congress by January 1, 2017. Additionally, by January 1, 2014, the Secretary must survey participating states and report to Congress on various topics related to the program's effects. The term \"medical assistance\" in Title XIX of the SSA encompasses payment for services and the services themselves. Financing for Medicaid is shared by the federal government and states, with federal reimbursement rates based on the FMAP formula. FMAP rates range from 50% to 83%. The FMAP rates for Medicaid services range from 50% to 83%, with some states receiving higher rates. States received temporary enhanced FMAP rates from FY2009 to FY2011. State expenditures for Medicaid programs are matched by federal funding at 50%. Between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015, specified expansion states will receive an increase in their regular FMAP rate of 2.2 percentage points for medical assistance for individuals up to 133% FPL who are not \"newly eligible\". Eligible states must be expansion states and approved by the Secretary to receive additional federal funding. The FMAP increase described in this provision will apply to certain states that meet specific criteria, such as not receiving additional federal matching funds for \"newly eligible\" individuals and not having been granted approval to divert a portion of their DSH allotment. The only state that appears to qualify for the 2.2 percentage point increase is Vermont. States will receive 100% FMAP for providing coverage to \"newly eligible\" individuals from 2014 through 2016. The FMAP rate for \"newly eligible\" individuals will be 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% thereafter. States requiring political subdivisions to contribute the non-federal share of expenditures may not be eligible for an FMAP increase if the subdivisions pay a greater percentage than required as of December 31, 2009. \"Newly eligible\" individuals are defined as nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with family income below 133% FPL. Expansion states are those that had health benefits coverage for parents and nonpregnant childless adults with income of at least 100% FPL as of March 23, 2010. This coverage cannot be based on employer coverage or employment. The law requires health benefits coverage to be more than premium assistance, hospital-only benefits, high deductible health plans, or alternative benefits under a demonstration program. States offer a range of long-term care services under Medicaid, with limits on benefits based on medical necessity. Institutional services are care provided in nursing homes. The health reform law allows states to receive bonus payments for increasing their share of Medicaid long-term care spending on home and community-based services (HCBS) and reducing their share of Medicaid spending on institutional services like nursing facilities and inpatient hospital care. States can receive bonus payments for increasing their share of Medicaid long-term care spending on home and community-based services (HCBS) and reducing their spending on institutional care. States must meet target-spending percentages, with those below 25% in FY2009 needing to reach a 25% target by October 1, 2015, to qualify for bonus payments. States above 25% must reach a 50% target by the same date. The balancing incentive period runs from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2015, with a cap of $3 billion in payments. States must submit a proposed budget to receive incentive payments. States must submit an application with a proposed budget to expand and diversify medical assistance for non-institutionally based long-term care services. The application must include details on increasing eligibility levels and offering new services while maintaining eligibility standards from December 31, 2010. Additional incentive payments must be used for specified purposes. States must agree to use additional incentive payments for new or expanded offerings of HCBS services under Medicaid. They must also implement a no wrong door-single entry point system, conflict-free case management services, and core standardized assessment. Additionally, states must collect data from providers and others on services. Under Medicaid, states are required to make disproportionate share hospital (DSH) adjustments to payment rates for hospitals treating low-income and Medicaid patients. DSH hospitals must meet specific criteria and have a payment formula that does not exceed unreimbursed costs for Medicaid and uninsured patients. The federal DSH matching dollars for Medicaid and uninsured patients are based on state-specific allotment amounts. Low DSH states have special rules for allotments, with increases in funding for FY2004 through FY2008. From FY2009 onwards, DSH allotments for all states are adjusted based on the consumer price index. In FY2009, federal DSH allotments totaled nearly $10.6 billion, with additional temporary funding provided under ARRA. The ARRA provided temporary DSH funding for states, increasing total federal DSH allotments to nearly $10.9 billion. P.L. 111-152 requires aggregate reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments, totaling $18.5 billion from FY2014 to FY2020. Reductions will be based on states with low uninsured rates or not targeting DSH payments to hospitals with high Medicaid patient volumes. Under the ACA, Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) allotments will be adjusted to account for uncompensated care levels, with smaller reductions for low DSH states. Special arrangements exist for Tennessee and Hawaii, with set allotment amounts that will increase under the ACA. Tennessee's allotment will be $47.2 million for FY2012 and $53.1 million for FY2013, while Hawaii's allotment will remain at $10 million for FY2012 and increase thereafter. Under the ACA, Hawaii's annual DSH allotment will increase based on the CPI-U. The Secretary is prohibited from imposing limits on payments to hospitals under Hawaii's QUEST Section 1115 project, except to prevent excess payments. The fiscal situation of states has focused on Medicaid expenditure shares and changes in federal shares. During the recession, states received enhanced FMAP rates under ARRA in FY2009 to provide economic stimulus funding. During the recession period from FY2009 to FY2011, states received increased FMAP rates under ARRA, with a 6.2 percentage point across-the-board increase and additional benefits for qualifying states. Territories were given a choice between a 6.2 percentage point FMAP increase with a 15% spending cap increase or their regular FMAP with a 30% spending cap increase, with all territories opting for the latter. DRA also included provisions to exclude certain Hurricane Katrina evacuees from FMAP calculations, prevent Alaska's FMAP from dropping below FY2005 levels, and allocate $2 billion for assistance. ACA Section 2006 provides additional FMAP above regular levels for qualifying \"disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment\" states once the ARRA adjustment ends. To qualify, states must have been declared a major disaster area in the past seven fiscal years and have a regular FMAP at least three percentage points lower than their highest since FY2008. Only Louisiana, Hawaii, and North Dakota meet this requirement. Louisiana, Hawaii, and North Dakota are the only states that meet the requirements for additional FMAP under ACA Section 2006. Louisiana will receive an increased FMAP of 68.04% starting January 1, 2011. Other states may qualify for this special disaster relief FMAP increase in the future. Five territories operate Medicaid programs under different rules from states. The territories operate Medicaid programs with different rules from states, including varying eligibility groups and financial standards. Territories are not required to cover the same groups as states, and they have annual federal spending caps that are typically exhausted before the end of the fiscal year. Once the cap is reached, territories must assume full costs of Medicaid services or may suspend services until the next fiscal year. The health reform law allows territories to establish exchanges by October 13, 2013, with $1.0 billion allocated for premium and cost-sharing assistance. $925 million is designated for Puerto Rico, and the remaining $75 million for other territories. Territories must structure their exchanges to ensure no gap in assistance between Medicaid and exchange eligibility. The health reform law allows territories to establish exchanges with $1.0 billion allocated for premium and cost-sharing assistance. Territories not establishing exchanges are entitled to their share of the funding towards an increase in Medicaid funding caps. An additional $6.3 billion in Medicaid federal payments is available for distribution among territories, with an increased FMAP from 50% to 55% starting July 1, 2011. State Medicaid plans must ensure payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care. Under HCERA (P.L. 111-152), states have flexibility to set Medicaid provider reimbursement rates, with requirements for primary care services to be set relative to Medicare rates. This includes evaluation and management services and immunization administration. Under P.L. 111-152, Medicare payment rates for primary care services in 2013 and 2014 will be at least as high as the Medicare rate. Medicaid managed care must also adhere to these new payment rates for evaluation and management services, regardless of payment method. The federal government will fully finance the difference between the new minimum payment rates and state rates for primary care services in those years. Medicare uses a prospective payment system to reimburse hospitals for inpatient care based on severity adjusted diagnosis-related groups. The DRA required the initiation of a hospital-acquired condition program, allowing additional payments for certain conditions present at admission. However, if a patient acquired a condition during their stay, no additional payment would be made. Additionally, CMS issued national coverage determinations in 2009 that prohibited Medicare from reimbursing certain services. The DRA in 2009 prohibited Medicare from reimbursing hospitals for preventable medical care errors, while Medicaid was not covered by these policies. CMS issued guidance to align Medicaid payment policies with Medicare's HAC policies, instructing states to avoid payment liability for dual eligible beneficiaries with HACs. ACA requires the Secretary to identify state practices that prohibit certain payments. The ACA requires the Secretary to issue regulations by July 1, 2011, prohibiting federal Medicaid matching payments for health care-acquired conditions to prevent Medicaid beneficiaries from losing access to services. The Secretary must define these conditions in line with Medicare's definition and apply Medicare's regulations to the Medicaid program. The ACA requires the Secretary to issue regulations prohibiting hospital payments for HACs in Medicaid, aligning with Medicare's rules. Medicaid covers outpatient prescription drugs through rebate agreements with manufacturers, exempting purchases by MMCOs. Around 550 pharmaceutical manufacturers participate in Medicaid's drug rebate program. The Medicaid drug rebate program requires manufacturers to report average manufacturer prices and best prices for each prescription drug purchased. This information is used to determine manufacturers' rebate obligations for single source drugs, innovator multiple source drugs, and all other drugs. The Medicaid drug rebate program requires manufacturers to report average manufacturer prices and best prices for each prescription drug purchased. Rebates are determined for drugs still under patent or once covered by patents, with a basic rebate and an additional rebate component. Manufacturers may avoid additional rebate obligations by making alterations to existing products and releasing them as new products. The Medicaid drug rebate program requires manufacturers to report prices for prescription drugs. Manufacturers can avoid additional rebate obligations by creating line-extension products, which are considered new products and have higher prices. Public Health Service Act Section 340B requires discounts for outpatient drugs purchased by certain public health facilities. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) increases Medicaid's rebate percentages for prescription drugs, requiring states to recover additional funds from drug manufacturers. The Secretary can reduce Medicaid payments to states for the increased rebates, estimating the additional amounts. The ACA requires states to recover additional rebate amounts from drug manufacturers for Medicaid prescription drugs. The Secretary can adjust Medicaid payments to recover underestimated rebate amounts, which are considered overpayments and disallowed against states' regular Medicaid draw. Medicaid MCOs are also subject to rebate requirements, with capitation rates adjusted to include these rebates. The ACA requires states to recover additional rebate amounts from drug manufacturers for Medicaid prescription drugs. Medicaid MCOs are subject to additional reporting requirements and can utilize formularies with an exception process. Drugs discounted under 340B are excluded from Medicaid rebate requirements. ACA mandates additional rebates for new drug formulations based on the greater of the basic rebate or AMP multiplied by the highest additional rebate for any strength of the original product. The ACA requires states to recover additional rebate amounts from drug manufacturers for Medicaid prescription drugs. Medicaid MCOs have additional reporting requirements and can use formularies with an exception process. Drugs discounted under 340B are excluded from Medicaid rebate requirements. The total rebate liability for each dosage form and strength of a drug is capped at 100% of the drug's AMP. HCERA clarified that additional rebates for new drug formulations apply to single source or innovator multiple source drugs in oral solid dosage forms. States have the option to cover excluded drugs like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and smoking cessation products, with most states covering them and receiving FFP. The ACA requires states to cover smoking cessation drugs, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines in Medicaid beginning January 1, 2014. Medicare prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans must also include benzodiazepines and barbiturates in their formularies starting January 1, 2013. Beginning January 1, 2014, Medicaid will cover barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and smoking cessation products for most beneficiaries. Medicaid law mandates upper limits on pharmacy payments for prescription drugs to promote generic substitution over brand-name drugs. The federal upper payment limits (FUL) are calculated by CMS based on the average manufacturer price (AMP) of the least costly therapeutic equivalent, set at 250% under the new formula since January 1, 2007. The Drug Rebate Act (DRA) reduced the number of multiple source products rated by the FDA as equivalent from three to two. Manufacturers must report AMP to CMS. National pharmacy associations challenged the legality of DRA's FUL methodology, leading to a court injunction in 2007. This injunction prohibited CMS from setting FULs for Medicaid covered generic drugs based on AMP. The court's 2007 injunction remains in place, prohibiting the use of AMP to calculate Medicaid FULs. MIPPA imposed a moratorium on using AMP to set FULs until October 1, 2009. CMS was authorized to set FULs based on the pre-DRA methodology until September 30, 2009. Published prices were used instead of AMPs, which were higher. CMS lacked authority to use the pre-DRA formula after September 30, 2009. Prior to the expiration of authority to use the pre-DRA formula, CMS issued a list of multiple source drug FULs to establish the federal maximum that states may pay under Medicaid. ACA requires FULs to be set at 175% or more of the weighted average of the most recently reported monthly AMPs. ACA also includes technical changes to the FUL formula such as a smoothing process for average manufacturer prices to reduce volatility. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) impacts drug pricing by introducing various fees and reimbursement mechanisms for wholesalers and retail community pharmacies. It also expands drug pricing disclosure requirements and revises the definition of multiple source drugs. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands drug pricing disclosure requirements to include monthly weighted average AMPs and retail survey prices. Manufacturers must report the total number of units sold and used to calculate the AMP for each covered outpatient drug within 30 days of the end of each month of a rebate period. Section 2503 takes effect the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins at least six months after ACA's enactment, regardless of final regulations. Pharmaceutical drug manufacturers participating in the Medicaid drug rebate program must enter into pharmaceutical pricing agreements under Section 340B of the PHSA. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands drug pricing disclosure requirements to include monthly weighted average AMPs and retail survey prices. Covered entities eligible for 340B discounts include hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), family planning clinics, and others as identified in the PHSA. ACA expands the list of covered entities to include certain children's and free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access and sole community hospitals, and rural referral centers. Covered entities do not receive discounts on inpatient drugs under the 340B program. ACA requires the Secretary to develop systems to improve compliance and program integrity activities for manufacturers and covered entities. The Affordable Care Act expands drug pricing disclosure requirements for covered entities eligible for 340B discounts. Program integrity initiatives aim to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in healthcare services. The Government Accountability Office is required to submit a report on the effectiveness of services provided through 340B covered entities. The federal government and states jointly fund Medicaid and CHIP activities to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. States receive varying federal matching rates for administrative activities, such as 90% for MMIS development and 75% for MFCU operation. Additional funding for program integrity activities was provided in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 established the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) with $75 million in annual appropriations to support state program integrity efforts. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) further enhanced Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP program integrity activities by introducing additional provider screening requirements and creating an integrated data repository for sharing PI data. ACA also mandated a recovery audit contractor (RAC) requirement for Medicaid, similar to Medicare's. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandated a recovery audit contractor (RAC) requirement for Medicaid, similar to Medicare's RAC program. RACs are private organizations that identify and collect improper payments in Medicare's FFS program. The RAC program was made permanent by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, with a nationwide expansion by January 1, 2010. CMS began the national rollout of the permanent RAC program in 19 states in March 2009. The Affordable Care Act mandated states to establish contracts with RACs by December 31, 2010, similar to the Medicare RAC program, to identify and recoup overpayments in state Medicaid plans. States must ensure RACs operate on a contingency basis, have an appeal process, and coordinate with law enforcement agencies. The Secretary may establish exceptions and requirements for the state Medicaid RAC program. The Secretary must exclude providers or individuals from Medicare or Medicaid if convicted of criminal offenses related to healthcare delivery, neglect or abuse of patients, health care fraud, or controlled substances. Exclusions may also occur for prohibited activities like program-related convictions or license revocation. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires states to terminate individuals or entities from Medicaid programs for unpaid overpayments, suspension, exclusion, or affiliation with terminated entities. Changes effective January 1, 2011. (P.L. 111-148: \u00a76502) The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates states to exclude individuals or entities from Medicaid participation if they have unpaid overpayments, are suspended, excluded, or affiliated with terminated entities. This provision took effect on January 1, 2011. As a condition of Medicaid participation, disclosing entities must provide information on individuals with ownership interests of 5% or more. This includes various healthcare providers and organizations. States must exclude individuals or entities from Medicaid if directed by the Secretary and deny payment for services provided. The ACA requires agents submitting Medicaid claims to register with the state and Secretary. States must operate an automated claims processing system called MMIS, approved by the Secretary. MMISs must be compatible with Medicare systems and use uniform coding for timely and accurate processing. Beginning in January 1, 2011, the ACA requires states to collect and report timely and accurate data through their MMISs, which must be compatible with Medicaid Statistical Information Systems (MSIS) data formats. MMIS primarily captures claims data for Medicaid beneficiaries receiving care on a fee-for-service basis, while managed care encounter data is generally not reported. Medicaid managed care organizations are paid a fixed fee regardless of care required, and reporting requirements vary under state contracts. Medicaid agencies do not report managed care data to CMS through MMISs. The ACA requires states to collect and submit managed care data through their MMISs for program integrity, oversight, and administration. MMCOs must also submit necessary data elements as determined by the Secretary. Additionally, the ACA prohibits Medicaid payments to institutions or entities located outside the United States. The ACA requires states to collect and submit managed care data through their MMISs for program integrity, oversight, and administration. Medicaid payments to institutions or entities located outside the United States are prohibited. Starting from the enactment of ACA, states have one year to repay overpayments due to fraud, extending the previous 60-day period. The ACA requires states to repay overpayments due to fraud within one year, with an extension for ongoing judicial or administrative processes. The Secretary must issue regulations for states to identify and correct recurring overpayments. CMS processes Part B Medicare claims to ensure correct payment, including through the national correct coding initiative (NCCI). The ACA requires states to implement pre-payment edits similar to NCCI for Medicaid claims to detect improper coding. Medicaid law does not mandate NCCI edits but states conduct reviews to prevent fraud. The Secretary must identify NCCI methodologies compatible with Medicaid claims by September 1, 2010. The ACA requires states to implement pre-payment edits similar to NCCI for Medicaid claims to detect improper coding. States must incorporate NCCI methodologies into their Medicaid claims processing systems by January 1, 2011, as mandated by P.L. 111-148. States are also required to implement ACA's Medicaid program integrity Sections by the same date. The ACA mandates states to implement pre-payment edits for Medicaid claims by January 1, 2011, incorporating NCCI methodologies. The process for enrolling providers in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP varies, with PPACA requiring similar screening procedures for all programs by January 1, 2011. The Secretary must develop procedures for screening providers, enhanced oversight measures, disclosure requirements, and compliance programs within three years. The Secretary is required to implement screening requirements for providers within three years, based on fraud risk category. Providers and suppliers must undergo licensure checks, with additional requirements like criminal background checks and site visits. New institutional providers pay application fees starting at $500, with waivers for certain Medicaid providers to ensure access to services. The ACA requires providers to establish compliance programs and the Secretary to enhance program integrity initiatives for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. Data matching is being improved through the consolidation of information into an Integrated Data Repository. The ACA mandates the consolidation of data from various healthcare programs into an Integrated Data Repository (IDR), prioritizing Medicare and Medicaid claims. Inspectors General have broad access to agency records to combat waste, fraud, and abuse, including Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment data. The ACA grants HHS/OIG authority to access Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment data for law enforcement and oversight. It also allows obtaining information from providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries for validation of payment claims and evaluation of program efficiency. Beneficiaries participating in health care fraud schemes may face penalties and are required to return overpayments promptly. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) mandated the use of a standard unique identifier for health care providers known as the National Provider Identifier (NPI). All covered entities under HIPAA were required to obtain and use NPIs for claims starting in May 2007. Regulations were issued to mandate the inclusion of NPIs on all Medicare and Medicaid payment claims and enrollment applications by January 1, 2011. Failure to report enrollee encounter data in the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) could result in the withholding of federal matching payments. The Secretary can withhold federal payments if states do not report encounter data to MSIS for Medicaid beneficiaries in a timely manner. HHS/OIG has the authority to exclude healthcare providers from federal programs for false statements. Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) are also imposed for violations. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) authorizes Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) for individuals engaging in improper conduct under federal health care programs, with penalties of up to $10,000 for false claims and additional actions subject to CMPs. ACA also grants the Secretary authority to issue subpoenas for testimonial evidence. The Secretary can issue subpoenas for testimonial evidence and delegate this authority to HHS/OIG and CMS for program exclusion investigations. Increased funding for Medicare and Medicaid Integrity Programs under DRA, with activities to protect against fraud, waste, and abuse. ACA mandates Medicare and Medicaid Integrity Program contractors to combat fraudulent activities. The ACA mandates Medicare and Medicaid Integrity Program contractors to combat fraud, waste, and abuse by providing performance statistics to the Secretary and HHS/OIG. Section 6402 of ACA increased funding for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account, with the majority of funds used for Medicare activities. HCERA further increased HCFAC funds to proposed levels in the House health care reform bill. The Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962) amended the ACA and increased MIP funding by indexing it to the consumer price index. Medicare and Medicaid law requires skilled nursing facilities to ensure residents' well-being through regular inspections for compliance with federal standards, with penalties for deficiencies. The ACA enhances accountability requirements for Medicare and Medicaid certified skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and nursing homes (NFs). Facilities failing to meet standards may face civil penalties, new management installation, or closure. The changes include additional ownership information, staff training programs, and compliance and ethics requirements. The Secretary must improve information on the Medicare Nursing Home Compare website for SNFs and NFs. The ACA mandates reporting of wage and benefit expenditures by skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and nursing homes (NFs) for direct care staff. It also requires redesigning Medicare and Medicaid cost reports to capture this information. Additionally, a new standardized complaint form must be developed for facilities and states to make available to stakeholders and consumers. SNFs and NFs are required to electronically report staffing information to the Secretary. The ACA also calls for a study of CMS's nursing home Five-Star rating system and establishes civil money penalties for non-compliance. The ACA mandates civil money penalties for SNFs and NFs with quality of care issues, requires reporting of planned facility closures, and calls for demonstration projects on culture change and information technology use in facilities. Additionally, it mandates revisions to nurse aide training and evaluation. The ACA mandates revisions to nurse aide training, competency, and evaluation requirements to include dementia and abuse prevention. It also authorizes the Secretary to revise ongoing nurse training to include dementia management and patient abuse prevention. Additionally, under the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration, competitive grants are awarded to states to increase the use of home and community-based long-term care services and eliminate barriers to Medicaid funds for individuals transitioning from institutions to community settings. The ACA mandates revisions to nurse aide training, competency, and evaluation requirements to include dementia and abuse prevention. It also extends the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration to provide quality assurance for home and community-based LTC services. Individuals must meet specific criteria to participate, including residing in an inpatient facility and receiving Medicaid benefits. The MFP Rebalancing Demonstration is extended through September 30, 2016, with updated eligibility rules. The ACA includes a provision that exempts Medicare-covered short-term rehabilitative services from the 90-day period. This provision becomes effective 30 days after enactment. Additionally, the law establishes a Medicaid demonstration to evaluate the impact of bundled payments to hospitals and physicians for integrated care delivery. Bundled payments will be based on the beneficiary's severity of illness, and states can target specific categories of beneficiaries. Participating hospitals must have robust discharge planning programs. The ACA includes a provision exempting Medicare-covered short-term rehabilitative services from the 90-day period. It also establishes a Medicaid demonstration to evaluate bundled payments to hospitals and physicians for integrated care delivery. Participating hospitals must have robust discharge planning programs. The Medicaid Global Payment System Demonstration Project is limited to eight states and is required to begin on January 1, 2012, and end on December 31, 2016. Under this project, payments to hospitals will be based on a prospectively determined payment system. The ACA includes a provision exempting Medicare-covered short-term rehabilitative services from the 90-day period. It also establishes a Medicaid demonstration to evaluate bundled payments to hospitals and physicians for integrated care delivery. Participating hospitals must have robust discharge planning programs. The Medicaid Global Payment System Demonstration Project is limited to eight states and is required to begin on January 1, 2012, and end on December 31, 2016. Under this project, payments to hospitals will be based on a prospectively determined payment system. The project requires payments to an eligible safety net hospital system or network to be adjusted from a FFS payment structure to a global, capitated payment model. The Secretary has the authority to modify or terminate the project during an initial testing period, and will be required to submit an evaluation by the Innovation Center, as well as recommendations for legislative and administrative action, no later than 12 months after the demonstration's completion. The Medicare Shared Savings Program, established under P.L. 111-148, recognizes Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) as groups of providers jointly responsible for the quality and cost of healthcare services for beneficiaries. ACOs must meet certain criteria, including quality measurements, and participate in the shared savings program for a minimum of three years. ACOs consist of various healthcare practitioners in group practice arrangements, networks of practices, and partnerships or joint-venture arrangements. The health reform law establishes the Pediatric Accountable Care Organization demonstration project, allowing pediatric medical providers to be recognized as ACOs and share cost savings with the Medicaid program. ACOs can include pediatric physicians in group practice arrangements, networks of practices, and joint-venture arrangements with hospitals. Incentive payments are provided based on meeting quality performance guidelines. The health reform law establishes the Pediatric Accountable Care Organization demonstration project, allowing pediatric medical providers to be recognized as ACOs and share cost savings with the Medicaid program. Incentive payments are provided based on meeting quality performance guidelines and a minimum annual savings level set by participating states. The Secretary determines the amount of the annual incentive payment, which is a portion of savings with a possible annual cap on total payments. Medicaid does not reimburse for services provided to residents of institutions for mental disease, except for individuals under age 21 receiving inpatient psychiatric care and those age 65 and over. The new law requires hospital-based IMDs with emergency departments to provide a medical screening examination to individuals requesting treatment for a medical condition. If a medical emergency is found, the IMD must stabilize the condition or transfer the individual to another facility. A three-year Medicaid demonstration project will reimburse certain IMDs that are not publicly owned. The new law requires hospital-based IMDs with emergency departments to provide a medical screening examination and stabilize medical emergencies or transfer patients. A Medicaid demonstration project will reimburse eligible IMDs for services provided to Medicaid eligibles aged 21-64 with psychiatric emergency medical conditions. Selected states must establish in-stay review mechanisms, and the Secretary will evaluate the project's impact. $75 million in budget authority is provided for FY2011, available for obligation until December 31, 2015. The evaluation of a demonstration project includes assessing access to mental health services, lengths of stays, emergency room utilization, discharge planning, and impact on mental health service costs. A grant program supports school-based health centers with $50 million annually from FY2010 to FY2013. The Secretary must establish criteria for awarding grants. The Secretary will award grants to school-based health centers serving children eligible for Medicaid or CHIP for facilities and equipment costs only. No funds can be used for personnel or healthcare expenses. Additionally, grants may be awarded to states to incentivize Medicaid beneficiaries to participate in programs promoting healthy lifestyles. These programs must be tailored to Medicaid eligible beneficiaries' needs and have a track record of success in improving health outcomes. The initiative aims to help individuals improve health outcomes by addressing conditions like high cholesterol, blood pressure, weight management, smoking cessation, and diabetes prevention. $100 million in funding is allocated for grants over a five-year period, starting in 2011. The grants will support behavior modification approaches based on evidence-based research, with state initiatives lasting at least three years within the program. States can apply for grants to provide incentives to Medicaid enrollees who complete healthy lifestyle programs. Collaboration with various organizations is permitted. States must conduct outreach campaigns, track beneficiary participation, establish health status targets, evaluate program effectiveness, and report to the Secretary. The Secretary requires states awarded grants to submit semi-annual reports on fund usage, program implementation, quality improvements, and cost savings. States are exempt from a specific SSA requirement. An independent entity will evaluate the initiatives' impact on healthcare utilization and special populations. The Secretary is required to submit reports to Congress on the impact of healthcare incentives on special populations, Medicaid beneficiary satisfaction, and administrative costs. Reports are due before January 1, 2014, and July 1, 2016, with recommendations for legislative and administrative actions. Incentives received will not affect eligibility for federal programs. CHIPRA included provisions to improve care quality under Medicaid and CHIP, including a demonstration to reduce child obesity with $25 million authorized over FY2009-FY2013. P.L. 111-148 allocated $25 million for FY2010-FY2014 for the same purpose. CHIP offers health coverage to low-income uninsured children and pregnant women under certain conditions. States have flexibility in designing their CHIP programs. CHIP is a joint federal-state program that offers health coverage to low-income uninsured children and pregnant women under certain conditions. States have flexibility in designing their CHIP programs, which can be Medicaid expansion, stand-alone programs, or a combined approach. Federal CHIP appropriations are provided through FY2013, with a higher federal share for CHIP compared to Medicaid. The enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) for CHIP lowers the state's share of expenditures by 30%, ranging from 65% to 83% for FY2010. E-FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83%, with beneficiary cost-sharing varying based on program design. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing, and total cost-sharing is capped at 5% of family income. P.L. 111-148 maintains current CHIP structure and provides appropriations through FY2015. If federal CHIP allotments are insufficient, states must establish procedures for coverage. States must ensure that all eligible CHIP children receive coverage through certified plans in state-established exchanges. They will receive a 23 percentage point increase in the CHIP match rate for FY2016 through FY2019, with a cap of 100%. States must maintain income eligibility levels for CHIP through September 30, 2019, to receive payments under Medicaid. Exceptions include enrolling children in CHIP or certified exchange plans when federal CHIP funding is unavailable. States can expand their current income eligibility levels for CHIP children through certified exchange plans. If federal CHIP funding is not available after September 30, 2015, only exchange plans certified by the Secretary will be available. The Secretary must review and certify that these plans offer benefits and cost-sharing comparable to CHIP plans by April 1, 2015. States will be required to establish procedures to ensure that children are screened for Medicaid eligibility and enrolled if eligible. Bonus payments for Medicaid enrollment exceeding baseline levels will not apply after FY2013. Starting January 1, 2014, states must use modified adjusted gross income for CHIP enrollment. Starting January 1, 2014, states must use modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility, premiums, and cost-sharing. States must also classify children as CHIP beneficiaries if they are ineligible for Medicaid due to the elimination of income disregards. The CHIP benefit package and cost-sharing rules will remain unchanged. Additionally, a new Medicaid section from P.L. 111-148 regarding coordination with state health insurance exchanges will apply to CHIP programs. The ACA extends federal CHIP allotments for even-numbered years, aligning them with prior law calculations. States' FY2014 and FY2015 allotments are based on growth factors and prior year spending. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund is also addressed under ACA. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund, established under CHIPRA, receives a separate appropriation to prevent states from federal CHIP fund shortfalls. It provides direct payments to states for CHIP children above target enrollment levels. The fund's authority is extended through FY2015, with appropriations necessary for eligible states. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund, established under CHIPRA, provides direct payments to states for CHIP children above target enrollment levels. The fund's authority is extended through FY2015, with appropriations necessary for eligible states. Additionally, a child health quality measurement initiative was established for both Medicaid and CHIP to improve pediatric quality measurement programs. The program aims to enhance child health quality measures, develop new measures, and expand existing ones. The Secretary must establish criteria for certifying health plans as qualified health plans available through the exchange, including using a uniform enrollment form and standard format for presenting benefits. The ACA requires exchange plans to report pediatric quality measures annually. States can purchase family coverage under a group health plan if cost-effective compared to CHIP coverage. Under Medicaid law, states may implement a premium assistance program for children or families who would otherwise qualify for health insurance coverage. The program must meet CHIP minimum benefits and cost-sharing requirements, and children must not have had group coverage for a specified period. Enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost-effective if it is more affordable than the state providing Medicaid-covered services directly. Under Medicaid law, states must provide \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage for Medicaid-covered services not included in private plans. CHIPRA allows states to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance, meeting specific criteria. States offering premium assistance cannot require CHIP eligible individuals to enroll in an employer's plan. The premium assistance subsidy under CHIPRA provides support for individuals eligible for CHIP and employment-based coverage, allowing them to choose regular CHIP over the premium assistance program. A wrap-around is required for employer plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements. Medicaid expansion CHIP programs follow Medicaid premium assistance provisions. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for child coverage using premium assistance, but a separate test is required for family coverage. The CHIP premium assistance subsidy can cover the entire family's premium if it is more cost-effective than regular CHIP coverage for eligible individuals. P.L. 111-148 extends cost-effectiveness definitions to Medicaid beneficiaries in employer plans, premium assistance under Medicaid, and the new CHIPRA state plan option. \"Targeted low-income child\" is defined for CHIP purposes as uninsured children in families with income above Medicaid levels. The law sets income standards for CHIP eligibility and defines two groups of children ineligible for CHIP. ACA makes exceptions for children of state employees. The federal statute provided yearly total allotments for CHIP, with specific annual amounts appropriated for fiscal years FY1998 through FY2012. For FY2013, two semi-annual allotments were made, along with a one-time appropriation. Children of state employees can enroll in CHIP if their family's income exceeds 5% of the family's income for the year involved. In FY2013, $11.706 billion was added to the half-year amounts, reducing allotments assumed by the CBO. P.L. 111-148 replaced the semi-annual allotments with a $17.406 billion appropriation for FY2013, $19.147 billion for FY2014, and established two semi-annual allotments for FY2015. $15.361 billion was also appropriated for FY2015. Prior law allocated $100 million for outreach and enrollment grants for FY2009. The CHIPRA law allocated $140 million for outreach and enrollment grants from FY2009 through FY2015. Ten percent is for a national campaign, 10% for Native American children, and 80% for state and local governments. Funds target rural areas, underserved populations, and cultural barriers to enrollment. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) provided supplemental appropriations for job preservation, infrastructure investment, energy efficiency, and state and local fiscal stabilization. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) corrected provisions in CHIPRA and ARRA, including adjustments to FY2010 CHIP allotments and clarifications on immigrant coverage in CHIP statute. In 2011, changes were made regarding Medicaid provisions, including the establishment of a Medicaid Improvement Fund. These changes were effective as if they were included in previous acts. The Medicaid program underwent changes in 2011, including the creation of a Medicaid Improvement Fund (MIF) with funding totaling $100 million in FY2014 and $150 million in each FY2015-FY2018. The MIF funds were affected by subsequent legislation, such as the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 and the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) rescinded unobligated MIF funds for FYs 2014 through 2018, with the Secretary required to ensure states develop responsive service systems. Established under the Older Americans Act (OAA), Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) provide information and assistance to elderly persons and individuals with disabilities. They serve as a single point of entry for enrollment in publicly administered long-term care services, including those funded by Medicaid and OAA. The centers aim to allocate resources for services that meet the changing needs of beneficiaries, promote independence, and improve coordination among providers. (P.L. 111-148: \u00a72405) The law appropriates $10 million for FY2010 through FY2014 to carry out ADRC initiatives funded by Medicaid and OAA. Some elderly and disabled individuals, known as dual eligibles, qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid due to limited income and assets. The Secretary has authority to waive Medicaid and Medicare requirements, approve waivers for dual eligibles, and extend waivers for up to five years under the ACA. Medicaid waiver extensions can be granted for up to five years if requested by states, as long as they meet certain conditions. The ACA requires the establishment of a federal coordinated health care office within CMS to integrate benefits and improve care coordination for dual eligible beneficiaries. The ACA aims to provide dual eligible individuals with full access to Medicare and Medicaid benefits, simplify access processes, improve healthcare quality, increase beneficiary satisfaction, eliminate regulatory conflicts, improve care continuity, eliminate cost-shifting, and enhance provider performance. The ACA also assigns specific responsibilities to the federal coordinated health care office within CMS. The ACA assigns specific responsibilities to the federal coordinated health care office within CMS, including providing education and tools for developing programs aligning benefits for duals under Medicare and Medicaid, supporting state efforts in program coordination, consulting on enrollment and benefit policies for dual eligible individuals, studying drug coverage for new full-benefit dual eligibles, and monitoring total annual expenditures and health outcomes for all dual eligibles. The ACA mandates the Secretary to submit a report to Congress containing recommendations for legislation to improve care coordination and benefits for dual eligible individuals. It also includes a federal initiative to collect and report quality of care data for adults enrolled in Medicaid, with the Secretary publishing a core set of adult health quality measures by January 1, 2012. Additionally, by January 1, 2013, the Secretary, in consultation with states, is required to develop further measures. The Secretary, in consultation with states, must develop a standardized format for reporting information based on a core measurement set for Medicaid adults. States are encouraged to voluntarily report data using these measures. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress every three years on efforts to improve coverage duration, care quality, and state reporting of data for Medicaid adults. Within one year of releasing the core set of adult health quality measures, the Secretary must establish a Medicaid Quality Measurement Program. The Secretary must establish a Medicaid Quality Measurement Program (MQMP) to develop innovative evidence-based measures for Medicaid adults. The program includes grants for testing and validating measures, with recommended changes to the core set of adult health quality measures published within two years. Annual state reporting requirements will include state-specific adult health quality measures and information from external quality reviews. The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) was established by CHIPRA to review program policies affecting children's access to benefits. The commission will focus on payment policies, Medicaid and CHIP interactions with healthcare delivery, and other relevant policies. $60 million was appropriated annually for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to support these activities. MACPAC, established by CHIPRA, reviews payment policies, healthcare delivery interactions, and other relevant policies. It submits annual reports to Congress with recommendations on Medicaid and CHIP issues, including an early warning system for provider shortages. P.L. 111-148 makes changes to federal statutes. P.L. 111-148 expands MACPAC's focus to include all Medicaid beneficiaries, not just children. It will review payment policies, eligibility, benefits, quality of care, and interactions between Medicaid and Medicare. MACPAC must report to Congress on regulations affecting access and quality of services. MACPAC is required to report to Congress on Medicaid and CHIP regulations impacting healthcare access, quality, and efficiency. They must also review alternatives to tort litigation under new state demonstration grants, assessing their impact on the programs and beneficiaries. A report with findings and recommendations is due by December 31, 2016. MACPAC can obtain necessary data from state agencies administering Medicaid or CHIP, with state input and data review required for federal matching funds. P.L. 111-148 mandates MACPAC to coordinate with state agencies, review state data, and consider state input in its recommendations. MACPAC and MedPAC must consult with the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office before making recommendations for dually eligible Medicare beneficiaries. MACPAC is responsible for Medicaid policy changes for dual eligibles. $11 million is appropriated for MACPAC in FY2010, with funding from the Treasury and CHIP funds. Funding for subsequent years is not addressed. This provision is effective upon enactment. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare for eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives through programs and facilities on or near reservations and in urban areas. These programs, operated by Indian Tribes or Tribal Organizations, can receive reimbursements from various sources and are designated as the payer of last resort for services provided to eligible individuals. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the payer of last resort for eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives, including services covered by Medicaid and CHIP. A provision aims to clarify payor issues, potentially increasing funding for IHS programs. States can now use \"Express Lane\" agencies for Medicaid enrollment, but IHS, ITs, TOs, and UIOs were not included initially. This exclusion affects American Indians and Alaska Natives. The ACA allows IHS, ITs, TOs, and UIOs to serve as \"Express Lane\" agencies for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment among American Indians and Alaska Natives. They are not charged premiums or cost-sharing for services provided by IHS, ITs, or TOs. This may deter enrollment in private health insurance plans that have premiums or cost-sharing. The ACA allows IHS, ITs, TOs, and UIOs to serve as \"Express Lane\" agencies for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment among American Indians and Alaska Natives without charging premiums or cost-sharing. This facilitates enrollment in private health insurance plans through the exchanges. The Secretary has broad authority under Medicaid and Medicaid law to develop research and demonstration projects for innovative payment and service delivery models to reduce program expenditures while improving care quality. The ACA authorizes the Secretary to develop innovative payment and service delivery models to improve healthcare coordination, quality, and efficiency. Models must target populations with care deficits, including dual eligibles, and may test all-payer payment systems.
