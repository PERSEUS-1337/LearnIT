    "content": "The United States is a global leader in genetic technologies for crops and livestock. GE foods, like the Flavr Savr tomato, were first approved in 1994. Today, 90% of canola, corn, cotton, soybean, and sugarbeet acres in the US are planted with GE varieties. Congress passed the 2016 Act, requiring the USDA to establish a National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard. The 2016 Act mandated the disclosure of bioengineered foods to consumers, aligning the US with over 60 countries with similar labeling requirements. The Standard outlines responsibilities for disclosure, compliance deadlines, and received significant public input during the rulemaking process. USDA finalized the rule in December 2018. The USDA released the final rule for GMO labeling in December 2018, with phased implementation starting in January 2020. Stakeholder reactions have been mixed, with some organizations criticizing the rule for lack of transparency and others supporting it. The Organic Trade Association, Center for Food Safety, Non-GMO Project, and Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy all expressed concerns about the final rule. The final rule for GMO labeling has received mixed reactions from stakeholders. The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy criticized the rule for jeopardizing GMO transparency, while the National Corn Growers Association and American Soybean Association supported it, stating that it provides transparency for consumers. The final rule for GMO labeling requires food containing modified genetic material to be labeled as bioengineered. Food companies can provide additional information if they choose. FMI stated that the rule allows for transparency in food products and gives customers the means to learn more about products with bioengineered ingredients. The report provides background information on agricultural biotechnology, reviews major provisions of the Standard, and concludes with potential considerations for Congress. People have been modifying plants, animals, and other edible organisms for thousands of years. The genetic composition of species changed with the onset of agriculture, accelerated by selective breeding. Traditional and laboratory-based breeding techniques have improved agricultural varieties. Genetic engineering allows for specific genetic manipulation, creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Genetic engineering techniques create genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are regulated by the federal government through the Coordinated Framework. The USDA, FDA, and EPA evaluate biotechnology products under existing statutes for safety and approval. The Standard does not change regulations for food labeling or biotechnology product safety. The federal government regulates food, animal feed additives, and drugs under various acts. The Coordinated Framework focuses on regulating products based on their characteristics rather than the processes used to develop them. FDA and USDA ensure the safety and proper labeling of foods in the US. FDA's 1992 policy states that genetically engineered foods are usually similar to non-GE foods and do not need additional regulation or labeling. The FDA's policy states that genetically engineered foods are usually similar to non-GE foods and do not require additional regulation or labeling. However, GE foods with specific characteristics such as nutritional differences or allergenic sources must be labeled. APHIS reviews GE organisms for plant pest risks, and in 2019 proposed exempting certain GE plants from review based on evidence that genetic engineering does not necessarily pose a plant pest risk. The Standard provides a national standard for disclosure of bioengineered foods to consumers, with a compliance period and deadline set by USDA. The final rule, issued in December 2018, defines key terms and interprets issues from the 2016 Act. The Standard, issued in December 2018, sets terms for disclosure of bioengineered foods by regulated entities like food manufacturers, importers, and retailers. Compliance deadline is January 1, 2022, with a voluntary period since January 1, 2020. AMS estimates implementation costs between $570 million and $3.9 billion in the first year, and $52 million to $118 million annually thereafter. The RIA estimates ongoing costs for regulated entities under the new Standard, with financial benefits mostly attributed to costs avoided. The Standard does not provide benefits to human health or the environment. Key provisions and stakeholder issues are identified in three categories: applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions. Many components of the Standard remain controversial, with public reactions discussed. The Standard addresses specific types of foods and entities involved in food manufacturing, sale, and distribution. Policy discussions on GE food labeling debated issues such as defining bioengineered food and determining compliance. The 2016 Act defined bioengineering in food as genetic material modified through in vitro recombinant DNA techniques not achievable through conventional breeding or found in nature. It did not specify technologies meeting the bioengineering definition. The USDA Standard for bioengineered food labeling requires the use of the term \"bioengineering\" instead of other terms like genetic engineering or GMO. The Standard does not provide explicit definitions for terms like conventional breeding or foods developed through specific technologies. Certain products derived from GE sources do not require labeling based on the 2016 Act definition of bioengineering. The USDA Standard for bioengineered food labeling excludes certain products from labeling requirements, such as animal feed, foods with undetectable modified DNA, and incidental additives. The Standard also exempts food served at restaurants, food from small manufacturers, and foods with low levels of bioengineered substances. The USDA Standard for bioengineered food labeling exempts certain products from disclosure, including food served in restaurants, food from small manufacturers, and food with low levels of bioengineered substances. The USDA Standard for bioengineered food labeling exempts certain products from disclosure, including food served in restaurants, food from small manufacturers, and food with low levels of bioengineered substances. The Standard specifies that food derived from animals consuming bioengineered feed is not considered bioengineered food, and NOP certification is sufficient to claim the absence of bioengineering. The USDA Standard for bioengineered food labeling exempts certain products, including those certified under NOP, from disclosure. NOP certifies products produced without genetic engineering methods, making them exempt from the Standard's requirements. The USDA Standard for bioengineered food labeling includes a List of Bioengineered Foods that identifies foods available in a bioengineered form. Regulated entities must determine if certain substances require disclosure on a case-by-case basis. AMS will update the List annually starting in 2020, with opportunities for public comment. The USDA Standard for bioengineered food labeling includes a List of Bioengineered Foods that will be updated annually starting in 2020. AMS plans to notify the public of the review through the Federal Register and AMS website, with the possibility of updating the List through the federal rulemaking process. Controversies surrounding the Standard's definition of bioengineered food include disagreements on terminology, gene editing, treatment of refined food products, and disclosure thresholds for GE ingredients. Farmer and industry groups support the Standard for providing consistency and transparency, while some advocates of stricter GE labeling find it too permissive. The USDA Standard for bioengineered food labeling has faced controversies over terminology and the definition of bioengineered food. Some stakeholders argue for alternative terms like GMO or genetically engineered, while others support the precise language used in the Standard. The definition does not specify the technologies used to create bioengineered foods, focusing instead on the products of technology. During rulemaking, stakeholders called for the Standard to address foods derived from new genetic technologies that may not meet the bioengineering definition. The lack of clarity on whether these foods must be disclosed under the Standard has led to interpretations excluding foods derived from gene editing. The Standard excludes gene-edited foods from the definition of bioengineering, leading to interpretations that such foods do not require disclosure. Refined food products without detectable modified DNA are also exempt from disclosure requirements. The Standard does not require testing every product for modified genetic material. Instead, regulated entities can demonstrate absence of genetic modification through validated refining processes. Some groups advocate for disclosure of foods derived from genetically engineered plants and animals, while industry groups support voluntary disclosure. The Standard does not mandate disclosure for foods with up to 5% unintentional bioengineered substances per ingredient. The Standard sets a threshold of 5% for bioengineered substances in food ingredients, with different thresholds in other regions like the EU (0.9%) and Australia/New Zealand (1%). Some argue the 5% threshold is too high, while the Standard allows for on-package disclosure of bioengineered foods. Regulated entities must place the disclosure on the label in one of three specified places. Different disclosure options are available, including text, symbol, electronic link, and text message. Small food manufacturers have additional options like a telephone number or website address. The final rule provides details on the implementation of these disclosure options. The final rule provides details on the implementation of disclosure options for bioengineered food labeling. Regulated entities can use text or symbols to disclose bioengineered ingredients in food products, with options for different types of products and languages. Entities may voluntarily place the phrase derived from bioengineering on food packages that do not meet the bioengineered food definition but contain food from bioengineered sources. Exempt entities can use electronic or digital links like QR codes to provide more information to consumers. The 2016 Act and the Standard require electronic or digital link disclosures on packages to be accompanied by specific text and a telephone number for additional information. Providing disclosure through these technologies was a controversial aspect of the Act, leading to a study conducted by USDA to determine consumer access to information while shopping. AMS contracted Deloitte Consulting to identify challenges for consumer access. The report highlighted challenges for consumers accessing information through digital or electronic link disclosures. Deloitte study showed these links may not provide sufficient access. The Standard now includes disclosure via text message as an option. Small food manufacturers can choose from additional options like providing a telephone number or website for more information. The Standard requires disclosures on food packaging, including a telephone number or website for more information. Small packages have abbreviated options like \"Scan for info\" or \"Text [number] for info.\" Very small packages can use preexisting contact information. Retailers must disclose for bulk containers. Voluntary disclosure is allowed in some cases. The Standard allows for voluntary disclosure in some cases, including exempt entities like very small food manufacturers and restaurants. Both regulated and exempt entities can voluntarily disclose foods that do not require mandatory disclosure, such as refined foods derived from bioengineered foods without detectable modified DNA. Critics of the Standard find the disclosure options confusing and uninformative. Industry groups support the flexible disclosure options in the Standard, while critics like the Organic Trade Association (OTA) and the Center for Food Safety (CFS) argue that the options are not meaningful and inhibit access to GE information. OTA criticizes the use of digital/electronic disclosures and the misleading GMO symbol, while CFS finds both disclosure methods unwieldy and time-consuming. The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) had a mixed reaction to the Standard, stating that it does not provide the transparency they were hoping for. The Standard does not require disclosure of highly refined ingredients from GE foods but allows for voluntary disclosure. The Food Marketing Institute and the National Corn Growers Association support the Standard for providing disclosure consistency. The inclusion of a voluntary disclosure option received mixed responses, with some praising it and others expressing concerns about potential confusion. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and the Organic Trade Association (OTA) have raised concerns about voluntary disclosure of genetically engineered products, emphasizing the potential for confusion among consumers. Stakeholders are also focusing on administrative issues of the Standard, such as compliance dates, recordkeeping requirements, and enforceability. The final rule allows phased implementation, with most regulated entities required to comply by January 1, 2020. The final rule on bioengineered foods sets compliance dates for regulated entities, with small food manufacturers having until January 1, 2021 to begin implementation. All entities must fully comply by January 1, 2022. The Standard requires maintaining records for foods on the List of Bioengineered Foods, including both bioengineered and non-bioengineered versions. Potentially regulated entities are not required to maintain records for foods not on the List unless they know the food is bioengineered. Regulated entities must disclose and maintain records of food not yet added to the List of Bioengineered Foods. Records must be kept for two years after sale or distribution. The 2016 Act prohibits failure to disclose but limits enforcement mechanisms. USDA cannot recall food for Standard violations but can enforce compliance through audits, examinations, and public disclosure of findings. The Standard allows for public complaints about violations, AMS may audit records and provide findings, entities can request a hearing, AMS can revise findings if necessary, final investigation results will be made public. Some stakeholders have focused on administrative provisions of the Standard. Some interested groups have commented on the administrative provisions of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard. Advocates of strict GE labeling wanted an early start to mandatory compliance, while industry groups supported a delay to allow time for adjustment. Critics argue that enforcement mechanisms are weak. State-level GE labeling approaches predated the federal 2016 Act, driven by public interest. Private and federal voluntary labeling programs are expected to continue post-implementation. The implementation of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard is expected to continue the labeling of genetically engineered (GE) foods. Despite initial concerns about the safety of GE ingredients, research has shown no difference in health and safety compared to non-GE foods. Some consumers still have reservations about genetic engineering for various reasons. Many consumers have called for GE foods to be easily identifiable through labeling, with surveys showing majority support for labeling. Proposed GE labeling laws at state and federal levels have included both mandatory and voluntary options. The 2016 Act preempted state laws and initiatives, instituting mandatory labeling of GE ingredients in foods. Vermont was the first state to enact a mandatory GE labeling law in 2014, with other states following suit. Michigan and North Dakota urged Congress to pass uniform labeling legislation. Michigan and North Dakota urged Congress to pass a uniform GE labeling standard, with proponents supporting mandatory labeling for consumers' right to know, while opponents argued against it due to lack of scientific basis and potential market disruption. Before the 2016 Act, there were calls for federal legislation to prevent a patchwork of state laws. In 2015, USDA experimented with a voluntary labeling program to address GE labeling interests. In 2015, the USDA used its Process Verified Program to certify the absence of GE ingredients in food products from a single company. Proponents of GE labeling argued that only mandatory labeling would meet consumer demands, while voluntary programs existed before legislation requiring mandatory labels on foods containing GE ingredients. These programs use on-package symbols to indicate the absence of GE ingredients. Food producers and manufacturers can make GE-absence claims by certifying that their products do not contain GE ingredients or by using processes that do not involve genetic engineering, such as certified organic production methods. They can opt into programs like the Non-GMO Project or the USDA National Organic Program to have their processes reviewed and products verified. Once verified, companies can display the Non-GMO Project Verified symbol on their packaging, indicating the absence of GE ingredients. The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) is a voluntary labeling program that certifies agricultural products as organic, excluding genetic engineering. The NOP symbol indicates products produced without genetic engineering. This program differs from the Standard's voluntary disclosure option for bioengineered foods. The voluntary labeling programs provide opportunities to identify foods that do not derive from bioengineering. The Standard does not address GE-absence claims, and FDA retains authority over absence claims. Implementation of the Standard will affect consumers, regulated entities, and AMS. Potential concerns related to applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions may arise. Congress may monitor the Standard's implementation to ensure it meets congressional intent. In the final rule, AMS balanced flexibility for regulated entities and consumer information on bioengineered foods. Stakeholders may question if AMS's implementation aligns with congressional intent, especially regarding the definition of bioengineered. Some groups may call for amendments to include highly refined products and new technologies. AMS will update the List annually. AMS has committed to maintaining and updating the List of bioengineered food products through annual public reviews. Stakeholders may advocate for a more expansive or restrictive listing during these reviews. Consumer familiarity with bioengineered labels and public reaction to disclosure options may influence revisions for providing accessible information. Administrative provisions regarding the extent of disclosure are also under consideration. The potential need for additional federal resources to implement the Standard, estimated at $2 million annually by AMS for various activities such as updating the List, audits, hearings, and training. Congress may need to allocate new resources for continued implementation. The implementation of the new Standard includes assessing costs and administrative overhead for regulated entities. Estimates range from $459 million to nearly $3.6 billion for the first year. Enforcement relies on a public notification mechanism to ensure compliance, with potential for stakeholders to petition Congress for stronger enforcement mechanisms. Interested parties can petition Congress to strengthen enforcement mechanisms for compliance with the new Standard on bioengineered products. Consumer reactions to bioengineered disclosures on food labels are uncertain, with potential for manufacturers to avoid labeling 20% of their products as bioengineered. The implementation of the Standard may impact consumer behavior and influence manufacturers. The implementation of the Standard on bioengineered products may influence manufacturer and retailer demand. Congress may address market shifts and trade issues. AMS does not expect foreign trade impact but is prepared to work with foreign countries on understanding the Standard. Congress may amend labeling requirements for harmonization with trading partners. Agricultural biotechnology involves altering living organisms to improve plants or animals, using tools like genetic engineering. Conventional breeding is the modification of plants and animals through selective breeding, which may include biotechnological practices. Gene editing allows researchers to alter the DNA of organisms. Gene editing is a technique that allows researchers to alter the DNA of organisms to modify genetic characteristics. GE labeling refers to on-package disclosure of genetically engineered foods. Genetic engineering involves manipulating an organism's genes using modern molecular biology techniques. Genetic modification results in heritable improvements in plants or animals through genetic engineering or traditional methods. GMOs are organisms produced through genetic modification. A GMO is an organism produced through genetic modification, involving the insertion of genetic material from another organism using recombinant DNA techniques. Recombinant DNA technology is used to join DNA segments in a cell-free system, allowing the DNA molecule to replicate autonomously or as part of a cellular chromosome. Selective breeding is the deliberate mating of organisms to achieve desired characteristics in offspring. Transgenic organisms result from the insertion of genetic material from another organism. Varieties are subdivisions of species for taxonomic classification, also known as \"cultivars.\" A variety is a genetically distinct group of plants within a species, also known as a \"cultivar.\""
