XLDA is a method that replaces a segment of input text with its translation in another language, improving performance on the XNLI benchmark for 14 languages. It outperforms a naive approach and achieves state-of-the-art results for Greek, Turkish, and Urdu. On the SQuAD question answering task, XLDA provides a 1.0 performance increase on the English evaluation set. It is effective for cross-lingual augmentation, robust to translation quality, and more effective for randomly initialized models than pretrained models. Recent work on pretraining natural language processing systems has led to improvements across various tasks, especially for high-resource languages like English, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French. However, data collection and availability are limited for low-resource languages like Urdu. Even with large language models pretrained on multilingual data, languages like English still have significantly more data available for pretraining. Transfer learning is commonly used to leverage multilingual data for tasks like word embeddings. Recent advancements in natural language processing have led to the development of task-agnostic word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe, which have shown significant improvements in downstream task performance. Multilingual variants of these embeddings have also proven to be effective in enhancing performance across different languages. Contextualized embeddings such as CoVe, ElMo, ULMFit, and GPT have further improved upon static embeddings. BERT, for instance, utilizes a masked language modeling objective and provides multilingual contextual representations through shared sub-word vocabulary and training data. These techniques have been particularly beneficial for low-resource languages with limited data availability. Mrs. Cavendish is in her mother-in-law's room. XLDA is a technique that improves generalization across multiple languages and tasks without needing to align embeddings explicitly. It can be used with pretrained or randomly initialized models by simply replacing a portion of the input. XLDA is a new technique for NLP systems that replaces part of the input with its translation in another language. It improves performance for various languages including English, French, Spanish, and more, leading to state-of-the-art results in some cases. XLDA is a new technique in NLP that enhances performance across languages like English, French, and Spanish. It improves exact-match and F1 scores on the SQuAD dataset. Prior work on multilingual methods involves training word embeddings from monolingual corpora and aligning them using dictionaries or training them jointly from parallel corpora. Techniques like zero-shot translation and adaptation for low-resource languages have shown promising results. The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus uses data from ten genres of English for natural language inference tasks. XNLI is an evaluation set for cross-lingual understanding in 15 languages, including low-resource languages like Swahili and Urdu. Techniques for obtaining cross-lingual word embeddings through unsupervised methods have been developed. XLDA is tested on XNLI, a dataset in 15 languages including low-resource languages like Swahili and Urdu. XLDA outperforms the baseline model and achieves state-of-the-art results on Greek, Turkish, and Urdu. Additionally, experiments are conducted on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) by translating the training set into 4 languages using a neural machine translation system. Translation of this dataset is more complex due to potential span position changes. Unsupervised language models like BERT have been used to improve performance on tasks like XNLI and SQuAD. BERT pretrains deep bidirectional representations and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Back-translation is also used to provide additional data. Back-translation, similar to XLDA, is commonly used with neural machine translation systems to generate additional data. XLDA translates training data from a source language to a target language, resulting in improved performance compared to using only the original source data. This suggests that utilizing signal from multiple languages can benefit training directly, not just as an intermediary for back-translation. The dataset consists of input text sequences x and y with labels z. A new dataset is created by translating x into language l and y into language m using a neural machine translation system. Different settings include monolingual, disjoint multilingual, and cross-lingual. Experiments show that the cross-lingual setting can improve natural language inference and combining monolingual with cross-lingual training yields the best results for question answering. Different subsets of the dataset provide better learning environments. The XNLI dataset was created using 15 different neural machine translation systems to generate cross-lingual datasets for MultiNLI and XLDA tasks. The dataset allows training between examples in different languages, improving learning environments. XLDA only pertains to training, with validation and test settings remaining the same for each of the 15 languages. Future work will explore how this method can be used at test time as well. The primary task under examination in our experiments is the XNLI dataset, which has human-translated validation and test sets. For the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), translation of the training set required special care due to it being a span-extraction problem. Questions, context paragraphs, and gold answers were translated separately, with exact string matching used to determine if the translated answer could still be found in the translated context. 65% of German, 69% of French, 70% of Spanish, and 45% of Russian answer spans were recoverable in this way. To improve answer span recovery in translations, a special symbol was used on both sides of the ground truth span in the English context paragraph. This method helped recover 81% of German, 96% of French, 97% of Spanish, and 96% of Russian answer spans. However, adding this additional data led to worse performance overall, so only the translated examples from the first phase were used for training. The validation and test splits for SQuAD remained in English, reducing the training set size effectively. XLDA improves over the multilingual BERT model in XNLI by leveraging multilingual supervision at train time for a single target language at validation time. Experiments show that replacing one XNLI input with a non-target language always improves performance. These findings are detailed in sections 4.3-4.5. XLDA is effective for models that are not pretrained or as complex as BERT, as demonstrated in experiments outlined in sections 4.3-4.6. XLDA improves over BERT ML fine-tuned for SQuAD by using only two additional parameter vectors. Experiments show that XLDA can enhance even the strongest multilingual systems pretrained on large amounts of data. Hyperparameters and optimization strategies recommended by are used for all experiments, with learning rate warmed up for 10% of total updates and then linearly decayed to zero. The batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs differ for XNLI and SQuAD experiments. XLDA is evaluated on the XNLI dataset with results shown in Figure 2a. The table displays validation scores for different languages and their corresponding augmentors. Color coding indicates relative performance improvements or decreases. The BLEU score of the translation system has little effect on a language's performance as a cross-lingual augmentor. Cross-lingual examples improve over the monolingual approach, showing better validation performance for target languages. XLDA with German improves validation performance by 3.3% to 70.6%. XLDA approaches exist for every language, with Hindi augmented by German showing the strongest improvement. Most languages are effective augmentors except for Urdu, Swahili, Hindi, and Greek. Avoiding the lowest resource languages as augmentors is likely to improve XLDA over the standard approach. XLDA improves over the standard approach, suggesting translating into higher resource languages for training machine translation systems. Lower resource languages are less effective augmentors but benefit greatly from XLDA. Urdu is often the worst augmentor, while Hindi benefits the most from XLDA. XLDA is robust and can significantly improve performance. XLDA benefits Hindi the most and is robust to translation quality. The XNLI dataset was created using 15 different neural machine translation systems with varying BLEU scores. Multilingual BERT was the state-of-the-art at the time, but recent work has surpassed it. Pairwise evaluations show most languages are effective augmentors. Experiments aim to maximize XLDA benefits by using multiple augmenting languages with a greedy approach. The greedy approach in XLDA improves performance on target languages by adding augmentors in decreasing order of effectiveness. Results show consistent improvement over pairwise XLDA and the original standard approach, with a minimum improvement of 2.1%. More data does not always lead to better XLDA performance. In XLDA, more data does not always improve performance. Greedy XLDA shows significant improvements over pairwise XLDA and the standard approach, with gains of up to 4.9% in some languages. The study evaluates XLDA against a disjoint, multilingual setting to assess its effectiveness. The study compares the effectiveness of XLDA in a cross-lingual setting with different augmentors. XLDA shows greater improvement over monolingual settings by incorporating cross-linguality, proving its effectiveness. The benefits of XLDA do not solely come from the multilinguality of the BERT model. In a study comparing XLDA effectiveness in a cross-lingual setting with different augmentors, it is shown to have greater improvement over monolingual settings. XLDA benefits do not solely come from the multilinguality of the BERT model. The LSTM baseline model also sees substantial gains from XLDA, with greedy XLDA being more effective for randomly initialized models than pretrained ones. Performance improvements of up to 3.3% are observed, similar to those seen in BERT ML. XLDA performance was improved by 3.3% over pairwise XLDA alone, with an absolute gain of 5.3% over the standard approach. Greedy XLDA is a powerful technique for pretrained and randomly initialized models. Experiments on SQuAD show varying results based on languages used during training. When using French, Russian, Spanish, and German as cross-lingual augmentors over context input, there is an improvement in performance. XLDA is more effective on randomly initialized models compared to pretrained ones. Adding cross-lingual augmentors to an LSTM baseline also shows improvement. However, translating questions accurately is crucial for question answering in SQuAD. XLDA improves performance on SQuAD by reducing errors made by the baseline BERT model, which often relies on key words from the question in the context. Machine translations of questions are less effective than translating the context accurately. XLDA, cross-lingual data augmentation, is a method that improves NLP systems by replacing a segment of the input text with its translation. This approach helps models like XLDA to consider the semantics of the context instead of relying solely on word-similarity-based matching. XLDA improves NLP systems by replacing input text segments with translations in another language. It boosts performance on all languages in the XNLI dataset by up to 4.8% and achieves state-of-the-art results on 3 languages, including Urdu. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between XLDA and performance on downstream tasks."
