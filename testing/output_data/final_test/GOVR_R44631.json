    "content": "Representative Jeb Hensarling introduced the Financial CHOICE Act (FCA) in June 2016, which was later turned into H.R. 5983. The bill aims to provide regulatory relief to financial firms, investors, and borrowers, with 11 titles that would make significant changes to the financial regulatory system. The committee approved the bill with a vote of 30 to 26 after a markup session on September 13, 2016. The Financial CHOICE Act (FCA) aims to alter the financial regulatory system in response to the Dodd-Frank Act. It includes major policy proposals but is not a comprehensive summary. The bill provides regulatory relief to financial firms, investors, and borrowers, with 11 titles making significant changes. Some Members of Congress argue that excessive regulation from financial reforms like the Dodd-Frank Act has hindered economic growth and limited consumer access to credit. Others believe current regulations have strengthened financial stability and consumer protections. The debate centers on finding a balance between regulatory relief for financial institutions and maintaining market stability. Regulatory relief is a topic of debate, with some arguing that current regulations hinder economic growth and consumer access to credit, while others believe regulations strengthen financial stability and consumer protections. The focus is on finding a balance between providing relief for financial institutions and maintaining market stability. Regulatory reforms post-financial crisis aimed to ensure safe lending practices and protect consumers, with some regulations applying to all lenders and others to specific types. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced regulatory changes for lenders, focusing on prudential regulation for financial stability and consumer protection. Safety and soundness regulation aims to prevent bank failures, while consumer protection ensures compliance with laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created to emphasize consumer protection. Nonbank lenders are not subject to safety and soundness regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred authorities to the CFPB for consumer protection in banks and nonbanks. Recent rulemakings have led to debates in Congress over regulatory burden on lenders impacting economic growth and credit access. The FCA proposes regulatory relief for lenders, especially community banks. The FCA proposes regulatory relief provisions, including modifications or repeals of rules from the Dodd-Frank Act, targeting prudential regulation and consumer protection. For example, the FCA would repeal the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from proprietary trading of risky assets and certain relationships with risky investment funds. The FCA proposes regulatory relief provisions, including modifications or repeals of rules from the Dodd-Frank Act. This includes repealing the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from trading risky assets and certain relationships with investment funds. The statute carves out exemptions for legitimate trading activities, such as risk-mitigating hedging and market-making. It also modifies supervision of lenders for safety and soundness, establishing timelines for bank examinations and an ombudsman to investigate complaints. The FCA proposes regulatory relief provisions, including allowing banks to appeal exam results to an ombudsman or judge without deferring to the supervisor's opinions. It also reduces regulatory compliance costs by allowing certain lenders to report less information every other quarter and provides relief from consumer protection regulations. The FCA proposes regulatory relief provisions, including repealing the Durbin Amendment and allowing states to opt out of CFPB rules on payday loans. Prudential regulation aims to strengthen banks after the financial crisis by assessing their ability to meet obligations, asset quality, and capital levels. Capital, the difference between assets and liabilities, indicates a bank's ability to absorb losses. The capital ratio of a bank is crucial, with two main categories: leverage ratio and risk-weighted asset ratio. Failure to meet these ratios can lead to regulatory action, including closure. Leverage ratio treats all assets equally, while risk-weighted ratio assigns a risk weight to each asset based on its likelihood of losing value. This requires banks to hold more capital for riskier assets. Basel III is a proposed comprehensive reform for capital ratios in banks, set by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision. Banks must hold varying levels of capital based on size and complexity, with larger banks required to hold more. Most banks need to meet a 4% leverage ratio, while large banks are subject to a supplementary leverage ratio. Large banks are subject to a supplementary leverage ratio ranging from 3% to 6% depending on their size and bank charter. This ratio considers off-balance sheet assets and exposures. Risk-weighted ratios vary based on bank size and capital quality, with requirements ranging from 4.5% to 8%. Additionally, banks must maintain a 2.5% capital conservation buffer. Global systemically important banks face a capital surcharge of 1% to. Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) may face a capital surcharge of up to 4.5% and a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. Economists argue for both risk-weighted and leverage ratios to complement each other in assessing bank risk. Risk weighting is crucial to prevent banks from favoring riskier assets due to capital costs, although it may not always accurately reflect asset risk levels. The leverage ratio acts as a backstop to prevent banks from holding insufficient capital, especially when risk-weighted capital ratios incentivize maximizing risk. Critics argue that the risk-weighted system is overly complex and benefits larger banks, leading to poorly calibrated risk weights that encourage investments in risky assets. This can distort funding sources and exacerbate downturns. Critics argue that the risk-weighted system for banks can lead to a distortion in credit allocation. They suggest eliminating this system in favor of a higher leverage ratio to ensure banks hold more capital. This debate also raises questions about the role of capital in bank regulation, with some advocating for a simpler approach focused on sufficient capital levels, while others support various prudential regulations like liquidity requirements and asset concentration guidelines. Under the FCA, banking organizations with high ratings could opt for a higher 10% leverage ratio, exempting them from certain regulations like risk-weighted capital ratios, liquidity requirements, and merger restrictions. Regulators could still conduct stress tests on entities choosing this approach but would have limited authority to adjust their capital levels. Under the FCA, banks can opt for a higher 10% leverage ratio to receive relief from certain regulations, including risk-weighted ratios. Larger banks with assets between $50 billion to $700 billion could benefit from this exemption. Securities laws are overseen by the SEC and apply to entities in the securities markets and issuing companies. Securities laws overseen by the SEC aim to ensure investor protection and facilitate capital formation, which can sometimes conflict. Derivatives markets are regulated by the CFTC and SEC based on the type of derivatives traded. The Dodd-Frank Act established new regulations for derivatives following vulnerabilities exposed during the financial crisis. Stringent securities regulation may better protect investors but could hinder capital raising, while lenient regulation may make it easier to raise capital but leave investors more vulnerable to fraud. Some believe current securities regulation is overly burdensome and stifling capital formation. Some believe securities regulation is too burdensome, stifling capital formation. The FCA includes provisions to ease restrictions on eligible investors, such as accredited investors for private placements exempt from SEC registration. The FCA would expand the definition of accredited investors to include licensed securities industry professionals and individuals with specific educational or job experiences. This provision is similar to H.R. 2187 and aims to relax regulatory requirements for professionals in the securities industry, such as private equity advisers and investment fund researchers. The FCA aims to repeal the DOL rule on fiduciary responsibility for financial professionals, requiring the SEC to establish a uniform standard for broker-dealers and investment advisers. The SEC is currently working on this standard, while the DOL rule broadens the fiduciary obligation under ERISA for retirement and benefit plans. The SEC must report to Congress on potential harm to retail investors and alternative approaches before conducting rulemaking. Provisions in the FCA relax regulatory requirements for firms issuing capital or securities, including emerging growth companies and firms subject to conflict mineral disclosures. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to include commentary on internal controls in annual reports. The FCA proposes to expand exemptions from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for public companies with less than $250 million in public float and depository institutions with less than $1 billion in assets. This aims to reduce compliance costs, especially for firms with more than $75 million in public float. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses regulations for derivatives markets, specifically cross-border swaps. It raises questions about the CFTC's authority to regulate swaps extending beyond U.S. borders. The Act requires recognition of foreign regulators' clearinghouses and exchanges to streamline trade reporting across jurisdictions. The FCA requires the CFTC to establish criteria for foreign jurisdictions regulations within one year. If not done in 18 months, the eight largest foreign swaps jurisdictions would be considered comparable and comprehensive. This bill substitutes foreign swaps requirements for U.S. requirements for trades involving non-U.S. persons. Federal policy does not regulate executive compensation levels but requires disclosure by publicly-listed companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to disclose executive compensation details, including conducting a shareholder vote on pay every three years and disclosing CEO-worker pay ratios. Additionally, there are rules aimed at prohibiting incentive-based compensation that encourages certain behaviors. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates public companies to disclose executive compensation details and prohibits incentive-based compensation that encourages risky behavior at financial institutions with over $1 billion in assets. Proposed rules in 2016 aimed to implement this requirement, with proponents advocating for greater transparency to prevent excessive pay arrangements. Critics argue that current disclosure requirements are costly and do not provide useful information for maximizing shareholder return. Compliance challenges and costs are cited, especially for large multinational firms with decentralized payroll systems. The debate centers on whether high executive compensation is justified. The FCA proposes changes to executive compensation regulations, including eliminating mandatory shareholder votes on pay, repealing the CEO-worker pay ratio disclosure requirement, and removing the incentive compensation mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act. The debate continues on whether high executive pay reflects productivity or governance issues. The \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) policy issue arose during the 2008 financial crisis when large firms like Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and AIG nearly collapsed. Government assistance was provided to prevent insolvency, except for Lehman Brothers. TBTF firms are those whose failure could disrupt the financial system. This perception is based on their size or interconnectedness, leading to moral hazard as creditors expect government protection from losses. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed the \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) issue by implementing enhanced regulatory measures, mainly overseen by the Federal Reserve, to hold systemically important firms to stricter prudential standards. This includes capital standards, liquidity standards, counterparty limits, stress tests, and risk-management standards. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed enhanced prudential regulation on banks, nonbank financial firms, and financial market utilities. Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in assets are automatically subject to enhanced regulation. Additional capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements are also imposed on the largest U.S. BHCs through U.S. regulations implementing Basel III. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed enhanced prudential regulation on banks, nonbank financial firms, and financial market utilities, including regulations implementing Basel III. Nonbank financial firms and FMUs face enhanced regulation if designated as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Eight FMUs and four nonbank financial firms, including three insurance companies, have been designated. Some firms have had their designations removed or overturned. The Act also included provisions to limit the size of financial firms and restrict emergency authority to prevent future bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act narrowed emergency authority to prevent bailouts and extended access to the Fed's discount window to FMUs. Critics question if the TBTF problem has been solved as large firms continue to grow. Debate persists on the best policy approach to address excessive risk. Debate continues on the best policy approach to address excessive risk-taking from moral hazard, whether through enhanced prudential regulation or market discipline. Critics fear that enhanced regulation may undermine market discipline, leading to increased risk-taking by designated firms. Proponents question the credibility of letting firms fail as a deterrent. Proponents of enhanced regulation question the credibility of letting firms fail as a deterrent, citing the failure of market discipline during the 2008 financial crisis. They argue that systemic risk, which investors do not internalize, may still be too high even with perfect market discipline. The concept of prudential regulation of nonbank SIFIs raises policy questions regarding enhanced regulation, the designation process, insurance and systemic risk, and the source of systemic risk for nonbanks. The Federal Reserve's ability to tailor regulation to match nonbanks' business models and risks is questioned, as well as the transparency and appropriateness of FSOC's designation process. The role of insurance in systemic risk and whether firm size or activities are the main source of systemic risk for nonbanks are also key considerations. The FCA would repeal provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act related to TBTF and FSOC's ability to designate nonbank financial firms as SIFIs. Currently designated SIFIs would no longer be subject to enhanced regulation, except for large BHCs. Regulatory exemptions under the 10% leverage ratio would exempt banks from enhanced regulations, except for stress tests. The \"Hotel California\" provision prohibiting a BHC from debanking would also be repealed. The FCA would repeal the \"Hotel California\" provision prohibiting a BHC from debanking and eliminate various Dodd-Frank Act provisions related to financial firm size restrictions and emergency authorities. The impact on the riskiness of large financial firms and the financial system depends on the balance between market discipline and reduced prudential regulation. The financial crisis highlighted the need for allowing large financial firms to fail without causing instability. The Dodd-Frank Act created a special resolution regime to address concerns about resolving failing non-bank financial firms. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) as a resolution regime for failing financial firms to prevent financial instability. OLA is an administrative forum, not judicial, and can provide resources to failing firms if needed. Assessments on surviving firms would recoup any payments made by the FDIC. Access to OLA is not limited to designated SIFIs and has not been utilized yet. The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) is an administrative resolution regime for failing financial firms, allowing the FDIC to resolve nonbank financial institutions outside of the Bankruptcy Code. This includes financial firms excluding depository institutions, providing an alternative to judicial bankruptcy proceedings. Advocates of the \"Lehman Moment\" explanation of the financial crisis point to specific characteristics of financial markets and the Bankruptcy Code at the time that may have exacerbated financial instability. They argue that the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy announcement was a shock to confidence due to the assumption that Lehman was \"too big to fail.\" Additionally, the lengthy judicial bankruptcy process compared to an administrative agency resolution process contributed to financial uncertainty. Treatment of financial contracts and the continuous need for financial intermediaries to access credit were also cited as factors. Critics of the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) argue that it promotes bailouts and government intervention in large financial institutions, while supporters believe that private financing may not be sufficient during a firm's bankruptcy. They argue that government financing is necessary for an orderly liquidation process. Critics of the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) argue that government financing is necessary for an orderly liquidation process, as private financing may not be sufficient during a firm's bankruptcy. The FDIC has developed operational capabilities to carry out a resolution if needed, but concerns remain about its ability to resolve complex financial institutions. OLA cannot bail out failing firms but could potentially bail out a firm's creditors by making them whole. Critics worry that the FDIC's authority to treat similarly situated creditors differently during a resolution could lead to government picking winners and losers, causing uncertainty and incentivizing creditors to demand immediate repayment, hastening insolvency. Proponents argue that the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) can reduce financial instability, but it may increase uncertainty compared to the bankruptcy process. The FDIC addresses concerns by expecting consistency in creditor treatment. The FDIC aims to maintain consistency in creditor treatment during the resolution process. Proponents of the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) highlight its potential advantages in promoting financial stability, such as quicker resolution compared to bankruptcy and a statutory focus on financial stability. The Financial CHOICE Act (FCA) proposes to repeal Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and establish a new chapter in the Bankruptcy Code for handling the failure of large financial firms with over $50 billion in assets. This would shift the resolution process to the courts instead of regulatory agencies, aiming to avoid bailouts and maintain consistency in creditor treatment. Critics argue against FDIC guarantees to counterparties, calling it a bailout of firm creditors. The Financial CHOICE Act proposes changes to the Bankruptcy Code for large financial firms, aiming to avoid bailouts and maintain creditor treatment consistency. The new chapter would offer resolution options like liquidation, reorganization, or recapitalization, ensuring the plan benefits creditors and does not threaten financial stability. Financial regulators' independence from political influence is crucial for effective policy outcomes. The Financial CHOICE Act proposes changes to the Bankruptcy Code for large financial firms to avoid bailouts and maintain creditor treatment consistency. The act aims to make policymaking more technical and less political, but independence may reduce accountability to elected officials. Each financial regulator has unique structural attributes that influence policy outcomes. The FCA raises issues related to independence and accountability, with leadership structure and financing being key elements. Currently, financial regulatory agencies have different leadership structures, with some led by a single leader and others by multimember boards. Boards with diverse membership may lead to more durable policy decisions, while individual leadership may result in faster decision-making. The Financial Choice Act (FCA) aims to convert financial regulatory agencies with single leaders to multimember commissions, enhancing independence from the President and Congress. This change would introduce diverse membership and potentially lead to more durable policy decisions. The Financial Choice Act proposes converting financial regulatory agencies to multimember commissions with staggered, nonrenewable terms. Members would be nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and limited to three from the same party. Board members could be removed for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Nominees must have expertise and cannot have outside employment during their service. The FCA also includes changes to the heads of the OCC and CFPB, as well as increasing the NCUA board's membership. Congress can influence agency size, scope, priorities, and activities through annual appropriations and reauthorization legislation. The CFTC and SEC are financial regulators funded through appropriations and subject to periodic reauthorizations. Other regulators have more autonomy in budgeting and generate income from fees. The CFTC and CFPB do not raise their own revenues, with funding coming from Treasury and the Federal Reserve. Congress evaluates agency performance through appropriations and authorization processes. Congress can influence agencies by reallocating resources or placing limitations on funds to reflect priorities. This control increases accountability and reduces agency independence. The Financial Choice Act would bring more financial regulators into the appropriations process, except for the Fed's monetary policy spending. The Financial Choice Act proposes changes to the funding and structure of financial regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The CFPB would no longer receive transfers from the Federal Reserve, leading to funding changes, while the FSOC would see modifications in agency representation and responsibilities. The Financial Choice Act proposes changes to financial regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). It would repeal FSOC's ability to rescind CFPB rules in limited cases and subject FSOC to the Government Sunshine Act. The Act would reauthorize the SEC through FY2021 with a reduced budget and eliminate the SEC's Reserve Fund. Additionally, it would eliminate the Office of Financial Research (OFR), which supports FSOC in gathering data and monitoring financial markets. The Financial Choice Act proposes changes to financial regulatory agencies, including the repeal of FSOC's ability to rescind CFPB rules and the elimination of the Office of Financial Research (OFR). The OFR issues reports and research papers on financial-stability topics, funded by assessments on SIFIs. If the FCA repealed FSOC's designation authority, it would remove a key duty supported by the OFR. The FCA would merge the Federal Insurance Office and the position of independent insurance expert into the Office of Independent Insurance Advocate within Treasury, with the head appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The Financial Choice Act proposes changes to financial regulatory agencies, including the repeal of FSOC's ability to rescind CFPB rules and the elimination of the Office of Financial Research (OFR). The FCA would merge the Federal Insurance Office and the position of independent insurance expert into the Office of Independent Insurance Advocate within Treasury, with the head appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The CFPB, established under the Dodd-Frank Act, faces potential revisions under the FCA due to concerns about its independence and accountability. Critics argue for structural changes, while supporters highlight transparency measures like biannual congressional testimony and funding caps. The Financial Choice Act proposes changes to financial regulatory agencies, including modifying the CFPB's operations by replacing the director with a five-member commission and subjecting it to the traditional appropriations process. It would rename the CFPB as the Consumer Financial Opportunity Commission (CFOC) and alter its mandate to focus on increasing competition and enhancing consumer choice. Other modifications include repealing the CFPB's authority to deem certain acts as \"abusive\" and raising the supervisory threshold for depositories. The Financial Choice Act proposes changes to financial regulatory agencies, including modifying the CFPB's operations and raising the supervisory threshold for depositories. The Federal Reserve's independence from Congress and the Administration is highlighted, with proposed provisions in the FCA to expand GAO's powers for evaluating Fed policy decisions. The Financial Choice Act proposes changes to financial regulatory agencies, including expanding GAO's powers to evaluate Fed policy decisions and requiring the Fed to follow a Directive Policy Rule for setting monetary policy. It also includes provisions to change the voting membership of the Federal Open Market Committee. The FCA includes provisions from the CFTC reauthorization bill, addressing issues like commission authority, internal controls, subpoenas, notice and comment process, and judicial review of agency rules. Federal agencies use rulemaking to implement public policy, with rules issued under inherent authority or legislative requirements. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 establishes rulemaking requirements for federal agencies, including independent regulatory agencies. Three proposals in the FCA aim to modify regulator discretion and accountability in the rulemaking process, including requiring cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Cost-benefit analysis involves examining the total costs and benefits of implementing a proposed rule. Regulatory agencies are often mandated to conduct CBA by statute or executive order. Financial regulators, classified as independent regulatory agencies, are not required to quantify and evaluate total economic costs and benefits like other agencies. They face narrow analysis requirements, such as the impact on small businesses or compliance burdens, with the discretion to determine the parameters of a cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, financial regulators are exempt from Executive Order 12866, which establishes analytical principles for federal agencies. Financial regulators are exempt from Executive Order 12866, which sets analytical principles for federal cost-benefit analysis (CBA). There is a debate on whether financial regulators should be legally required to perform certain types of CBAs subject to review, which could impact their independence and accountability. One argument is that they should not be bound by rigid structures, especially in quantifying costs and benefits. Financial regulators face challenges in quantifying the effects of financial regulation due to uncertainties in causal assumptions and data accuracy. Some argue that increasing rulemaking requirements could hinder regulatory effectiveness, while others suggest imposing stricter cost-benefit analysis requirements on financial regulators. Some argue for stricter cost-benefit analysis requirements for financial regulators to discipline agencies in rule implementation and assess regulation desirability. The FCA would mandate financial regulators to conduct CBA, including analyzing necessity, efficacy, benefits, and costs of rules. The Financial Choice Act (FCA) would require financial regulators to conduct cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for regulations, assessing direct and indirect costs and benefits, available alternatives, burden distribution, uncertainty in assumptions, and predicted market changes. The bill would restrict rule implementation based on CBA findings, prohibiting final rules with greater costs than benefits unless Congress grants a waiver. Adversely affected parties could challenge regulations in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Financial Choice Act (FCA) mandates financial regulators to conduct cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for regulations, including retrospective analysis. Adversely affected parties can challenge regulations in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to invalidate final rules issued by federal agencies through expedited procedures. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) provides fast-track procedures for Congress to consider legislation striking down agency rules. These procedures limit debate and amendment on a joint resolution disapproving a rule, ensuring a simple majority vote. If enacted, the rule in question \"shall not take effect (or continue)\" and a new rule in the same form cannot be issued without specific authorization. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) prohibits judicial review of any \"determination, finding, action, or omission under\" the act. Since 1996, Congress has considered several CRA joint resolutions of disapproval, successfully overturning one agency final rule related to workplace ergonomics standards. The CRA was enacted in response to concerns about Congress's ability to control administrative rules, as delegated power to agencies increased. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) was created to provide Congress with more information about federal agency rulemaking processes and an expedited way to overturn rules. Despite concerns about administrative rules, there is a bipartisan consensus that the CRA has not been effective as an oversight tool. The de facto supermajority vote required for a CRA resolution of disapproval is a key reason why it has only overturned one agency rule in 20 years. The CRA disapproval process requires a two-thirds supermajority to override a presidential veto, making it difficult for Congress to enact disapproval resolutions. This imbalance tilts power towards the President, rendering the CRA largely ineffective as an oversight mechanism. Various proposals have been introduced to restructure the CRA disapproval process. Several proposals have been introduced to restructure the CRA disapproval mechanism, shifting from a resolution of disapproval to a resolution of approval. The REINS Act (H.R. 427) would require Congress to approve major rules before they could become effective, aiming to give Congress more power in rulemaking. The Financial CHOICE Act (FCA) proposes amending the CRA to require congressional approval for major financial agency rules. This would increase accountability to Congress and reduce independence for financial regulators. The FCA defines \"federal financial agency\" and mandates reporting requirements to Congress for rule issuance. Major financial agency rules would need a joint resolution of approval for fast-track consideration. The Financial CHOICE Act (FCA) proposes amending the CRA to require congressional approval for major financial agency rules. Major rules would not take effect without a joint resolution of approval within 70 session days. The FCA allows for a 90-day period for a major financial rule to take effect without approval in cases of emergency or national security. The Financial CHOICE Act (FCA) proposes amending the CRA to require congressional approval for major financial agency rules. The FCA would allow a court to review if a financial agency has met requirements for a final rule. It includes a provision changing how agency interpretations of the law are reviewed. The current legal framework involves courts reviewing agency interpretations of the law based on Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. The Chevron test, established by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., limits the role of courts in reviewing agency interpretations of law. It requires courts to enforce Congress's clear intent and defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes if reasonable. This allows federal agencies, not courts, to resolve ambiguities in implementing their authority delegated by Congress. The Supreme Court established the Chevron two-step test for reviewing agency statutory interpretations. The test requires courts to determine if Congress has directly spoken on the issue, and if not, defer to the agency's interpretation of ambiguous statutes. This limits the court's role in interpreting laws and allows agencies to implement their authority effectively. In Chevron, the Supreme Court outlined reasons for favoring a restrained judicial role in reviewing agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. Congress delegates authority to clarify ambiguity to agencies, and courts should respect this by granting agencies the ability to interpret statutes they administer. This approach limits the court's policy-making role in implementing laws. The Supreme Court in Chevron emphasized that agencies and legislators are best suited to interpret statutory ambiguity and make policy decisions due to their technical expertise and accountability through the democratic process. Courts should defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes to respect Congress's delegation of authority. Administrative agencies are politically accountable through the democratic process. Courts should defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes to respect Congress's delegation of authority. Judicial deference under Chevron has allowed agencies to expand their authority, risking excessive power. A recalibration of judicial review of administrative rulemakings is argued to be necessary to ensure laws are interpreted as intended by Congress and hold agencies accountable. This could lead to courts engaging more in policymaking decisions and increase legal challenges to agency rulemakings, potentially delaying new regulations and increasing costs. The Financial Choice Act would overturn Chevron's policy of judicial deference to certain federal financial regulators. The Financial Choice Act aims to change judicial review of administrative rulemakings by requiring de novo review instead of deferring to agency interpretations. This could lead to more legal challenges and delays in new regulations. The Financial Choice Act aims to change judicial review of administrative rulemakings by prohibiting courts from considering agency expertise. This could give courts more power to overturn agency interpretations. Federal financial agencies also rely on their enforcement authority, which can be affected by their statutory jurisdiction and available resources. The Financial Choice Act proposes changes to federal financial regulators' enforcement powers, aiming to balance consumer protection with the ability of law-abiding institutions to operate in the market. It includes increasing civil penalties for violations and limiting certain SEC and CFTC enforcement powers. The Financial Choice Act proposes changes to federal financial regulators' enforcement powers, including increasing civil penalties for violations and limiting certain SEC and CFTC enforcement powers. The FCA may also prohibit individuals from serving as officers or directors of securities issuers, impacting enforcement resources indirectly."
