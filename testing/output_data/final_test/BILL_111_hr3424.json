The amendment disallows deductions for excess non-taxed reinsurance premiums paid to affiliates by a covered insurance company, limiting the deduction to the premium limitation and qualified ceding commissions. The term 'affiliated non-taxed reinsurance premium' refers to reinsurance premiums paid to an affiliated corporation that are not subpart F income or subject to tax. Premiums paid to affiliates by a covered insurance company are reduced by any reinsurance amounts. The term 'premium limitation' refers to the maximum amount of reinsurance premiums that can be deducted by a covered insurance company in a taxable year, with rules similar to section 163(j)(5)(B) applying to determine the extent of taxation. The premium limitation for a covered insurance company in a taxable year is the excess of gross premiums written on insurance contracts multiplied by the industry fraction, minus reinsurance premiums paid that are not affiliated non-taxed reinsurance premiums. This limitation cannot be less than zero. The industry fraction is determined by the Secretary based on aggregate data from insurance companies' annual statements. It is the ratio of reinsurance premiums paid to non-affiliated corporations to gross premiums written by covered insurance companies in the second preceding calendar year. The industry fraction is determined by the Secretary based on aggregate data from insurance companies' annual statements. It is the ratio of reinsurance premiums paid to non-affiliated corporations to gross premiums written by covered insurance companies in the second preceding calendar year. The Secretary determines a separate industry fraction for each line of business, and this fraction is applied separately to each line of business for calculating qualified ceding commission. The term 'qualified ceding commission' refers to ceding commissions paid by a covered insurance company for affiliated non-taxed reinsurance premiums, exceeding the premium limitation for the taxable year. The specified affiliated corporation can elect to treat reinsurance income as effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States and be treated as carrying on an insurance business within the United States. A specified affiliated corporation, for tax purposes, is a foreign corporation that would qualify as a domestic corporation and waives benefits under US treaties for specified reinsurance income. The specified reinsurance income refers to reinsurance premiums received by a specified affiliated corporation, subject to requirements set by the Secretary to ensure proper tax determination and payment. The specified reinsurance income includes premiums received directly or indirectly from covered insurance companies by an affiliated corporation, along with net investment income allocable to reinsurance premiums under a specific election. Rules regarding the election must be followed. The election under clause (i) must be made as per the Secretary's instructions and applies to the taxable year it is made for and subsequent years unless revoked with the Secretary's consent. A covered insurance company is defined as any insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 831. All domestic members of a controlled group of corporations with a covered insurance company are treated as one corporation. Affiliation is determined if both corporations are part of the same controlled group, with a threshold of 'more than 25 percent' instead of 'at least 80 percent' as per section 1563. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section, including the treatment of reinsurance ceded by a non-affiliated corporation to a covered insurance company. Reinsurance will be accounted for in the same manner as premiums written by the covered insurance company. The amendment made by this section applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2009."
