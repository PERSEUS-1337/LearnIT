Section 317(k) of the Public Health Service Act is amended to allow immunization grantees to use funds for providing recommended vaccines to children aged 0 to 35 months through WIC clinics, coordinating care or immunization services, and paying for an immunization coordinator's salary. Grantees with funding for an immunization information system must allow all participating clinics access to the system. The projects under this section aim to provide access to appropriate immunization services for children aged 0 to 35 months. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State administrators of the program will consult with the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture. Activities will target areas with the greatest immunization needs in this age group. The term 'immunization information system' refers to a confidential system for tracking immunization records. An immunization information system is a confidential computerized system that collects vaccination data, generates reminders, and assesses coverage. An immunization coordinator coordinates immunization activities and referrals to providers.
