    "content": "The \"Fair Claims Act\" is the short title of the Act. Section 14010 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 is amended to address civil rights complaints against the Department of Agriculture. The \"Fair Claims Act\" requires annual reports on unresolved claims and submissions to Senators and Members of Congress regarding constituents. The \"Fair Claims Act\" mandates annual reports on unresolved civil rights claims exceeding 270 days, with details on the number of claims for each 60-day interval. The Secretary must provide claimants with an estimated resolution time after the 270-day period. The \"Fair Claims Act\" requires the Secretary to accept or deny all formal civil rights complaints within 180 days of receipt. If a complaint is not accepted, the complainant can appeal within 15 days through the Assistant Secretary for Administration of the Department of Agriculture. The Assistant Secretary for Administration must respond within 45 days to appeals filed regarding formal complaints. The Secretary is required to resolve all civil rights claims within 270 days, except in cases where alternative dispute resolution has been pursued. The 270-day period for resolving civil rights claims does not begin until the claimant terminates the alternative dispute resolution process in writing to the Department of Agriculture and the Department acknowledges receipt of the claim or the Postal Service verifies delivery by registered mail. During a pending criminal investigation, the 270-day period for resolving civil rights claims does not start until the investigation concludes. If a claim is not resolved within the 270-day period, the Secretary must explain the delay and the remaining process required for resolution. The resolution of a civil rights claim includes a description of necessary items for review and an estimated time for resolution. Any delay explanation should not include confidential information. Claimants can appeal findings of discrimination. The claimant can appeal findings of discrimination to the Assistant Secretary for Administration, who must respond within 180 days with an acceptance or denial. The Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture must conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with the section."
