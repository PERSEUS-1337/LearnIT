    "content": "In early 2005, data brokers like LexisNexis and ChoicePoint experienced security breaches, leading to calls for tighter regulation of the industry. These data brokers operate without much oversight and provide personal information for background checks to businesses and criminal investigators. The internet has allowed these companies to quickly grow by offering such services. The growth of data brokers like ChoicePoint and LexisNexis has been fueled by the need for accurate identification of individuals, especially after the events of September 11, 2001. These companies provide personal information to businesses and law enforcement, bypassing legal restrictions on government agencies. The Privacy Act limits the government's collection and dissemination of personal information on American citizens. Data brokers collect and sell personal information from public records and credit reporting agencies, including data like Social Security numbers. They are largely unregulated by state and federal laws, allowing companies and government agencies to purchase individuals' information freely. Data brokers gather personal information, including Social Security numbers, mostly through online transactions. Criminals exploit this anonymity to steal identities, using stolen credit card numbers to access victims' information and commit fraud. Despite tighter security measures, identity theft remains a significant risk. The rise of personal computers in the 1980s led to the growth of data brokerage firms since 2000. The Internet explosion in the 1990s and the development of parallel programming software by John Asher enabled data brokers like ChoicePoint and LexisNexis to search multiple databases simultaneously for information about individuals. ChoicePoint, a major data broker in the US, sells data to various entities, including insurers and law enforcement, and was originally a spin-off of Equifax in 1997. ChoicePoint, a spin-off of Equifax in 1997, dominates the data brokerage market by acquiring smaller brokers and subsidiaries. Its revenue grew from $585 million in 2000 to over $1 billion in 2006. ChoicePoint offers sophisticated products like personalized background checks and \"Soundex\" searches. It also assists law enforcement in linking suspects to addresses and neighbors. The data brokerage industry has become closely intertwined with law enforcement. The data brokerage industry, exemplified by ChoicePoint, has strong ties to law enforcement and counterterrorism agencies. ChoicePoint has lucrative contracts with Homeland Security and Justice Departments, providing access to federal agency-specific websites for searches. Initially, access to ChoicePoint's information required stringent verification, but a criminal ring exploited this by creating fake businesses. A 2004 sting operation in Los Angeles revealed this breach. In 2004, a scandal involving ChoicePoint revealed that a criminal ring accessed personal information of 145,000 people. ChoicePoint faced criticism for initially only notifying victims in California, the only state with a notification law. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against ChoicePoint for not screening subscribers properly and providing sensitive information to suspicious applicants. ChoicePoint approved customers who lied about credentials and used fake addresses. FTC charged ChoicePoint for violating FCRA by providing reports to unauthorized subscribers and for false privacy statements. In 2006, ChoicePoint settled with FTC, paying $10 million in penalties and $5 million in consumer redress for privacy violations. The settlement with ChoicePoint requires new security procedures to protect consumer privacy and comply with federal laws. LexisNexis, a leading information research engine, acquired data broker Seisint in 2004. Following the ChoicePoint scandal, LexisNexis reported unauthorized access to personal information of 32,000 customers. Unauthorized individuals accessed personal information of about 32,000 customers of Seisint's data brokerage unit by using legitimate customers' passwords. The number of affected customers later increased to over 300,000. Hackers obtained passwords of paying customers of Seisint's \"Acurint\" service, allowing them to access sensitive information like social security numbers and driver's license numbers. The incidents at ChoicePoint and LexisNexis have raised concerns about the security of personal data collected and sold by data brokers in the growing market for personal information."
