    "content": "The Act titled \"Equitable Health Care for Neurobiological Disorders Act of 1995\" is abbreviated as such. Congress acknowledges the neuroscientific evidence showing that severe mental illnesses are actually neurobiological disorders with significant abnormalities. It emphasizes the need for adequate health insurance coverage for treating these disorders, as current insurance programs often discriminate against individuals with neurobiological disorders. Unequal coverage contributes to the problem. Unequal health insurance coverage contributes to stigmatization of persons with neurobiological disorders. Research advancements in brain function have not reached many severely mentally ill individuals. Equitable insurance coverage for severe mental disorders could save $2.2 billion annually. Standards for nondiscriminatory treatment of neurobiological disorders in employer health benefit plans are outlined in Section 3. Employer health benefit plans must provide coverage for essential services for neurobiological disorders in a non-discriminatory manner, with financial protection and cost control measures similar to other major physical illnesses. Plans meeting these standards are deemed compliant. The plan includes stop-loss protection for catastrophic expenses, coverage of facility-based care, outpatient medical management, visits for psychological services, coverage of essential prescription drugs, and medically necessary services for comorbidity. SEC. 4980C. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN STANDARDS FOR NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT FOR NEUROBIOLOGICAL DISORDERS. Imposition of Tax on carriers or employer health benefit plans for noncompliance with standards regarding neurobiological disorders under the Equitable Health Care for Neurobiological Disorders Act of 1995. The tax imposed shall not exceed 25 percent of coverage amounts received during the noncompliant period, with a limit of $100 per day for individual failures. The tax imposed on carriers for noncompliance with standards regarding neurobiological disorders under the Equitable Health Care for Neurobiological Disorders Act of 1995 is $100 per day for each individual affected. The carrier is liable for paying the tax, with exceptions for corrections made within 30 days and waivers granted by the secretary for failures due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. The Secretary may waive part or all of the tax imposed for noncompliance with neurobiological disorder standards if failure is due to reasonable cause, not willful neglect. Definitions for 'carrier' and 'employer health benefit plan' are provided in the Equitable Health Care for Neurobiological Disorders Act of 1995. Sec. 4980C addresses employer health benefit plan standards for nondiscriminatory treatment of neurobiological disorders, with amendments effective for plan years starting after December 31, 1995. In this Act, the term \"carrier\" refers to entities providing health insurance or benefits in a State, including insurance companies, prepaid hospital plans, and health maintenance organizations. The term \"employer health benefit plan\" denotes a health plan offered to employees through an employer, subject to State insurance regulation. An employer health benefit plan is a health plan offered to employees through an employer, with contributions deducted from compensation. A health benefit plan includes policies, contracts, or arrangements providing health care benefits, excluding certain types of coverage like accident or dental insurance. Neurobiological disorder includes affective disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorders, and autism. It can be covered by medicare supplemental health insurance, liability insurance supplements, worker's compensation, automobile medical-payment insurance, or a combination of these. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will direct the National Institute of Mental Health to conduct a biannual review of the definition of neurobiological disorders, including autism and psychotic disorders, within 6 months of the enactment of this Act. The Institute of Mental Health will consult with extramural researchers to review and recommend revisions to the definition of neurobiological disorders. The Secretary cannot change the definition until the recommendations are reviewed by the National Advisory Mental Health Council."
