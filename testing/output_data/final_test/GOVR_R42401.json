    "content": "To qualify for Medicare Part A SNF coverage, a beneficiary must have a 3-day inpatient hospital stay and be transferred to a participating SNF within 30 days. SNFs must provide services for the condition the beneficiary was treated for in the hospital. Medicare covers skilled nursing care or rehabilitation services. Some services may be reimbursed under Medicare Part B for non-covered SNF stays. For more details, refer to CRS Report R44512. Medicare beneficiaries qualify for up to 100 days of covered SNF care per spell of illness, which includes skilled nursing, rehabilitation, medical services, and equipment. Common conditions treated in SNFs include joint replacement, septicemia, infections, pneumonia, and heart failure. Skilled nursing and rehabilitation services must require health skills to be labeled as such. Skilled nursing and rehabilitation services in SNFs require the skills of health professionals and are provided under their supervision. Examples include management of care plans, assessment of patients, intravenous injections, catheter administration, therapeutic exercises, and range-of-motion exercises. SNFs are commonly found in urban areas and long-term care facilities. Approximately 95% of SNFs are freestanding, with the remaining 5% located in hospitals as hospital-based SNFs. Most SNFs are for-profit facilities, with 70% being for-profit, 24% nonprofit, and 5% government-owned. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated SNFs to be reimbursed under a prospective payment system starting in 1998. Medicare payments to SNFs have been reduced by 2% due to sequestration from 2013 to 2026. The SNF PPS covers most costs of providing services to Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare requires SNFs to use consolidated billing for most services provided to beneficiaries, regardless of whether the service was done by SNF personnel or an outside contractor. In some cases, services may be billed separately to Part B if not reimbursed under the SNF PPS. Beneficiaries do not need to pay a copayment for the first 20 days of a Medicare-covered SNF stay. For a Medicare-covered SNF stay, no beneficiary copayment is required for the first 20 days. From the 21st to the 100th day, a daily copayment is required, which is $161 in 2016. The SNF PPS formula includes urban and rural base rates, case-mix classification system (RUGs), and wage index adjustments. Urban or rural base rates depend on the SNF's location within a core-based statistical area (CBSA). The SNF PPS formula includes urban and rural base rates, broken down into four components: noncase-mix, noncase-mix therapy, nursing case-mix, and therapy case-mix. These components reflect various costs of providing SNF care and allow adjustments by RUGs for varying levels of nursing and therapy intensity. The SNF PPS formula includes urban and rural base rates with components for noncase-mix, nursing case-mix, and therapy case-mix, adjusted by RUGs for varying levels of nursing and therapy intensity. Base rates are updated annually for inflation based on SNF market basket index, with additional corrections if actual costs exceed the market basket update. The SNF PPS formula includes urban and rural base rates adjusted by RUGs for nursing and therapy intensity levels. RUG classification system determines beneficiary's SNF daily costs based on medical conditions. The RUG classification system has 66 groups in eight categories based on medical conditions. Information for classification is gathered from the MDS, part of the RAI completed for all residents in nursing homes. The RAI helps gather information on a resident's needs for individualized care planning. The MDS portion of the RAI collects data on 15 criteria for individualized care planning in nursing homes. SNFs must complete the MDS for Medicare reimbursement under Part A, with assessments required on specific days during a patient's stay. The \"look back\" period for MDS assessments is the seven days prior to the assessment dates. The MDS assessments for Medicare reimbursement in SNFs must be completed on specific days during a patient's stay, with a \"look back\" period of seven days prior to the assessment dates. Federal law also requires completion of the MDS and CAA for dual-eligible residents near specific days of stay and in case of significant changes. The RUG-IV classification system, with 66 RUGs, adjusts the federal base rate based on expected nursing and therapy intensity levels provided to the beneficiary. The case-mix adjusted rate in SNFs is determined by adding together components of the urban or rural base rate for each RUG, including noncase-mix, nursing, and therapy components. The nursing component is calculated by multiplying the base rate's nursing case-mix by the RUG-specific nursing case-mix index. The third component can be either a therapy case-mix or noncase-mix therapy amount, resulting in the case-mix adjusted rate reflecting the beneficiary's daily resource use before adjusting for area wage differences. The third component on the RUG is either the base rate's non-casemix therapy amount or the base rate's therapy case-mix multiplied by the RUG-specific therapy case-mix index. The case-mix adjusted rate is then adjusted for area wage differences by splitting it into labor-related and non-labor-related shares, with the labor-related share multiplied by a hospital wage index specific to the SNF location. The SNF wage index is calculated from a survey of wages and wage-related costs from acute care hospitals. For areas without data, adjacent areas are used as a proxy measure. The wage index is updated annually but adjusted to maintain Medicare SNF payments. The global per diem rate is the final reimbursement rate for daily SNF care under Part A. In 2014, Medicare FFS spending on SNF care totaled $28.6 billion, with SNF payments representing 8.0% of total Medicare FFS spending. The for-profit Medicare margin was 14.9% and nonprofit margin was 3.9% for freestanding SNFs. Total Medicare margin for freestanding SNF care in 2014 was 12.5%. MedPAC analyzed the adequacy of these payments and potential implications of using SNF payments to subsidize Medicaid nursing facility payments. The Medicare margin for freestanding SNF care in 2014 was 12.5%, with Medicare contributing 21% of the median nursing care facility's total revenue. MedPAC's analysis on Medicare payments for SNF care may only capture about a fifth of the financial picture of an average nursing facility. MedPAC considers various factors like beneficiaries' access to care, quality of care, and providers' access to capital when assessing Medicare's payments. MedPAC recommended a 0% update to SNF payment rates for Congress. MedPAC recommended a 0% update to SNF payment rates for FY2017 and FY2018 due to factors like Medicaid not covering total costs for nursing facility services. Industry advocates suggest Medicare should subsidize Medicaid payments through SNF reimbursements. Evidence shows non-Medicare payments do not cover costs, with a negative margin of -1.5% in 2014. Including Medicare, the nursing facility industry's total margin was 1.9%. MedPAC has raised concerns about targeting Medicare SNF reimbursements to compensate for inadequate payments from other providers, stating that it results in poorly targeted subsidies. Facilities with high Medicare shares would receive the most subsidies, while those with low shares would receive the least. MedPAC also warns that maintaining high Medicare payment levels could lead to states reducing Medicaid payments, creating pressure to raise Medicare rates. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act requires the establishment of a Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing Program. The Secretary is required to establish a Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (SNF VBP) Program starting on or after October 1, 2018. This program rewards healthcare providers with incentive payments for quality care provided to beneficiaries, aiming to reward quality over quantity. Similar VBP programs exist in other Medicare payment systems. Under the SNF VBP Program, Medicare per diem reimbursement for SNFs may be adjusted based on performance scores starting in FY2019. Performance scores will be determined by the Secretary using established standards. The Secretary will establish performance standards for the Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (SNF VBP) Program, based on all-cause, all-condition hospital readmission rates for Medicare SNF patients. The program aims to reward quality care over quantity, with reimbursement adjustments for SNFs based on performance scores starting in FY2019. The measures do not need to be endorsed by the National Quality Forum and may be replaced by risk-adjusted preventable readmission rates specified by the Secretary. Beginning October 1, 2016, SNFs will receive confidential feedback reports on their hospital readmission performance. High-performing SNFs will receive a percentage add-on incentive payment based on their performance score, with higher-ranked SNFs receiving a higher percentage add-on. Beginning October 1, 2016, SNFs will receive confidential feedback reports on their hospital readmission performance. High-performing SNFs will receive a percentage add-on incentive payment based on their performance score, with higher-ranked SNFs receiving a higher percentage add-on. The value-based incentive payments awarded to high-performing SNFs will be funded through a portion of a 2% reduction in Medicare per diem payments applied to all Medicare-covered SNF days beginning in FY2019. Between 50% and 70% of the 2% reduction applied each fiscal year will be allocated for value-based incentive payments, while the remaining proportion will be retained as savings to the Medicare program. The IMPACT Act, passed in 2014, aims to improve Medicare quality comparison and payment accuracy for post-acute care settings by eliminating differences in assessment instruments. Medicare SNF care, along with other post-acute care benefits, has shown wide geographic payment and delivery variations. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation has tested alternative payment models for post-acute care reimbursement. Incentive payments for high-performing SNFs will be funded through a 2% reduction in Medicare per diem payments starting in FY2019. The IMPACT Act, passed in 2014, aims to unify post-acute care assessment instruments. Changes to the MDS for SNFs will occur, with feedback on quality and resource use measures starting in 2017. Public reporting of performance will begin in 2018. A report to Congress on alternative payment models for post-acute care providers, including SNFs, will be submitted within two years. The report will be submitted no later than two years after the Secretary has collected two years of data on quality measures. MedPAC is required to submit a report to Congress by June 30, 2016, with recommendations for a technical prototype for a post-acute care PPS. The CMMI was created to test innovative payment and service delivery models to reduce program expenditures while maintaining quality of care. In some CMMI Medicare models affecting post-acute care, providers can enter gainsharing agreements to share monies from increased efficiencies in healthcare delivery after hospitalization. Incentive payments under gainsharing agreements aim to reduce Medicare FFS spending for certain providers. Under gainsharing agreements, providers can collaborate to reduce Medicare FFS spending for specific episodes, such as post-acute care following pneumonia hospitalization. The CJR Model provides a 90-day Medicare episode spending benchmark for lower-extremity joint replacement procedures. These payment models aim to incentivize providers to achieve cost savings while maintaining quality of care."
