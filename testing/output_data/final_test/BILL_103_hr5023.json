    "content": "The \"Citizens' Tax Relief Act of 1994\" reduces the lowest rate of income tax for taxpayers other than corporations from 15% to 12.5% for taxable years starting after December 31, 1994. Additionally, the Act repeals the increase in basis of property acquired from a decedent. The \"Citizens' Tax Relief Act of 1994\" repeals Section 1014 of the Internal Revenue Code, relating to the basis of property acquired from a decedent. It amends Section 1015 to treat property acquired from a decedent as acquired by gift for tax purposes. The basis of property acquired from a decedent is determined under subsection (a) and increased by the portion of the aggregate death tax adjustment allocated to the property. The death tax adjustment for any property is limited by the net appreciation in the property multiplied by the Federal marginal estate tax rate. The net appreciation in value of property is the fair market value exceeding the initial basis, increased by the minimum basis adjustment. The aggregate death tax adjustment for an estate is the product of the aggregate net appreciation of properties and the Federal marginal estate tax rate, with a limitation on the amount considered for taxation. The Federal marginal estate tax rate, as defined in section 2001(c), is the highest rate used to determine the tentative tax on an estate, with a minimum rate of 30 percent. The executor must allocate adjustments among properties on the tax return. The tax imposed by chapter 11 is being returned. Conforming amendments are made to the table of sections and the heading of section 1015. SEC. 1015 amends the basis of property acquired by gift, from a decedent, or transferred in trust. The effective date for these amendments is for decedents dying after December 31, 1994. Additionally, SEC. 4 introduces a phase-in of capital gains tax on inherited property. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 changes the maximum capital gains rate for taxpayers with a net capital gain. The tax imposed will be based on taxable income reduced by the net capital gain or taxable income taxed at a rate below 28 percent. The tax rate on net capital gains acquired from a decedent after December 31, 1994, is 28 percent of the excess taxable income over the sum of the initial amount and the net capital gain. The applicable percentage varies between 10 percent and 15 percent depending on the taxable year. The tax rate on net capital gains acquired from a decedent after December 31, 1994, ranges from 10% to 25% depending on the taxable year. Taxpayers can elect to mark-to-market property acquired from a decedent, treating it as sold at fair market value. This amendment applies to taxable years ending after December 31, 1994. SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION OF GAIN ON SALE OF PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE ACQUIRED FROM A DECEDENT. SEC. 5 amends subsection (d) of section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include special rules for residences acquired from a decedent after December 31, 1994. This amendment exempts such residences from certain requirements related to the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence. The amendment made by this section applies to sales and exchanges after December 31, 1994, in taxable years ending after that date."
