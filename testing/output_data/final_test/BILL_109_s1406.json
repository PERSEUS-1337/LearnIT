    "content": "The Act titled \"Respirator Access Assurance Act of 2005\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that millions of workers rely on US-made respirators for protection against hazardous materials and disasters. Respirators are regulated by NIOSH to meet performance standards and ensure compliance. Prior to NIOSH, respirators were approved by the US Bureau of Mines. Manufacturers of NIOSH-compliant respirators face product liability claims. Respirators impact interstate commerce and litigation costs may lead to manufacturers ceasing production. The United States must maintain the capacity to produce and distribute respirators to ensure their availability. This is crucial for protecting the health of American workers and emergency responders. The protections outlined in this Act are necessary to ensure that lifesaving respirators remain commercially available. The curr_chunk is a section defining terms related to respirators. The curr_chunk defines terms related to respirators, including the definitions of \"Manufacturer,\" \"NIOSH,\" and \"NIOSH approval.\" The curr_chunk defines the term \"Respirator\" as any device designed to provide respiratory protection against hazardous atmospheres. It also defines \"Seller\" as a person or entity regularly engaged in selling respirators. NIOSH approval includes certification by federal agencies like the United States Bureau of Mines and the Mine Safety and Health Administration. The curr_chunk states the effect of NIOSH approval on design and labeling of respirators. The curr_chunk explains that manufacturers or sellers of respirators are protected from claims of defective design or warning if the respirator has NIOSH approval and complies with NIOSH standards. This protection does not apply if NIOSH withdraws its approval due to withheld or misrepresented information. The statute of limitations for claims related to respirators approved by NIOSH does not begin until NIOSH withdraws its approval due to withheld or misrepresented information. SEC. 5 of the Act preempts State or local laws related to defective design or warning claims for respirators that comply with NIOSH-approved design. It also clarifies that the Act does not affect any defense available under other laws or create new causes of action. This Act applies to civil actions in Federal or State courts for harm caused by a respirator, manufacturer, or seller. It becomes effective upon enactment and applies to actions not yet at trial, regardless of when the respirator was made or sold."
