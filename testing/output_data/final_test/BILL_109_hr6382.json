    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Law Enforcement Abuse Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006\". Congress acknowledges the duty of American law enforcement to provide compassion, aid, and protection to all individuals, regardless of race or background. Despite efforts to address violations by law enforcement agencies, abuses and murders of innocent suspects continue to occur. A special prosecutor in Chicago is investigating a police abuse ring that tortured over 200 African-American males in custody over three decades. Public and media attention on abuse of power by law enforcement in communities of color has increased since high-profile cases in the late 1990s. Recently, there have been numerous instances of police misconduct and abuse of power in various cities, leading to community outrage and calls for external oversight. This includes the fatal shooting of an unarmed man in New York City and reports of abuse in Atlanta and DeKalb County, Georgia. Law enforcement agencies across the country rely on federal funding, training, and assistance, which is funded by taxpayers who are often the victims of police abuse. The behavior of law enforcement officials remains unchecked and unaccountable. The lack of accountability and transparency in law enforcement agencies regarding abuses is unacceptable. To prevent further misconduct, Federal funding should be denied to agencies that do not have proper training, oversight, and consequences for violators. To address the lack of accountability in law enforcement, perpetrators must be held accountable and cases of abuse or excessive force should be reviewed by an independent forum. Congress believes that dishonorable actions should be investigated, recorded, and condemned independently. Additionally, individuals involved in such actions should be ineligible for federal assistance. During the 1-year period after this Act is enacted, law enforcement agencies without independent oversight or accountability for excessive force, torture, or manslaughter will be ineligible for federal programs, licenses will be suspended, and agencies involved in abuses must return federally-owned equipment. Law enforcement agencies involved in abuses must return all federally-owned equipment to the appropriate Federal agency. In this Act, \"law enforcement agencies\" are defined as entities in any State or locality within the control of the United States receiving Federal funds for training, equipment, or support."
