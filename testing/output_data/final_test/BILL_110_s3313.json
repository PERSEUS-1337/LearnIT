    "content": "The Act titled \"Victims of Polygamy Assistance Act of 2008\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that despite polygamy being illegal in the US for over 100 years, the practice involving underage marriages is increasing in states like Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. These polygamist communities are controlled by organizations that commit various crimes such as child abuse, domestic violence, and tax evasion. The Federal Government should assist State and local law enforcement agencies in investigating and prosecuting polygamist organizations for violations of State and Federal law. Collaboration and information-sharing among State and Federal agencies are crucial in combating crimes by polygamist organizations. Establishing a task force within the Department of Justice to coordinate efforts would aid in the investigation and prosecution of criminal activities of polygamist organizations. Polygamist organizations engage in criminal activities and manipulate victims to prevent them from leaving. Witnesses testifying against these organizations require social services and witness protection. Federal assistance is needed to support these individuals in both Federal and State courts. Establishment of a Federal Polygamy Task Force. Establishment of a Federal Polygamy Task Force within the Department of Justice to address illegal activities of polygamist organizations by formulating effective responses and establishing partnerships with State and local law enforcement. Task force includes Deputy Attorney General, US attorneys, FBI, IRS, Department of Labor, and Department of Health and Human Services. The Federal Polygamy Task Force aims to combat crimes by polygamist organizations through partnerships with law enforcement, supporting witness protection, tracking criminal behavior across borders, and preventing corruption among officials with ties to polygamist groups. SEC. 4. POLYGAMY VICTIM ASSISTANCE DISCRETIONARY GRANTS. The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 is amended to include assistance for victims of polygamy.
