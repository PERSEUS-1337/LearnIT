    "content": "The federal health center program, administered by HRSA under HHS, awards grants to support outpatient primary care facilities for low-income individuals. Authorized in Section 330 of the PHSA, the program supports community health centers, health centers for the homeless, health centers for public housing residents, and migrant health centers. Over 9,400 unique health center sites exist, with the majority being community health centers serving the general low-income population. Health centers, including community health centers, serve low-income populations and are part of the health safety net. They are required to provide care regardless of ability to pay and are located in areas with limited healthcare providers. Most patients are uninsured or on Medicaid. This report outlines the federal health center program, its requirements, locations, patient demographics, and associated outcomes. The report discusses federal programs available to assist health center operations, including the FQHC designation for Medicare and Medicaid payments. It also addresses potential effects of the ACA on health centers, workforce, and financial considerations in the context of changing budgets. Additionally, the report includes appendices on FQHC payments and similar programs not authorized in the PHSA. The federal health center program, authorized in Section 330 of the PHSA, awards grants to support outpatient primary care facilities for low-income individuals. It includes definitions of health center types, program requirements, grants awarded, appropriations, and funding sources. Health centers must serve the entire population regardless of ability to pay and document residents' health needs in their service area. Health center grantees must meet specific requirements such as geographic location, fee schedule, reimbursement collection, governance, health services, reporting, quality assurance, and provider licensing. Concerns have been raised about oversight of the program by HRSA and whether some health centers are meeting these requirements. This report outlines the requirements of the federal health center program under PHSA Section 330. PHSA Section 330 requires health centers to be located in medically underserved areas and establish fee schedules based on local rates and costs. Discounted fees are offered based on income, with full charges for those above 200% of the federal poverty level. Coordination with state Medicaid and CHIP plans is also required. Health centers must coordinate with state Medicaid and CHIP plans to provide services to beneficiaries. They are required to seek reimbursement from third party payers and have systems in place for billing and collections. Despite collecting reimbursements, Medicare payments do not cover the full cost of services in nearly two-thirds of visits. Medicaid reimbursements also fall short of covering the cost of health services provided. The NACHC found that Medicaid reimbursements covered 81% of health service costs, while Medicare and private insurance covered two-thirds. The PHSA Section 330 grant for uninsured patients was $312, less than half the average health center cost per patient of $654. Health centers must have a patient-majority governing board that oversees operational issues and approves budgets, management, and grant applications. They provide primary care services and may offer behavioral health, case management, and specialty care. Health centers are required to provide primary, preventive, and emergency health services, including diabetes self-management training. Primary health services are provided by physicians or physician extenders and include diagnostic laboratory and radiology services. Preventive health services include well-child care, prenatal and postpartum care, immunization, family planning, health education, and preventive dental care. Health centers must provide emergency health services with defined arrangements for after-hours care and admitting privileges at nearby hospitals for care continuity. Enabling services like transportation and translation are also required. Additional services may be provided as well. Health centers are required to report patient demographics, services provided, staffing information, utilization rates, costs, and revenue to HRSA's UDS. They must also report on certain clinical outcomes to assess quality, such as immunization rates, cancer screenings, and body mass index. Health centers must have quality improvement systems in place, including clinical services, management, and patient confidentiality assurances. A clinical director is required to report on quality improvement activities and conduct periodic assessments of services. HHS Inspector General found that over two-thirds of health centers conducted quality assessments. Grants have been awarded for quality initiatives like care coordination. Health center providers must be properly licensed in the state they practice. Health center providers must be properly licensed in the state they practice and have admitting privileges at hospitals. They must maintain proper credentials during employment. HRSA encourages accreditation from AAHC or TJC and provides support grants for new centers, service expansion, construction, planning, and maintenance. Five types of grants support health centers: New Access Point (NAP) grants for establishing new sites, Increased Demand for Services (IDS) or Expanded Service (ES) grants for expanding services, Capital Improvement Program (CIP) grants for construction and renovation. Other grants are available for planning and reducing infant mortality. Eligibility criteria and factors for awarding grants are also discussed. The fifth grant program supports activities to reduce infant mortality, but HRSA now supports other programs for this purpose. Public and non-profit entities can apply for Section 330 grants to operate health centers, awarded competitively based on need and application merit. HRSA allocates percentages of the health center program's budget to grants supporting special populations like migrant workers, the homeless, and residents of public housing. Health centers must meet specific funding requirements to serve these populations, with at least 25% of HRSA grant funding dedicated to migrants to be considered serving a \"special population.\" HRSA is required to allocate percentages of the health center program's budget to grants supporting special populations like migrant workers, the homeless, and residents of public housing. Grant recipients are not required to provide matching funds but must use the grant funds to supplement existing funding. Grant amounts are based on proposed activities and may be adjusted to ensure funding criteria are met. Funding for multi-year projects is contingent on congressional appropriations and compliance with regulations. The health center program's appropriation has increased significantly over the past decade, leading to the establishment of more centers and the ability to serve more patients. Funding for new or expanded health centers has been provided to 1,200 communities since 2002, with continued expansion during the Obama Administration. In FY2009, the program received $2 billion in funding. In FY2009, the health center program received $2 billion under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5). ARRA provided $500 million for new sites and expanded services, and $1.5 billion for construction, renovation, equipment, and health information technology. The program's expansion may continue under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), which appropriated $1.5 billion for health center construction and repair. The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) included $9.5 billion for health center operations from FY2011 to FY2015. However, these funds may not be used for program expansion. The ACA provided funding for health centers to train medical residents and for care coordination initiatives. The program's appropriations increased by 119% since FY2004, with funds mainly used to expand the number of centers. Table 3 shows appropriations from FY2004 to FY2015, including amounts from ARRA and the ACA. Health centers also receive funding from reimbursements and other sources. In FY2013, health centers received funding from various sources including Medicaid (38.5%), Section 330 grants (18.2%), and grants/contracts from state, local, and private foundations (16.9%). The section discusses the types of health centers funded, services offered, populations served, and their locations. Health centers are categorized into four types: community health centers, health centers for the homeless, health centers for residents of public housing, and migrant health centers. Community health centers (CHCs) are the most common type and serve the general population with limited access to healthcare. Each type of health center targets specific populations and provides specific services. Health Centers for the Homeless (HCHs) provide services to homeless individuals, defined as those lacking permanent housing. They are the only federal health program targeting this uninsured population. 18.5% of the health center program budget is reserved for grants supporting health centers serving special populations, with the majority allocated to support Community Health Centers (CHCs). Health Centers for the Homeless (HCHs) provide services to homeless individuals, including substance abuse and supportive services. They aim to connect them with emergency shelter, job training, and education. Grants are available for innovative programs serving homeless children. HRSA must allocate at least 8.7% of its budget to support these centers. Public housing centers were authorized in 1990 to address health disparities among residents. HRSA allocates 1.2% of its budget to support these centers. Migrant health centers cater to migrant and seasonal farm workers, providing care to over a quarter of this population. Migrant health centers are required to provide specific services tailored to their population's health needs, including environmental health services and accident prevention. They may be exempt from certain services and operate seasonally. HRSA allocates at least 8.6% of its budget to support these centers, which served 21.1 million patients in 2012, mostly socioeconomically disadvantaged and uninsured or underinsured. The majority of health center patients are disadvantaged, uninsured, or underinsured, with incomes at or below the federal poverty level. Nearly a quarter of patients are treated in a language other than English, and most are racial or ethnic minorities. In 2012, almost one-third of patients were African-American and/or Hispanic/Latino, double the proportion in the overall U.S. population. Demographic characteristics of health center patients in 2012 are shown in Table 6. Figures 1 and 2 display the locations of health centers funded with PHSA Section 330 grants, including some school-based health centers. Community health centers are distributed throughout the country. Community health centers are the most numerous type of sites in the country, with many receiving grants to operate multiple health center types in the same area. Research shows that access to health centers can improve health outcomes and reduce costs, especially for underserved populations like those enrolled in Medicaid and racial minorities. Health centers focus on preventive care and managing chronic conditions to prevent disease and complications. Patients at health centers are more likely to receive care. Health center patients receive preventive health services and screenings, manage chronic conditions like diabetes, and increase prenatal care use in low-income pregnant women to reduce infant mortality outcomes. Health centers have made progress in increasing prenatal care initiation in the first trimester, resulting in fewer low birth weight babies compared to the national average. Researchers suggest that health centers may lower healthcare costs. Health centers can reduce healthcare costs by lowering emergency department visits through education and offering convenient appointments. Studies show that treatment at health centers is much cheaper than in emergency departments, leading to cost savings. Additionally, health centers help prevent unnecessary hospitalizations, contributing to overall cost reduction in healthcare. Studies have shown that health centers can prevent unnecessary hospitalizations by treating ambulatory sensitive conditions in outpatient settings. Patients enrolled in Medicaid who use health centers are less likely to be hospitalized or visit the emergency room compared to those who do not. Patients receiving care at health centers also have significantly lower medical costs, with savings ranging from 24% to 62% compared to those receiving care elsewhere. Health centers provide less costly health care compared to other outpatient settings, with savings ranging from 24% to 62%. Reasons for this include offering discounted services through federal programs and providers working on a salaried basis, reducing financial incentives for unnecessary tests or procedures. Health centers aim to reduce healthcare costs by providing care to underserved populations in areas with few providers. They may lower costs by avoiding expensive emergency room visits, specialty care, or hospital stays. This is achieved through the FQHC rate, which is comparable to rates in other outpatient settings. Health centers provide access to underserved populations, including Hispanic, African American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities. They help reduce health disparities by accepting new patients, charity patients, and those unable to pay. Patients are often enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, increasing healthcare access for diverse groups. Health centers are required to coordinate with Medicaid and CHIP plans, accepting all patients regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. Private providers may not accept Medicaid patients due to administrative requirements or low reimbursements rates. Recent evaluations show that health centers perform better on 6 out of 18 quality measures compared to physician offices, providing access to Medicaid and CHIP patients who may struggle to find care. Despite treating a population with higher comorbidities, health centers performed better on 11 measures but worse on 2 measures related to diet counseling for at-risk adolescents. Studies have shown that health centers implementing quality improvement teams for asthma management reduced hospitalizations and emergency visits. Another study compared health center care to Medicaid managed care organizations on quality measures like diabetes and blood pressure control, identifying high-performing health centers that exceeded Medicaid MCOs. The study compared high-performing health centers to low-performing ones, noting differences in populations served and geographic locations. Low-performing centers served more uninsured or homeless individuals and had less Medicaid revenue. High-performing centers were mainly in California, New York, and Massachusetts, while low-performing centers were more common in southern states. Section 330 grants cover about one-fifth of health center costs. The federal government provides financial assistance to health centers, including Section 330 grants that cover about one-fifth of operating costs. Health centers may employ members of the National Health Service Corps for support. Designation as Federally Qualified Health Centers allows for higher Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, with Medicaid being the largest revenue source for health centers. Health centers receive revenue from Medicaid reimbursements, discounted prescription drugs, and vaccines. They are designated as health professional shortage areas and eligible for National Health Service Corps providers, who offer scholarships or loan repayments. This program helps health centers recruit providers, with about half of Corps members serving in health centers. Some states also offer loan repayment programs for health professionals in designated areas. Health centers designated as Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) may rely on J-1 visa waivers to recruit physicians for shortage areas. These waivers allow foreign medical graduates to waive the two-year foreign residency requirement if they practice primary care in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). Centers must enroll in Medicare and/or Medicaid programs to receive higher reimbursement rates for services provided to patients enrolled in these programs. Health centers designated as Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) can participate in the 340B Drug Pricing program, receiving discounts on drugs ranging from 13% to 17% below average manufacturer price. They are also eligible for the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) to provide vaccines for low-income children. The Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) provides free vaccines to low-income children through health centers, which are eligible providers. The program is administered by the CDC and funded by Medicaid, enabling health centers to offer vaccinations at a lower cost. Health center employees are covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), eliminating the need for medical malpractice coverage. In FY2012, 107 claims were paid through the FTCA program totaling $68.1 million, providing financial support to health centers. Health centers are eligible for grants under the Ryan White AIDS program to provide care for low-income individuals. Part C grant funds are awarded to entities to provide medical services such as testing, referrals, and clinical and diagnostic services to underserved and uninsured people living with HIV/AIDS in rural and frontier communities. Health centers are eligible to apply for federally funded grant programs to improve rural health, mental health and substance abuse services, provide services to high-risk pregnant women and infants, increase health professional training, and enhance access to family planning services for low-income families. Programs specific to rural areas may also be administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Health centers in rural areas may access USDA programs for equipment and broadband. They can also utilize resources from the General Services Administration and Department of Housing and Urban Development for real estate and facility improvements. Congress may need to address issues like health insurance expansions, workforce adequacy, and financial challenges faced by health centers. The Budget Control Act may impact health centers' ability to provide care for newly insured individuals under the ACA. Congressional concern for healthcare access has led to ACA Title V aiming to improve access for underserved populations. The health workforce's role in serving these populations is also a focus for Congress. Congress has a strong interest in improving healthcare access for underserved populations, including increasing the supply of qualified health care workforce. They are also concerned about the financial circumstances of health centers and how policy changes may impact them. Program changes may be considered to address these issues. The ACA aims to expand insurance coverage by expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies for low-income individuals. This may increase the number of patients at health centers and reimbursements received. Patients with private insurance or Medicaid under the ACA may have lower out-of-pocket costs for services at health centers. The ACA may lower out-of-pocket costs for services at health centers, potentially increasing the number of patients. Evidence suggests that individuals use more health services after obtaining insurance coverage, leading to increased health center use. Massachusetts experienced a 7% increase in patient case load after implementing similar health insurance expansions. The ACA's Medicaid expansion could strain health centers' capacity to provide services, impacting healthcare access for Medicaid beneficiaries. The ACA aims to increase health insurance coverage by expanding Medicaid enrollment, but state variation in Medicaid eligibility due to the Supreme Court's decision may impact health center patients and finances. Medicaid beneficiaries may seek care at health centers due to acceptance requirements, while some private providers may not accept Medicaid due to low reimbursement rates. Health centers may benefit if uninsured patients enroll in Medicaid, allowing them to bill Medicaid for services. An estimated 4 million health center patients may become Medicaid eligible due to the ACA, with 1 million remaining ineligible. The authors estimate that health centers in states where Medicaid is expanded will receive over $2 billion in additional reimbursements, allowing for service expansion and improvement. However, health centers in states without Medicaid expansion will continue to rely on grant funds to provide care for the uninsured, potentially straining their ability to serve this population. The ACA insurance expansions may lead to some previously uninsured health center patients gaining coverage, potentially benefiting health centers by increasing revenue. Evidence from Massachusetts suggests that health centers retained their patients after insurance expansion, indicating a positive outcome for health centers. The ACA requires private insurance plans from exchanges to include access to essential community providers like health centers, potentially increasing revenue. Concerns arise as some health centers fear their patients may enroll in plans without them in the provider network. The ACA requires private insurance plans to include health centers in their provider network, potentially increasing revenue. Health centers are concerned about not being included in exchange plans, which could lead to financial strain or patients needing to choose different providers. They also worry about receiving low reimbursement rates that may not cover the cost of care for patients. The impact of the ACA on health center patient base and revenue is uncertain, and health centers face challenges in providing care to an expanded population due to provider shortages and capacity constraints. Health centers may struggle with provider shortages and financial challenges as they expand their patient base. The National Association of Community Health Centers estimates a significant shortage of primary care providers and nurses, which may worsen with health center expansion. Recruiting and retaining staff is difficult due to their location in rural and remote areas. Health centers in rural and remote areas face challenges recruiting and retaining staff due to declining numbers of primary care providers. They traditionally rely on the NHSC for recruitment, but the ACA-authorized teaching health centers program aims to increase provider training. The federal government provides NHSC providers to health centers to address shortages, with mandatory funding from FY2011 to FY2015. The NHSC's funding has been primarily mandatory since FY2012, raising concerns about future funding after FY2015. The President's Budget for FY2015 includes new discretionary funding and a $8.1 billion mandatory funding source until FY2020. NHSC providers are crucial for health centers, but reliance on NHSC may lead to workforce instability. Some providers may stay beyond their service commitment. The ACA authorizes a new program to increase medical residency training at health centers, which may help recruit physicians but could also challenge health centers. Teaching health centers, located at outpatient facilities, may assist in physician recruitment, although health centers may face challenges in operating these programs. Operating residency programs at health centers can be challenging due to the time and patient care impact on reimbursements. Despite insufficient graduate medical education payments, these programs serve as recruitment tools and connect specialists with health centers. The ACA provides funding for teaching health center graduate medical education payments through FY2015, but no funds have been appropriated for grants to develop teaching health centers. This limited and uncertain funding may have limited effects on health center provider recruitment and retention. The financial considerations for health centers include program appropriations, impact of federal deficit reduction efforts, changes in state funding, costs of electronic health records, and potential effects of ACA care coordination. The future of the health center program's expansion is uncertain due to recent focus on deficit reduction. Assessing whether the program should be expanded or contracted is challenging and may depend on ACA implementation and economic conditions. The section discusses changes in federal and state funding for health centers, the impact of the ACA on health center finances, and the establishment of the CHCF. State and local funding vary for individual health centers, with some states reducing financial support. The ACA may provide increased reimbursements for health services and care coordination, potentially benefiting health centers. The ACA established the CHCF, which may impact health center appropriation levels. Funding for health centers has increased over the past decade, with expansions supported by ARRA and the CHCF. CHCF funds have been used in place of annual appropriations for health centers since FY2011, leading to fewer New Access Point grants being awarded. The federal government's focus has shifted to maintaining the health center program rather than expanding it, as indicated by the FY2014 appropriations law. Congress is balancing priorities of maintenance and expansion by increasing grant amounts and awarding new access point grants. Concerns have been raised about the CHCF making up a large portion of the health center program budget and the potential decrease in funding after FY2016 if the CHCF ends. The CHCF funding for health centers may decrease significantly unless extended or replaced from another source. The President's Budget Request for FY2015 proposes new mandatory funding starting in FY2016, totaling $8.1 billion. Budget reductions triggered by the Budget Control Act affected health center appropriations, leading to a 2% reduction for community and migrant health centers and a 5% reduction for discretionary health center appropriations. This resulted in over $60 million being cut from the program. The CHCF funding for health centers may decrease significantly unless extended or replaced from another source. In FY2014 and FY2015, the CHCF will be reduced by 2% for community and migrant health centers and by 7.2% in 2014 and 7.3% in 2015 for health centers for the homeless and residents of public housing. The ACA may provide additional reimbursements for care coordination, which can reduce overall healthcare costs but may not directly benefit health centers financially. The ACA may offer additional reimbursements for care coordination, potentially benefiting health centers. However, funding constraints could make it challenging for health centers to sustain these efforts. Future federal funding for health centers is uncertain, and some states are reducing their funding. State funding for health centers is declining, with a 42% decrease since 2008. Some argue that federal investments make state funding unnecessary, but advocates stress its importance to maintain services. State funding for health centers is decreasing, with a 15% decline from state FY2011 to FY2012. Some states are withdrawing support due to budget concerns, which, coupled with decreasing federal appropriations, may strain health center finances. Advocates argue that states should continue providing support through Medicaid reimbursements for services provided to Medicaid patients. States may choose to limit separate funding for health centers despite potential Medicaid cost savings. HRSA awarded grants for EHR systems to help health centers qualify for incentive payments from Medicare or Medicaid. Some grantees faced challenges with EHR adoption. Approximately 72% of health center EHR grantees were able to meet meaningful use requirements, but concerns about maintaining EHR systems post-grant were reported by 76% of grantees. Some centers experienced decreased provider productivity and revenue due to EHR implementation. Financial strain from acquiring and maintaining EHR systems and potential loss of CMS incentive payments were highlighted, impacting health centers serving low-income populations with limited access to healthcare. The federal government supports health centers through the health center program, which aims to improve access to healthcare for underserved populations. This program awards grants to plan, operate, and expand health centers, as well as providing recruitment and financial incentives. Health center appropriations have increased over the past decade, but it is uncertain if these increases will continue. Congress may be concerned about the program's appropriation level and the impact of federal deficit reduction efforts. The federal government supports facilities providing primary care to underserved populations through various programs, including school-based health centers and nurse-managed health clinics. These facilities serve different populations with different requirements than those authorized in the health center program under PHSA Section 330. The government supports facilities providing care to targeted populations such as American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, as well as those in rural areas, offering mental health services and free care. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) are located on or near school grounds, providing primary health care services to students regardless of their ability to pay. SBHCs receive separate grants under the ACA for construction and operation. The ACA authorized grants for School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) construction and renovation, but funding for operating grants has not been appropriated. Nurse-Managed Health Centers (NMHCs) provide primary care and wellness services to underserved populations, with nurses delivering most health services. NMHCs offer prenatal care, disease prevention, chronic condition management, and health education, with some also providing dental and mental health services. Community mental health centers (CMHC) provide mental health services tailored to children, adults, and the elderly with serious mental illnesses. They also offer services to individuals discharged from inpatient treatment. CMHCs must provide emergency services, day treatment, and psychosocial support. Community mental health centers (CMHC) offer emergency services, day treatment, psychosocial rehabilitation, and screening for state mental health facilities. CMHCs receive funding from SAMHSA block grants, HHS grants, and reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid. Native Hawaiian Health Care System provides primary care and health promotion. Lokahi is a consortium providing health care services to Native Hawaiians, facing cultural and financial barriers. The Native Hawaiian Health Care System (NHHCS) was authorized under the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 and receives funding through the health center appropriation. In FY2011, NHHCS served over 8,400 people with medical and enabling services. Tribal Health Centers receive funds from the Indian Health Service to operate health centers for American Indians or Alaska Natives. Tribal health centers for American Indians or Alaska Natives are not bound by Section 330 requirements, such as providing services to all individuals in their service area or seeking payments from clients. They may be designated as Federally Qualified Health Centers and receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. ITs, TOs, and UIOs can also apply for Section 330 funds but would then need to comply with all requirements, including serving non-American Indians and Alaska Natives. Tribal health centers receiving Section 330 grants must use funds for IHS-eligible individuals. Rural Health Clinics in underserved areas get higher Medicare/Medicaid payments. Unlike health centers, RHCs don't receive federal grants and may be for-profit. Free clinics offer medical, dental, and behavioral health services to underserved populations. Free clinics provide medical, dental, and behavioral health services to uninsured populations. Funding for free clinics comes from donations and religious groups. They do not receive HRSA funding but may participate in the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program. Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) look-alikes meet grant criteria but do not receive funding. The FQHC look-alike program was established in 1990 to support new health centers by designating certain facilities as \"FQHC look-alikes,\" making them eligible for federal programs and the FQHC payment rate. Facilities submit applications to HRSA for designation, with HRSA reporting 316 FQHC look-alikes as of November 2013. All health centers can be designated as FQHCs upon enrolling as providers in Medicare and Medicaid. The FQHC designation allows Section 330 grantees to receive higher Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Medicare pays health centers an all-inclusive rate for services provided to beneficiaries, covering all costs during a visit. ACA-mandated changes to Medicare FQHC payments are also described in this appendix. The payment rate for FQHCs is calculated based on estimated allowable costs divided by the total number of visits for services. It includes services provided by physicians and supplies used. Certain preventive services and diagnostic tests are billed separately. FQHCs are reimbursed based on estimated costs, which are adjusted at the end of the year for actual costs. The payment rate for FQHCs is calculated based on estimated allowable costs divided by the total number of visits for services, including physician services and supplies. Medicare beneficiaries have different deductible and cost-sharing requirements at FQHCs, with the Medicare Part B deductible not applying for FQHC services. The ACA requires changes to how FQHCs are paid for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries, including the development of a prospective payment system (PPS) to ensure sufficient reimbursement. The ACA required Medicare to develop a prospective payment system (PPS) for FQHCs to align payments with service costs. CMS proposed a national encounter-based rate for FQHCs, adjusting for geographic differences and services provided. The new rule would eliminate payments for multiple visits on the same day. The ACA mandated Medicare to establish a prospective payment system for FQHCs, aligning payments with service costs. Medicare preventive services and initial exams for new beneficiaries are provided without copayments. Medicare reimbursement for mental health services at FQHCs is changing, with the previous limit phased out by January 1, 2014. Medicaid uses a PPS to reimburse FQHCs based on predetermined per-visit rates established in FY1999 and FY2000, updated annually for medical inflation. The state uses a prospective payment system (PPS) to reimburse Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) under Medicaid, with rates updated annually for medical inflation. States must adjust PPS payment rates based on changes in services provided. Some states use alternative payment methodologies (APM) for reimbursement. Supplemental payments are provided to FQHCs that subcontract with Medicaid Managed Care Entities to ensure they receive adequate payment. The ACA did not bring changes to Medicaid FQHC reimbursement policy, affecting the Medicaid payment under PPS or APM."
