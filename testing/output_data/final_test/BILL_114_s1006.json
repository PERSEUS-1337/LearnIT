    "content": "The \"Positive Train Control Safety Act\" includes provisions for implementation deadlines, transparency, positive train control on high-hazard flammable trains, spectrum coordination, confidential close call reporting systems, commuter rail track inspections, grade crossing effectiveness study, and redundant signal protection. The amendment to Section 20157 of title 49, United States Code allows the Secretary to extend the implementation deadline in 1-year increments if full implementation is infeasible due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. This includes factors such as funding availability, spectrum acquisition, resource and technology availability, and interoperability standards. The amendment allows the Secretary to extend the positive train control implementation deadline in 1-year increments if full implementation is infeasible due to factors like funding, spectrum acquisition, resources, and interoperability standards. The applicant must demonstrate good faith in implementation and present a revised plan to fully implement positive train control by December 31, 2018, considering areas of greater risk. The Secretary may extend the positive train control implementation deadline in 1-year increments if full implementation is infeasible due to factors like funding, spectrum acquisition, resources, and interoperability standards. The application review must be completed within 120 days, and the implementation deadline cannot be extended beyond June 30, 2016. SEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY. Section 20157(a) of title 49, United States Code is amended to require progress reports from Class I railroad carriers and entities providing rail passenger transportation on the status of their positive train control system plans. Under subparagraph (A), progress reports from Class I railroad carriers and entities providing rail passenger transportation must include details on the total number of positive train control components required, the number installed, equipped, or deployed, the remaining components to be installed, equipped, or deployed, and an estimated completion date for full positive train control system completion. Additionally, the reports should summarize the number of employees involved in the implementation process. The progress reports from railroad carriers and entities must include details on the number of employees needing training, the status of training activities, and challenges to positive train control system implementation such as testing, interoperability, and certification issues. The term 'component' refers to locomotive apparatus or wayside equipment. The term 'component' in positive train control system implementation refers to various equipment such as locomotive apparatus, wayside interface units, and radios. The Secretary must make progress reports from railroad carriers public within 30 days. SEC. 4. Positive train control required on high-hazard flammable trains. Section 20157(a)(1) of title 49, United States Code is amended to require each main line with 20 or more tank cars of flammable materials to comply with safety regulations. Section 20157(a)(1) of title 49, United States Code is amended to require compliance with safety regulations for main lines with 20 or more tank cars of flammable materials. SEC. 5. COORDINATION OF SPECTRUM. The Secretary of Transportation and the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission will assess spectrum needs for positive train control systems within 120 days of the enactment of the Positive Train Control Safety Act. They may consult with external stakeholders. SEC. 6. CONFIDENTIAL CLOSE CALL REPORTING SYSTEMS. The Positive Train Control Safety Act mandates the Secretary of Transportation to establish regulations for confidential close call reporting systems within a year of enactment. This system aims to protect railroad carrier employees and utilize third parties for data collection and distribution. The Positive Train Control Safety Act requires railroad carriers to develop and submit a confidential close call reporting system program to the Secretary for approval within 180 days of final regulations being promulgated. The program must outline core principles, stakeholder roles, concerns, and operational details. The Secretary will review and approve or disapprove proposed close call reporting programs from railroad carriers promptly. If a program is not approved, the carrier must address deficiencies within a specified timeframe. Carriers must also update their programs as necessary and obtain approval for major changes. Each applicable railroad carrier must establish a confidential close call reporting system within 2 years of the Positive Train Control Safety Act enactment. The system should provide a safe environment for employees to report unsafe events and protect them from discipline for reporting within the system. Each applicable railroad carrier must establish a confidential close call reporting system to collect information for targeted corrective actions and identify safety issues before accidents occur. The carrier must consult and reach agreement with directly affected employees, including labor organizations, on the program's development and implementation. If consensus cannot be reached on a proposed program between an applicable railroad carrier and its directly affected employees, a statement can be filed with the Secretary explaining their views. Non-applicable carriers can voluntarily establish a program under this section, subject to regulations. The Secretary may use confidential close call reporting data for implementing the Federal Railroad Administration's National Inspection Plan, performing focused inspections, and developing rulemakings and guidance. The term 'applicable railroad carrier' refers to Class I carriers with inadequate safety performance or those providing intercity or commuter rail passenger transportation. Authorization of appropriations is provided for implementing this section. The Secretary may use close call reporting data for implementing the Federal Railroad Administration's National Inspection Plan and developing rulemakings and guidance. Authorization of appropriations is provided for nationwide implementation of confidential close call reporting system programs. SEC. 7. COMMUTER RAIL TRACK INSPECTIONS. Sec. 20170 of title 49, United States Code, requires commuter rail carriers to conduct regular track inspections on high density commuter railroad lines, including traversing main lines by vehicle or inspecting on foot at least once every 2 weeks, and inspecting sidings monthly. This does not limit the Secretary's authority to regulate or issue guidelines. The Secretary's authority to regulate or issue guidelines for commuter rail carriers' track inspections is limited under title 49, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on the effectiveness of positive train control in reducing collisions at highway-rail grade crossings. Appropriations are authorized for this study. Additionally, there will be a study on redundant signal protection. SEC. 9 of the Positive Train Control Safety Act mandates the Secretary of Transportation to require on-track safety programs to include redundant signal protection for maintenance-of-way work crews."
