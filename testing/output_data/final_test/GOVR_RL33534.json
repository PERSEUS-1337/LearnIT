    "content": "Prior to 1979, China had a centrally planned economy under Chairman Mao Zedong, with state control over production, prices, and resources. Industrial production was mainly from state-owned enterprises, with limited foreign trade to maintain self-sufficiency. Foreign trade in China was limited to goods not produced domestically, leading to economic distortions. The centrally managed economy lacked market mechanisms for resource allocation, hindering productivity. Despite reported GDP growth of 6.7% from 1953 to 1978, the accuracy of data has been questioned due to potential exaggeration by officials for political reasons. During Mao Zedong's leadership, China experienced significant economic downturns, including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, leading to a drop in living standards. From 1950 to 1978, China's per capita GDP doubled, but living standards fell by 20.3% from 1958 to 1962 and 9.6% from 1966 to 1968. China's economic growth lagged behind Western countries like Japan. In 1978, after Chairman Mao's death, the Chinese government shifted to free market principles to boost economic growth. Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms, including incentives for farmers and special economic zones to attract foreign investment and technology. China implemented economic reforms in stages, decentralizing economic policymaking, giving control to local governments, encouraging entrepreneurship, and liberalizing trade. This led to the designation of open cities and development zones, the elimination of state price controls, and the removal of trade barriers, attracting foreign investment and fostering economic success. Since the introduction of economic reforms, China's economy has grown substantially faster, with an average annual real GDP growth of 9.6% from 1979 to 2016. The global economic slowdown in 2008 had a significant impact, leading to 20 million migrant workers losing their jobs. During the global economic slowdown in 2008, China implemented a $586 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the financial crisis. This led to a real GDP growth averaging 9.7% from 2008 to 2010. However, GDP growth slowed in the following years, declining to 6.7% in 2016. The IMF projected further slowdown, with China's real GDP expected to reach 5.7% in 2022. China's rapid economic growth is attributed to large-scale capital investment and rapid productivity growth, fueled by high domestic savings and foreign investment. Economic reforms in 1979 led to increased efficiency, boosting output and resources for further investment. China's gross savings as a percentage of GDP is the highest among major economies, driven by growth in household and corporate savings. China's rapid economic growth is fueled by high domestic savings, which as a percentage of GDP is the highest among major economies. The large level of savings has enabled China to boost domestic investment significantly. Productivity gains, particularly through reallocating resources to more productive sectors like manufacturing, have also played a crucial role in China's economic growth. China's economic growth was driven by private firms engaging in productive activities, outperforming state-owned enterprises. The export sector faced competitive pressures, while FDI brought new technology and efficiency. However, China's growth may slow without major technological innovation or economic reforms. Other developing economies in Asia and Latin America also experienced rapid development. Several developing economies in Asia and Latin America experienced rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s by implementing policies similar to China's current strategies. However, some of these countries fell into the \"middle-income trap\" due to sustained economic stagnation caused by structural inefficiencies. China may face a similar challenge according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Economist Intelligence Unit projects that China's real GDP growth will slow and eventually converge with U.S. growth rates by 2036. China aims to shift towards \"smart\" economic growth, reducing reliance on energy-intensive industries and focusing on high technology and services for more balanced economic growth. Analysts speculate on when China will surpass the U.S. as the world's largest economic power. China's economy is projected to overtake the United States as the world's largest economic power. The debate on China's actual economic size revolves around the use of nominal exchange rates to measure GDP. Economists argue that these rates fail to accurately reflect China's true economic size and living standards compared to the U.S. due to differences in prices for goods and services across countries. The purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate is used to estimate the actual purchasing power of different currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Economists use this to make accurate comparisons of economic data across countries. China's economy benefits from a lower cost of goods and services compared to the United States, leading to a higher estimated measurement of its GDP and per capita income. China's GDP in 2017 was $23.1 trillion on a PPP basis, surpassing the U.S. as the world's largest economy. China's share of global GDP on a PPP basis rose to 18.3% in 2017, while the U.S. fell to 15.3%. By 2022, China's economy is predicted to be 46.6% larger than the U.S. on a PPP basis. China's economy is projected to be 46.6% larger than the U.S. economy by 2022 on a PPP basis. Despite rapid growth, it may take years for Chinese living standards to reach U.S. levels. China has become the world's largest manufacturer, overtaking Japan. China became the world's second-largest manufacturer in 2006, surpassing Japan, and the United States in 2010. By 2014, China's manufacturing value was 39.6% higher than the U.S. Manufacturing plays a significant role in China's economy, with gross value added manufacturing equal to 27.7% of its GDP, compared to 12.1% for the U.S. Deloitte ranked China as the most competitive manufacturer in 2016, with the U.S. ranking second. Global executives predict the U.S. will overtake China as the most competitive economy by 2020 due to heavy investment in talent and technology. China became the world's second-largest manufacturer in 2006, surpassing Japan and the United States in 2010. By 2014, China's manufacturing value was 39.6% higher than the U.S. Deloitte ranked China as the most competitive manufacturer in 2016, with the U.S. ranking second. However, China was projected to fall to the second-most competitive manufacturer by 2020 due to challenges such as a slowing economy, declining value-added manufacturing, rising labor costs, and an aging population. The World Economic Forum produces an annual Global Competitive Report to assess and rank economies based on various factors. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitive Report ranks countries based on productivity and prosperity levels. In 2016-2017, China was 28th and the US was third. China's competitive advantage due to low wages is diminishing as wages rise. In 1990, China's average monthly wages were $37, compared to $54 for Vietnam and $505 for Mexico. In 2016, China's average monthly wages were $854. In 2016, China's average monthly wages were $854, 306.7% higher than Vietnam's wages ($210) and 122.3% higher than Mexico's ($384). China's unit labor production costs were 75% of U.S. levels in 2016, up from 47% in 1990. Rising labor costs were a major concern for U.S. firms in China according to the AmCham China survey. China's trade and investment reforms led to a surge in FDI and productivity gains. In 2010, China had 445,244 foreign-invested enterprises employing 55.2 million workers. These enterprises accounted for a significant share of China's industrial output, reaching a high of 35.9% in 2003 but falling to 25.9% in 2011. Additionally, FIEs were responsible for a significant portion of China's foreign trade, with levels peaking in 2005 at 58.3% of exports and 59.7% of imports. China has become a major recipient and provider of global FDI, with FDI inflows estimated at $134 billion in 2016, making it the world's third-largest recipient of FDI. China received $134 billion in FDI in 2016, ranking as the world's third-largest recipient. China's FDI outflows in 2016 were $183 billion, making it the world's second-largest source. The increase in outflows is driven by government policies to encourage firms to expand globally and gain access to technology and brands. This strategy aims to boost innovation, develop Chinese brands, and help firms compete globally amidst a slowing economy and rising labor costs. Chinese overseas FDI has increased due to rising labor costs, with a focus on diversifying risk and expanding business opportunities beyond the domestic market. In 2016, Chinese nonfinancial FDI in BRI countries reached $14.5 billion, with new contracts totaling $126 billion signed. The Chinese government is also looking to diversify its foreign exchange reserves, which totaled $3.1 trillion in 2017, by investing in low-cost countries. Additionally, a large share of China's reserves have been allocated to U.S. Treasury securities for their safety and liquidity, despite earning relatively small returns. According to Chinese government data, the largest sources of nonfinancial FDI inflows into China were Hong Kong, Macau, the British Virgin Islands, Japan, Singapore, and the United States. In 2016, the largest sources were Hong Kong, Macau, BVI, Singapore, South Korea, the United States, and Taiwan. Annual U.S. nonfinancial FDI flows to China peaked at $5.4 billion in 2002, but in 2016, they were $2.4 billion. China estimates the stock of U.S. nonfinancial FDI in China at $80 billion through 2016. China aimed to attract FDI to boost domestic firm development during the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, China shifted to a \"go global\" strategy to encourage Chinese firms, especially SOEs, to invest overseas. This was driven by the country's large foreign exchange reserves, traditionally invested in low-yielding assets. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was established in 2007 to seek higher returns and diversify away from U.S. dollar holdings, with an initial funding of $200 billion. This move aimed to obtain natural resources and expand China's global presence. The Chinese government's drive to encourage outward FDI flows aims to obtain natural resources and develop globally competitive Chinese firms. This includes investing in foreign firms for technology and management skills. For example, Lenovo Group Limited purchased IBM Corporation's personal computer division in 2005. China's FDI outflows by destination for 2015 are listed. China's FDI outflows by destination for 2015 are detailed in Table 3, with Hong Kong receiving the largest share. The American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation track Chinese investment globally through the China Global Investment Tracker database. The China Global Investment Tracker database reports Chinese outward nonbond investment exceeding $100 million, with top destinations including the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Russia. In 2017, Chinese FDI in the United States was $24.5 billion, with the largest acquisition being HNA's purchase of CIT Group's aircraft leasing business for $10.4 billion. China's economic reforms and trade liberalization have propelled it into a major trading power, with merchandise exports reaching $2.3 trillion in 2017. China's trade has grown significantly, with merchandise exports reaching $2.3 trillion in 2017. China became the largest trading partner for 130 countries in 2013. Despite a slowdown in trade flows since 2011, China's exports and imports have continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. China's exports and imports fell from 2014 to 2016 due to a sluggish global economy and lower commodity prices. However, in 2017, both exports and imports increased. China's trade surplus fluctuated over the years, reaching a record high in 2015 before decreasing in 2016 and 2017. China became the world's largest merchandise exporter in 2009 and the largest trading economy in 2012. China's share of global merchandise exports grew from 2.0% in 1990 to 14.1% in 2015, but fell to 13.2% in 2017. China's top three export markets were the United States, the EU28, and Hong Kong, while its top sources for imports were the EU28, ASEAN, and South Korea. China maintained large trade surpluses with the United States, Hong Kong, and the EU28, and reported large trade imbalances with Taiwan and South Korea. China's trade data differ significantly from its trading partners due to how trade via Hong Kong is counted. China's exports through Hong Kong are considered Chinese exports, while other countries attribute them to China. China's low-cost labor makes it competitive in labor-intensive manufacturing, with manufactured products forming a significant part of its trade. Imports consist of parts assembled into finished products for export, with minimal value-added by Chinese workers. China's top imports and exports in 2017 included electrical machinery, mineral fuels, nuclear reactors, machinery, ores, and instruments. China has engaged in trade agreements with Asian countries to boost trade and investment ties globally. In 2017, China had free trade agreements with 22 partners, including ASEAN countries, Australia, Chile, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Macau, Iceland, New Zealand, Pakistan, Peru, Switzerland, South Korea, and an economic cooperation framework agreement with Taiwan. The combined GDP and population of these countries was $15.6 trillion and 1.0 billion, respectively. The United States had FTAs with 20 countries with a combined GDP of $10.9 trillion and population of 465 million. China also signed FTAs with Georgia and Maldives. China has signed FTAs with Georgia and Maldives in 2017, with negotiations ongoing for agreements with several countries including Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Israel, Norway, and Japan. China is also considering FTA negotiations with Canada, Colombia, Mongolia, Fiji, and others. In 2012, China joined negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with ASEAN, Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, and New Zealand, potentially forming the world's largest free trade bloc. China's economic rise and impact on global trade have made it a key factor in U.S. trade policy debates. The country did not participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) but its trade policies influenced U.S. motivation for the agreement. China has also been actively engaging in Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with various countries, including Georgia, Maldives, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Israel, Norway, and Japan. Additionally, China is considering FTA negotiations with Canada, Colombia, Mongolia, and Fiji. The TPP was seen as a way to counter China's influence and push for economic reforms. It aimed to address economic differences between the US and China, such as SOE preferences and IPR protection. The agreement was also seen as a model for future FTAs. The Trump Administration's decision to withdraw from the TPP and pursue bilateral FTAs changed the course of US trade policy. The decision to terminate U.S. participation in the TPP has raised concerns about its impact on the country's role in the Asia-Pacific region and globally. Analysts believe it has damaged U.S. credibility with trading partners and weakened its ability to pressure China for economic reforms. Former USTR Michael Froman expressed confusion over the inconsistency of being tough on China while withdrawing from the TPP, stating it would be a significant gift to China with far-reaching consequences. The decision to terminate U.S. participation in the TPP has raised concerns about its impact on the country's role in the Asia-Pacific region and globally. Analysts believe it has damaged U.S. credibility with trading partners and weakened its ability to pressure China for economic reforms. Some analysts argue that China is already positioning itself as a major advocate of the global trading system, despite its protectionist economic policies. Chinese President Xi Jinping's attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2017 was seen as a significant move in this direction. In a keynote speech at a forum, Xi emphasized the importance of global free trade and investment, promoting liberalization and opposing protectionism. China supports open and transparent regional free trade agreements and opposes exclusive groups. The remaining 11 TPP members formed the CPTPP without the US. President Trump expressed willingness to negotiate bilateral trade agreements at the World Economic Forum. China is restructuring its economic model to focus on sustainable growth, emphasizing private consumption and innovation. The old growth model, which prioritized rapid economic growth at any cost, has led to various issues like pollution and income inequality. The US is open to negotiating bilateral trade agreements with all countries, including those in the TPP, either individually or as a group if beneficial. China is shifting towards private consumption and innovation as new drivers of the economy, aiming for sustainable growth. Implementing new economic reforms is crucial to avoid stagnant growth and living standards. Despite three decades of economic reforms, China maintains a \"socialist-market economy\" where the government still plays a significant role in development. China's State Council reports that China has a large number of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) at both central and local government levels, accounting for up to 50% of nonagriculture GDP. Despite a decline in numbers, SOEs still dominate key sectors, are shielded from competition, and are encouraged to invest overseas. They also dominate China's stock indexes and are significant players in the global economy, with 103 Chinese firms listed in Fortune's 2016 list of the world's 500 largest companies. In Fortune's 2016 list of the world's 500 largest companies, 103 Chinese firms were listed, with 75 of them having the government owning 50% or more of the company. These 75 firms generated $7.2 trillion in revenues, had assets valued at $20.7 trillion, and employed 16.2 million workers. China's banking system is dominated by state-owned or state-controlled banks, with the top five largest banks in China being state-owned entities. The majority of China's banking assets are held by state-owned commercial banks, government policy banks, and joint-stock commercial banks with government entities as major shareholders, totaling 68.5% of total bank assets. Foreign participation in the banking system is minimal at 1.6%. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) receive preferential credit treatment, accounting for 85% of bank loans in 2009. Analysts believe that SOEs often do not repay their loans, leading to a growing number of nonperforming loans. The banking system lacks the ability to allocate credit based on market principles. The Chinese banking system lacks the ability to allocate credit based on market principles, leading to a rapid increase in domestic credit from 2007 to 2016. China's debt levels have risen sharply, sparking concerns of a future economic crisis. China's total nonfinancial sector debt as a percentage of GDP increased significantly from 2006 to mid-2016, with much of the rise coming from the corporate sector. China's corporate debt rose from $3 trillion to $17.8 trillion during this period, exceeding U.S. corporate debt levels. Concerns have been raised about China's extensive credit growth potentially leading to overcapacity, bubbles in real estate, and reduced productivity. Local government debt in China has increased significantly, reaching $4.3 trillion in 2015. Efforts to restructure and restrict borrowing have had mixed success due to pressure on local governments to maintain economic growth. China's closed capital account and restrictions on capital flows have led to debt problems and distorted financial markets. The economic model has created internal imbalances with high savings and fixed investment, raising concerns about sustainability. From 1990 to 2014, Chinese gross savings and gross fixed investment as a percentage of GDP increased significantly, while private consumption declined sharply. China's high savings and investment rates are among the world's highest, while private consumption is low. This disparity suggests that Chinese households have not benefited as much from economic growth compared to other sectors. Economists attribute this to China's banking policies and lack of a social safety net, along with restrictions on capital export by the government. The Chinese government imposes restrictions on capital export, leading households to save in domestic banks. Low interest rates set by the government, below inflation, reduce household income, benefiting Chinese firms. The lack of a social safety net in China prompts high savings rates, with urban households saving 32% of income. Corporations, especially SOEs, retain earnings instead of paying dividends, contributing to the high savings rate. Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) do not pay dividends, allowing them to retain earnings. Requiring them to pay dividends could potentially boost private consumption in China. Chinese economic policies have focused on gross fixed investment as the main driver of economic growth from 2000 to 2014. The global financial crisis reduced demand for Chinese exports, leading to a decrease in trade surpluses. The Chinese government responded to reduced trade surpluses by increasing fixed investment, leading to a rise in fixed investment as a share of GDP. In recent years, there has been some rebalancing of China's economy, with private consumption becoming the largest contributor to GDP growth in 2015 and 2016. China's gross savings rate decreased, while private consumption and gross fixed investment as a percentage of GDP increased. In recent years, China's gross fixed investment as a percentage of GDP decreased from 45.2% to 42.4%. The output of services overtook industrial output for the first time in 2012, with services growing in importance through 2016. China's exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP dropped from 38.3% in 2006 to 20.5% in 2016, leading to a decrease in trade surpluses as a percentage of GDP. China has consistently run current account surpluses since 1994, with a peak of 9.9% of GDP in 2007. However, the surplus has since decreased to 2.4% in 2016, partly due to the global economic slowdown reducing demand for Chinese exports. Chinese private consumption has been growing rapidly, with an average annual growth of 8.9% over the past decade. China's heavy industry growth has led to increased pollution levels, posing health risks. The level of pollution in China is worsening, posing serious health risks. The government often disregards environmental laws to promote economic growth. Reports estimate that China's CO2 emissions will surpass the US and EU combined by 2025. The health costs of air pollution in 2015 were estimated at $1.4 trillion, equivalent to 7.8% of GDP. The costs of air pollution, water pollution, and soil degradation were significant as a percentage of GDP each year from 2000 to 2010. The Chinese government's poor enforcement of environmental regulations led to a deadly explosion in Tianjin in 2015, causing at least 163 deaths. Concerns were raised about the proximity of dangerous chemicals to residential areas and the resulting chemical contamination. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing reported unhealthy to hazardous air quality levels in January 2013. In January 2013, Beijing experienced severe air pollution levels, termed \"Airpocalypse,\" leading to government actions like shutting down factories and reducing official cars on the road. China's media reported widespread smog covering half of the country. The U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai also reported hazardous air quality levels in December 2013. Additionally, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing noted that nearly two-thirds of days from 2008 to 2015 had unhealthy air pollution levels. According to reports, 90% of Chinese cities have polluted groundwater, with two-thirds severely polluted. Less than 1% of the 500 largest cities in China meet air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization. The Chinese government is taking steps to reduce energy consumption, enforce environmental laws, and shift away from coal usage. Efforts to reduce pollution have had mixed results. China is a major producer and user of clean energy technology, with plans to invest $361 billion in renewable energy. The Chinese government plans to invest $361 billion in renewable energy by 2020, but the lack of rule of law and government corruption in China hinder competition and efficient allocation of goods and services. US firms face challenges in China due to inconsistent regulations, unenforceable contracts, and lack of intellectual property rights protection. Former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's family reportedly controlled assets worth $2.7 billion. Premier Wen Jiabao's family controlled assets worth $2.7 billion. China was a major source of illicit capital outflows. Corruption is a significant issue in China, with officials acknowledging it as a threat to the Communist Party. Xi Jinping has led an extensive anticorruption campaign since 2012. China has sought cooperation with the US to extradite corrupt officials. Analysts believe some anticorruption efforts are politically motivated. Some analysts argue that government anticorruption campaigns in China are used to settle political scores, with President Xi Jinping's drive seen as more about consolidating his own power than instituting reforms. There are concerns that the campaign is impacting the economy, as local officials are hesitant to pursue projects that may attract central government scrutiny. Observers believe that true progress against corruption requires greater transparency, checks and balances, a free press, Internet freedom, and an independent judiciary. China's efforts to enhance the rule of law have been criticized for emphasizing the Communist Party's control over the legal system. China's weak and decentralized government structure leads to lax enforcement of laws, resulting in unsafe products being sold domestically and abroad. The lack of food safety enforcement caused a major recall in 2008. China ranks 79th in corruption perception. The one-child policy is impacting the economy. China's declining fertility rate is impacting the Chinese economy by shrinking the workforce, which was once a key factor in the country's rapid economic growth. The labor force is reportedly decreasing, leading to concerns about a potential labor shortage in the future. China's labor force in China could shrink by one-fifth over the next 50 years, leading to slower economic growth. The one-child policy has resulted in an aging society with 180 million people over 60, expected to reach 360 million by 2030. This demographic shift poses challenges for boosting worker productivity and increasing spending on healthcare and elderly services. President Xi's report to the 19th Party Congress in November 2017 outlined China's goals to become a \"moderately prosperous society in all respects\" by 2050. This includes addressing income disparities, boosting living standards for poor and rural people, making private consumption the driver of the economy, reducing pollution, promoting innovation, and improving overall living standards through technology development and increased spending on health care and elderly services. The Hukou system poses challenges to the government in achieving these goals. China aims to integrate internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy to drive growth in consumption, innovation, green economy, and modern supply chains. The country plans to upgrade traditional industries, develop modern service sectors, and move industries to the medium-high end of the global value chain. China will pursue trade and investment reforms to promote liberalization and ease market access. China plans to significantly ease market access, open the service sector, and protect foreign investors' rights. All businesses will be treated equally, with a focus on improving state-owned sector management and assets. Reforms will aim to strengthen state capital, prevent asset loss, develop mixed-ownership entities, and enhance Chinese enterprises globally. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched in 2013, aims to boost economic integration and connectivity with neighboring countries and trading partners. President Xi emphasized the initiative's focus on promoting infrastructure construction, enhancing economic policy coordination, and achieving common prosperity through interconnected development. The BRI is open to partners worldwide and looks towards the future while rooted in history. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) launched in 2013 aims to boost economic integration and connectivity with neighboring countries and trading partners. It focuses on Asian, European, and African continents, open to all partners. The BRI includes infrastructure development, regional political cooperation, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people exchanges, serving Beijing's vision for regional integration. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a grand strategy by China to address internal and external economic challenges and establish itself as a leading power in the region. Many details of the initiative, such as participating countries and funding, remain unclear. China has signed cooperation agreements with numerous countries under the BRI, with pledges to spend $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion. China's Belt and Road Initiative aims to boost its economy and soft power image by investing trillions of dollars in infrastructure projects. However, there are financial risks involved if loans are not repaid or recipient countries do not benefit. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has criticized certain aspects of the initiative. China's financing mechanisms in the region, particularly through the New Development Bank, result in high levels of debt for recipient countries. Infrastructure projects often do not create local jobs, leading to the use of foreign workers. The financing structure makes it hard for countries to secure future funding, with triggers that can lead to default and debt-to-equity conversion. The new $100 billion Asian Infrastructure Development Bank (AIIB) was launched by China in October 2014 to fund infrastructure projects in Asia. Fifty-seven nations joined as founding members, with the AIIB headquartered in Beijing and open for business in January 2016. The \"Made in China 2025\" initiative aims to increase Chinese industries' competitiveness, foster Chinese brands, boost innovation, and reduce reliance on foreign technology by 2049. China's \"Made in China 2025\" initiative aims to increase manufacturing power by 2049, with goals of domestically manufacturing basic components and materials. The plan also aims for China to become a global leader in telecommunication, railway, and electrical power equipment by 2025. Concerns have been raised about the methods China plans to use, including subsidies, protection of domestic industries, and pressure on foreign firms to transfer technology. China's Made in China 2025 initiative poses a serious challenge to global trading systems, including the US, Europe, and Japan. The initiative's ambitious goals and significant resources dedicated to achieving them could lead to market distortions and excess capacity in targeted industries. China's economic growth has boosted its confidence in its economic model, presenting key challenges for foreign participation in Chinese markets. China's leadership is confident in its economic model, posing challenges for the US to convince China to play a more active role in maintaining the international trading system. Lowering trade barriers in China could benefit consumers and spur innovation, but concerns exist about state intervention in innovation and technology development. Some advocate engagement with China through forums like the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, while others suggest a mix of engagement and aggressive use of WTO dispute settlement procedures. There are also those who believe in containing China's economic power and using punitive measures to address unfair trade policies. Responding to China's Belt and Road Initiative is seen as a challenge to U.S. global economic interests. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) raises concerns for U.S. policymakers regarding transparency, debt burdens on participating countries, and the potential spread of China's economic system."
