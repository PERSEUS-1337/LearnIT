    "title": "AB 1324",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature amends Section 38501 of the Health and Safety Code, stating that global warming poses a serious threat to California's economy, public health, natural resources, and environment. Adverse impacts include air quality problems, reduced water supply from the Sierra snowpack, rising sea levels displacing coastal businesses and residences, damage to marine ecosystems, and increased health issues. Global warming will harm California's key industries like agriculture, wine, tourism, and fishing. It will strain electricity supplies for air-conditioning. California leads in energy conservation and environmental efforts, setting standards for air quality, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and greenhouse gas emissions. The program aims to keep California at the forefront of global emission reduction efforts. California's actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have far-reaching effects, encouraging other states, the federal government, and other countries to take action. By leading in global efforts, California will benefit its economy and technology centers, positioning itself as a leader in reducing emissions and developing innovative technologies. The State Air Resources Board will coordinate with various stakeholders, including state agencies, the environmental justice community, industry sectors, business groups, academic institutions, and environmental organizations, in implementing emissions reduction measures. They will also consult with the Public Utilities Commission to develop limits on greenhouse gas emissions for electricity and natural gas providers to avoid duplicative regulations. The Legislature intends for the State Air Resources Board to design emissions reduction measures to meet statewide greenhouse gas limits in a cost-effective manner, improve California's economy and energy infrastructure, and maintain electric system reliability. The Climate Action Team will continue coordinating climate policy efforts. Definitions for terms in this division are specified in Section 38505 of the Health and Safety Code. In Section 38505, terms related to greenhouse gas emissions are defined, including \"Allowance\" for emission authorization, \"Alternative compliance mechanism\" for approved emission reduction actions, and \"Carbon dioxide equivalent\" for measuring global warming impact. The curr_chunk defines terms related to greenhouse gas emissions, including cost-effectiveness, direct emission reduction, emissions reduction measures, and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. It also explains greenhouse gas emissions limits as the authorized level of emissions in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents during a specified year. The curr_chunk defines terms related to greenhouse gas emissions, including sources, leakage, and market-based compliance mechanisms for reducing emissions. The curr_chunk defines terms related to greenhouse gas emissions, including statewide emissions expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. The curr_chunk defines the \"Statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit\" as the maximum allowable level of statewide greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 and beyond, determined by the state board."
