    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Department of Energy Small Business and Industry Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998\". It includes findings related to the Department of Energy. Congress finds that partnerships between contractor-operated facilities of the Department of Energy and small businesses can enhance growth of competitive small business opportunities, as these facilities represent a national resource in science and technology. Capacity for innovation in the United States is enhanced when the capabilities of these facilities are engaged with other providers and users of the Nation's science and technology base. Contributors to the Nation's science and technology delivery system can best perform their missions through partnerships and interactions that leverage the resources of each entity. Interactions between contractor-operated facilities, industry, and universities enhance technology base, instill sound business practices, benefit from leading-edge research, recruit talent, and improve products and processes for a competitive advantage. The science and technology developed by contractor-operated facilities can benefit other Federal agencies in advancing their missions. The Act aims to enhance collaboration between small businesses, Federal agencies, industry, and universities with Department of Energy contractor-operated facilities. It also promotes partnerships with universities and industries, as well as interactions with small businesses to support commercial development of science and technology. SEC. 4. CONTRACT RESEARCH SERVICES. Amends Section 31a of the Atomic Energy Act to include areas of technology within the Department of Energy's mission. SEC. 5. COST RECOVERY. Amends Section 33 to address research for others. The text chunk discusses cost recovery for work performed at contractor-operated facilities of the Department of Energy, limiting the Secretary of Energy to recover only the full cost incurred. Administrative costs are to be funded from departmental administration accounts, and charges for work done for external customers are also addressed. The paragraph discusses how a contractor-operated facility can charge an external customer for work performed, including direct costs and a share of overhead charges. SEC. 6. PARTNERSHIPS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND INDUSTRY. Amends Chapter 4 of the Atomic Energy Act to include a new section on contractor-operated facilities of the Department of Energy. In this subsection, \"metrics\" refer to measurements for performance levels. Metrics are jointly developed by the Secretary of Energy and contractors to set realistic goals in support of facility missions. They are included in facility operation contracts and used to assess partnership effectiveness. The Secretary of Energy encourages partnerships with universities and private industry at contractor-operated facilities. These partnerships are evaluated annually as part of performance assessments. Contractors are required to create small business technology partnership programs at each facility. The Secretary of Energy evaluates the effectiveness of small business technology partnership programs at contractor-operated facilities annually to ensure opportunities for small businesses. Funds from the program cover interaction costs, not direct monetary grants. The Energy Act of 1954 is amended to include provisions related to chapter 4 of title I.
