    "content": "The \"Cut Energy Bills at Home Act\" is cited as the short title. The Act includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to performance-based home energy improvements. A new section, SEC. 25E, is added to address these improvements. The \"Cut Energy Bills at Home Act\" adds a new section, SEC. 25E, to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It allows for a tax credit for qualified whole home energy efficiency retrofits for individuals. The credit amount is determined based on a base amount of $2,000 and additional reductions in energy use. The tax credit amount for qualified home energy efficiency retrofits is determined based on a base amount of $2,000 and additional reductions in energy use. The maximum credit is $5,000 per residence or 30% of qualified expenditures. Energy use reduction is calculated by modeling annual predicted percentage reduction in total energy. The annual predicted percentage reduction in total energy costs for heating, cooling, hot water, and lighting is modeled using approved computer software. Energy costs are determined by dividing the total energy bill by the energy units used. Qualified home energy efficiency expenditures are defined in this section. The term 'qualified home energy efficiency expenditures' refers to amounts paid for a qualified whole home energy efficiency retrofit, excluding certain expenses like building envelope expansion, swimming pool improvements, or hot tubs. The retrofit must have an average estimated life of 5 years or more. A qualified whole home energy efficiency retrofit involves implementing measures to reduce energy use in the taxpayer's principal residence in the US. The retrofit must be designed and installed by a contractor accredited by the Building Performance Institute or a state certification program aligned with BPI standards. The text chunk discusses the requirements for a qualified whole home energy efficiency retrofit, including the accreditation of contractors and the installation of measures to achieve a 20 percent reduction in energy use. The model must be calibrated using specific standards, document measures with before and after photos, and implement a test-out procedure following certification program guidelines. After consultation with the Secretary of Energy, ensure safe operation of systems post retrofit and that improvements are installed according to certification program standards. Organizations or States may submit equivalent certification programs for approval by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy must approve or deny equivalent certification programs within 180 days. Approved modeling software must follow specific standards. The Secretary will prescribe regulations in consultation with the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy will prescribe regulations for documentation required to claim the credit, including a form completed by the contractor stating procedures followed and software used for calculating energy savings. The contractor must provide details of calculations and energy bills for 5 years, list installed measures, and certify software used for energy savings. The contractor must provide documentation of the total project cost to comply with the limitation under subsection (b)(4)(B) and meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(A). No credit shall be allowed under this section for any taxable year if the taxpayer claims a credit under section 25C for the same residence. In the case of a renewable energy system or appliance qualifying for another credit, the reduction in energy use won't count towards the percentage energy use reductions. Qualified home energy efficiency expenditures do not include expenses claimed for a deduction or credit under this chapter or for which the taxpayer receives a Federal energy efficiency rebate. The term 'principal residence' has the same meaning as in section 121, with special rules applying. Rules similar to those in section 25D(e) and 25C(e)(2) apply for determining credits, with basis adjustments reducing property basis by the credit amount allowed. Taxpayers can elect not to claim the credit for a taxable year, and multiple year retrofits are allowed. The section allows for multiple year retrofits, with baseline energy use established after previous retrofit. The credit terminates for costs incurred after December 31, 2016. The Secretary will review retrofits for effectiveness and report findings to Congress by June 30, 2014. The text discusses improvements and expansion of the credit for rental units under section 25E, along with conforming amendments to related sections. The text discusses amendments to subchapter A chapter 1, inserting a new item after section 25D. The amendments made by this section apply to qualified whole home energy efficiency retrofits placed in service after December 31, 2011."
