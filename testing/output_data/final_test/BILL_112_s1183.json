    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act\". Congress acknowledges that mercury is a potent neurotoxin with significant ecological and public health implications. Approximately 410,000 children born in the US each year are exposed to levels of mercury that can impair neurological development. The CDC has found that 6% of women of childbearing age have unsafe blood mercury levels. Mercury exposure mainly occurs through contaminated fish consumption, which is crucial for dietary protein and the US economy. A national mercury monitoring network is needed to track atmospheric deposition, ecosystem contamination, and bioaccumulation in fish and wildlife. Computer models vary in predicting mercury concentrations in fish, and more data is needed to test these predictions. Mercury pollution in the US is primarily from atmospheric emissions, highlighting the importance of understanding sources and trends for policy makers and the public. The text chunk discusses the need for a national mercury monitoring network to track atmospheric deposition, ecosystem contamination, and bioaccumulation in fish and wildlife. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Program, Advisory Committee, Ancillary measure, Ecoregion, and Mercury export. The Act defines key terms such as mercury export, mercury flux, and surface sediment in relation to ecosystem components and water bodies. SEC. 4. MONITORING PROGRAM. Establishment of a national mercury monitoring program by the Administrator in consultation with various federal agencies to track long-term trends in atmospheric mercury concentrations, deposition, and mercury levels in watersheds, surface water, and wildlife in response to changing emissions. The Administrator will select multiple monitoring sites in various ecoregions of the United States, including National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, and sensitive ecological areas, to track changes in mercury emissions over time. The Administrator will establish standardized measurement protocols and a centralized database for the monitoring program, in coordination with the Advisory Committee. The program will establish a centralized database for environmental mercury data accessible online once quality standards are met. Monitoring will include measuring mercury levels in air and watersheds, recording wet and estimating dry mercury deposition, flux, and export. The program will monitor mercury levels in water and soil, including measuring reemitted mercury from environments and sulfur species to understand mercury cycling. This includes analyzing soil and sediment cores for total mercury and methyl mercury concentrations. The program will monitor total mercury and methyl mercury concentrations in surface water, throughout the water column, sediments, zooplankton, invertebrates, yearling fish, and commercially relevant fish. The program will measure total mercury concentrations in selected insect- and fish-eating birds and mammals. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Administrator will establish a scientific advisory committee called the \"Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee\" to advise on the national mercury monitoring program. The committee will consist of non-government scientists appointed by various federal agencies. The \"Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee\" will include scientists appointed by different federal agencies, such as the Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Geological Survey, National Park Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Administrator is required to submit reports to Congress every 2 years on the program, including trend data. Every 4 years, an assessment of mercury deposition rates must be included to prevent adverse effects. All data obtained under this Act must be made available to the public. Appropriations of $37,000,000 for 2012, $29,000,000 for 2013, and $29,000,000 for 2014 are authorized."
