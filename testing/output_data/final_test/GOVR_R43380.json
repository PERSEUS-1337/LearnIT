    "content": "The Gulf Coast region in the U.S. spans Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Environmental changes, including hydrology shifts, habitat loss, water quality issues, and human development, have prompted federal and state restoration efforts. Projects by agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fish and Wildlife Service, NOAA, and EPA aim to restore the region's ecosystem. Natural and manmade disasters have also impacted the Gulf Coast. The Gulf Coast region in the U.S. has been affected by large-scale natural and manmade disasters, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. These events have significantly impacted the environment and economy of the region, leading to changes in restoration efforts. The oil spill had short-term ecological effects and is expected to have long-term consequences, increasing attention towards restoring the Gulf Coast ecosystem. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill focused attention on natural resources impacted by the incident and long-term restoration issues. BP, as a responsible party, is liable for cleanup costs and damages. Oil cleanup operations have decreased, and funds have been allocated for environmental and economic restoration, including through the Clean Water Act. The RESTORE Act of 2012, along with other funding streams, provides resources for environmental and economic restoration in the Gulf Coast states. Funds are allocated for habitat restoration, economic development, and compensation for spill impacts. Congress oversees the distribution of funding to various entities for the restoration efforts. The RESTORE Act of 2012 established a framework for funding distribution to restore the Gulf Coast, including creating a trust fund for penalties under the Clean Water Act. Congress oversees the allocation of funds for ecosystem and economic restoration, as well as other ongoing restoration processes. Congress oversees multiple federal agencies funding and conducting restoration actions in the Gulf Coast region, including activities related to the Deepwater Horizon spill. The complex restoration processes are interrelated and largely funded outside the traditional appropriations process. With various funding sources for ecosystem and economic restoration, Congress is interested in how these processes coordinate and impact the Gulf Coast restoration efforts. The curr_chunk provides information on environmental damage and restoration activities related to the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf Coast region, including the implementation of the RESTORE Act. The region is home to over 22 million people and 15,000 species across five states, with interconnected ecosystems spanning 600,000 square miles. These ecosystems provide aesthetic, economic, and environmental values for residents, including coastal storm damage protection from barrier islands and wetland complexes. Barrier islands and wetland complexes in the Gulf Coast region provide coastal storm damage protection benefits and habitat for various species. These ecosystems also filter water, trap contaminants, and store carbon. The Deepwater Horizon spill, along with human development and natural processes, has altered these ecosystems over time. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill did not change many processes in the Gulf Coast region, but it did alter perspectives on restoration efforts by federal and state governments. Prior to the spill, various federal agencies were involved in ecosystem restoration initiatives, including the Louisiana Coastal Area Program aimed at wetland restoration. The spill highlighted the importance of ongoing federal restoration efforts in the Gulf. The Gulf Coast region lacks a comprehensive restoration initiative due to its size and ecosystem variability. There is no central entity responsible for planning or implementing restoration activities, leading to varied responsibilities among federal, state, local, and nonprofit entities. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas have major ongoing Corps restoration plans focused on specific projects. Mississippi and Texas have major ongoing Corps restoration plans focused on specific projects and ecosystems, while Alabama and northern Florida lack comparable coastal initiatives. The complexity of ecological issues in the Gulf Coast region, such as excess nutrients causing hypoxia, is connected to ecosystems outside the region. Efforts to restore the Gulf Coast region cut across regions, ecosystems, and federal agency jurisdictions. The Obama Administration initiated actions to restore the Gulf Coast region before the Deepwater Horizon spill. A roadmap was created to guide restoration efforts, but the spill altered the government's approach. New processes have been developed as a result of the spill. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill on April 20, 2010, resulted in 171 million gallons of oil discharged into the Gulf of Mexico. Approximately 50% of the oil had evaporated, dissolved, or been removed through human activities, but over 100 million gallons remained in the Gulf. The fate of this remaining oil is uncertain and may never be conclusively determined. Multiple challenges hinder the determination of the oil's fate. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 released 171 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Despite efforts to remove or break down the oil, over 100 million gallons remained, impacting the Gulf Coast ecosystem. The long-term effects of the spill are expected to persist, with significant damage to coastlines and habitats. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 released 171 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, impacting the Gulf Coast ecosystem. The effects of the oil spill were divided into four categories: Water Column Effects, Fisheries Effects, Effects on Other Species, and Habitat Effects. These effects include impacts on the food chain, temporary closure of fishing waters, impacts on animals' food availability, growth, reproduction, behavior, and disease, as well as potential erosion issues and harm to plants and animals in Gulf Coast habitats. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 released 171 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, impacting the Gulf Coast ecosystem. Scientists have documented various effects on the ecosystem, including reductions in biodiversity around the wellhead extending up to 17 km southwest and 8.5 km northeast. Recovery rates for the habitat could take decades or longer. Efforts post-spill focused on immediate impacts and monitoring the spread through ecosystems. The long-term effects on the seafood industry are also being assessed economically and environmentally. The Oil Pollution Act liability provisions address natural resource damages from the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf. Long-term restoration efforts also focus on pre-spill environmental issues. The Mabus Report commissioned by the Obama Administration outlined funding sources for Gulf Coast restoration, highlighting the challenges facing the region. The final report on Gulf Coast restoration highlighted the region's existing environmental challenges and recommended using ongoing efforts to address complex problems. It suggested dedicating civil penalties under the Clean Water Act towards Gulf restoration and establishing a Gulf Coast Recovery Council for future restoration actions. The Mabus Report recommended establishing a Gulf Coast Recovery Council to focus on improving the economy, public health, and ecosystem restoration in the region. President Obama then created the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force to develop a restoration strategy in December 2011, outlining goals, milestones, and policy areas for coordinated actions between government agencies. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force evaluated research programs and gaps in data collection, with goals to restore habitat, water quality, and protect marine resources. The enactment of the RESTORE Act led to the creation of the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, disbanding the task force. Various legislative actions and settlements have initiated efforts to restore the Gulf Coast region, each with different processes, leadership, and goals. The focus is on significant efforts to restore the Gulf Coast region, including RESTORE Act funding, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Gulf Coast Restoration Funding, and Natural Resource Damages under the Oil Pollution Act. Over $18.3 billion is expected to be allocated to these efforts from civil and criminal settlements. Economic claims and individual payments are not included in this discussion. Additional funding for Gulf Coast restoration activities is also available through various sources. The RESTORE Act, part of legislation enacted in 2012, establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund with 80% of Clean Water Act penalties from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Approximately $5.5 billion in penalties is expected to be available for Gulf Coast restoration efforts through the trust fund. The RESTORE Act allocates approximately $5.5 billion in Clean Water Act penalties to the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund through FY2031. The Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to determine annual expenditures from the fund, with investments in interest-bearing obligations for surplus funds. The Secretary can also audit and halt funding to entities not using the funds as prescribed. The RESTORE Act allocates $5.5 billion in Clean Water Act penalties to the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund through FY2031. The trust fund's authority terminates when all owed funds are provided and expended. Monies are distributed to entities through various components, with the largest being the \"Direct Component\" distributing 35% of funds equally to the five Gulf of Mexico states. The RESTORE Act allocates $5.5 billion in Clean Water Act penalties to the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund through FY2031. Other major components include the Council-Selected Restoration Component, the Spill Impact Component, and allocations for science and research grants. No more than 3% of the funds received can be used for administrative expenses. The largest portion of the fund is divided equally among the five Gulf of Mexico states. The RESTORE Act allocates $5.5 billion in Clean Water Act penalties to the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund through FY2031. The funding is divided equally among the five Gulf of Mexico states: Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, with specific distribution requirements for Florida and Louisiana. In Florida, the funding is divided among affected counties, with 75% going to \"disproportionately affected\" counties and 25% to \"non-disproportionately impacted\" counties. In Louisiana, 30% goes to individual parishes and the remainder to the state Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority Board. Other states will distribute the funding to similar state authorities or offices for specific activities outlined in the act. The state (or county) funding from the RESTORE Act must be used for activities such as restoration and protection of natural resources, mitigation of damage, workforce development, infrastructure projects, coastal flood protection, planning assistance, and promotion of tourism in the Gulf Coast region. Administrative costs are limited to 3% of a state's allotment. The RESTORE Act funds must be used for activities like restoration, protection of natural resources, workforce development, and promotion of tourism in the Gulf Coast region. States must meet conditions, submit implementation plans, and certify projects to receive funds. Under the RESTORE Act, states must meet conditions, submit implementation plans, and certify projects to receive funds for Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration. Funds can be used for various activities like restoration, protection of natural resources, and workforce development. The Act also authorizes the creation of the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council to govern restoration efforts. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, established under the RESTORE Act, consists of representatives from federal agencies and Gulf Coast states. It receives funding from the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund to implement a Comprehensive Plan for ecosystem restoration. The council also allocates funds to Gulf States based on a formula outlined in the Act. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, established under the RESTORE Act, implements a Comprehensive Plan for ecosystem restoration. The council published its draft Initial Comprehensive Plan in August 2013 and finalized the plan on December 16, 2016. The plan includes five restoration goals, project selection criteria, and funding details in line with the RESTORE Act. The Comprehensive Plan for ecosystem restoration under the RESTORE Act includes two components: Restoration Component and Spill Impact Component. Projects may not be balanced in addressing restoration goals, with a focus on water quality over natural processes and shorelines. Implementation responsibility lies with state or federal agencies, with the council serving as a managing and oversight entity. The Comprehensive Plan 2016 Update outlines the allocation of funds from the trust fund for restoration projects from 2017 to 2026. It includes a \"10-Year Funding Strategy\" and a \"Funded Priorities List\" as required by the RESTORE Act. Eligible activities focus on restoring and protecting natural resources in the Gulf Coast Region. The council is directed to disburse 30% of Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund monies. The council is directed to disburse 30% of Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund monies to the five Gulf States based on the impact of the oil spill in each state. A distribution formula was developed based on shoreline impact, oiled-shoreline distance, and coastal population. The final rule allocated Spill Impact Component funds to each state as follows: Alabama\u201420.40%; Florida\u201418.36%; Louisiana\u201434.59%; Mississippi\u201419.07%; and Texas\u20147.58%. Each state must submit a plan for approval to receive funding. The Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund allocates 30% of funds to the five Gulf States based on oil spill impact. Each state must submit a plan for approval to receive funding, with 25% of funds designated for infrastructure projects. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Science program is funded by 2.5% of the Trust Fund and supports marine research. The NOAA administrator will implement a program to support marine research projects in the Gulf of Mexico, focusing on monitoring ecosystems and collecting data on fisheries. The program emphasizes coordination with other entities to avoid duplication of efforts and will sunset when all funds are expended. Additionally, 2.5% of funds from the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund will be disbursed to establish centers of excellence in the Gulf States for science, technology, and monitoring in coastal areas. The Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund will distribute interest earned as follows: 50% for the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, 25% for the Restoration Science program, and 25% for research grants. Amounts of $816 million and $128 million have been deposited in the fund from settlements with Transocean. The Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund was established through settlements with Transocean, Anadarko Petroleum Company, and BP. BP agreed to pay $5.5 billion, with $4.4 billion going to the trust fund. The total funding, including previous settlements, amounts to $5.3 billion. As of spring 2017, the fund has distributed $26.7 million under the Direct Component and allocated over $200 million for Multiyear Implementation Plans. The council has approved $156.6 million in initial Funded Priorities List (FPL) projects, with $34.68 million completed in 2016. $6 million in grants have been awarded for planning activities related to the Spill Impact Component. Each state will develop State Expenditure Plans (SEPs) to use allocated funds. The NOAA RESTORE Act Science Program awarded $2.7 million to seven research teams in 2015, with $17 million available for research projects in 2017. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council approved the Comprehensive Plan Update in December 2016, setting goals based on the Mabus Report. The plan includes project selections under the FPL and the 10-Year Funding Strategy, with future FPLs planned every three years. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was scheduled to receive over $2.5 billion from BP and Transocean settlements in 2013 for Gulf Coast restoration projects. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) received over $2.5 billion for Gulf Coast restoration from BP and Transocean settlements in 2013. Established by Congress in 1984, NFWF is a nonprofit organization that administers mitigation funds for conservation purposes. The funds are directed towards creating or restoring barrier islands off the coast of Louisiana and implementing river projects as part of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill recovery settlements. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) received $2.5 billion for Gulf Coast restoration from BP and Transocean settlements in 2013. The funds will be used for projects to remedy harm caused by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with allocations to Gulf states based on specific proportions. The majority of funds are expected to be available in 2017 and 2018. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) received $2.5 billion for Gulf Coast restoration from BP and Transocean settlements in 2013. The payment schedule and allocations to individual states are detailed in Table 1. NFWF established the Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund (Gulf Fund) to carry out Gulf Coast restoration efforts under the settlement, consulting with state and federal natural resource management agencies. Gulf Coast restoration efforts, including projects funded by NFWF worth $880 million. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 allows governments to recover damages from parties responsible for oil spills. NOAA developed regulations for natural resource damage assessment. NOAA developed regulations for natural resource damage assessment under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in 1996. Damages may include direct and passive uses, with a focus on compensatory restoration. The Deepwater Horizon NRDA Trustees are responsible for overseeing these efforts. The Horizon NRDA Trustees, including federal and state agencies, conduct natural resource damage assessments after a spill to determine harm extent. The Deepwater Horizon NRDA process involves trustees from various government agencies working through three phases: preassessment, restoration planning, and restoration implementation. Currently, the process is in the restoration implementation phase, where project-specific restoration plans are developed and implemented in compliance with environmental laws. Early restoration projects can be completed during this phase to expedite the restoration of natural resources. The NRDA evaluation process is ongoing, and early restoration projects may be initiated to expedite restoration activities. Trustees for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill reached an agreement with BP to provide $1 billion for early restoration projects in the Gulf of Mexico. This Framework Agreement set the basis for subsequent early restoration actions, requiring agreement from all trustees, DOJ, and BP on funding and NRD Offsets for each project. The NRDA trustees solicited projects from the public for early restoration funds in five phases. The first two phases were completed in 2012, resulting in 10 projects costing $71 million. Phase III proposed 44 projects at $627 million, Phase IV proposed 10 projects at $134 million, and Phase V selected the Florida Coastal Access Project. The trustees have selected the first phase of the Florida Coastal Access Project for Phase V, aiming to enhance public access and recreational opportunities in the Florida Panhandle. The estimated cost for this phase is $34.4 million, with a second phase planned for the future. As of July 2017, $866 million has been allocated for 65 early restoration projects, which will be credited against BP's liability for natural resource damages. NOAA released a final damage assessment and restoration plan in early 2016, planning to fund $8.8 billion in natural resource damages approved under the 2016 settlement with BP. To date, funding from civil and criminal pleas, including $500 million from Transocean and BP for research on human health and environmental protection, and $100 million from BP for wetlands restoration and conservation, complements major restoration processes and funding mechanisms in the Gulf Region. Many Gulf Coast restoration efforts are still in progress, with funds available for deposit into various projects. The planning processes and funds for the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund are still being finalized. Issues of interest to Congress include coordination of restoration activities, development of a comprehensive plan, governance, and balancing ecological restoration with economic development in the region. Multiple implementing entities in the Gulf Coast region are a key area of congressional interest. Several funding streams are supporting restoration activities in the Gulf, planned and implemented through various processes. Coordination among entities like NFWF and the council is emphasized, but there is no formal oversight or required coordination process. Concerns may arise regarding project duplication and restoration implementation. The 2016 Comprehensive Plan Update under the RESTORE Act acknowledges the need for coordination among restoration entities to avoid duplication and maximize benefits. While some argue that informal coordination has been effective, formal coordination is seen as necessary to address potential conflicts in goals at local and regional levels. The plan states the council's intention to coordinate with other partners involved in restoration activities. The RESTORE Act establishes a coordinating entity with authority over relevant processes, allowing for integrated funding and implementation plans to reduce project duplication and promote a cohesive restoration effort among federal entities. It also addresses the need to avoid duplication in monitoring the Gulf Coast ecosystem, requiring coordination among research and monitoring activities. Coordination among restoration activities extends beyond the RESTORE Act to include existing federal and state projects and activities. Coordination among restoration activities in the Gulf Coast region involves integrating new projects under the RESTORE Act with existing programs, ensuring monitoring and oversight consistency, and maintaining baseline ecosystem restoration efforts. Questions arise regarding the need for a congressionally authorized mechanism for coordination and the comparability of data and results from different entities' restoration activities. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council published a Comprehensive Plan Update in December 2016 under the RESTORE Act and other Deepwater Horizon-related restoration activities. The plan aims to guide restoration activities in the region and address complex challenges. The Comprehensive Plan Update published by the Council in August 2013 included elements required by Congress for project selection and state expenditure plans. Congress did not mandate coverage of the Direct Component under the RESTORE Act, Gulf Coast Science Program, or centers of excellence in the report. Other Gulf Coast restoration planning processes are coordinated by NFWF and NRDA trustees, not governed by RESTORE Act planning. The NFWF and NRDA trustees oversee Gulf Coast restoration planning processes, which are not governed by the RESTORE Act. These processes are guided by different regulations and settlement agreements. Congress is considering alternative organizational structures for ecosystem restoration in the Gulf, such as the federally-led Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) outlined 68 projects for restoration efforts, which are more centralized and detailed compared to the Gulf's planning process under the RESTORE Act. Planning for Everglades restoration is coordinated by the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. However, a complete comparison of planning processes in the Gulf is challenging due to missing information, such as estimated completion timeframes and maintenance plans. The RESTORE Act planning process lacks details on completion timeframes and maintenance plans. Congress may have questions regarding how it incorporates other restoration processes and the timeline for implementation. Additionally, there is uncertainty about creating a vision for a restored ecosystem under the RESTORE Act and other Gulf planning processes. The Gulf Coast restoration planning process lacks details on completion timeframes, maintenance plans, and funding sources. Questions remain about the division of labor between federal and state activities, progress measurement, and governance of restoration activities. The Gulf Coast restoration planning process lacks details on completion timeframes, maintenance plans, and funding sources. The RESTORE Act does not specify an overarching entity to monitor all restoration activities. Questions arise about how activities from different funding streams relate to each other and who will evaluate and report on the overall status of restoration activities in the Gulf. The Gulf Coast restoration planning process lacks details on completion timeframes, maintenance plans, and funding sources. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council is responsible for reporting on the progress of projects to protect the region, but it appears to have limited authority over other activities. Two projects on the initial FPL include the Council Monitoring and Assessment Program and the Gulf of Mexico Alliance Monitoring Community of Practice, which aim to fund region-wide monitoring and data management. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council is responsible for monitoring and data management in the region. Questions arise about its authority, use of indicators, and plans for when the fund is depleted. The council's role in measuring progress and implementing holistic changes in restoration efforts is unclear. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council is responsible for overseeing restoration efforts in the region, including funding allocation for ecosystem and economic vitality restoration. Congress may conduct oversight on the balance of resources used for these dual goals, as there are no specific provisions addressing the exact balance. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council oversees funding allocation for ecosystem and economic vitality restoration. Questions arise about how funding from the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund will balance these goals, how funds will be split between economic and ecosystem projects, and if the funding will replace or add to existing restoration funding in state budgets. The Comprehensive Plan Update prioritizes objectives, with funding not equally distributed, raising questions about prioritizing ecological activities over economic ones and using ecosystem services to determine project priority. The Gulf Coast restoration planning and funding are uncertain, with progress made in various areas. Funding from the RESTORE Act, NFWF, and NRDA has been released, increasing attention on restoration efforts. Congress may need to address coordination, planning, and implementation issues, considering lessons from similar initiatives. Questions on adaptive management, governance, and balancing restoration with the economy could be raised in congressional oversight of Gulf Coast restoration."
