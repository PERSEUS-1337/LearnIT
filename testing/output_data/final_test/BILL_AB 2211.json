    "title": "AB 2211",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 488.080 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to allow a registered process server to levy on various types of property, including real property, growing crops, personal property, equipment of a business, motor vehicles, farm products, personal property used as a dwelling, and deposit accounts. Registered process servers are allowed to levy on various types of property, including deposit accounts, property in a safe-deposit box, accounts receivable, final money judgments, and interest in personal property in the estate of a decedent. Before levying, the process server must deposit a copy of the writ and fee with the levying officer. If property is levied on, the process server must comply with levy, posting, and service provisions. Within five court days after levy, the registered process server must file the writ of attachment, proof of service, proof of service on other persons, and written instructions with the levying officer. If the fee is paid, the levying officer must carry out duties under the writ. Failure to comply renders the levy ineffective, releasing the officer from further obligations. The officer is not liable for actions taken in accordance with provided information, except in cases of known incorrect information. The plaintiff or process server may still be held liable for incorrect information provided. The fee for services of a registered process server is recoverable under Section 1033.5. A registered process server may levy on various types of property under a writ of execution, including real property, personal property, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts receivable, and final money judgments. The registered process server must deposit a copy of the writ and fee with the levying officer before executing a levy. After levying on property, they must comply with levy provisions and request a garnishee's memorandum. Within five court days, the writ of execution must be filed with the levying officer. The registered process server must provide proof of service and levy details, along with written instructions. If the required fee is paid, the levying officer will carry out duties under the writ. Failure to comply renders the levy ineffective, and the fee for the process server is a recoverable cost. A registered process server can levy multiple times under the same writ of execution if it is still valid. Section 706.108 of the Code of Civil Procedure allows a judgment creditor to request an earnings withholding order from a process server if the writ of execution is still active. A registered process server can serve an earnings withholding order on an employer, depositing necessary documents and fees with the levying officer beforehand. The server must provide the employer with the original order, a copy, and a return form. Within five court days after service, the employer must file the necessary documents with the levying officer, including the writ of execution, proof of service, and written instructions as required by law. The levying officer must perform all duties required by the earnings withholding order if the fee has been paid. Failure to comply with certain provisions makes the service ineffective, and the officer may release withheld earnings to the judgment debtor. The fee for a registered process server is a recoverable cost."
