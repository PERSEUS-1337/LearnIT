    "content": "The report describes SOCOM's unique acquisition authorities compared to military departments, including chains of command and program oversight. It also explores whether SOCOM's characteristics influence its acquisition process. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 reorganized DOD's command structure, establishing combatant commands. SOCOM, the first combatant command with acquisition authority, was granted unique acquisition responsibilities in the FY 1987 NDAA. It has the authority to validate requirements, ensure combat readiness, and acquire special operations equipment. CYBERCOM, the second command with independent acquisition authority, was granted limited authority in the FY2016 NDAA. SOCOM has unique acquisition responsibilities to acquire special operations-peculiar equipment, material, supplies, and services. They can modify service-common equipment provided by military departments to meet special operations-specific requirements. The Acquisition Executive has the authority to negotiate agreements with military departments for acquisitions. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has unique acquisition responsibilities to acquire special operations-peculiar equipment, material, supplies, and services. The Acquisition Executive negotiates agreements with military departments for acquisitions. SOCOM's Special Operations Force Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (SOF AT&L) manages internal major procurement efforts. The SOCOM Commander is directly responsible for overseeing acquisition programs and negotiating with military departments for systems to be provided to SOCOM. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has a unique acquisition structure with the Acquisition Executive reporting directly to the Commander. This allows for rapid communication and decision-making within the command. The Commander delegates acquisition decision authority to the Acquisition Executive, who further delegates Milestone Decision Authority to the Program Executive Offices (PEOs). This streamlined process enables efficient procurement efforts within SOCOM. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) delegates acquisition decision authority to the Program Executive Offices (PEOs), allowing for rapid decision-making and efficient procurement. SOCOM's acquisition process is similar to military services but with differences in statutory authorities and scope. SOCOM can only acquire Special Operations-specific items, while military services have broader authority. SOCOM adheres to the same oversight and documentation requirements as the military services when exercising its acquisition authority. Despite some differences in acquisition authorities and flexibilities, SOCOM operates within the same regulations and directives as the rest of DOD. The FY2017 and FY2018 NDAA granted new reprogramming and acquisition authorities to the military departments, including a special transfer authority for prototype projects. The Secretary of Defense was required to assess the feasibility of providing similar authorities to the Commander of the United States Special Operations Command. Acquisition regulations are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Supplement. The DFARS provides DOD-specific regulations for government acquisition officials and contractors working with DOD. Each military service and DOD component has its own acquisition regulatory supplement. SOCOM has its own supplement called SOFARS, which defines its purpose as providing essential regulations. The supplemental regulation's purpose is to provide the minimum essential implementation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DOD FAR Supplement (DFARS). SOCOM Directive 70-1 sets an overarching construct for acquisition within the constraints of FAR, DFAR, and SOFARS. SOCOM has no unique exemptions or waivers from acquisition requirements and follows the same regulations as other military services and defense agencies. SOCOM, like other military services and defense agencies, follows the same acquisition regulations and oversight standards. They categorize programs based on dollar figures, with the Silent Knight Radar program being one of their largest, estimated at $391.7 million through FY2023. In FY2017, SOCOM's procurement funding budget was $34 million, significantly smaller than other military programs like the Navy's Virginia Class submarine program. SOCOM's acquisition workforce is much smaller, consisting of only 500 personnel, less than 1% of the total DOD acquisition workforce. SOCOM benefits from its size relative to the military services, allowing it to operate like a small business. Small organizations are seen as more nimble, innovative, adaptable, effective in communication, and less bureaucratic. The 2004 congressional report highlighted SOCOM's unique size, culture, and proximity to the warfighter as factors contributing to effective acquisitions. The organization's flatter structure allows for rapid identification of issues, program modifications, and divestment when necessary. James \"Hondo\" Geurts, the current Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition, emphasizes the need for SOCOM to divest from programs quickly. SOCOM's ability to operate below statutory and regulatory dollar thresholds allows for less scrutiny compared to other military programs. For example, the Nunn-McCurdy Act requires reporting to Congress for cost overruns of 15% or more in Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs), which have larger budgets than SOCOM's entire procurement budget for FY2017. SOCOM's procurement budget for FY2017 is smaller than the cost growth of the CVN-78 Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier. Despite lower dollar thresholds, SOCOM faces challenges in executing acquisition programs like the Advanced SEAL Delivery System. The canceled Advanced SEAL Delivery System faced cost, schedule, and performance issues before being terminated in 2009. SOCOM's ability to fail fast and adapt acquisition strategies efficiently is highlighted. The focus on procuring SOF-peculiar equipment enables a more operations-oriented acquisition culture. James Smith emphasized the advantages of USSOCOM's direct relationship for unique services and equipment procurement. USSOCOM benefits from a focused mission set and a direct relationship for unique services and equipment procurement, unlike the services with a broader acquisition mandate. SOCOM benefits from its focused mission set and limited acquisition authorities. Senior officials from SOCOM are promoting more delegation of authority and cultural risk-taking in the military services. One potential issue for Congress is whether current acquisition laws and regulations hinder efficiency and bureaucracy reduction. The current laws and regulations may hinder SOCOM's acquisition efforts due to fewer authorities compared to military departments. SOCOM must go through the Secretary of Defense for new acquisition authorities, potentially leading to missed opportunities. Congress may need to consider granting additional acquisition authorities to SOCOM and modifying the definition of military departments for acquisitions. The current laws and regulations may hinder SOCOM's acquisition efforts. Congress may need to consider granting additional acquisition authorities to SOCOM and modifying the definition of military departments for acquisitions. Should the definition of military departments as they relate to acquisitions be modified to include SOCOM?"
