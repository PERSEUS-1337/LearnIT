    "content": "Conventional hydropower accounted for over 6% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2014, with potential for further development. Limited investment in hydropower is due to financial constraints, market uncertainty, and environmental regulations. Stakeholders are divided on whether to support increased hydropower development while protecting other interests. The 114th Congress is considering changes to federal support for hydropower. The 114th Congress is debating changes to federal support for hydropower, with ongoing issues surrounding hydropower-related bills introduced in past Congresses. Over 30 hydropower-related bills were introduced in the 113th Congress, leading to the passing of several acts. Currently, four hydropower-related bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress. Several hydropower-related bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress, including the Hydropower Improvement Act of 2015, Renewable Electricity Standard Act, Small Hydropower Dependable Regulatory Order Act of 2015, and Reliable Investment in Vital Energy Resources Act. Stakeholders have differing views on the benefits and costs of hydropower development, with advantages including renewable energy status, minimal greenhouse gas emissions, and operational efficiency. Hydropower is seen as a reliable and flexible domestic energy source that can supplement generation shortfalls. Large hydropower projects have high initial capital costs and can harm surrounding ecosystems. The legislative environment for hydropower projects can be complex, with different laws applying to federal and nonfederal entities. Federal agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers manage large hydropower projects. The federal government, through agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers, is involved in hydropower generation at federal facilities and regulates nonfederal hydropower projects. Most U.S. hydropower capacity comes from conventional hydropower plants, which include storage, run-of-river, and pumped storage plants. Hydropower is generated by directing water through a penstock to spin a turbine, which activates a generator to produce electricity. Run-of-river plants use a portion of a river to generate electricity without a reservoir. Pumped storage facilities store energy by pumping water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir during off-peak hours, releasing it during periods of higher demand. Hydropower contributes 6%-9% of U.S. electric generation and is the largest renewable power source, followed by wind and wood-derived fuels. The western states produced the most hydropower in 2014. In 2014, western states like Washington, Oregon, and New York were top hydropower producers. Drought in the West may lead to a decline in hydropower generation. California, the fourth-largest producer, saw a decrease in hydropower contribution to its energy portfolio. The debate continues on whether hydropower should be considered renewable due to its replenishable nature. Some argue for increased natural gas use to compensate for reduced hydroelectric generation. Hoover Dam and other facilities in western states are producing less power due to drought conditions. Hydropower is debated as renewable due to its replenishable nature, but concerns arise regarding its environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions during construction. The exact number of hydropower projects in the US is unknown, with the majority owned by the public sector. The majority of hydropower capacity in the United States is owned by the private sector, with small hydro and low-power plants making up 83% of total plants but only 10% of total production capacity. Large hydropower plants, on the other hand, account for 90% of total capacity despite making up only 16% of total plants. Only 2.5% of the more than 80,000 dams in the US are used for hydropower. According to a 2012 Department of Energy study, there are over 54,000 non-powered dams in the US with a total potential capacity of 12 GW, which could increase hydropower capacity by 15%. The majority of this capacity is concentrated at 100 non-powered dams, with 81 operated by the Corps. Using non-powered dams for hydropower is seen as a way to increase renewable energy, but the actual cost and feasibility are unknown, requiring further site-specific studies. The federal government owns and operates about half of all US hydroelectric generating capacity, mainly at large multi-purpose dams. The U.S. hydroelectric generating capacity is primarily at large multi-purpose dams owned and operated by federal entities like the Corps and Reclamation. The Power Marketing Administrations are responsible for selling and distributing the electricity generated by these facilities. Federal hydropower capacity varies by state and region, with 90% of it located in 13 states, mostly in the West. The Corps owns and operates 353 units at 75 projects in 13 states, with a total estimated capacity of 22.9 GW. The majority of this capacity is in the West, with Washington and California having the greatest federal hydroelectric capacity. The Corps' multi-purpose dams are the largest producer of hydropower in the United States, with much of the power generation concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. The most recent hydroelectric construction project was the R.D. Willis project in Texas, completed in 1989, generating approximately 77,000 gigawatt hours of hydropower annually. The Corps operates 353 units at 75 projects with a total capacity of 22.9 GW, generating 77,000 GWH of hydropower annually. Revenues from hydropower sales go to the U.S. Treasury. The average age of Corps hydropower facilities is 49 years, with concerns about declining generation due to aging infrastructure. The Corps contributes approximately 24% to total hydropower generation. The Corps' contribution to total hydropower generation has remained steady at around 24% since 2008. Aging infrastructure is affecting the delivery of Corps hydroelectric power, with unit availability decreasing due to maintenance and repairs. Many hydropower assets have fallen below the industry goal of 95% unit availability, leading to internal reviews and recommendations for improvement under the Hydropower Modernization Initiative (HMI). The Corps' Hydropower Modernization Initiative (HMI) aims to modernize critical projects for increased electricity production and revenue generation. Upgrades to 54 units outside the Federal Columbia River Power System could prevent potential revenue losses of $7 billion over 20 years, with estimated upgrade costs of $3.7 billion. The Corps is prioritizing efficiency improvements and capacity upgrades at these plants. The Corps is prioritizing efficiency improvements and capacity upgrades at hydropower plants, with a focus on developing an annual budget-based HMI implementation strategy. Nonfederal development of hydropower at Corps sites is also allowed under certain circumstances, requiring a FERC license and a Corps Section 408 permit. The Corps and FERC signed an MOU in 2011 to coordinate regulatory reviews. Reclamation is the second-largest producer of hydroelectric power in the US, operating in 17 western states. Reclamation is the second-largest producer of hydroelectric power in the United States, operating in 17 western states with 11 states having Reclamation hydropower facilities. They have 176 generating units at 53 power plants, with a total capacity of 14.7 GW, generating an average of 40,000 GWH annually. They significantly increased hydropower production during World War II to meet wartime demands. Reclamation is the second-largest producer of hydroelectric power in the United States, generating an average of 40,000 GWH annually. Power from Reclamation projects is first used for project purposes, with the remaining power marketed by Power Marketing Administrations. Hydropower revenues are deposited into the Reclamation Fund and applied to project repayment costs. Reclamation's facilities are aging, with an average plant age of 58 years old as of 2015. Reclamation estimated the cost of rehabilitating and replacing assets for FY2012-FY2016 to be $2.6 billion. Despite aging facilities, net generation has remained constant over the last decade. Upgrades to hydropower facilities have been studied, but the potential for development is lower compared to Corps facilities. Only 10 out of 58 facilities were deemed feasible for significant upgrades, increasing total capacity by less than 1%. Adding nonfederal hydropower facilities at existing Reclamation projects is allowed. Adding nonfederal hydropower facilities at existing Reclamation projects is permitted through obtaining a FERC license or the Lease of Power Privilege Process. Reclamation reported development at 47 sites with a capacity of over 46 GW. Development must align with the original project's purpose, not impact its integrity, and avoid adverse environmental, cultural, or historical effects. Legislation has been enacted to support this development. Legislation has been proposed in Congress to support hydropower research and development. Dam removal for ecosystem restoration and recreational purposes is a controversial issue, especially when the dam produces hydroelectric power. Congress becomes involved in proposals for federal dam removal and funding for dam removal projects. Some federal facilities with hydropower units have debated and pursued dam removal. The federal government has been involved in dam removal projects to restore fish passage and river ecosystems, such as the removal of two nonfederal dams on the Elwha River in Washington. Efforts are also underway to remove four nonfederal hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River in Oregon, although congressional authorization is still pending. Nonfederal groups are also pushing for the removal of both federal and nonfederal hydroelectric dams through litigation. Efforts to remove four hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River in Washington State operated by the Corps are controversial. The Obama Administration has not considered dam removal as a viable option in biological opinions. Litigation by nonfederal parties is ongoing, with concerns that it could lead to dam removal. If mandated by the courts, specific authority from Congress would be needed for dam breach or removal. Some oppose the removal of hydroelectric dams. Some argue for dam removal to restore fish passage and prevent species extinction. The federal government operates four Power Marketing Administrations responsible for marketing surplus power from Corps and Reclamation facilities. The Power Marketing Administrations sell surplus power from Corps and Reclamation facilities at low rates to customers, with revenue deposited into the U.S. Treasury. Approximately $5 billion in annual revenue is returned to the Treasury, exceeding budgets for hydropower operations. The Flood Control Act of 1944 mandates selling power at the lowest possible rate, resulting in lower prices compared to investor-owned utilities. For example, in 2014, BPA's average industrial firm power rate was 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The Power Marketing Administrations sell surplus power at low rates to encourage regional economic development. Critics argue that current policies result in artificially low costs that do not account for necessary upgrades. Controversies also arise over using hydropower revenues for fish mitigation and the costs of environmental laws on ratepayers. Critics of Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) argue that customers are unaware of the costs for fish and wildlife mitigation included in their bills. A proposal in the 112th Congress aimed to address this issue by requiring PMAs to include cost estimates related to environmental laws on monthly billing statements. Hydropower generation at federal facilities has been established since the early 20th century, providing low-cost power but also carrying environmental costs. Studies suggest potential increases in federal hydropower through efficiency gains and nonfederal power development at federal sites. Two bills in the 112th Congress aimed to facilitate nonfederal development at federal sites by directing revenues from power privileges towards storage rehabilitation and expansion at Reclamation facilities. Challenges to future production and development persist, particularly at Corps facilities where aging infrastructure hinders hydroelectric production. The federal government faces limited options for addressing these issues, as financing major upgrades and expansions of federal hydropower facilities is difficult without congressional appropriations and authorizations. Construction of new projects also faces challenges. Challenges for hydropower projects at federal facilities include environmental restrictions, hydrologic uncertainties, limited operational flexibility, and competition for water from other uses. Nonfederal hydropower projects, whether privately or publicly owned, are subject to FERC regulations. Nonfederal hydropower plants, subject to FERC regulations, generated 142,340 GWh of electricity in 2013, accounting for 53% of total hydropower generation and 3.5% of total U.S. electricity. Nonfederal projects have unique benefits like regular maintenance and upgrades, but also face drawbacks such as high capital costs and environmental concerns. Nonfederal hydropower projects face hurdles in obtaining state and federal approval, with the major barrier being federal financing for upgrades and expansions. FERC has exclusive authority to license, oversee, and decommission nonfederal hydropower projects under the Federal Power Act of 1935. Nonfederal hydropower projects, under FERC authority, must meet specific criteria for licensing, including being located on navigable waters or public lands, utilizing surplus water or power from a government dam, or being on waters under Commerce Clause jurisdiction. FERC has licensed over 1,000 projects and exempted 631 more, with licenses typically lasting 50 years. A small percentage of licensed projects are set to expire in the coming years, requiring relicensing. FERC oversees hydropower projects, with 296 licensed projects set to expire between January 2016 and December 2026. Exemptions are issued indefinitely. FERC's focus is now on relicensing projects and exploring small hydropower and hydrokinetics. Three licensing processes are available: Traditional Licensing Process (TLP), Alternative Licensing Process (ALP), and Integrated Licensing Process (ILP), with ILP as the default since July 2005. Nonfederal projects face similar challenges and opportunities as federal projects. Nonfederal hydropower projects share challenges and opportunities with federal projects, including capacity expansion, environmental considerations, and community issues. Unique to nonfederal projects are FERC licensing requirements and the need for financial incentives to increase generation capacity. Congress may need to adjust tax incentives or subsidies for nonfederal investment. Mitigating environmental impacts from expansion is also important. Challenges unique to nonfederal hydropower projects stem from regulatory issues, including licensing delays, workforce adequacy, community opposition, and market fluctuations. Criticism of FERC's licensing process centers on the belief that it hinders the full potential of nonfederal hydropower. Simplifying the licensing process by reducing information requirements and speeding up license acquisition could unlock additional generation capacity. The process of obtaining a hydropower license can be lengthy, taking up to six years or more. Multiple federal and state agencies are involved in the licensing process, which may lead to delays. One common reason for delays is the untimely receipt of state water quality certification. Project developers and stakeholders have a significant role in determining project outcomes, according to a FERC representative. Stakeholders, not the Commission, play a key role in determining project success and regulatory process length. Small projects can still have significant environmental impacts, leading to delays in the application process. Some stakeholders are concerned about mandatory conditions to protect resources during the licensing process. There are arguments for a comprehensive licensing process to allow for adequate review and comments, as licenses can be valid for 30 to 50 years. The legislative proposal in the 114th Congress, S. 1236, aims to designate FERC as the lead agency for coordinating federal authorization of projects and establishing compliance schedules for federal and state agencies. It also includes provisions for FERC to investigate best practices for license studies to improve future environmental impact reports. Potential solutions for challenges facing nonfederal projects include legislation incorporating a federal renewable electricity or clean energy standard, energy efficiency measures, and technological advancements. Investments in new nonfederal hydropower projects, energy efficiency measures, and technological advancements could increase generation at existing projects. Issues include treatment in state renewable portfolio standards, FERC charges for federal lands, and development near FERC-regulated projects. Congress is considering a federal renewable electricity standard to promote domestic renewable energy production. Many states have renewable portfolio standards (RPS) requiring a minimum percentage of electricity from renewable sources. 37 states and DC include hydropower in their RPS, each with its own criteria. State standards vary in yearly targets and eligibility requirements for renewable sources, often with conditions for hydropower projects. The classification of federal lands for water power development is determined by the USGS, FERC, and BLM, with FERC having jurisdiction over the power value. Once land is classified, the designation remains with the land even if it is transferred. The power site classification for federal lands remains with the land even after transfer, leading to disputes over annual fees for hydropower projects. FERC states that charges are still required for federal lands with power site classification, as the US retains the right to obtain power from these lands. Controversies over property rights near hydropower facilities have brought attention to FERC. Controversies over property rights near hydropower facilities have drawn attention to FERC's Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) process. The SMP governs the use of project reservoir shorelines to prevent adverse impacts on project operations and public safety. Past FERC orders limiting use near hydroelectric facilities have sparked backlash from nearby communities, with property owners often feeling their rights and land use are restricted. A proposal to amend Sections 4(e) and 10(a)(1) of the FPA to require FERC to consider property rights of non-licensees during the licensing process has been introduced in the 114th Congress. FERC's authority to require SMPs and enforce their terms on hydropower license applicants is primarily found in Sections 10(a)(1) and 4(e) of the FPA. The requirement for FERC-permitted hydropower facilities to file and abide by SMPs is not in the FPA, and the phrase \"shoreline management plan\" does not appear in the U.S. Code. The only reference to SMPs is in the titles of the Code of Federal Regulations as a requirement for existing licensees to include their SMPs in their pre-application filing for license renewal. FERC requires hydropower licensees to include a comprehensive plan for improving waterways and wildlife protection in their license renewal applications. Shoreline management plans ensure compliance with these requirements, determined on a case-by-case basis by FERC. Some applicants voluntarily submit SMPs, while others may not need them. Regardless, all licensees must secure property rights for their projects. Licensees must obtain property rights for obligations in Shoreline Management Plans (SMP). Aging federal hydropower infrastructure needs funding for upgrades. Policy options include increasing federal funding for modernization initiatives. Some suggest using alternative funding mechanisms like an infrastructure bank or private sector contracts to finance hydropower upgrades without relying on increased annual appropriations. However, these alternative programs may involve upfront budgetary costs, especially if they require federal backing or future federal outlays. Increasing rates or implementing new user charges could also help cover the full costs of operations and maintenance, including major upgrades. Some argue for increased rates by PMAs to cover infrastructure upgrades, but this may be viewed negatively. Privatizing federally owned dams is another option to shift maintenance responsibilities and potentially increase generation, but private entities may raise electricity rates. Allow customers to commit to future power to fund upgrades. Some advocate for allowing customers to use future power revenues to pay for federal hydropower upgrades, with some PMAs already having this authority. Data gaps exist on the value of ancillary benefits from federal hydropower operations. The potential benefits of federal hydropower operations, such as increasing production when needed for power system stability, have not been well documented. There are gaps in studies on economic feasibility and availability of climate data for informing hydropower facility operations, leading to ongoing controversy. Uncertainty in natural climate variability may impact water resources and hydroelectric power availability. Operations of federal hydropower infrastructure will need to be altered due to climate change, as federal facilities are often operated based on past trends and the assumption of \"stationarity.\" Revising these estimates can be difficult, and uncertainty still exists in the process. Alterations to federal operations are further complicated by existing requirements to meet multiple competing goals in the face of uncertain water conditions. Some stakeholders question whether federal agencies will require greater flexibility in operating existing reservoirs if climate conditions result in changes to weather patterns. In 2009, the Secretary of the Interior issued an order for considering climate change impacts in long-range planning exercises. A 2013 report assessed climate change effects on hydropower generation. There is a debate on whether nonfederal hydropower could help meet electricity demand and reduce emissions. Hydropower is a flexible energy source that can serve as a baseload generation. Hydropower is a flexible energy source that can be used as baseload or peaking generation. There are environmental, regulatory, and security concerns. Congress could decide on supporting additional hydropower development and the level of federal involvement in nonfederal projects. Congress could support additional hydropower generation by transferring some activities to nonfederal entities. The Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 exempts small hydropower projects from licensing requirements and promotes development at nonpowered dams. Small hydropower represents 5% of total U.S. capacity, and Congress could assess federally funded efforts for nonfederal projects and provide supplementary funds. Congress could support hydropower projects by providing supplementary funds or modifying efforts to meet congressional goals. Tax credits for hydropower could be evaluated, with arguments for and against their necessity. Establishing a clean energy standard that includes hydropower as an eligible source is also a possibility. Some suggest that FERC licensing is a barrier to increasing hydropower capacity, and Congress could amend laws to expedite the licensing process. Congress may consider amending laws to expedite the licensing process for hydropower projects, including S. 1236. Stakeholders have raised concerns about time delays in the licensing process, urging federal, state, and local agencies to complete their contributions promptly. Several bills in the 114th Congress aim to expand hydropower development and modify the regulatory process. S. 1236, the Hydropower Improvement Act of 2015, proposes to amend the FPA to designate FERC as the lead agency for coordinating federal authorization of hydropower projects. FERC would establish a schedule for granting licenses, collect information from agencies, and compile environmental impact statements. Annual reports on energy changes and environmental costs would be submitted to Congress. The Hydropower Improvement Act of 2015, S. 1236, aims to designate FERC as the lead agency for hydropower project authorization, extending permit terms and allowing for additional permits under special circumstances. It also modifies the administrative hearing process for license applicants and recognizes hydropower as a renewable resource. Additionally, it addresses the operation and maintenance of fishways near projects, contingent on FERC's determination of their necessity for mitigating project effects on fish populations. The bill aims to establish a federal renewable energy standard and credit program for retail electric suppliers selling 1,000 GWh or more. Suppliers must generate a percentage of electricity from renewable resources, with requirements increasing over time. Credits can be issued for incremental hydropower improvements. The Dependable Regulatory Order Act of 2015 proposes amendments to the FPA for faster licensing decisions for small projects. The RIVER Act aims to extend incentives for hydropower production and efficiency improvement. The 114th Congress may also oversee policies from previous legislation. The Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-23) redefined small hydropower as 10 MW or less, allowing FERC to grant exemptions for projects. It also amended the FPA to expedite licensing for qualifying conduit hydropower projects, setting time limits for FERC's initial determination and public contestation. The Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-23) redefined small hydropower as 10 MW or less, allowing FERC to grant exemptions for projects. It set time limits for FERC's initial determination and public contestation, with a 45-day period for contesting notices. Amendments include granting exemptions for conduit projects with certain stipulations and increasing the capacity limit for municipal projects to 40 MW. Preliminary permits can now be extended once for two years, and FERC is required to study the feasibility of issuing licenses within a two-year period for certain projects. The Secretary of Energy must also study aspects of pumped storage facilities and submit a report to Congress. The Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-23) redefined small hydropower as 10 MW or less, allowing FERC to grant exemptions for projects. P.L. 113-24 authorized nonfederal hydropower development at all Reclamation projects, with the Power Resources Office setting policy and procedures. Local project operators have priority for conduit hydropower development, with categorical exclusions under the National Environmental. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121) expedites the approval and construction of nonfederal hydropower at Corps facilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-76) appropriates funds for a hydropower development program under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, providing incentive payments to owners of nonfederal hydropower facilities for electricity generated over a 10-year period. The guideline for potential incentive payment for nonfederal hydropower facilities is 1.8 cents/kWh over a 10-year period. Federal operators of hydroelectric facilities have highlighted the need for infrastructure improvements, while the private sector dominates the small hydropower market. Investment in large hydropower projects is unlikely in the near term due to various constraints and concerns. The federal government and private sector are both involved in hydropower development. Congress may pursue policy options to increase hydropower capacity, addressing issues such as aging infrastructure, maintenance delays, permitting processes, and water availability. Key concerns include operation of federal projects, permitting for nonfederal projects, and environmental impacts. The federal government and private sector are involved in hydropower development. Concerns include maintenance delays, permitting processes, and environmental impacts. Questions for Congress involve increasing hydropower capacity at existing or new projects. The Integrated Licensing Process (ILP) for hydropower development aims to streamline the licensing process by incorporating elements from Traditional and Alternative Licensing Processes. Changes include resolving study disputes and involving FERC earlier in the process to make it more efficient without altering agencies' authorities. The ILP for hydropower development streamlines the licensing process by involving FERC earlier, resolving study disputes, and consulting with various entities like NOAA Fisheries, FWS, NPS, EPA, and federal/state agencies. The licensing process for hydropower development involves consulting with various entities such as federal and state agencies, the State Historic Preservation Officer, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, local zoning agencies, Indian tribes, and potentially affected landowners. Applicable laws include the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and others. Relevant laws for hydropower development include the Northwest Power Planning and Conservation Act, Wild and Scenic Rivers and Wilderness Act, and National Environmental Policy Act."
