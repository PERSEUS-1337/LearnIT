    "content": "The title of the act is the \"FHA Manufactured Housing Loan Modernization Act of 2006\". The purpose of the act is to provide findings and purposes related to manufactured housing loans. The Congress finds that manufactured housing is crucial for low- and moderate-income families in the US, the FHA title I insurance program is important for manufactured home loans, the market is experiencing a downturn leading to a lack of private lending, and the FHA program has historically provided stability during such times. The FHA title I insurance program for manufactured housing loans has not been adjusted for inflation since 1992, resulting in a lack of financing options for low- and moderate-income homebuyers. The Act aims to provide adequate funding and modernize the program to enhance participation. The Act aims to adjust low loan limits for title I manufactured home loan insurance to reflect cost increases since 1992 and index the limits to inflation to enhance participation in Ginnie Mae and private lending markets.
