    "content": "EXEMPTION FOR ASBESTOS-RELATED SETTLEMENT FUNDS. The amendment exempts asbestos-related settlement funds from tax under the Internal Revenue Code, providing relief for funds established to resolve claims related to asbestos. Conforming amendments ensure the exemption is applied accordingly. The amendments made by this section, except subsection (b)(6), apply to taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2000. SEC. 2. MODIFY TREATMENT OF ASBESTOS-RELATED NET OPERATING LOSSES. SEC. 2. MODIFY TREATMENT OF ASBESTOS-RELATED NET OPERATING LOSSES. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow taxpayers to carry back specified liability losses related to asbestos to the year of first involvement in asbestos production or distribution. The taxpayer can elect to deduct payments from related parties for asbestos-related products. This deduction does not affect tax credits and reduces taxable income for the carryback year. The deduction for asbestos-related products from related parties reduces taxable income for the carryback year. The deduction amount is determined by the increase in allowable credits divided by the maximum tax rate for the taxable year. The taxable income for the year is determined without deductions related to asbestos. If there is a net operating loss after considering these deductions, the portion of the loss attributed to them is treated as a specified liability loss. There is a limitation on the reduction in income tax liability from this election, exceeding the reduction from a 10-year carryback. The taxpayer must use the 10-year carryback period for asbestos-related losses for compensation and costs. The amount of loss absorbed in a prior year is not limited by other carryback rules. Predecessor corporations are included in this provision. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2000, regarding the transfer or distribution of assets to the taxpayer in specific transactions."
