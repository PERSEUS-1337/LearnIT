The Congress recognizes the impact of award programs like the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in improving operations and competitiveness of organizations. A President's Total Environmental Quality Award Program, based on the Baldrige model, aims to promote environmental quality and sustainable economic development by encouraging the development and deployment of environmental technologies, recognizing achievements in this area, and establishing guidelines for companies. The President's Total Environmental Quality Award Program and National Environmentally Sound Technology Award Program aim to recognize successful development and deployment of environmental technologies. Guidelines are established for organizations to evaluate their own environmental technology initiatives. The President's Total Environmental Quality Award is established under SEC. 24. The President's Total Environmental Quality Award (referred to as the Award) is established with a medal bearing the inscription 'President's Total Environmental Quality Award'. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will create a process for evaluating Award applicants similar to the Malcolm Baldrige Award procedures. The President's Total Environmental Quality Award is established for companies and organizations benefiting the US through environmental technologies. The Secretary submits recommendations to the President for selection, who then presents the Award to deserving recipients. The President's Total Environmental Quality Award is given with ceremony by the President or Vice President. Information gathered for evaluating applications can only be used for evaluation and publicity by winners, not for regulatory purposes. Evaluation criteria include the organization's development of environmental technologies, energy and materials use efficiency, and integrated approaches.

Citizens or permanent residents of the US may qualify for the Award if they were substantially involved in the invention or innovation. The Award is limited to five recipients annually and focuses on technologies that improve the environment through pollution reduction or remediation. The National Environmentally Sound Technology Award recognizes individuals involved in innovative environmental technologies that reduce pollution or improve energy/materials efficiency."
