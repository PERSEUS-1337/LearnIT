The National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, with deposits from mineral revenues for fiscal years 2018 to 2047 ranging from $50 million to $500 million annually. The National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund is established with deposits ranging from $50 million to $500 million annually for fiscal years 2018 to 2047. The funds are available for expenditure without further appropriation, with unobligated amounts credited to the Treasury if not used within 2 years. The funds are to be used for high-priority deferred maintenance needs of the Service, with 80% allocated for repair and rehabilitation projects. The National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund allocates funds for repair and rehabilitation of assets, including historic structures, visitor facilities, and transportation-related projects. Twenty percent of the fund is designated for transportation projects eligible for funding through the transportation program under title 23. The National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund allocates funds for repair and rehabilitation of assets, including historic structures, visitor facilities, and transportation-related projects. The fund prohibits the use of funds for land acquisition and to supplant discretionary funding for facility operations and maintenance. The Service must submit a prioritized list of deferred maintenance projects to be funded by the Fund annually to Congress for review. After review of the list submitted, the Committees may allocate amounts from the Fund. If no alterations are made to the proposed fund allocation before the fiscal year begins, the submitted list for that year is considered approved. However, if a continuing resolution is enacted for a period of 120 days or less, funds cannot be committed to high-priority deferred maintenance projects until an appropriations law is passed. The enactment of a law making appropriations for the Service that is not a continuing resolution; or more than 120 days, the list submitted under subsection (f) for that fiscal year shall be considered approved. Public donations can be accepted to reduce overall deferred maintenance costs, with specific cost-share components based on project costs. The table of sections for chapter 1049 of title 54, United States Code, is amended by adding a provision for projects costing $2,000,000 or more with a 25% non-Federal cost-share component. The National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund is established with a provision for projects costing $2,000,000 or more with a 25% non-Federal cost-share component."
