    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004\". Congress recognizes the importance of American innovation and the protection of intellectual property, which contributes significantly to the country's economic growth. Copyright-based industries are a valuable asset, representing over 5% of the GDP and employing millions of people. The proliferation of criminal counterfeiting poses a threat to the economic growth of these industries. The American intellectual property sector has invested millions in developing authentication features to combat counterfeiting. Counterfeiters tamper with genuine authentication features to evade industry efforts. Federal law lacks adequate remedies to address tampering activities facilitating counterfeiting crimes. Congress must enact legislation to strengthen Federal enforcement against counterfeiting of copyrighted works. To combat counterfeiting of copyrighted works, Congress should pass laws prohibiting trafficking and tampering with authentication features, while also allowing aggrieved parties to pursue civil action. PROHIBITION AGAINST TRAFFICKING IN ILLICIT AUTHENTICATION FEATURES. The amendment to Section 2318 of title 18, United States Code, prohibits trafficking in counterfeit labels, illicit authentication features, or counterfeit documentation or packaging. This includes trafficking in counterfeit labels affixed to phonorecords, computer programs, motion pictures, or documentation/packaging, as well as illicit authentication features affixed to phonorecords. The amendment to Section 2318 of title 18, United States Code, prohibits trafficking in counterfeit labels, illicit authentication features, or counterfeit documentation or packaging, including those affixed to phonorecords, computer programs, motion pictures, or audiovisual works. Offenders can face fines or imprisonment for up to 5 years. The term 'authentication feature' refers to physical features used by copyright owners to verify authenticity of products. 'Documentation or packaging' refers to materials accompanying products. 'Illicit authentication feature' is an unauthorized authentication feature. The curr_chunk discusses the tampering or distribution of authentication features without authorization from the copyright owner, in violation of title 17. It also mentions genuine authentication features distributed without authorization or appearing genuine but being counterfeit. The curr_chunk discusses the modification or distribution of authentication features without permission from the copyright owner, in violation of title 17. It also addresses genuine authentication features distributed without authorization or appearing genuine but being counterfeit. The curr_chunk proposes amendments to include illicit authentication features in counterfeit labels, and outlines civil remedies for copyright owners in case of violation. The court has the discretion to grant injunctions, order impounding of articles, and award attorney fees, costs, and damages in actions brought under the proposed amendments for counterfeit labels with illicit authentication features. The court may award actual damages, additional profits, or statutory damages to the injured party for violations of this section. Actual damages include the injured party's losses and any profits of the violator from the violation. The court will calculate the damages. The court calculates actual damages by multiplying the value of counterfeit items by the number of items affected, unless underestimating harm. The injured party may choose to receive statutory damages instead of actual damages and profits, with a minimum sum for each violation of copyright infringement. The value of the phonorecord or copy is defined as the retail value of authorized copies of copyrighted works. The court may impose fines ranging from $2,500 to $25,000 for violations of this section. For subsequent violations within 3 years, the fine may be tripled. A civil action must be initiated within 3 years of discovering the violation. This section does not affect liability under other copyright laws. The amendment adds \"or illicit authentication features\" to the item relating to section 2318 in the table of sections at the beginning of chapter 113 of title 18, United States Code. The Senate passed S. 2227 on December 8, 2004, an act to prevent and punish counterfeiting and copyright piracy, among other purposes."
