    "content": "The Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972, aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters by regulating pollution from both point and nonpoint sources. Despite progress, water quality issues persist, including runoff from farms, cities, and industrial discharges. The Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972, aims to eliminate pollution and achieve zero discharge of pollutants. Federal financial assistance is provided for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction. The Environmental Protection Agency administers federal programs, while state and local governments implement CWA programs. The goal is to make waters \"fishable and swimmable\" by controlling pollutants. Progress has been made in controlling conventional pollutants discharged by industries and sewage treatment plants. However, efforts to control toxic pollutants, which can harm human health and the environment even in small amounts, have been mixed. Nonpoint source pollution from urban, suburban, and agricultural areas is a more recent focus. Data from EPA and states show that a significant percentage of river and stream miles and lake acres do not meet water quality standards. Approximately 95,000 lakes and 544,000 river miles in the United States are under fish-consumption advisories due to chemical contaminants, with mercury levels being a growing concern. The Water Quality Act of 1987 was the last major amendment to the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-4) was a significant amendment to the original act, with authorizations for various programs expiring in the 1990s and 2000s. Despite this, funding has continued to be appropriated for implementation. The Act has been successful in achieving its goals and is widely supported, but there are questions about the need for further actions to bring additional benefits. Criticism of the Clean Water Act has come from industry, developers, and property rights groups, questioning the cost and intrusiveness of regulations. States and cities support water quality programs but oppose potential new unfunded mandates. Environmental groups advocate for further strengthening of the law to address remaining water quality issues. The Clean Water Act, passed 40 years ago with amendments 25 years later, has shown progress in clean water but significant pollution issues remain. There is debate on the need for new legislation to address water quality problems and ensure progress is not lost. Key issues include implementing existing provisions, achieving overall goals, and determining the federal role in clean water infrastructure. Efforts to amend the act comprehensively have stalled. Efforts to amend the Clean Water Act have stalled due to debates on how to address various issues, such as economic impacts, scientific uncertainty, and governmental responsibilities. Congress has focused on narrow bills instead of comprehensive proposals, partly due to political dynamics and a lack of legislative initiatives from the Administration on clean water issues. The 112th Congress focused on water infrastructure financing and wetlands protection, with a shift in priorities after the 2010 election. Two bills amending the Clean Water Act were enacted, extending a moratorium on certain vessel permitting and authorizing funds for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin program. In the 113th Congress, environmental issues, including water quality, were a focus with a Republican-controlled House and a Democratic-controlled Senate. Several bills with Clean Water Act provisions were enacted, including a pilot program for water infrastructure financing and exemptions for silviculture activities from CWA permits. The Clean Water Act provisions in the 113th Congress included a three-year moratorium for certain vessels, elimination of statutorily required reports, and financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction. Congress has provided nearly $90 billion since 1972 to assist cities in meeting water quality objectives. The Clean Water Act provisions in the 113th Congress included a three-year moratorium for certain vessels, elimination of statutorily required reports, and financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction. State and local governments have spent over $25 billion on construction, with an additional $298 billion needed for water infrastructure improvements according to the EPA and states' Needs Survey estimate. The EPA reported increased total needs for wastewater treatment, including improvements for water quality standards, infrastructure rehabilitation, and capacity expansion to meet population growth. Stormwater management needs also rose due to emerging green infrastructure requirements. Funding for security issues and climate change adaptation was not explicitly included in the estimates. The 1987 amendments sparked debate on the nation's wastewater infrastructure efforts. The 1987 amendments to the act included grants for sewage treatment projects and a new program for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs). States had to deposit 20% of the federal grant into a state fund for wastewater treatment construction. The SRFs allowed for loans to be repaid, creating a continuous source of financing for future projects. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act introduced State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) to assist in transitioning to full state and local financing by FY1995. While most states find the SRF program effective, large funding needs have delayed the shift to full state responsibility. SRF monies can be used for various activities, including providing loans for up to 100% of project costs, buying or refinancing cities' debt, and serving as revenue or security for state-issued bonds. Additionally, SRF monies can be used for loan guarantees or credit enhancement for localities. Since the inception of the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) program, states have utilized $4.0 billion to support over 14,500 nonpoint management projects. Congressional oversight has monitored progress in reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities to meet water quality objectives. Despite some criticism, the SRF program's fundamental approach is widely endorsed. The Congress established a drinking water SRF in 1996, modeled after the clean water SRF. Despite initial plans to phase out federal support, Congress has continued to provide an average of $1.35 billion annually in SRF capitalization grants to states. Table 1 shows funding for wastewater treatment under Title II and Title VI since the 1987 amendments. One ongoing concern is the impact of funding water infrastructure projects on small communities. Small communities face challenges in participating in the SRF loan program due to factors like narrow tax bases, limited access to capital, and higher per capita needs. Congress is interested in addressing the special needs of small towns through a grant program or special loan rules. There are concerns about the allocation of SRF funds, prioritizing projects, and funding high-cost projects. The EPA is concerned about the adequacy of funding for high-cost projects dealing with sewer overflows and stormwater runoff, estimating a nationwide cost of nearly $64 billion. Wastewater utilities are seeking assistance to assess vulnerabilities and upgrade facilities against potential terrorist attacks. In 2010, the EPA issued a policy to encourage conservation and provide long-term funding for infrastructure through SRFs. EPA is working with water utilities to promote planning processes that reflect public health, water quality, conservation of natural resources, and innovative treatment. Congress has considered water infrastructure funding issues, but no legislation other than appropriations has been enacted. Several factors have contributed to difficulties in moving bills through the legislative process. Controversies surround the application of prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act to water infrastructure projects and disputes over the formula for allocating clean water SRF grants among states. The Davis-Bacon Act has both strong supporters and critics in Congress and elsewhere, with critics arguing it increases construction costs and hampers competition, while supporters believe it stabilizes the local construction industry by preventing undercutting of wages and working conditions. The Davis-Bacon Act applied to initial federal capitalization grants in the original SRF program authorization. When the authorization expired in FY1994, Davis-Bacon requirements also expired. The recent issue is whether to restore these requirements. Another issue is the allocation of SRF capitalization grants among states, which has not been revised since 1987 despite changing needs. This is important for every state as it can result in winners and losers. The issue of allocating SRF capitalization grants among states has not been revised since 1987, despite changing needs. This is crucial for clean water infrastructure legislation, with proposals for new federal spending not advancing due to a focus on reducing federal spending and deficit reduction. Reauthorization legislation was introduced in the 113th Congress, acknowledging the challenges communities face in providing water infrastructure services. Congress is considering ways to help meet these challenges, including established programs like the SRF program. Some infrastructure financing options include the SRF program and a national infrastructure bank. There is no consensus on a preferred policy, with many advocating for a combination of options. One debated option is the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, which has been enacted in the 113th Congress. EPA is authorized to provide credit assistance for drinking water and wastewater projects under this program. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program provides assistance for water projects, offering financing advantages by providing credit assistance at low U.S. Treasury rates. Projects must be $20 million or larger, except for rural areas with a population of 25,000 or less, which must have eligible project costs of $5 million or more. EPA has been holding meetings to discuss implementation of the program and gather stakeholder views on defining eligible projects, developing ranking systems, and determining credit criteria. In FY2015, Congress provided EPA with $2.2 million for staffing the WIFIA program, but did not allocate funds for project financing. P.L. 113-121 also includes amendments to water infrastructure provisions, such as changes to the Title VI SRF program. Some provisions were proposed in previous legislation but did not progress. The CWA provisions included in P.L. 113-121 are the first amendments to Title VI since 1987, expanding SRF-eligible projects, increasing assistance to Indian Tribes, and imposing \"Buy American\" requirements. However, the amendments do not address reauthorization of clean water SRF grants, state-by-state allocation of grants, and prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act. The Davis-Bacon Act requires locally prevailing wages for workers on projects receiving SRF assistance. The debate over wetlands protection focuses on the CWA, particularly Section 404 permit program for disposal of dredged material into navigable waters. Section 404 is a key federal tool for wetlands protection but is seen as intrusive and burdensome. The Section 404 permit program under the CWA is crucial for wetlands protection but is criticized for being intrusive and burdensome. The program is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with input from other federal agencies like the Fish and Wildlife Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service. Conflicts arise between regulating activities in wetlands and landowners' desire to develop property including wetlands. The conflicts over wetlands regulation have mainly occurred in administrative and judicial proceedings since Congress has not amended Section 404 since 1977. Controversies have arisen over federal jurisdiction, impacts on private property, permit procedures, and the roles of federal agencies and states. One contentious issue is whether isolated waters should fall under Section 404 jurisdiction, as they may not provide all the values of wetlands despite meeting the technical definition. In 2001, the Supreme Court ruled on the extent of the Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdiction over isolated waters in the SWANCC case. The Court held that denying a permit based solely on migratory bird usage exceeded the CWA authority. In 2006, the Court revisited CWA jurisdiction in cases seeking to narrow the scope of the 404 permit program for wetland development. The issue focused on whether non-navigable waters could be regulated under the CWA. The Supreme Court ruled on the Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdiction in 2006, specifically regarding non-navigable waters and wetland development. The Court's decision in Rapanos v. United States clarified the scope of federal jurisdiction under the CWA, with Justice Scalia leading a plurality decision that vacated lower court rulings. Justice Kennedy joined the plurality in remanding the cases for further consideration, while dissenting Justices took different positions on substantive issues. The Supreme Court's 2006 ruling on Clean Water Act jurisdiction in Rapanos v. United States led to uncertainty over which wetlands and waters are federally regulated. This lack of clarity has resulted in case-by-case determinations and ongoing litigation, prompting calls for administrative rulemaking. The full impact on regulatory programs remains unclear, with differing interpretations in subsequent court cases. Environmentalists criticize the Court's interpretation of congressional intent, while industry and others await further changes. The responsibility to protect affected wetlands now falls on states and localities. The Supreme Court's 2006 ruling on Clean Water Act jurisdiction in Rapanos v. United States created uncertainty over federally regulated wetlands and waters. Different court interpretations have led to varying impacts on regulatory programs. Environmental groups criticize the restrictions on protected waters, while industry faces delays in obtaining permits. EPA and the Corps issued guidance documents to help make jurisdictional determinations following the rulings. The Obama Administration proposed new guidance in April 2011 to clarify regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters and wetlands, addressing inconsistencies and delays in obtaining permits. The guidance aimed to determine which waters are subject to the Clean Water Act, based on Supreme Court decisions and agency regulations. The Obama Administration proposed new guidance in April 2011 to clarify regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters and wetlands. The agencies concluded that previous guidance did not fully utilize the authority provided by the Clean Water Act. They expected an increase in the extent of waters under jurisdiction, clarifying uncertainties and not greatly expanding acreage or stream miles. The EPA and Corps proposed guidance in 2011 to clarify jurisdiction over U.S. waters. Critics argued it was over-reaching and not legally binding. The draft guidance was not finalized, and in 2013, a new rule was announced. Public comments were accepted until 2014. The proposed rule aimed to revise the definition of \"waters of the United States\" based on legal rulings and scientific evidence. The proposed rule aims to clarify the regulatory status of various types of waters in the United States, including isolated waters, ambiguous waters post-SWANCC ruling, and waters affected by the Rapanos ruling. It does not change jurisdiction over traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, wetlands, territorial seas, and impoundments, but it does expand CWA jurisdiction by explicitly including certain types of waters. The proposed rule clarifies CWA jurisdiction by categorically identifying some waters as jurisdictional, such as adjacent waters, tributaries, and excluding waters like ditches with less than perennial flow. It aims to provide clarity and certainty to the regulated community while maintaining the need for case-specific evaluations for some waters. The proposal does not extend beyond historical CWA coverage or protect new types of waters. The EPA proposed rule aims to clarify CWA jurisdiction by categorically identifying certain waters as jurisdictional, such as adjacent waters and tributaries, while excluding waters like ditches with less than perennial flow. Some stakeholders believe this would not exceed the Supreme Court's narrow reading of jurisdiction under SWANCC and Rapanos, while others argue it would expand CWA jurisdiction beyond legal limits. Additionally, in September 2013, EPA released a draft report summarizing scientific literature on the connectivity of streams and wetlands to larger water bodies. The EPA and Corps used a draft report to develop a proposed rule clarifying CWA jurisdiction. The draft report was reviewed by the Science Advisory Board for scientific support. The proposed rule considers the latest peer-reviewed science but will not be finalized until the SAB's review is complete. The EPA connectivity report will provide a scientific basis for clarifying CWA jurisdiction. The final science report is complete, and stakeholders are concerned about potential broad jurisdiction over streams. An ad hoc panel found the draft connectivity study accurately links streams, wetlands, and downstream waters. Congressional committees seek clarification on federal jurisdiction over wetlands. Legislation has been introduced to address uncertainties regarding federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters raised by recent rulings. Environmental advocates argue that Congress must clarify these issues and reaffirm the original intent of the Clean Water Act. Critics question proposed legislation to clarify Clean Water Act jurisdiction, citing concerns about expanding federal authority. Obama Administration officials acknowledge uncertainties and support legislative clarification, but no specific legislation was developed. Future prospects for legislation are uncertain due to differing views. Future prospects for legislation regarding Clean Water Act jurisdiction are uncertain due to differing views among proponents and opponents. Efforts by the EPA and the Corps to develop revised guidance and regulations have been controversial and received congressional attention. Legislative provisions prohibiting funding for activities related to the guidance and proposed \"waters\" rule have been included in appropriations bills since the 112th and 113th Congresses. One provision in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 requires the withdrawal of an interpretive rule related to the proposed \"waters\" rule, specifically addressing permit exemptions for agricultural activities. Legislation concerning the Clean Water Act has been a topic of interest in Congress, with bills introduced to prevent finalization of proposed rules and guidance. The House passed a bill to prevent finalization of a proposed \"waters\" rule and withdraw related agricultural exemptions. Other issues related to achieving CWA goals have also been subject to congressional oversight and legislation. Since 2009, EPA has faced criticism for its regulatory initiatives under the Clean Water Act. Critics accuse the agency of overreaching its authority and underestimating the economic impacts of its rules. Republican leaders in Congress conducted oversight and introduced bills to overturn regulations or limit EPA's authority. Environmental groups defend EPA's actions, arguing that the focus on costs overlooks the benefits of pollution controls. The EPA defends its regulatory initiatives under the Clean Water Act, emphasizing the benefits of pollution controls over costs. Despite efforts to improve the Chesapeake Bay, water quality remains a significant concern, with overall poor health in the Bay and its tributaries. The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries are in poor health due to polluted water, reduced fish and shellfish populations, and degraded habitat. President Obama declared the Bay a \"national treasure\" in 2009, leading to the development of a new strategy for restoration. This strategy includes clean water regulations, agricultural conservation practices, and pollution control initiatives. The EPA's strategy for restoring the Chesapeake Bay watershed includes implementing new agricultural conservation practices, establishing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) to control pollution, and ensuring water quality standards are met. Failure by states to establish TMDLs may result in EPA intervention. Over 20,000 waterways in the US, including those in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, are known to be violating water quality standards and require TMDLs. The EPA established the Chesapeake Bay TMDL on December 29, 2010, as a result of lawsuits pressuring EPA and states to develop TMDLs for waterways violating quality standards. The TMDL aims to address pollution from nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment in the Bay and its tributaries, with implementation measures targeted for completion by 2025. Jurisdictions in the watershed are required to develop Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs) to meet specific pollutant reduction goals outlined in the TMDL. The EPA established the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in December 2010 to address pollution from nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment. Jurisdictions must develop WIPs with specific control measures and milestones. Phase II WIPs provide localized identification of controls and best management practices. Legal challenges to the TMDL have been brought by agricultural and home builder groups. Environmental activists support federal leadership in restoring the Chesapeake Bay through legislation codifying TMDL requirements in the Clean Water Act. The 112th Congress showed interest in early TMDL implementation, focusing on agricultural impacts. Legislation was proposed to give states authority over nutrient and sediment limits, increasing USDA's role. The Clean Water Act directs states to adopt water quality standards, with EPA able to intervene if needed. Florida's waters are heavily impacted by nutrients from various sources. In 2009, EPA determined that Florida's water quality standards for nutrients needed to be revised to better control pollution. EPA entered into a consent decree to address this issue. The EPA entered into a consent decree with environmental litigants in 2009 to establish numeric nutrient water quality standards for Florida. The first phase of these standards was issued on November 15, 2010, for lakes and flowing waters in the state. The rule does not directly apply to regulated entities or sources of nutrient pollution, and it has not yet gone into effect as EPA delayed the effective date to prepare for implementation and state efforts to develop a rule that EPA could approve. EPA delayed the effective date of the 2010 rule to allow time for review and development of implementation strategies by local governments, businesses, and the state of Florida. Controversies arose over data, compliance costs, and administrative flexibility. EPA preferred Florida to implement its own numeric nutrient water quality criteria, and the state submitted revised standards in June 2012. EPA indicated approval of the standards, leading to the initiation of administrative action to repeal the 2010 federal rule. Multiple delays were made to allow the state to finalize its standards. In response to legal challenges and delays, EPA extended the effective date of the 2010 rule multiple times to accommodate state processes and avoid confusion. A federal court ruling upheld EPA's authority in setting numeric criteria for nutrient pollution in Florida waters but remanded a portion of the rule concerning criteria for streams. The deadline for issuing standards for estuaries and coastal waters in South Florida was also extended to allow the state to develop its own standards. EPA and the state reached an agreement in March 2013 on steps to implement the state's standards. In March 2013, EPA and Florida agreed for the state to determine numeric limits on nutrient pollution in waterways. Florida committed to establishing criteria for lakes, rivers, streams, and estuaries through rulemaking and legislation. EPA approved the state's plan for controlling nutrient pollution and sought court approval for Florida's water quality standards. In January 2014, the court amended the 2009 consent decree to lift the requirement for EPA to issue numeric nutrient standards in Florida. EPA finalized a rule withdrawing federally promulgated water quality standards to allow Florida to implement its own standards. Industry groups supported the agreement, but environmental advocacy groups criticized it for lacking essential elements and excluding certain water bodies from regulation. Some industry groups fear that EPA's actions in Florida could set a precedent for similar regulatory action elsewhere. Environmental advocacy groups have filed petitions and lawsuits seeking numeric nutrient water quality standards in Kansas and the Upper Mississippi River Basin. EPA is defending its decision in court, drawing congressional attention with a bill in the 113th Congress. In the 113th Congress, a bill (H.R. 1948) aimed to limit EPA's oversight of state water quality standards by requiring EPA approval before promulgating a new standard. Controversies surrounding Florida's rules persisted despite EPA approval. Mountaintop removal coal mining in six Appalachian states buries streams with excess spoil, leading to environmental concerns. Mountaintop mining in the Appalachian region is controversial due to its impact on stream water quality and wildlife habitat. The mining industry argues that it is necessary for surface coal mining, but regulations are in place to reduce environmental harm. In 2009, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed to address these concerns. The plan to address impacts of mountaintop mining and surface coal mining in Appalachia includes near-term and longer-term actions for improved coordination and transparency. Regulatory proposals and stricter use of permits have been implemented to limit environmental impacts. Enhanced Coordination Procedures are being used to evaluate pending permit applications for surface mining activities. In October 2011, coal industry groups and state officials challenged the Enhanced Coordination Procedures (ECP) process in federal court, which was deemed unlawful. The court struck down the ECP, leading to the EPA issuing guidance on permit reviews for surface coal mining in Appalachia. The guidance tightened oversight by establishing benchmarks for stream conductivity, a measure of water salinity linked to mining activity. This move has sparked controversy within the industry. The 2011 guidance document on assessing a mine's water quality impacts was invalidated by a federal court in July 2012, leading to controversy within the industry. Legislation introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to restrict mountaintop mining practices. The significance of the bill is regulating discharges into U.S. waters under Section 404 permits, which are less restrictive than Section 402 requirements. Supporters aim to limit environmentally harmful activities, while critics argue that economically important activities like coal mining may become infeasible under stricter regulations. Another bill proposed a moratorium on mountain removal coal mining for health studies. The EPA's veto of a CWA Section 404 permit for a surface coal mining operation in West Virginia, the Spruce No. 1 mine, was controversial. A federal district court overturned the veto, but a federal appeals court later upheld EPA's authority to retroactively veto permits, sparking debate and leading to bills being introduced to limit EPA's veto power. Several proposals in the 113th Congress aimed to restrict EPA's veto authority over 404 permits, including bills that would have prohibited retroactive vetoes. Congressional interest in government actions on mountaintop mining continued in 2014, with federal courts requiring NPDES permits for aerial pesticide application in U.S. waters. This decision impacted pesticide applicators and public health entities. In 2006, EPA finalized a rule to clarify when a CWA permit is needed for pesticide use. A federal court rejected EPA's argument in 2009, leading to the development of a general CWA permit for pesticide applications. This aimed to reduce regulatory burdens on pesticide applicators and state officials. EPA issued a pesticide general permit on October 31, 2011, covering various use patterns. Despite efforts to address the 2009 court ruling, bipartisan support exists for legislation affirming that a CWA permit is not required for FIFRA-approved pesticides. Legislation has been proposed to amend FIFRA and the CWA to exempt pesticides authorized under FIFRA from requiring a CWA permit. This proposal was included in the 2013 farm bill but not in the final version. Another court ruling highlighted the need for CWA permits for certain types of stormwater runoff. The court invalidated EPA's position on stormwater runoff from logging roads, stating it does not require a permit. Environmental groups argue that timber hauling causes sediment runoff harming aquatic life. Critics say the existing state regulation process has been effective for 35 years. In 2012, the Supreme Court reviewed the logging roads ruling after a petition by timber industry groups. EPA planned to issue a rule to nullify the ruling and specify that logging roads do not need discharge permits for stormwater runoff. In November 2012, EPA signed a rule stating that logging roads do not need discharge permits for stormwater runoff. The Supreme Court upheld EPA's interpretation in March 2013, reversing the Ninth Circuit's ruling. Legislation was introduced in Congress to amend the Clean Water Act regarding permit requirements for silviculture activities. The legislation exempts silviculture activities from needing an NPDES permit under the Clean Water Act, as long as they follow industry standards. This exemption does not apply to dredge and fill permits or other federal laws. Congress regularly addresses clean water policy in annual appropriations acts. EPA's appropriations are included in the Interior, Environment, and Related. The Administration's FY2014 budget request sought $8.15 billion overall for EPA, including reduced funding for clean water SRF capitalization grants. The House Appropriations Subcommittee drafted a bill that would cut EPA funding by 34%, with an 83% reduction for clean water SRF grants. The reduction is justified by the lack of progress in addressing the water infrastructure gap. The draft bill proposed $60 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, but no final agreement was reached on FY2014 appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee drafted an alternative bill maintaining funding for the clean water SRF program at $1.45 billion and providing small increases for EPA programs. Congress passed a short-term funding measure (P.L. 113-46) until January 15, 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (H.R. 3547, P.L. 113-76) provided $1.45 billion for clean water SRF grants, $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and funding for various water quality grants. The Administration's FY2015 budget sought $7.89 billion for EPA, including $1.018 billion for clean water SRF grants. The FY2015 budget requested $1.018 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $15 million for specific projects, and $1.13 billion for state categorical grants. The budget also included funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and other geographic programs like Chesapeake Bay. The FY2015 budget requested funding for clean water SRF capitalization grants, specific projects, state categorical grants, and programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and Chesapeake Bay. The appropriations committees took action on bills to provide EPA funding, with final appropriations included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. This bill maintained FY2014 funding levels for most EPA water programs, including $1.45 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants and $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The bill allocates $159 million for nonpoint pollution management grants, $231 million for state water quality management grants, and $73 million for the Chesapeake Bay program, which is $3 million more than FY2014. Funding levels are higher than the President's FY2015 budget request. Additionally, $9.5 million is included for the beaches grant program, despite no funding being requested by the Administration."
