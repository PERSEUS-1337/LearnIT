    "content": "The \"Family Act of 2016\" is the short title of this Act. Congress recognizes infertility as a disease, with approximately 3,000,000 women in the US facing challenges in conceiving or carrying a pregnancy. Among them are cancer survivors who underwent treatments causing irreversible damage to their reproductive systems. Military families, including active duty individuals and veterans, face challenges with infertility due to lower extremity war injuries and barriers to accessing fertility treatments. They do not have coverage for IVF through military health insurance and must pay out of pocket, with the average cost per cycle being $12,500. Medical insurance coverage for infertility treatments is limited and inconsistent at the State level, with only 8 States requiring comprehensive coverage. IVF is only covered by a small percentage of employer-sponsored health plans, leading to significant out-of-pocket expenses for couples seeking treatment. According to the latest National Survey of Family Growth, African-American and Hispanic women are more likely to be infertile than Caucasian women, yet they are less likely to use infertility services. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR CERTAIN INFERTILITY TREATMENTS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section providing a credit for certain infertility treatments. A credit of 50% of qualified infertility treatment expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year is allowed for eligible individuals. The credit is subject to limitations on dollar amount and income. The credit for infertility treatment expenses is subject to limitations based on adjusted gross income, with a reduction formula based on income exceeding a certain threshold. No double benefit is allowed for this credit. The credit for infertility treatment expenses is limited if a deduction or credit is taken elsewhere, if reimbursement is received from a government program, or if payment is made through insurance. Unused credit can be carried forward to future years. The credit for infertility treatment expenses can be carried forward to future years, with a limitation of up to the 5th taxable year after the credit arose. Qualified infertility treatment expenses refer to payments for in vitro fertilization administered by a licensed medical practitioner for infertility diagnosed by a US licensed physician. Expenses for procedures causing involuntary infertility or sterilization are considered qualified infertility treatment expenses, regardless of subsequent diagnosis. Fertility preservation procedures before infertility-inducing treatments are not included. Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to live birth, including iatrogenic infertility from medical treatments like chemotherapy or surgery. The term \"eligible individual\" in this section refers to someone diagnosed with infertility by a licensed physician in the US. Married couples must file joint returns for this section. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Sec. 23A allows for a tax credit for certain infertility treatments. Amendments are made to various sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include references to Sec. 23A. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2016."
