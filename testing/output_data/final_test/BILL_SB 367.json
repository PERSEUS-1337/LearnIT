    "title": "SB 367",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 562 is added to the Food and Agricultural Code, emphasizing California's significant agricultural output and vulnerability to climate change. The state's agriculture sector can also play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The California agriculture sector can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and store carbon in soils and trees, contributing to the state's climate change goals. These efforts also lead to environmental benefits such as improved air and water quality, water conservation, wildlife habitat enhancement, and healthier rural communities. The Legislature aims to support activities that enhance the long-term viability of California agriculture amidst climate change impacts. The Legislature aims to support the state's agricultural sector in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon storage in soils and woody biomass. Definitions related to agricultural activities, the Department of Food and Agriculture, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the Environmental Farming Science Advisory Panel, and the Secretary of Food and Agriculture are provided in the Food and Agricultural Code. The Department of Food and Agriculture will establish an environmental farming program to provide incentives to farmers for practices that benefit ecosystems, air quality, wildlife, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase carbon storage in agricultural soils and woody biomass. This may include loans, grants, research, technical assistance, educational materials, permit assistance, coordination, and funding for on-farm demonstration projects. The Department of Food and Agriculture may compile scientific evidence on agriculture's environmental impacts and benefits from various sources. They will serve as a repository for this evidence and provide it to relevant agencies. These activities will be conducted with existing resources. The Department of Food and Agriculture will convene an Environmental Farming Science Advisory Panel to advise on environmental farming programs and agricultural practices' impact on air, water, climate change, and wildlife habitat. The panel will consist of members appointed by the Secretary for Environmental Protection with expertise in climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction practices related to agriculture. The Environmental Farming Science Advisory Panel will consist of members appointed by the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency and the Secretary, including agricultural producers, representatives from the California Association of Resource Conservation Districts, University of California Cooperative Extension, and individuals conducting scientific research related to environmental farming practices. The Environmental Farming Science Advisory Panel members are appointed by the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency and must be highly qualified with at least five years of experience in their field. The panel reviews data on the impacts of agriculture on the environment and recommends scientifically valid data to state agencies for incorporation into programs. The Environmental Farming Science Advisory Panel recommends scientifically valid data on agriculture's environmental impacts to state agencies. If agencies do not use the data, they must provide reasons within 180 days. The panel also compiles environmental impact data for the department and assists in incorporating benefits into regulatory programs. The Environmental Farming Science Advisory Panel advises on programs and projects for agricultural producers to achieve environmental and health benefits. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air and water quality, and enhancing wildlife habitat. The State Air Resources Board, in consultation with the panel, may recommend tools for quantifying greenhouse gas reductions in the grant program. The panel can create ad hoc committees for assistance and must submit a biennial report on their work to relevant parties. The panel conducts work over a two-year period, with an action plan for the next two years. The first report is due two years after the panel's first meeting or by January 1, 2019. The panel is funded from existing department resources. Additionally, a new section 569 is added to the Food and Agricultural Code. Section 569 of the Food and Agricultural Code allocates $25 million for projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon storage in agricultural practices. This includes soil-building techniques, irrigation efficiency, water conservation measures, and alternative energy production. An agricultural processing facility in the state improved on-farm energy efficiencies and implemented wildlife habitat conservation measures. The department will develop a grant program in consultation with a panel to carry out the purposes of this article. A memorandum of agreement will be established among relevant state agencies to ensure coordination in implementing funded programs and projects. Section 39719 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. Section 39719 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to appropriate annual funds for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the state. 35% of the proceeds are allocated for transit, affordable housing, and sustainable communities programs. Five percent of the fund proceeds go to the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program, while twenty percent is allocated to the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program. Beginning in the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, 25 percent of the annual fund proceeds are continuously appropriated to the High-Speed Rail Authority for various project costs, including acquisition, construction, environmental review, design, and repayment of loans. The calculation does not include moneys subject to a specific section. Section 75217.5 is added to the Public Resources Code to provide incentives for agricultural land management practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon. The Sustainable Agricultural Lands Conservation Program includes financial incentives for these practices, but the 2014 program guidelines do not establish a grant program for this purpose. The council will establish a grant program to incentivize land management practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon on agricultural operations. Priority will be given to operations that achieve these goals."
