    "content": "When the President declares a major disaster, FEMA provides three types of assistance: Public Assistance (PA) for infrastructure repairs, Mitigation Assistance (MA) for future damage reduction projects, and Individual Assistance (IA) for affected individuals and households. FEMA uses factors from the Preliminary Damage Assessment to recommend PA and/or IA. After Hurricane Sandy, Congress mandated FEMA to update the factors considered for assistance recommendations. FEMA considers various factors when recommending Individual Assistance (IA) to the President after a major disaster. IA programs include Mass Care, Crisis Counseling, Disaster Unemployment, Legal Services, Case Management, and Individuals and Households Program. Emergency Assistance includes distributing supplies, reuniting families, coordinating volunteers, managing donations, supporting sheltering, and assisting with evacuations. The Crisis Counseling Program offers outreach and counseling services for disaster recovery. Disaster Unemployment Assistance provides resources for affected individuals. Unemployment Assistance provides resources for individuals affected by disasters, including those who were employed or self-employed, unable to work due to damage to their workplace, or ineligible for regular unemployment benefits. Disaster Legal Services offer legal aid to low-income individuals, while Disaster Case Management involves a partnership to create a recovery plan. Individuals and Households Program offers two categories of assistance. The Individuals and Households Program provides Housing Assistance and Other Needs Assistance. Housing Assistance includes financial aid for lodging, repairs, and replacement of residences. It may also involve home repair and construction services in certain areas. FEMA may offer manufactured housing units as well. FEMA provides temporary housing through Transitional Sheltering Assistance and financial assistance for disaster-related expenses. Individual Assistance accounted for 14.4% of federal spending from FY2007 to FY2016. Some IA programs require cost sharing between FEMA and state governments. Transitional Sheltering under Mass Care and Emergency Assistance is subject to a 75/25 percent cost share. FEMA uses factors like concentration of damages, trauma, and special populations to determine potential IA for disaster survivors. These factors have remained unchanged since 1999. FEMA considers various factors such as low-income, elderly, and insurance coverage when determining Individual Assistance for disaster victims. Requests for more than $7.5 million in assistance typically result in a declaration for IA. FEMA provides factors for Individual Assistance (IA) programs, including state fiscal capacity, uninsured losses, population profile, infrastructure impact, casualties, and disaster-related unemployment. FEMA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in response to congressional direction for updated IA factors. FEMA proposed using three factors to evaluate state and local jurisdiction's fiscal capacity for Individual Assistance programs: total tax revenue, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and per-capita personal income. These factors, along with projected IA costs, would be used to develop Individual Assistance Cost to Capacity (ICC) ratios. FEMA found that higher ICC ratios were more likely to result in IA being part of a major disaster declaration based on data from 153 disaster declaration requests between 2008 and 2013. The proposed approach by FEMA for evaluating state and local jurisdiction's fiscal capacity for Individual Assistance programs would not be a hard \"threshold\" and would not incorporate a single factor into its regulations. Some FEMA stakeholders recommended a hard \"threshold\" similar to the per capita amount used for Public Assistance declarations, but FEMA cited Section 320 of the Stafford Act, which prohibits denial of assistance based solely on an \"arithmetic formula.\" FEMA stated that formulas are just one of several factors considered in decision-making. FEMA's proposed approach for evaluating state capacity in Individual Assistance programs includes various factors but does not impose a strict threshold. The proposal aims to influence states' decisions without removing their discretion, offering more detail on state resources and FEMA's assessment methods. Questions arise on how factors like the proposed ICC will be weighted in considering a governor's request, with a focus on programs like Disaster Unemployment Assistance. The rule also encourages states to develop programs that align with FEMA-style assistance for families and individuals. The proposed rule by FEMA aims to evaluate state capacity in Individual Assistance programs without imposing strict thresholds. It encourages states to align their programs with FEMA-style assistance for families and individuals, especially when federal supplemental help is not available. FEMA's timeline for finalizing this rule remains unknown."
