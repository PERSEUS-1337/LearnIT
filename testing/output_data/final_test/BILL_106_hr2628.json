    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Home Health Services Equity Act of 1999\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that the payment system for home health services covered under Medicare is causing unintended consequences, including depriving the sickest Medicare beneficiaries of necessary services and excessive reductions in reimbursement compared to other Medicare services. The per beneficiary limits for home health agencies do not accurately reflect their incurred costs. The current chunk highlights concerns about access to home health services under the Medicare Program, the potential limitations of the prospective payment system, and the impact of a 15 percent reduction in reimbursement scheduled for October 1, 2000. The 15 percent reduction in Medicare spending for home health services scheduled for October 1, 2000, exceeds Congress's intentions under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and does not consider patient needs. The home health interim payment system from the same act is not facilitating a smooth transition to prospective payment. SEC. 3. INTERIM PAYMENT SYSTEM OVERPAYMENT RECOUPMENT. The amendment to the Social Security Act limits recovery of payments for reasonable costs made to home health agencies before a specific cost reporting period. The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply as if included in the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. SEC. 4. ELIMINATION OF AUTOMATIC 15 PERCENT REDUCTION IN PAYMENT LIMITS. Elimination of reduction in payment limits under the Prospective Payment System and Interim Payment System. Amendments made to the Social Security Act and Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to remove specified reductions. The Act of 1997, as amended by the Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998, removes subsection (e). SEC. 5 revises per visit limits under the Social Security Act, while SEC. 6 ensures beneficiary choice of provider with prorated limits. SEC. 6 amends the Social Security Act to ensure beneficiary choice of provider with prorated limits for home health services. The amendment applies to cost reporting periods starting on or after October 1, 1999. The Social Security Act is amended to provide exceptions and exemptions for home health agencies in medically underserved areas and additional payment amounts for agencies incurring costs above set limits due to new federal regulatory requirements after 1994. The Social Security Act is amended to provide exceptions and exemptions for home health agencies in medically underserved areas and additional payment amounts for agencies incurring costs above set limits due to new federal regulatory requirements after 1994. The aggregate amount of additional payments or payment adjustments made under section 1861(v)(1)(L)(ii)(II) may not exceed 5 percent of the projected payments for the fiscal year. Additionally, the Secretary shall provide an additional payment amount to a provider equal to the difference between the reasonable cost incurred by the provider and the limit under applicable clauses. The provider may receive additional payment if they demonstrate excessive costs for individuals needing expensive or extended home health services, as determined by the Secretary, and if the costs are reasonable. No payment will be made to providers who ceased offering eligible home health services by October 1, 1999. The amendments made by this section shall apply as if included in the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997."
