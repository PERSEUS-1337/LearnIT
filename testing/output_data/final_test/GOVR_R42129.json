    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to regulate the OTC derivatives market post-2008 financial crisis by requiring swap contracts to be cleared through a central counterparty. Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying variables like commodity prices or interest rates, and clearinghouses mandate initial margin to cover potential losses. Margin requirements in trading involve initial margin to cover potential losses and maintenance margin for actual losses. This helps prevent firms from building up large uncapitalized exposures that could lead to systemic consequences, as seen in cases like AIG. Clearing derivatives limits the size of positions based on capital availability, protecting trading partners and the system. While clearing derivatives addresses systemic risks, it also imposes the cost of posting margin on traders. The cost of posting margin on traders who trade derivatives can be a burden, even if the futures position ultimately makes a profit. Nonfinancial firms argued against being subjected to clearing OTC derivatives costs, known as \"the end user debate.\" The Dodd-Frank Act includes an exemption from clearing requirements for nonfinancial firms, addressing concerns about indirect costs. Some bills in the 112th Congress aim to address these \"end user\" concerns. Swap dealers and major swap participants are subject to additional margin and capital requirements under the act. Cleared swaps are also subject to trading on an exchange or swap execution facility. Derivatives, including cleared swaps, are traded on regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities. All trades must be reported to data repositories for regulatory oversight. Concerns about derivatives have been fueled by sharp rises in commodity prices, leading to apprehension about financial speculation causing volatility. Bills in the 112th Congress aim to expand the definition of swap execution facilities. In early 2011, gasoline prices surged by 20%, nearing 2008 highs, causing concern among consumers and Congress about the role of speculators in commodity markets. Reports from Senate and House committees highlighted the impact of excessive speculation on price movements in wheat and natural gas markets, with recommendations to address this issue to reduce gas prices for American consumers. Several bills in the 112th Congress address the influence of speculation on commodity prices. Several bills in the 112th Congress aim to address the impact of financial speculation and derivatives on spot commodity prices, proposing exemptions for commercial end users from margin and capital requirements. Several bills in the 112th Congress aim to address the impact of financial speculation and derivatives on spot commodity prices. H.R. 2682 would exempt swap transactions involving nonfinancial end users from capital and margin requirements. H.R. 2779 would exempt certain contracts from being classified as swaps, subject to reporting requirements. The bill referred to the full Committee on Financial Services exempts swaps between affiliates from margin and capital requirements. It also amends definitions related to swap execution facilities and addresses concerns about proposed agency rules for trading facilities. The bill prohibits certain requirements for bids and offers on SEFs and SBSEFs. H.R. 3045, introduced by Representative Canseco, amends Dodd-Frank to redefine \"special entities\" for swap dealers and specifies a higher standard of care owed to them. It removes ERISA plans from the definition of special entities. The bill also addresses concerns about trading facilities and prohibits certain requirements for bids and offers on SEFs and SBSEFs. The bill H.R. 2328 and S. 1200 aim to reduce speculation in commodities like crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil by imposing limits on speculative positions in both swaps and futures markets. The CFTC is directed to enforce these limits to prevent price fluctuations not justified by supply and demand forces. The bill H.R. 3006 and S. 1598 aim to reduce speculation in commodities by imposing position limits on swaps and futures markets. The CFTC is directed to set a 12% margin requirement for these commodities, which is higher than the current 8% for crude oil futures. The increase in trading costs is expected to decrease trading volume. The provisions of the bill will expire once the CFTC establishes position limits in line with the Dodd-Frank Act. Excessive speculation is presumed if speculative trading volume exceeds the 25-year average by more than 10%, leading the CFTC to set limits on the percentage of energy commodity contracts held by speculators. The bills aim to reduce speculation in commodities by imposing position limits on swaps and futures markets. H.R. 2003 proposes a tax on oil futures, options, and swaps, with exemptions for commercial traders and financial institutions. Other bills, such as H.R. 3313 and S. 1787, suggest a tax on a broad range of financial transactions. S. 1787 (Senator Harkin) proposes a tax on various financial transactions, including derivatives trades. H.R. 3283 (Representative Himes) limits Dodd-Frank's extraterritorial reach by exempting swaps between U.S. and non-U.S. persons. Several bills seek to repeal Dodd-Frank entirely, returning swap regulation to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. Several bills aim to delay the implementation of Title VII of Dodd-Frank by requiring regulators to conduct studies, public hearings, or roundtables before issuing final rules. H.R. 1573 sets a deadline of December 31, 2012, for the provisions of Title VII to take effect, with exceptions for certain rules related to swap reporting, clearing provisions, speculation authorities, and the prohibition on federal bailouts of swap dealers. The bill also mandates public hearings by the CFTC and SEC to assess the time and resources needed by market participants to comply with regulations and consider alternative regulatory approaches. The bill authorizes U.S. regulators to exempt persons subject to comparable foreign regulation. H.Amdt. 465 to H.R. 2112 postpones swap trading data reporting rules under Dodd-Frank Section 727 for 12 months. S.Amdt. 814 to H.R. 2112 requires CFTC to adopt an implementation schedule and submit a study on the effects of Title VII on U.S. economic growth and job creation. The amendment to H.R. 2112, proposed by Senator Crapo, extends the Title VII rulemaking deadline by one year, shifting most rules to be due in July 2012 instead of July 2011. The bill mandates the CFTC and SEC to create an orderly implementation schedule by December 31, 2011, considering the impact on U.S. economic growth, international competitiveness of U.S. financial markets, derivatives market depth and liquidity, and cooperation among U.S. regulators. H.R. 1840, introduced by Representative Conaway, also makes amendments related to these regulatory aspects. H.R. 1840 amends the Commodity Exchange Act to require the CFTC to consider costs and benefits before proposing regulations. The bill outlines factors the CFTC must consider, such as market impact and regulatory burden. H.R. 1838 aims to repeal restrictions on federal assistance to swap entities under Dodd-Frank. H.R. 2483 amends Dodd-Frank whistleblower provisions for CFTC and SEC, requiring internal reporting before regulators for eligibility for awards. The bill amends Dodd-Frank whistleblower provisions for CFTC and SEC, requiring internal reporting before regulators to be eligible for an award. It also removes the minimum award provisions, giving agencies discretion over the whistleblower payment size."
