Section 508 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to establish the Railroad Emergency Services Preparedness, Operational Needs, and Safety Evaluation Subcommittee under the National Advisory Council. The Subcommittee includes the Deputy Administrator for Protection and National Preparedness of FEMA. The Subcommittee under the National Advisory Council includes representatives from various agencies such as FEMA, Department of Homeland Security, National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Railroad Administration, Transportation Security Administration, and Coast Guard. The Subcommittee under the National Advisory Council includes representatives from various agencies such as FEMA, Department of Homeland Security, National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Railroad Administration, Transportation Security Administration, and Coast Guard. The Administrator appoints qualified individuals from different agencies to the National Advisory Council, including representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and other qualified individuals as needed. Members of the National Advisory Council with technical expertise in rail emergency response include individuals from emergency management, fire service, law enforcement, hazardous materials response, emergency medical services, as well as state, local, and tribal government officials with expertise in preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation. The RESPONSE Subcommittee includes individuals with technical knowledge from the rail, oil, and communications industries, as well as emergency response providers. Other individuals may be included as determined by the Administrator. The RESPONSE Subcommittee includes representatives from various organizations, technical experts, and vendors involved in emergency responder services. Other stakeholders and interested parties may also be included as deemed appropriate by the Administrator. The RESPONSE Subcommittee, chaired by the Deputy Administrator for Protection and National Preparedness, must hold an initial meeting within 90 days of the enactment of the RESPONSE Act of 2014. Subsequent meetings must occur at least twice a year, with one in-person meeting in the first year, as called by the Chairperson. Consultation with nonmembers and program offices for emergency responder training and resources is required. The RESPONSE Subcommittee will consult with relevant agencies, federally funded research entities, and academic institutions to explore new technologies for rail incident preparedness. Recommendations will focus on improving training and resource allocation for local emergency responders in hazardous materials incidents involving railroads. The RESPONSE Subcommittee will consult with relevant agencies, research entities, and academic institutions to improve training for local emergency responders near railroads, focusing on modernizing course content for hazardous materials incidents. The RESPONSE Subcommittee aims to enhance training for local emergency responders near railroads, specifically addressing the increase in oil shipments by rail. This includes developing complementary training opportunities across agencies and the private sector to prevent course content overlap and promote integrated content through partnerships. Regular evaluation and adaptation of courses are emphasized to stay current with emerging trends. The RESPONSE Subcommittee focuses on improving training for local emergency responders near railroads, with a focus on effectiveness of funding levels and minimizing resource allocation overlap among agencies and the private sector. The RESPONSE Subcommittee aims to enhance training for local emergency responders near railroads by maximizing public-private partnerships, adapting funding priorities, and integrating commodity flow studies for better access to resources. The RESPONSE Subcommittee is focusing on improving access to emergency response plans for rail, similar to existing laws for maritime and stationary facility emergency plans for hazardous materials. This includes requirements for emergency plans on each train, how the industry would implement these plans, and the thresholds that trigger their activation. The RESPONSE Subcommittee is addressing the need for emergency plans for trains carrying hazardous materials, gaps in regulations, and the establishment of a rail hazardous materials incident database. This includes determining the hosting entity, defining incidents requiring reporting, estimating costs, and ensuring database maintenance and enforcement. Increasing access to relevant, useful, and timely information for local emergency responders in the event of a rail hazardous materials incident, including assessing current information access and usefulness, and maximizing technology utilization for training and incident response. The RESPONSE Act of 2014 aims to assess emerging communications technology for emergency responders, determine appropriate agencies for implementation of recommendations, and issue a report within one year of enactment. The RESPONSE Act of 2014 requires the RESPONSE Subcommittee to submit recommendations to the National Advisory Council for review within 30 days. The Council may request additional information before approving the recommendations, which will then be submitted to the Administrator. The RESPONSE Act of 2014 mandates the submission of recommendations by the RESPONSE Subcommittee to the National Advisory Council for review within 30 days. The Council may request additional information before approving the recommendations, which will then be submitted to various congressional committees and agencies for oversight. After the report is submitted, the Administrator is required to provide quarterly updates to the congressional committees. The RESPONSE Subcommittee will coordinate the implementation of recommendations and submit additional reports as needed to congressional committees and agencies. The Subcommittee's responsibilities will terminate except in specific circumstances. The RESPONSE Subcommittee will terminate within 4 years of the enactment of the RESPONSE Act of 2014, with the possibility of extensions in 1-year increments if additional reports and recommendations are deemed necessary by the Administrator."
