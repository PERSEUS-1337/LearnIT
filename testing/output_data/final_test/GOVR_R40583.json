    "content": "On July 22, 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton signed the Instrument of Extension and Accession to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Phuket, Thailand. This move aimed to enhance the United States' presence in Southeast Asia by expanding its multilateral engagement in the region. The Obama Administration decided on executive agreement for U.S. accession to the TAC without Senate approval. Key issues included advancing U.S. interests in Southeast Asia, potential policy constraints, and the question of Senate ratification. Congressional measures focused on ASEAN engagement but did not mention TAC accession. The Obama Administration's decision to accede to the TAC was motivated by a desire to enhance U.S. presence in Southeast Asia and signal commitment to the region. ASEAN leaders view the TAC as a key document for maintaining regional peace and stability, with accession seen as a symbol of engagement in Southeast Asia. Prior to 2009, the U.S. was the only major Pacific power not part of the TAC. The U.S. presence in Southeast Asia has traditionally been organized along bilateral lines. Acceding to the TAC is a requirement for joining the East Asia Summit (EAS), which includes ASEAN members, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand. It is uncertain if the Obama Administration plans to join the EAS, and there may be resistance from EAS members like China and Malaysia. Australia joined the TAC in 2005 to become a founding member of the EAS. The idea of joining the TAC had been debated for years, with objections including concerns about constraints on U.S. freedom of action, potential undermining of security agreements with Asian allies, and doubts about the effectiveness of the TAC. Proponents argued that U.S. allies had already acceded to the TAC, negating these concerns. The TAC accession negotiations with Australia, South Korea, and Japan included side letters with ASEAN to address concerns about constraining U.S. policy. The Obama Administration also exchanged side letters with ASEAN to prevent limitations on U.S. foreign policy actions. Australia's actions against the Burmese regime in 2007 were cited as evidence that the TAC would not necessarily restrict U.S. policy. Australia's policy towards Burma involves quiet engagement with occasional criticisms and penalties, not as extensive as U.S. sanctions. ASEAN, a major regional grouping in Southeast Asia, includes 10 member nations with over 500 million people. Secretary Clinton stated that neither sanctions nor ASEAN's engagement strategies were effective during her visit to Asia in February 2009. Southeast Asia is a key region for U.S. naval deployments and has been a base for terrorist operations. It is a source of various security issues such as smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and human trafficking. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, is important for its size, democratic example, and carbon emissions. Southeast Asia is strategically important for the U.S. due to its role in global and regional affairs. It includes key allies like Thailand and the Philippines, as well as security partner Singapore. The region is also a battleground for influence between China, the United States, and Japan, with China expanding its presence since the early 2000s. There are debates about whether Beijing's growing influence has undermined U.S. power in the region. China's increased presence in Southeast Asia has raised concerns about U.S. influence in the region. Some argue that the U.S. and China are not in a \"zero sum\" situation, but China's actions have made some Southeast Asians wary. Despite debates on the threat to U.S. interests, many Southeast Asian leaders desire a strong U.S. presence. The U.S. has increased engagement with ASEAN to support the region's political stature as China expands its influence. ASEAN is a significant U.S. trading partner. Total trade between the United States and the 10 ASEAN countries in 2008 was $178 billion, with ASEAN ranking as the fourth largest U.S. export market and the fifth largest source of U.S. imports. ASEAN's share of U.S. trade has fallen since 1995, with China's trade with ASEAN expanding sharply over the years. In 2008, ASEAN's trade data showed an increase in imports from China (2.2% to 12.7%) and a decrease from the United States (14.6% to 9.6%). ASEAN's exports to China also rose (2.1% to 9.7%) while exports to the United States fell (18.5% to 11.5%). Top trading partners for ASEAN in 2008 were Japan, the European Union, China, and the United States. In 2008, ASEAN's trade data showed an increase in imports from China and a decrease from the United States. ASEAN's exports to China also rose while exports to the United States fell. The United States, the European Union, China, and Japan were ASEAN's top trading partners. The United States was ASEAN's third largest export market and fourth largest source of imports, while China was the fourth largest export market and largest source of imports. The United States was a bigger source of ASEAN's foreign direct investment (FDI) than China. During 2006-2008, cumulative U.S. FDI flows to ASEAN were $12.8 billion, making the United States ASEAN's third largest source of FDI. China's FDI flows to ASEAN totaled $3.5 billion, making China the ninth largest source of ASEAN's FDI. ASEAN, established in 1967, has shifted from its original goal of containing communism to becoming a platform for Southeast Asian nations to address issues through informal consensus. Since the 1990s, ASEAN has played a key role in promoting cooperation in East Asia. It is seen as a less threatening mediator compared to China or Japan. However, its role as a neutral convener may be diminishing, as seen in the first standalone China-Japan-South Korea summit in 2008. ASEAN's consensus-based decision-making and policy of non-interference have led to criticisms of ineffectiveness in addressing transnational issues. Some Southeast Asians acknowledge ASEAN's role in fostering stability and promoting trade, but frustrations with internal procedures and limitations have been publicly highlighted. In the 2000s, some ASEAN members, like Indonesia and the Philippines, sought to expand the organization's powers, facing resistance from others like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Burma. Despite initial provisions for sanctions and compliance monitoring being removed from the 2008 charter, ASEAN established its first human rights body in 2009, focusing on promotion rather than penalization of human rights violations. The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) aims to promote peace and cooperation in Southeast Asia by providing a mechanism for resolving regional disputes among TAC parties. Originally drafted in 1976, the TAC was amended in 1987 and 1998 to allow accession by States outside Southeast Asia with the consent of ASEAN members. Accession by additional States outside Southeast Asia is contingent upon approval by all 10 ASEAN members. The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) in Asia aims to promote peace and cooperation among parties by outlining principles such as mutual respect, non-interference, peaceful dispute resolution, and effective cooperation. The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) in Asia emphasizes mutual relations, obligations in good faith, and cooperation in economic, social, technical, and scientific fields among parties. It also encourages collaboration for economic growth, trade expansion, and infrastructure improvement, as well as cooperation in training and research facilities. The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) in Asia emphasizes mutual relations, obligations in good faith, and cooperation in various fields. Article 9 requires parties to maintain regular contacts for coordinating policies. Article 10 prohibits activities that threaten the stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of another party without specifying the types of prohibited activities. The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) in Asia aims to promote national and regional resilience and pacific settlement of disputes between parties. Parties are obligated to refrain from using force and settle disputes through friendly negotiations. A High Council is established to resolve disputes, and the dispute settlement system is applicable to State parties outside Southeast Asia when directly involved in the dispute. The High Council under the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) recommends means of settlement for disputes, such as mediation or conciliation. Parties are not legally bound to follow the Council's recommendations. The Council has never been convened for dispute resolution under TAC. Parties can also seek recourse under the U.N.'s peaceful settlement modes. The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) recommends peaceful settlement modes for disputes, including negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. Parties are encouraged to resolve disputes through friendly negotiations before resorting to other procedures. This ensures compliance with the U.N. Charter's Article 103, which prioritizes obligations under the Charter over conflicting international agreements. The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) outlines treaty ratification, entry into force, and authoritative text. Accession of States outside Southeast Asia requires consent from all Southeast Asian States. The treaty is equally authoritative in all contracting parties' languages, with a common English text for interpretation. It does not address withdrawal, relationships with other agreements, or available remedies. The TAC parties must obtain consent from all ASEAN members for candidate States to accede to the agreement. Formal exchanges and consultations occur between ASEAN members and candidates for accession, typically through the ASEAN Chairman. If all ASEAN Members agree, the Chairman can sign a preliminary declaration of accession. The Chairman can sign a preliminary declaration of consent to accession on behalf of ASEAN Members. The accession process is completed when all ASEAN foreign ministers formally consent to the candidate party's accession to the TAC, and the candidate party signs and submits the instrument of accession. Negotiations may raise issues related to the agreement's provisions, and parties can attach reservations, declarations, or understandings. ASEAN members historically reluctant to allow reservations or declarations upon accession to the TAC. Some states seeking to accede have instead reached common understandings with ASEAN members, recorded in side letters with the ASEAN Chairman. These side letters serve as interpretative guidance, not amending the TAC but assisting in its interpretation according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The United States and other countries communicated their understanding of TAC requirements during the accession process. Side letters were exchanged with ASEAN Chairman to clarify interpretations. U.S. policymakers had to decide on the form of accession, either as a treaty or an executive agreement. The United States can enter into international agreements as treaties or executive agreements. While treaties require Senate approval, executive agreements are made by the executive branch without Senate consent. The President may have authority to enter into executive agreements through statutes or constitutional powers. The executive branch opted to accede to the TAC as a sole executive agreement, focusing solely on relations between TAC parties without imposing requirements on domestic activities. U.S. accession could have been a treaty requiring Senate approval, but it was chosen as an executive agreement. The United States has concluded numerous agreements concerning friendly relations as treaties, but the TAC differs in focus. The ASEAN TAC focuses on State-to-State relations without granting enforceable rights to nationals in other parties' territories. The United States has entered into international agreements covering security, economics, and technology through executive agreements, similar to the breadth of the TAC. The agreement with Spain aimed to promote cooperation in defense, economic, scientific, and cultural areas. Specific provisions included basing rights, defense procurement, and the status of U.S. forces in Spain. Discussions focused on the significance of the agreement being titled the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Only one similar agreement is currently in force. The Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure is the only agreement currently in force at the time of U.S. accession to the TAC. The distinction between \"treaty\" in international law and domestic American law is important to note. The use of the word \"treaty\" in the TAC's title does not necessarily mean it must take the form of a \"treaty\" for U.S. law purposes. The United States did not participate in drafting the TAC and did not decide to entitle it a \"treaty.\" After the U.S. acceded to the TAC through an executive agreement, Senator Mitch McConnell submitted a letter expressing support for the U.S. accession. The Senators believe that while the TAC could be entered as an executive agreement, agreements labeled as \"treaties\" should be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. They noted that the agreement's title refers to it as a \"treaty\" and expressed concern about acceding to such agreements without Senate approval as per the Constitution. The Senators believe that while the TAC could be entered as an executive agreement, agreements labeled as \"treaties\" should be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. They noted that the agreement's title refers to it as a \"treaty\" and expressed concern about acceding to such agreements without Senate approval as per the Constitution. The agreement is largely limited to general pledges of diplomatic cooperation and would not obligate the United States to take specific actions. The United States did not participate in the negotiations leading to the TAC in 1976, and in light of these unique considerations, the Department's plan to accede to the TAC as an executive agreement is not objected to. However, the use of the term \"treaty\" in the title generally requires Senate advice and consent for the United States to accede. The Senators believe that the TAC could be entered as an executive agreement, but agreements labeled as \"treaties\" should be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. They expressed concern about acceding to agreements labeled as \"treaties\" without Senate approval as per the Constitution. Congress has tools available to address concerns about the Executive's implementation of TAC requirements, such as enacting new legislation, requiring information submission, or limiting appropriations. The TAC may impose obligations on parties as international law, but its requirements may not create binding federal law enforceable by U.S. courts. Many clauses are non-specific and lack precision for legal enforceability, focusing on promoting cooperation and ties between parties. While the agreement sets guidelines for relations, it does not explicitly mandate changes to existing laws. The TAC does not require parties to change their domestic laws but calls for diplomatic resolution of disputes. U.S. accession to TAC would not impact existing laws but may affect policies. Some States negotiated side letters addressing specific issues, with a focus on renouncing the threat or use of force. The TAC emphasizes the renunciation of the threat or use of force in the relationship between parties, similar to the U.N. Charter. While the TAC does not explicitly mention self-defense, it is believed to not restrict this right. The agreement lists guiding principles but does not limit other principles that may guide State parties' relations. Article 51 of the U.N. Charter recognizes the inherent right of self-defense for Members in case of an armed attack. The TAC does not explicitly address self-defense but is believed not to restrict this right. Some States have exchanged side letters to clarify that the TAC does not modify parties' rights under the U.N. Charter, including the right to self-defense. This raises considerations regarding the TAC's impact on U.S. security arrangements. The TAC does not explicitly address self-defense but is believed not to restrict this right. Some TAC parties with security arrangements with the United States acceded to the TAC after reaching an understanding that it would not affect other agreements. The United States exchanged side letters reflecting its understanding that the TAC would not affect its existing relationships or its ability to address threats to its national interests. The TAC might also have implications for U.S. policy in the territory of another party. The TAC parties' obligations concerning non-interference in each other's internal affairs may be broadly interpreted, potentially affecting activities like criticism of human rights records or imposing sanctions. This could pose a concern for the United States. The TAC parties' obligations on non-interference may conflict with the US sanctions regime against Burma, a member of ASEAN. Some parties have imposed sanctions to deter human rights violations in other party territories. US sanctions policy may lead to contention with TAC members. Parties to the TAC are also parties to international agreements that obligate or permit members to take action to deter specified activities arising in other countries, including matters involving unfair trade practices, transnational criminal activity, international terrorism, and gross human rights violations. All TAC parties are members of the United Nations and may be required to comply with Security Council resolutions imposing economic sanctions on a particular country. The U.N. Charter emphasizes promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction. The TAC parties are urged to adhere to principles in their relations with other States. Some States exchanging side letters with ASEAN Members clarify that the TAC does not hinder rights under other international agreements. The TAC was initially for Southeast Asian countries but now includes non-Southeast Asian States. Several non-Southeast Asian States have joined the TAC. The TAC was initially for Southeast Asian countries but now includes non-Southeast Asian States. Some States outside Southeast Asia exchanged side letters to clarify the agreement's scope, limiting their participation in the High Council to instances where they are directly involved in the dispute. Southeast Asian States can participate in all High Council meetings regardless of their involvement in the dispute. Australia and the United States exchanged side letters with ASEAN members to clarify their rights under the TAC. The letters stated that a State outside Southeast Asia must consent to the High Council resolving a dispute in which they are directly involved. If the State agrees, they can participate in the Council. The United States did not include a similar clarification in its side letter with the ASEAN Chairman. Australia has decided to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South East Asia (the Treaty), strengthening its friendship and ties with ASEAN Member countries. This decision was made after extensive discussions between Australian officials and ASEAN counterparts. Australia's decision to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South East Asia is based on key understandings that it will not affect existing obligations under other agreements, will be interpreted in line with the UN Charter, and will not impact relationships with states outside South-East Asia. Additionally, the Treaty requires the agreement of non-South-East Asian states involved in a dispute before the High Council can be convened. The Australian Government will lodge a formal instrument of accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia after completing domestic treaty processes. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Downer expressed gratitude for assistance and looks forward to a reply from the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Australia will formally accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, strengthening cooperation with ASEAN in promoting peace and security in the region. The Deputy Prime Minister looks forward to receiving Australia's formal instrument of accession."
