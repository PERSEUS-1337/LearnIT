    "content": "The Senate and House Armed Services Committees report their versions of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) annually, containing provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the two versions are resolved by a Conference Committee. Congressional staff receive many requests for information on NDAA provisions. This report focuses on personnel-related issues generating intense congressional and constituent interest in the FY2010 House and Senate versions of the NDAA. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 was introduced in the House as H.R. 2647 and in the Senate as S. 1390. The Senate replaced the House text with the amended S. 1390 and passed it by unanimous consent. A conference report was filed and passed by both the House and Senate, becoming law on October 28, 2009 as P.L. 111-84. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (P.L. 110-181) authorized the Army to grow by 65,000 and the Marine Corps by 27,000 by FY2012. Successful recruiting efforts, aided by a downturn in the U.S. economy, enabled the Army and Marine Corps to achieve their respective end strengths. The Army and Marine Corps achieved new end strength targets earlier than projected, with high deployment rates despite stable operations in Iraq and increased deployments to Afghanistan in 2009. There are recommendations for further increases in end strength, especially for the Army, due to concerns about dwell time between deployments and the end of the Army's Stop Loss program in January 2010. Both 2010 national defense authorization bills provide the same increases to baseline end strength and allow temporary increases of 30,000 for the Army. The Army and Marine Corps met end strength targets early, with high deployment rates despite stable operations in Iraq and increased deployments to Afghanistan in 2009. Recommendations for further increases in end strength, especially for the Army, were made due to concerns about dwell time between deployments and the end of the Army's Stop Loss program in January 2010. Both 2010 national defense authorization bills provide the same increases to baseline end strength and allow temporary increases of 30,000 for the Army. The Administration proposed an additional Army active duty end strength increase of 15,000, approved by the Conference Committee, raising costs for salaries and expenses. The ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to a focus on the military pay raise. Title 37 U.S.C. 1009 provides a formula for an annual military pay raise tied to the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The FY2010 President's Budget requested a 2.9% raise, but Congress has often approved raises above the formula, such as ECI plus 0.5%. The proposed legislation for FY2010 includes a military pay raise larger than the permanent formula, costing an estimated $350 million in FY2010 and $2.3 billion over FY2010-FY2014. No mention of targeted pay raises is included in this year's proposal. Concurrent receipt legislation allows some military retirees to receive both military retirement benefits and disability compensation from the VA. Eligibility criteria include being a military retiree and eligible for VA disability compensation. There are two components: Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) for combat disabilities and Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments (CRDP) for service-connected disabilities. Retirees cannot receive both CRSC and CRDP. Currently, disabled retirees with combat-related disabilities rated at 10% or greater are eligible for CRSC. However, Chapter 61 retirees and longevity retirees with certain service-connected disabilities are not eligible for CRSC. Legislation has been proposed to expand concurrent receipt similar to H.R. 2647, with H.R. 2990 passing the House in 2009. The House version of the proposed expansion of concurrent receipt, known as H.R. 2990, was added to H.R. 2647 as Division D. It would have been effective on January 1, 2010, but was only funded for the first year. Many supporters expressed concerns about its scope and implementation. The background information prior to the enactment of P.L. 111-84 is detailed in the CRS Report R40589. The per diem rate for inpatient care increased to $645 a day for retirees under 65 and their family members, or 25% of total hospital charges. The freeze on inpatient copayment increases was extended until September 30, 2010, preventing a $110 per day increase. DOD did not implement the increase before the enactment of P.L. 111-84. Active duty military personnel and reservists can retire after 20 years of service. A provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 allows certain reservists to receive retired pay at age 50, reducing the age for access to retiree health benefits to 60. Specified duty includes various types of active duty. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 allows certain reservists to receive retired pay at age 50 for specified duty performed after September 11, 2001, expanding eligibility for retiree benefits. The Senate provision to increase the number of reservists eligible for retired pay before age 60 was not included in the final bill, pending budgetary offsets. Critics argue that the military has not effectively enforced regulations against extremist activities, leading to the infiltration of violent extremists, including white supremacists, into the armed forces. Defense officials maintain that racist or extremist behaviors are not tolerated in the military. The House provision aimed to prohibit recruitment, enlistment, or retention of individuals associated with hate groups in the military. Evidence of hate group association included tattoos, meeting attendance, online activity, and written material. Exemptions were made for those who had renounced previous affiliations with hate groups. No exemption was given for new recruits, potentially impacting recruiting in certain neighborhoods. The final bill does not include the House provision to prohibit recruitment of individuals associated with hate groups in the military. Section 716 requires a report on military personnel's participation in supremacist organizations and policies to prevent such enlistment. Since 9/11, the US has activated reservists for service in various locations, prompting actions to ease their transition. In 2003, Congress provided reservists with early access to Tricare Prime for up to 180 days prior to the projected date of activation if they had received \"delayed-effective-date active-duty orders.\" This provision extends the period of early Tricare access and provides such access upon \"official notification\" that orders are forthcoming. The expanded authority for early access to Tricare Prime for reservists is defined as a memorandum notifying them of delayed-effective-date active-duty orders. The Congressional Budget Office estimated this will cost $92 million in FY2010 and $347 million over FY2010-FY2014. VA researchers found a rapid increase in new mental health diagnoses among OEF/OIF veterans using VA health care post-Iraq invasion. Among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, 36.9% received mental health diagnoses, with 21.8% diagnosed with PTSD and 17.4% with depression. Rates of PTSD increased significantly after the Iraq invasion, especially among younger active duty veterans. Congressional concern has focused on addressing these mental health needs, with estimates suggesting an additional 150,000 mental health assessments annually due to Senate Section 711, costing $45 million over FY2010-FY2014. House Section 709 does not have a cost estimate available. House Section 709 does not have a cost estimate available. 10 U.S.C. 1086(d) states that Tricare beneficiaries must be enrolled in Medicare Part B. Retroactive Medicare eligibility determinations lead to claims being reprocessed by DOD and Medicare. About 1,500 retroactive Medicare determinations are made for Tricare beneficiaries annually. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Section 703 would require an additional $4 million per year for Tricare beneficiaries. Currently, reserve component members who have completed 20 years of service but are not yet 60 years old are not eligible for Tricare benefits. This provision will extend eligibility for these \"grey-area\" retirees. The provision extends Tricare Standard eligibility to Retired Reserve members qualified for non-regular retirement but not yet 60, and their dependents. They would pay a premium determined by the Secretary of Defense. The Congressional Budget Office estimated minimal long-term costs, with DOD incurring $15 million in start-up costs over FY2010-FY2011. Chiropractic care program established under the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 focuses on spinal adjustments to correct alignment issues and support the body's natural healing ability. Research on chiropractic treatment is ongoing. The Chiropractic Care Program for active duty service members is available at designated military treatment facilities. Family members, retirees, and others are not eligible for chiropractic care and may seek non-chiropractic health care services within the military health system or in the local community at their own expense. Additional research on chiropractic treatment outcomes is being considered. The provision aims to expand survivor eligibility for dental benefits under the Tricare program, aligning it with other survivor eligibility standards. This change would allow about 7,000 additional survivors to receive dental benefits annually. 7,000 additional survivors will receive dental benefits through the Tricare program each year, costing the DOD $2 million annually. Previous budgeting for savings by converting military medical positions to civilian positions had adverse effects on the military health system. The Department of Defense budgeted for restorations of unfilled military positions in its 2010 appropriations request. The House-passed bill extended a prohibition on conversions of military medical and dental positions to civilian positions until September 30, 2012. The Bush Administration opposed these prohibitions, citing concerns about flexibility and adverse impacts on the military services. Previous DOD budgets had recognized annual savings of over $200 million from conversions. The Department of Defense budgeted for restorations of unfilled military positions in its 2010 appropriations request, especially in the Army. Congress enacted provisions for cooperative health care arrangements between military installations and non-military health care systems. Pilot programs were conducted to test initiatives building cooperative health care agreements. The pilot program for cooperative health care arrangements between military installations and non-military health care systems was extended through 2010. An interim report was submitted to Congress in 2007, detailing pilot projects at Fort Drum, NY, and Yuma, AZ. This initiative aims to improve access to care for Tricare beneficiaries and leverage Federal health care resources in underserved areas. Unlike previous provisions, this program is not time-limited. The enacted provision under Section 713 is not time-limited and does not authorize health care services at military medical treatment facilities for those who are not eligible. It requires the Secretary of Defense to report on any agreements formed. This provision also mandates a Comptroller General report on the capacity of each military service to investigate and adjudicate allegations of sexual assault by October 28, 2010. The Secretary of Defense is required to evaluate the availability of sexual assault forensic examinations in combat zones and provide statistical information on military protective orders related to sexual assault. The U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report on progress in reducing domestic violence, with DOD agreeing to some recommendations. Congress has shown interest in issues affecting military families. The review and assessment of recommendations concerning domestic violence for military families is of interest to Congress and the DOD. Congress tasked GAO with reporting on this issue, and the conference report will require DOD to produce a report. Military spouses face challenges in obtaining employment due to frequent moves, with some employers possibly discriminating against them. This provision authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into agreements related to this issue. The provision authorizes the Secretary of Defense to reimburse federal agencies for costs associated with the first year of employment of eligible military spouses participating in internship programs. Spouses legally separated, on active duty, or retired from the military are not eligible. This initiative aims to support military personnel in enhancing their cultural knowledge and foreign language proficiency for operations in foreign countries. The final bill allows the Secretary of Defense to establish language training centers for military personnel and DOD civilians to enhance their language proficiency. The centers must offer programs for individuals with beginning through advanced skills in critical languages and area studies. The final bill authorizes the establishment of language training centers for military personnel and DOD civilians to improve language proficiency in critical and strategic languages. Programs include alternative delivery systems, incorporation into ROTC programs, expanding instructor pool, and encouraging native speakers to serve in the Department of Defense. Reporting requirements are specified if language training centers are established. A Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP)-eligible spouse eligible for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) will have SBP annuity reduced by DIC. Congress created survivor indemnity allowance for certain beneficiaries, increasing annually until FY2013. Senate language would allow surviving spouses to receive both SBP and DIC benefits. The FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act established a Supplemental Subsistence Allowance for Low-Income Members with Dependents, providing up to $500 a month to military families in lieu of SNAP benefits. The increased allowance recognizes rising subsistence costs for military families. The Army created the Combat Infantryman Badge (CID) and the Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB) in World War II to honor infantrymen who \"saw the face of battle.\" These awards were later made retroactive to December 6, 1941. In 2005, the Combat Action Badge was approved for members who engaged the enemy, retroactive to September 18, 2001. The House bill proposed retroactive award of the Combat Action Badge. Section 707 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 prohibited employers from offering incentives to use Tricare over employer's health plan to prevent cost shifting. The provision in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 impacted Tricare supplemental insurance offered by employers. The Department of Defense proposed rules regarding employer-provided Tricare supplemental insurance, requiring employers to certify they did not provide any payment for the insurance. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 affected Tricare supplemental insurance provided by employers. Employers offering this benefit must certify and maintain the certification while offering the plan. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report on the relationship between Tricare and employer-sponsored group health plans by March 31, 2010. In February 2009, the Department of Defense reported to Congress on mental health provider staffing. The report aims to assess the current shortage of mental health providers in the military, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to increase the number of mental health personnel and submit a report to Congress by October 28, 2010. Additionally, a plan to boost military and civilian mental health personnel by September 30, 2013, must be developed and implemented. P.L. 111-84 adopted a provision to expand suicide prevention efforts within the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program for IRR members who may lack access to mental health care. The Reintegration Program provides community healing and suicide prevention services for National Guard and Reserve members. Section 708 of P.L. 111-84 mandates pre- and post-deployment mental health assessments for service members. Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the cost of the Defense Health Program and declining satisfaction with Tricare. The lack of availability of Tricare providers and cumbersome requirements for preauthorization and referral to specialty care are causing operational problems for beneficiaries. The goal of maximizing use of military hospitals and clinics is not being achieved, as more care is being purchased in the private sector. Access issues for National Guard and other military families are compounding difficulties during deployment. The Secretary of Defense is required to report on health care needs and improve the Tricare program. The Secretary of Defense is required to report on health care needs and improve the Tricare program, including addressing access issues for National Guard and reserve members and their families. Reports on progress and future plans for the military health system are also mandated, along with budget materials submitted to Congress in support of the DOD budget for FY2012."
