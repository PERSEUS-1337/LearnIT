    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1026 of the Penal Code in California is amended. Section 1026 of the Penal Code in California is amended regarding the trial process for defendants pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. The defendant is first tried on other pleas, with a conclusive presumption of sanity. If found guilty or pleading only insanity, a separate trial determines sanity at the time of the offense. Verdicts of sanity lead to sentencing as per law. If the defendant is found to be insane at the time of the offense, the court will commit them to a state hospital or other approved treatment facility for care. Alternatively, the defendant may be placed on outpatient status as per Title 15 of the Penal Code. Prior to ordering the defendant's commitment to a state hospital or outpatient status, the court requires an evaluation by the community program director or a designee. If the defendant's sanity is fully recovered, they will be held in sheriff's custody until sanity is determined by law. The release of a defendant committed to a state hospital or outpatient status is determined by the court after a hearing to assess the person's sanity. Transfer to another state hospital or out-of-state hospital is allowed under certain conditions. If the defendant is committed or transferred to the State Department of State Hospitals, the court may order transfer to a public or private treatment facility approved by the community program director. The court may also order transfer back to the State Department of State Hospitals or another approved facility upon recommendation. Contesting transfer orders can be done by filing a petition for a hearing. A petition may be filed in court for a hearing on the order of transfer, where evidence can be presented by the prosecuting attorney or defendant. The court will follow the same procedures and standards of proof as in probation revocation hearings. Prior to transferring a defendant, the court must notify the defendant, their attorney, the prosecuting attorney, and the community program director. If the court orders commitment to a treatment facility, they must provide documents including the commitment order and the maximum term of commitment. The court must provide various documents including credit for time served, criminal history, arrest reports, psychiatric evaluations, placement recommendations, and medical records. If the defendant is in a treatment facility, the medical director must submit progress reports every six months to the court and community program director. A person committed to the care of the State Department of State Hospitals due to incompetence for trial may be eligible for compassionate release. The department will follow procedures outlined in the Welfare and Institutions Code to determine if release is recommended. A mentally disordered offender under the care of the State Department of State Hospitals may be eligible for compassionate release as per Section 4146 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The department will assess eligibility and recommend release following specified procedures. This also applies to those committed for treatment during parole or pursuant to Section 2970, with notice given to the Board of Parole Hearings if the individual is on parole. Section 4146 of the Welfare and Institutions Code applies to mentally disordered offenders committed to the department, including those found not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial. A physician employed by the department notifies the medical director and patient advocate of a patient meeting specific criteria. The medical director, upon agreement, informs the Director of State Hospitals. Within 72 hours, the patient is informed of discharge procedures and asked for consent. The patient can designate a family member or agent to be notified of their condition and release procedures. If unable to designate, emergency contacts are reached out to. The medical director or their designee will contact emergency contacts or the patient advocate if no contact is listed. The medical director or their designee will provide updated information to the patient and their family throughout the release process, including the patient's medical condition and discharge plan. The patient must have a verified placement upon release. The patient or their family can request a recommendation for compassionate release from the medical director or the Director of State Hospitals. The Director of State Hospitals may recommend compassionate release for a terminally ill patient, with court discretion based on specific criteria. The patient must be permanently medically incapacitated, requiring 24-hour care, and certified by the medical director and Director of State Hospitals. The court must hold a hearing within 10 days of a release recommendation by the director. A recommendation for compassionate release must include a medical evaluation, discharge and postrelease plans, and physician's determination of meeting specific criteria. Medical records must be sent to the district attorney, public defender, or patient's attorney. If the patient is a mentally disordered offender on parole, the public defender or private attorney will represent them. The Board of Parole Hearings will handle cases of mentally disordered offenders on parole. For patients on mandatory supervision or postrelease community supervision found incompetent, the designated county entity will supervise them. The hearing will be held before the original committing judge if possible, or by the court that committed the patient to state prison for the underlying conviction. Upon court approval for compassionate release, the patient's commitment is suspended, and they must be released within 72 hours. The executive director ensures the patient has a discharge plan, medical summary, records, identification, medications, and belongings upon release. Additional records are sent to the patient's forwarding address post-discharge. After discharge, any additional records are sent to the patient's forwarding address. The Director of State Hospitals may adopt regulations for implementation, exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act. Patients with suspended commitments for compassionate release are not under the custody of the State Department of State Hospitals. If a patient's commitment order is suspended, it can be reinstated by the court based on a finding by the State Department of State Hospitals that the patient poses a threat to public safety or no longer meets compassionate release criteria. The Department will establish a process, in consultation with stakeholders, for petitioning the court for reinstatement of a suspended commitment order."
