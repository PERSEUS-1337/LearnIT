    "content": "The \"Waterways Are Vital for the Economy, Energy, Efficiency, and Environment Act of 2012\" or the \"WAVE4 Act\" recognizes the importance of the inland waterways navigation system for the nation's economy, energy reliability, efficiency in transportation of bulk commodities, and environmental protection. The purposes of the Act are to improve program and project management for navigation projects on inland waterways, optimize system reliability, minimize project completion schedules, eliminate delays, and prioritize investments for maximum benefits and reduced risk. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"qualifying project\" refers to construction or major rehabilitation projects for navigation infrastructure of inland and intracoastal waterways funded at least partially from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. A \"major rehabilitation project\" involves restoring a major project or feature with a cost exceeding $100,000,000. The Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, must mandate formal project management training and certification for project managers of qualifying projects. Personnel fully certified by the Chief of Engineers must be assigned as project managers for qualifying projects. Cost estimation for qualifying projects must be risk-based with a confidence level of at least 80 percent. Independent external peer review is required for qualifying projects with estimated total costs exceeding $45,000,000 and subject to public safety concerns. The Chief of Engineers determines projects subject to public safety concerns, high complexity, or interagency interest. Governor-requested reviews are also included. Inland Waterways Users Board members may be appointed to project teams. Quarterly updates on project status are communicated to the Board. The Board is updated on the status of qualifying projects under construction. The Chairman of the Inland Waterways Users Board and project development team appointee are signatories of the project management plan. Lessons learned from prior projects are applied to improve project completion. Evaluation of early contractor involvement procedures is conducted to enhance project delivery performance. Additional measures may be implemented as deemed necessary by the Secretary. The Secretary may implement practices from military construction management, establish design centers, use standard lock designs, consider full-funding contracts, and recommend new projects using a capital projects business model. SEC. 6 outlines a 20-year capital investment program. The Secretary of the Army, in collaboration with the Inland Waterways Users Board, must submit a 20-year program for capital investments on inland waterways to Congress. This program will be based on national project-selection criteria and may utilize the Inland Marine Transportation System Capital Projects Business Model. Additionally, an annual review and update of the program will be conducted. The Secretary of the Army, with the Inland Waterways Users Board, must update a 20-year program for inland waterways to Congress. Every 5 years, a strategic review of the capital investment program will be submitted for revisions as needed. SEC. 7. COST SHARING FOR QUALIFYING PROJECTS. One-half of the construction cost of a qualifying project will be paid from the general fund of the Treasury, and the other half from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. For dams, the cost will be covered only by the general fund of the Treasury. SEC. 8. LIMITATION ON EXPENDITURES FROM THE INLAND WATERWAYS TRUST FUND. Section 9506 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to limit expenditures from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Expenditures for construction or rehabilitation of dams or any rehabilitation expenditure below $100,000,000 are not allowed. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund can only be used for authorized Federal projects up to the specified total cost, adjusted for inflation, and any additional amount agreed upon by the Secretary and the Inland Waterways Users Board. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund financing rate is amended to 26 cents per gallon after 2012."
