These obligations have not yet been enforced. The obligations outlined in Executive Order 13673 have not yet been applied to contractors and subcontractors. The order was effective immediately upon issuance on July 31, 2014, with implementing guidance still in development. The White House anticipates implementing the order's requirements for new contracts in stages, starting in 2016. One key aspect is the disclosure requirements for contractors and subcontractors bidding on contracts over $500,000, certifying any violations of federal or state labor laws within the past three years. Agency contracting officers must affirmatively determine that a contractor is \"responsible\" by considering labor law violations before awarding a contract. Executive Order 13673 requires contractors to certify labor violations and disclose subcontractor violations for contracts over $500,000. This process will be implemented in stages starting in 2016. After contract award, contractors and subcontractors must provide updated information on new labor violations at six-month intervals. These disclosures could result in remedial actions, compliance assistance, or contract termination. Executive Order 13673 mandates that contractors must provide employees with documentation of hours worked, pay, and deductions in each pay period for contracts subject to disclosure requirements. This requirement applies to contractors maintaining wage records under specific labor laws. Compliance with state or local laws can fulfill this documentation obligation. The Executive Order 13673 prohibits mandatory arbitration of claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and any torts arising from sexual assault or harassment for government contracts and subcontracts over $1 million. Exceptions include contracts for commercially available off-the-shelf items, employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, and those who entered mandatory arbitration agreements before. Compliance with state or local laws can fulfill documentation obligations for hours worked, pay, and deductions. Executive Order 13673 prohibits mandatory arbitration for government contracts over $1 million, except for certain exceptions. Covered contractors must disclose violations of 14 federal labor laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act). FLSA sets standards for minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor, enforced by the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. OSH Act ensures workplace safety and health. Violations can lead to back wages recovery, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) requires employers to provide safe workplaces and comply with OSHA's safety standards. OSHA enforces the act through inspections and citations. The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) protects agricultural workers from exploitation by employers and contractors. The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) provides protections for agricultural workers, including timely payment of wages, itemized earnings statements, and safe housing. The act is enforced by the WHD through investigations, penalties, and legal actions. The MSPA also allows for private legal action for violations, with criminal penalties for willful violations. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) grants private sector employees the right to unionize and engage in collective bargaining, enforced by the National Labor Relations Board. The Davis-Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act require contractors with the federal government to pay prevailing wages and benefits. Enforcement can include investigations, withholding payments, or contract termination. The Davis-Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act enforce prevailing wages and benefits for federal contractors. Executive Order 11246 prohibits discrimination in employment decisions, while Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act requires affirmative action for qualified minority and women workers. Enforcement is carried out by various agencies through compliance reviews and investigations. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 require contractors to take affirmative action for individuals with disabilities and veterans, respectively. The Family Medical Leave Act provides eligible employees with 12 weeks of leave. OFCCP enforces these acts through various means. The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows eligible employees to take 12 workweeks of unpaid leave for family and medical reasons with job protection. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces Title VII, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in various activities. Four agencies enforce the ADA, including the EEOC for employment, the Department of Transportation for transit, the FCC for telecommunication services, and the Department of Justice for public accommodations and government services. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) prohibits age discrimination in employment for individuals over 40 years old. The Executive Order 13658 establishes a minimum wage of $10.10 per hour for employees working under service or construction contracts. The WHD enforces this order, along with Executive Order 13673 which requires covered contractors to disclose violations of state laws equivalent to federal laws. The order does not specify these state laws, but OSHA-approved state health and safety plans are considered equivalent. The Executive Order 13673 establishes a new senior position within agencies called the labor compliance advisor (LCA) to assist with compliance of labor laws for contractors. LCAs will guide agency contracting officers on proper actions after labor law violations and consult with contractors on compliance and subcontractor violations. The labor compliance advisor (LCA) will assist agency contracting officers in handling subcontractor labor violations by advising on appropriate actions, such as remedial measures or compliance assistance, based on disclosed violations of labor laws by contractors. The labor compliance advisor (LCA) will assist agency contracting officers in handling subcontractor labor violations by advising on appropriate actions, such as remedial measures or compliance assistance, based on disclosed violations of labor laws by contractors. LCAs can coordinate assistance between contractors seeking help in addressing and preventing violations of labor laws and relevant enforcement agencies, as well as assist contractors in handling subcontractor disclosures of labor violations. The Executive Order 13673 addresses agencies' authority to consider labor law violations in the procurement process, factors considered in assessing vendors' integrity, direct impact on source selection, prequalification of vendors, potential debarment for disclosing violations, and changes to the COC process. The Executive Order 13673 requires contractors to disclose compliance with federal labor laws for consideration in responsibility determinations, impacting the COC process for small businesses. Agencies had the authority to consider labor law violations before the order but were not required to do so. Prior to Executive Order 13673, agencies had discretion to consider labor law violations while making contractor responsibility determinations during the procurement process. This was generally within agency officials' discretion and not required, as it is under the order. The types of violations considered were more limited before the order compared to those to be considered under the order. Vendors must be affirmatively responsible to be awarded a contract, with responsibility determined by various factors including facilities, personnel, experience, financial resources, and integrity. Labor law violations are often considered in assessing integrity and business ethics standards for contractors. In 2008, Congress established the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) to aid contracting officers in making responsibility determinations by providing information on convictions and findings of fault involving federal contractors or grantees. FAPIIS was created to provide information on convictions and findings of fault involving federal contractors or grantees with awards over $10 million in the past five years. However, FAPIIS has limited information compared to Executive Order 13673, which requires disclosure of labor law violations not limited to federal contracts or grants. Prior to Executive Order 13673, agencies could have considered labor law violations in vendor selection through agency specifications and evaluation factors. Specifications outline technical requirements and evaluation factors determine the \"best value\" proposal in negotiated procurement. In the past, agencies had the ability to factor in labor law violations when selecting vendors through specifications and evaluation factors. However, legal requirements such as the Competition in Contracting Act limited the consideration of these violations in the selection process. CICA requires that evaluation factors developed by procuring agencies represent key areas of importance for source selection decisions. Agencies can consider labor law violations in the procurement process if related to their specific needs, not to prefer one vendor over another. Certain violations could also lead to contractor exclusion under FAR regulations. Debarment or suspension from government contracting can occur for serious violations that affect the contractor's responsibility. Certain labor law violations could lead to exclusion from contracts, as mandated by various federal laws. Agency officials have discretion in exclusion proceedings and determining vendor debarment or suspension. \"Integrity\" in responsibility determination is interpreted as moral soundness and freedom from corrupt practices. Lack of integrity often involves criminal offenses by contractors or employees. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) denied protests of nonresponsibility determinations based on lack of integrity due to criminal convictions of contractor employees and officers. Nonresponsibility determinations have also been made based on violations of criminal statutes or criminal investigation reports suggesting wrongdoing. Non-criminal-related grounds for nonresponsibility determinations seem to be less common. Executive Order 13673 is relevant in these cases. Executive Order 13673 and its proposed implementing guidance do not directly factor contractors' labor violations into the source selection process. Prospective vendors must disclose any labor law violations within the past three years as part of their bid. Failure to disclose would make them ineligible for an award. The contracting officer reviews bids or offers to determine the lowest priced or \"best value\" option. They assess the responsibility of vendors in line for the award, especially those implicated in labor violations, by requesting information on the laws violated. Vendors can submit additional information to establish their responsibility, which the contracting officer considers before making a decision. If a vendor is deemed nonresponsible, the contracting officer moves on to the next option. The contracting officer does not consider vendors' compliance with labor laws when determining the lowest priced bid or best value offer. Some suggest using this information, but the Obama Administration has not adopted this approach under Executive Order 13673. The Obama Administration's Executive Order 13673 does not involve prequalifying vendors based on labor law violations. Some states, like Connecticut, use prequalification processes that consider contractors' violations before awarding contracts. The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 limits agencies' use of qualification requirements for state contracts, particularly when there is no statutory authority for prequalification. Agencies must justify and specify all requirements before enforcing any qualification requirement. The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 restricts agencies from using qualification requirements for state contracts without statutory authority. Contractors disclosing labor law violations under Executive Order 13673 may face debarment or suspension, but not necessarily exclusion. Debarment is a government contracting exclusion for a set period, while suspension is temporary pending investigation or legal proceedings. Executive Order 13673 allows agency contracting officers and labor compliance advisors to refer disclosed matters to suspending and debarring officials for consideration. The decision to make a referral is at the discretion of the officers and advisors. If a referral is made, officials will assess if the disclosed information warrants exclusion under the FAR based on various grounds. These grounds include issues that could impact the contractor's present responsibility. The FAR provides procedural requirements for contractors facing debarment or suspension, ensuring notice and a hearing before any exclusion. Multiple determinations of nonresponsibility could lead to exclusion to avoid de facto debarment allegations. These measures protect contractors' due process rights in the exclusion process. The proposed materials implementing Executive Order 13673 suggest a preference for labor compliance agreements over exclusion for contractors with disclosed violations. The responsibility determination process for small businesses differs from standard cases. Section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act of 1958 gives the Small Business Administration (SBA) the authority to determine the responsibility of small businesses, not the contracting officers. If a small business is deemed nonresponsible, the case is referred to the SBA for investigation. The SBA may issue a Certificate of Competency certifying the firm's responsibility, which the procuring agency must accept. The SBA has the authority to determine the responsibility of small businesses, and the agency must accept the SBA's judgment. The Certificate of Competency process could help mitigate the impact of Executive Order 13673 on small businesses by providing a check on agency contracting officers and protecting small businesses from nonresponsibility determinations. The SBA would likely consider reported violations of labor law when deciding whether to issue a certificate of competency. When issuing Executive Order 13673, President Obama referenced the authority of 40 U.S.C. \u00a7121 and the promotion of \"economy and efficiency\" in federal contracting. This section also addresses challenges to responsibility determinations, contractor representations and disclosures, penalties for false certifications, and potential congressional responses to the executive order. The President has the authority under the FPASA to prescribe policies for federal procurement to ensure economy and efficiency. Previous Presidents have used this authority for requirements in the procurement process. Challenges to these requirements have generally failed if they are deemed to be closely related to economy and efficiency in federal procurement. In federal procurement, the \"nexus test\" is applied to determine if requirements are closely related to economy and efficiency. Courts have taken a broad view, considering factors like price, quality, suitability, and availability of goods or services. Requirements with an attenuated link to economy and efficiency or those specifically prohibited by law may be invalidated. Challenges to labor violation provisions in Executive Order 13673 are unlikely to be successful based on current precedents. The labor violation provisions in Executive Order 13673 aim to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by disclosing contractors' violations. Poor workplace conditions lead to lower productivity, disruptions, and increased turnover, resulting in lower quality products, project delays, and cost overruns for federal agencies. The labor law disclosure requirements aim to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by revealing contractors' violations, which can lead to lower quality products, project delays, and cost overruns for federal agencies. The term de facto debarment refers to exclusion outside of the formal suspension and debarment process, which can be seen as improper. The de facto debarment process can be seen as improper as it violates contractors' rights to due process by depriving them of the opportunity to challenge allegations without notice or a hearing. Notice and a hearing are provided in exclusion proceedings but not in the responsibility determination process, leading to impermissible de facto debarment in cases of repeated nonresponsibility determinations. Some commentators are concerned that Executive Order 13673 may lead to de facto debarment of contractors who disclose labor law violations. The outcome will depend on how the order is implemented by procuring agencies, with potential for impermissible de facto debarment due to standardization of agencies' consideration of labor law violations in the responsibility determination process. Standardization in the responsibility determination process could lead to multiple contracting officers making the same determination based on the same information. However, multiple determinations of nonresponsibility may not be impermissible if based on the most recent information. The order requires consideration of labor law violations over the past three years, and using older information could be viewed as an attempt to exclude a vendor outside the formal process. Agencies could establish practices to pursue exclusion or labor compliance agreements routinely. Practices may include pursuing exclusion or labor compliance agreements to avoid de facto debarment. Concerns may arise about awarding contracts to entities with labor law violations. Contractors found nonresponsible are generally not entitled to notice or a hearing. Small business contractors found nonresponsible must be referred to the SBA. The FAR does not provide provisions for review or appeal of contracting officers' determinations on responsibility. Small business contractors found nonresponsible must be referred to the SBA for certification. Challenges to determinations can be made through bid protests at the procuring agency, GAO, or U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Challenges to determinations of responsibility in bid protests can be difficult due to substantial deference given to contracting officers' determinations. Protests must show the determination lacked a reasonable basis, was arbitrary, or made in bad faith. Review is limited in cases of nonresponsibility determinations. Limitations on jurisdiction and standing may restrict vendors' ability to challenge responsibility determinations in bid protests. Protests must demonstrate that determinations lacked a reasonable basis, were arbitrary, or made in bad faith. Review is generally limited to information available to the contracting officer at the time of determination, with potential exceptions for affirmative determinations of responsibility. Adverse information does not necessarily invalidate affirmative determinations if known to the contracting officer. Protest forums may only hear timely protests, and protesters may need to show that alleged violations of the law are prejudicial. The proposed FAR amendments implementing Executive Order 13673 require contractors to disclose any labor law violations within the three-year period preceding the offer date. If a contractor is in line for an award and has a labor law violation, they must provide information to the contracting officer. These requirements would not be the only representations required. Federal contractors are required to make various representations and disclosures, including labor law violations, inverted domestic corporations, delinquent federal taxes, and criminal offenses. They must also disclose information on human trafficking offenses and personal conflict-of-interest violations. The government has recourse if a contractor falsely represents compliance with labor laws, including violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations. The proposed FAR clause allows the Contracting Officer to terminate the contract if the Offeror knowingly provides false information. Remedies may include liquidated damages, price reductions, reprocurement at the contractor's expense, and performance evaluations. Monetary damages for fraud are also possible under various acts. The Clinton Administration's amendments to the FAR required contracting officers to consider vendors' compliance with legal requirements and make disclosures about legal actions, similar to the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order. The Obama Administration's proposed FAR amendments focus on compliance with specific federal labor and employment laws, in contrast to the broader categories considered by the Clinton Administration. The Clinton Administration required vendors to have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics, including compliance with various laws, while the Obama Administration's amendments implement the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order. The Obama Administration's proposed FAR amendments focus on compliance with specific federal labor and employment laws, including tax laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws. The amendments would address compliance with labor laws primarily in a new Subpart 22.20 of the FAR, with one provision specifying the contracting officer's duty to consider labor violations. Additionally, the Clinton Administration amended FAR provisions regarding the rejection of bids and notifications to vendors of nonresponsibility determinations. The Obama Administration has not proposed changes to notifications of nonresponsibility determinations. The Clinton Administration's amendments were revoked by the George W. Bush Administration. The Department of Agriculture implemented regulations requiring compliance with labor laws in contracts. The contractor, subcontractors, and suppliers must comply with labor laws and report any non-compliance. Congress may respond to Executive Order 13673 by enacting legislation to prevent its implementation. Congress could amend existing procurement statutes to require contractors to disclose violations of labor laws. This would ensure that these requirements are not in conflict with statutory enactments and could prevent their repeal by a subsequent administration. In 2008, Congress extended the \"mandatory disclosure rule\" to include contracts for commercial items or performed overseas, which were previously excluded by executive orders."
