    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Land Asset Inventory Reform Act of 2015\" establishes a cadastre of federal land. The Secretary is required to develop and maintain a cadastre of Federal real property for land management activities. Cost-sharing agreements with States can be made to include non-Federal lands in the cadastre. A report must be submitted to specific committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Senate committees will review the real property inventories and cadastre activities conducted by the Department of the Interior, including expenditures in fiscal year 2014, consolidation plans, and components that will not be included in the multipurpose cadastre authorized by the Act. The Act authorizes the elimination or consolidation of real property inventories into a multipurpose cadastre. It also requires justification for not terminating or consolidating such inventories, use of existing inventories to identify Federal real property, cost-savings from eliminating duplicative inventories, and a plan for implementation with cost estimates. The Act requires a cost estimate and feasibility assessment for using revenue from authorized transactions to offset implementation costs. It also mandates a comprehensive assessment of all cadastres and inventories maintained by Executive agencies, along with recommendations for legislation to enhance cost-savings and efficiency in replacing or consolidating real property inventories. The Secretary shall participate in establishing standards and protocols for geospatial information interoperability related to cadastres, coordinate with the Federal Geographic Data Committee, and comply with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-16 and Executive Order 12906. The Secretary must comply with standards for the cadastre, integrate with the Federal Real Property Profile, collaborate with State and local governments, and use private sector contracts for necessary services. Contracts for these services are considered \"surveying and mapping.\" Contracts for \"surveying and mapping\" services are awarded in accordance with selection procedures in title IX of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and \"cadastre\" is defined as an inventory of Federal Government real property developed through collecting, storing, and disseminating data depicting physical features and boundaries of the earth. This includes surveys, maps, satellite data, and services provided by professionals such as surveyors and cartographers. The term \"real property\" refers to land, buildings, crops, forests, or resources attached to the land or structures permanently attached to the land. It includes a geodetic network, accurate maps, cadastral boundaries, parcel indexing system, and land data files for each parcel. Real property includes land, buildings, crops, forests, or fixtures permanently attached to the land or a structure on it, including any interest, benefit, right, or privilege in such property. The Secretary is required to make the cadastre publicly available online in a searchable format, identify lands suitable for disposal, and prevent disclosure of certain information for national security reasons. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF ACTION. This Act does not create any new rights or benefits. SEC. 6. CERTAIN NEW ACTIONS NOT REQUIRED. This Act does not mandate new surveys, mapping, evaluations for non-Federal management, disposal of Federal land, or appraisals of cultural resources on Federal land."
