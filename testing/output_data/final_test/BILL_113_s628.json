    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Servicemember Mental Health Review Act\". Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are often denied access to disability compensation and face challenges in finding employment due to the label on their discharge papers. The Department of Defense's regulatory compliance has been questioned by the Government Accountability Office. The Department of Defense's regulatory compliance in separating Armed Forces members based on personality or adjustment disorders was as low as 40% between 2001 and 2007. There is a need to expand the authority of the Physical Disability Board of Review to include reviewing separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability, such as personality or adjustment disorders, to ensure wrongly separated veterans can access disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Physical Disability Board of Review will now review military separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. Members entitled to review by Physical Disability Board of Review are described as individuals who were separated from the armed forces between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2014, due to unfitness for duty because of a medical condition with a disability rating of 20 percent disabled or less. Members eligible for review by the Physical Disability Board of Review include those separated from the armed forces between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2014, due to unfitness for duty because of a medical condition with a disability rating of 20 percent disabled or less. Amendments to the section include a review process for separations due to mental conditions not amounting to disability. The Physical Disability Board of Review will review the findings and decisions of the Physical Evaluation Board for covered individuals. The review may also be initiated by the Physical Disability Board of Review itself. Members of the review board must include a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist. The review will consider the findings of the psychologist or psychiatrist. The Physical Disability Board of Review will assess the diagnosis of the mental condition by the Department of Defense psychologist or psychiatrist, the separation authority's decisions, and compliance with separation procedures. The review will be based on records from the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs, as well as any additional evidence provided. Private mental health records submitted by the individual will also be considered. The Physical Disability Board of Review must notify the individual or their representative before conducting a review. After completing the review, the Board will provide a statement of reasons for their decision, and the individual can request reconsideration with new evidence. The Physical Disability Board of Review will correct military records of a covered individual based on their recommendation, unless the Secretary determines a clear error. Any corrections will be effective from the date of separation. The amount of pay for military personnel will be adjusted to account for lump-sum payments. If the Physical Disability Board of Review does not recommend correcting military records, the action taken by the Physical Evaluation Board will be final. Amendments include specifying separations due to medical conditions with low disability ratings. In subsection (e), amendments are made to allow the Physical Disability Board of Review to review findings and decisions of the Physical Evaluation Board for covered individuals with medical conditions and low disability ratings. In subsection (e), amendments allow the Physical Disability Board of Review to review findings and decisions of the Physical Evaluation Board for individuals with medical conditions and low disability ratings. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that separated individuals from the Armed Forces are notified of their right to a review under section 1554a of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary of the military department responsible for providing notification to separated individuals regarding their right to legal counsel before the Physical Disability Board of Review. The Secretary of Defense must oversee compliance with this requirement and report any failures to Congress. Section 1554a of the Physical Disability Board of Review is amended to include separations with disability ratings of 20 percent or less and separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. The table of sections in chapter 79 is updated to reflect this change. Physical Disability Board of Review now includes review of separations with disability rating of 20 percent or less and separations based on mental condition not amounting to disability."
