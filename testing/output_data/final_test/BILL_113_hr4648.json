The \"Renewable Energy Jobs Act\" establishes a pilot program for competitive grants to train individuals in renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. Grants will be awarded to the top five states with the highest alternative energy power capacity, based on wind, solar, and geothermal facilities. States must submit applications with evidence of their installed alternative energy power capacity. The \"Renewable Energy Jobs Act\" establishes a pilot program for competitive grants to train individuals in renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. States must describe how funds will be used for skills training and job creation in these sectors, and have the option to collaborate with workforce boards and industry councils for program implementation. The \"Renewable Energy Jobs Act\" establishes a pilot program for competitive grants to train individuals in renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. States must describe skills training, on-the-job training, and industry-recognized certifications offered by grant recipients. Grants will prioritize support for renewable energy job creation programs. Grants will be of sufficient size for 3 years to enable States to carry out required activities. The State receiving a grant under the \"Renewable Energy Jobs Act\" must use the funds to reimburse employers for on-the-job training, provide skills training through various entities, and conduct outreach to inform eligible parties about the program.

The Secretary is also required to submit a report to Congress. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the pilot program, detailing activities and evaluating the program's success in placing participants in renewable energy jobs. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2015 to 2017 for the program. Definitions include \"Indian tribe\" and \"installed alternative energy power capacity.\" The term \"capacity\" refers to the amount of wind, solar, and geothermal power generation in megawatts installed in a State. The term \"labor organization\" is defined as per the National Labor Relations Act. \"On-the-job training\" is training provided by renewable energy and energy efficiency employers, labor organizations, educational institutions, or nonprofit organizations to paid participants, essential for job performance, with reimbursement to the employer for training costs and supervision. The term \"renewable energy and energy efficiency industries\" includes the energy-efficient building, construction, or retrofits industry. The term \"skills training\" refers to training provided by labor organizations, postsecondary educational institutions, or nonprofit organizations that equip individuals with the necessary knowledge and skills for specific jobs in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. The term \"State\" encompasses various entities such as states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories.
