    "content": "The Act may be referred to as the \"Manufacturing Jobs for Veterans Act\" and includes a Veterans Manufacturing Employment Program. The \"Veterans Manufacturing Employment Program\" is a pilot program under the Veteran's Workforce Investment Program to encourage the employment of eligible veterans in manufacturing. The program provides competitive grants to three States for the establishment of State Manufacturing Employment Programs that offer training, apprenticeships, and certification classes to veterans. States must submit grant applications outlining how funds will be used to be eligible for grants. The proposal aims to use grant funds to establish a public-private partnership program for eligible veterans, providing training, apprenticeships, and certification classes for sustainable employment in manufacturing. States must demonstrate the appropriate veteran population, a strong manufacturing industry, and the capacity to implement the program. Additional information may be required by the Secretary. The grant program aims to provide funding for manufacturing employers and labor-management organizations to offer training, apprenticeships, and certification classes to eligible veterans. States receiving grants must also conduct outreach to inform veterans and employers of their eligibility. Grants are subject to repayment conditions determined by the Secretary. The State must submit reports to the Secretary on the use of grant funds under the pilot program. Manufacturing employers seeking grants must provide details on the pay rates for eligible veterans to the State Manufacturing Employment Program administrator. The pilot program for manufacturing employers requires them to submit reports quarterly with specified information. Funds cannot be used for training non-eligible veterans. The Secretary must report to Congress annually on the program's activities and evaluation. The pilot program allocates 2 percent of funds for administrative costs and reporting. The Secretary determines the maximum amount for administrative costs per grant. Definitions include covered training for veterans. The pilot program allocates funds for covered training for eligible veterans employed by manufacturing employers. Eligible veterans must be enrolled in specific training programs designed for manufacturing skills. Manufacturing employers are defined as businesses employing individuals in manufacturing trades. The pilot program authorizes $10,000,000 annually from 2015 to 2019 for the Secretary to implement. The program is aimed at manufacturing employers in the United States classified in sectors 31, 32, or 33 of the NAICS."
