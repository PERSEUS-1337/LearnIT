The \"Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2012\" mandates covered entities to notify individuals in the US of any security breaches involving personal information in electronic form. This includes informing law enforcement if necessary. The Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2012 requires covered entities to notify individuals if their personal information has been accessed by an unauthorized person, exceeding 10,000 records. Third-party agents must also notify covered entities of any security breaches involving personal information stored or processed on their behalf. The Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2012 mandates covered entities to inform individuals of unauthorized access to their personal information exceeding 10,000 records. Service providers are exempt from being considered third-party agents for breach notification purposes. If a service provider discovers a security breach involving personal information owned by a covered entity using their system, they must notify the initiating covered entity. Covered entities must promptly notify individuals of security breaches involving their personal information. If a service provider detects a breach, they must inform the covered entity who initiated the connection. The notification should be timely and made without unreasonable delay to assess the breach's extent and restore data system integrity. The data breach notification can be delayed for law enforcement or national security reasons. Law enforcement agencies can request a delay if it would impede an investigation, and the delay can be extended if necessary. National security reasons can also justify a delay in notification. If a Federal national security or homeland security agency deems that notifying about a data breach would threaten national security, the notification can be delayed upon their written request for a period they determine necessary. They can also extend the delay if needed. Method and Content of Notification for a security breach include written notification, telephone, or email/electronic means to the individual's postal address in the records of the covered entity. In the event of a security breach, notification should include the date of the breach, description of accessed personal information, and contact information for inquiries. Substitute notification may be provided by a covered entity if direct notification is not feasible due to excessive cost or lack of contact information for the individual. Substitute notification can be provided by a covered entity through various means, such as a notice on their website or through print and broadcast media. Covered entities complying with other federal laws regarding breach notifications are considered compliant with this section. SEC. 4. APPLICATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
