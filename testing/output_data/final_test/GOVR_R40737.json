The Act provided approximately $45.1 billion for the Veterans Health Administration, a 7.4% increase over the previous year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2010 provided $45.1 billion for the Veterans Health Administration, including funding for medical services, facilities, and research. Funding for VHA has seen significant growth between FY1995 and FY2009, with an average annual increase of 6.9%. The Veterans Health Administration received $45.1 billion in funding from the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2010. The increase in funding is attributed to the aging World War II and Korean War veterans, veterans' reliance on VHA's pharmaceutical benefits, and recent veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom accessing VA health care. OEF and OIF patients will represent about 7% of the VA patient population in FY2010, compared to 3% in FY2006. The report is organized into sections covering the VA health care system, veteran patient population, eligibility for VA health care, and the VHA budget for FY2009 and FY2010. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a history dating back to 1930 when it was created as an independent federal agency. In 1988, it became a cabinet-level department. The VA offers various benefits and services to eligible veterans, including healthcare, disability compensation, education, and home loan guarantees. The FY2010 VHA budget is discussed, along with major VA healthcare issues. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides employment services, assistance to homeless veterans, home loan guarantees, life insurance, traumatic injury protection insurance, and death benefits for burial expenses. It operates nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals. The Veterans Health Administration offers health care services and research programs, the Veterans Benefits Administration provides compensations, pensions, and education assistance, and the National Cemetery Administration maintains national veterans cemeteries and provides headstones and markers. The VA's budget includes mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. The VA's budget includes mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. Mandatory funding supports disability compensation, pension benefits, education, vocational rehabilitation, and life insurance. Discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services including medical care. In FY2009, the total VA budget authority was approximately $96 billion, with about 51.2% ($49.2 billion) allocated to discretionary programs, mainly for VA health care programs. The VHA operates the nation's largest integrated direct health care delivery system. The VA health care system is a public system where the federal government owns facilities and employs providers. It is organized into 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) with management authority delegated to them. Funds are allocated based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system, which considers patient workload. Prior to the implementation of the VERA system, resources were allocated to facilities based on historical expenditures. VERA has two types of funds - General Purpose funds (83.5% of VHA total budget) and Specific Purpose funds for activities like prosthetics, mental health, and transplants. Under the VERA system, funds are allocated to VISNs based on unique characteristics and adjusted for veterans receiving care in multiple networks. The largest allocations in FY2009 were to VISNs 8, 16, 22, 7, and 21. Funding is not solely based on patient population but also considers patient mix, high-cost patients, and geographic costs. VHA operates 153 hospitals, 135 nursing homes, and 803 clinics. The VHA operates numerous healthcare facilities including hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient clinics, and counseling centers. It also pays for care provided by private-sector providers and offers services to eligible dependents of veterans. Additionally, VHA conducts medical research and collaborates with the Department of Defense in sharing healthcare resources. The VA's clinical training program is the largest in the US, providing health care training and serving as a backup to the DOD medical system during emergencies. In FY2008, 109,882 health professionals trained at VA facilities, including 34,075 physician residents. VA is the second largest federal payer for health care training after Medicare. The VA's residency program is the largest in the US, with about 31% of US physician residents training there annually. The program includes positions in primary care as well as medical specialties and subspecialties. In 2004, the Advisory Committee on GME reviewed the program and recommended increasing the number of residents in areas with high healthcare needs. The Advisory Committee on GME recommended increasing the number of residents in areas with high healthcare needs, leading to VA's GME enhancement program in 2006. The program aims to increase VA's share of U.S. resident positions to 10-11% by adding approximately 2,000 positions over five years. So far, 967 residency positions have been added to 72 VA facilities in 66 different specialty training programs. In FY2010, the VA treated about 5.4 million unique veteran patients, with an estimated increase to 5.53 million in FY2010. The total number of unique patients, including veterans and non-veterans, is expected to increase from 5.92 million in FY2009 to 6.05 million in FY2010. The VA will treat approximately 419,000 OIF and OEF veterans in FY2010, an increase of 56,000 patients from FY2009. Additionally, over 515,000 non-veterans are estimated to be treated in FY2010, an increase of over 5,900 patients from FY2009. The total number of outpatient visits is projected to increase to approximately 70.9 million in FY2009 and 74.5 million in FY2010. The VHA estimates that in FY2009 it will spend approximately 56.2% of its medical services obligations on outpatient care. Understanding eligibility for VA health care, the VA's enrollment process, and its enrollment priority groups is important as VA health care is not an entitlement program. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established eligibility categories for hospital care and medical services based on priorities. Veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, and those exposed to toxic substances are considered higher priority. Other veterans must meet a means test for access to care. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established eligibility categories for hospital care and medical services based on priorities. Veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, and those exposed to toxic substances are considered higher priority. Another category includes veterans with no service-connected disabilities and incomes above a means test. P.L. 104-262 authorized the VA to establish a patient enrollment system for managing access to VA health care, giving relative degrees of preference to enrolled veterans. Provision of health care to veterans depended on available resources as outlined in the committee report accompanying P.L. 104-262. The committee report accompanying P.L. 104-262 clarifies that hospital care and medical services depend on discretionary appropriations. The act established a national enrollment system for managing medical care delivery, with a new eligibility standard to prioritize medical judgment over legal criteria. Veterans enter the health care system by completing an enrollment application, with exemptions for some based on special eligibility requirements. Veterans can apply for VA health benefits by completing VA Form 10-10EZ at any VA facility. Once enrolled, veterans do not need to reapply annually, except for those in Priority Group 5 who must submit updated financial information yearly. Eligibility is based on veteran's status from military service and an honorable discharge. A veteran's eligibility for VA health care benefits is based on their status in the military and an honorable discharge. Those with \"other than honorable\" or \"bad conduct\" discharges may still be eligible for benefits for service-related disabilities. Specific requirements apply to those enlisting after certain dates, but exceptions exist for servicemembers with service-connected disabilities or reservists and National Guard members called to active duty. Members of the reserve components and National Guard may be exempt from a two-year active duty requirement if called to federal service and meet certain conditions. They have limited eligibility for VA health care services when not on full-time federal service. Service-connection may be granted for injuries incurred during duty, making them eligible for VA care. After establishing veterans' status, the VA categorizes applicants into two groups based on service-connected disabilities or income levels. Priority Groups 1-6 include veterans with service-connected disabilities, compensable conditions, or disabilities incurred in the line of duty. The VA categorizes veterans into different priority groups based on service-connected disabilities, compensable conditions, or disabilities incurred in the line of duty. Veterans who qualify for priority categories include those with compensable disabilities, former POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled veterans, World War I veterans, veterans exposed to hazardous agents, and those with income below a VA-established threshold. The VA considers applicants' income, net worth, and health insurance coverage to determine their priority category and copayment requirements for nonservice-connected care. The VA categorizes veterans into priority groups based on service-connected disabilities or injuries incurred in the line of duty. Veterans with compensable disabilities, former POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled veterans, and those with income below a VA threshold qualify for priority categories. Non-service connected veterans with higher incomes are placed in Priority Group 7 or 8. The National Defense Authorization Act extended VA health care enrollment for combat veterans to five years. The VA extended VA health care enrollment for combat veterans to five years from their most recent date of discharge. New servicemembers discharged from active duty on or after January 28, 2003, could enroll for up to five years after discharge. Veterans who served in combat theaters between November 11, 1998, and January 27, 2003, may apply for extended enrollment until January 27, 2011. OEF and OIF veterans are typically in Priority Group 6 and are not charged copays for combat-related conditions. Enrolled veterans will remain in the system even after the five-year eligibility period ends. Veterans enrolled in Priority Group 6 at the end of the five-year period may be re-enrolled in Priority Group 7 or 8 based on their service-connected disability status and income level. They may need to make copayments for nonservice-connected conditions. National Guard and Reserve personnel called to active duty after November 11, 1998, in a combat theater are also eligible. Once enrolled, veterans receive a standard medical benefits package covering inpatient, outpatient, and preventive services, prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, and more. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides priority care for non-emergency outpatient medical care for service-connected veterans rated 50% or more. Patients with emergency or urgent medical needs must receive care promptly regardless of service-connected status. Veterans with 50% or more service-connected disability must be seen within 30 days, while those with less than 50% disability may require copayments for nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans with less than 50% service-connected disability must be scheduled to be seen within 30 days for a service-connected condition. If there is doubt, assume priority access and schedule within 30 days. For nonservice-connected conditions, they should be seen within 120 days. All outpatient appointment requests must be addressed within seven days. Priority scheduling should not impact previously scheduled veterans. Service-connected veterans must not be affected by priority scheduling. The VHA budget size and character were historically determined by the number of operating beds controlled by Congress. Budget estimates were based on previous year's funding and activity, with workload estimates developed by VHA and unit costs derived from field stations' reports. New program costs, staffing improvements, pay increases, and inflation were added to the budget estimate each year. In 1996, Congress enacted the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1997 (P.L. 104-204), requiring VHA to develop a plan for fair allocation of health care resources. This plan aimed to ensure similar access to medical care for eligible veterans regardless of their location. In response, VHA established the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model in 1998 to comply with the mandate for a priority-based enrollment system. The VHA established the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) in 1998 to develop estimates of future veteran enrollment, utilization of health care services, and associated costs. These projections inform the VHA budget request to Congress, which is formulated based on the EHCPM estimates. The VHA is funded through multiple appropriations accounts and other revenue sources. The VHA's appropriations account structure has changed over the years, with funds traditionally allocated for medical care, research, administration, and facility construction. In FY2004, Congress restructured the VHA's appropriations through four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The VHA's appropriations account structure has evolved over the years, with funds allocated for medical care, research, administration, and facility construction. In FY2004, Congress restructured the VHA's appropriations into four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care for veterans and dependents, including care in non-VA facilities, outpatient care on a fee basis, medical supplies, employee salaries, and aid to state veterans homes. The medical support and compliance account funds administration expenses for hospitals, nursing homes, billing activities, public health programs, quality management, and medical inspection. In FY2008, the VA requested the transfer of food service operations costs from medical facilities appropriations to medical services appropriations, which was approved by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The medical facilities account covers expenses for maintenance, operation, planning, design, construction, and renovation of VHA facilities. It also funds research on veteran-centric health topics and provides funding for VA researchers. The VA's research program is primarily intramural, conducted by VA investigators at VA facilities and approved off-site locations. Funding for research comes from various sources including direct appropriations accounts, medical care cost recovery collections, and billing some veterans and health care insurers for nonservice-connected care. Unlike other federal agencies, the VA does not have the authority to make research grants to non-VA entities. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) gave the VHA authority to retain third-party payments for nonservice-connected care provided to veterans, allowing the funds to be used for medical services without fiscal year limitations. This change in billing from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" was intended to increase VA's third-party collections. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allowed VHA to retain third-party payments for nonservice-connected care, changing billing from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" to increase collections. In FY2004, the Administration consolidated medical collections accounts into MCCF, with funds from various accounts now deposited into MCCF as per the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005. The VA consolidated funds from five accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. The funds collected do not have to be spent in a specific fiscal year and are available until expended. In 2005, a revenue improvement demonstration project was established to restructure the revenue cycle for better collections. The VA established the Revenue Improvement Demonstration Project at the Mid-Atlantic CPAC to improve billing performance and reduce billing times. The GAO estimated that $1.2 to $1.4 billion dollars are going uncollected by VA due to ineffective controls over medical center billings. The Veterans Mental Health and Other Improvements Act of 2008 required the VA to establish no more than seven CPACs modeled after the existing CPAC in Asheville, North Carolina. In Asheville, North Carolina, MCCF collections increased from $1.5 billion in FY2003 to $2.4 billion in FY2008. First-party collections also rose by 35% during this period, reaching $922 million in FY2008. President George W. Bush submitted a budget proposal of $39.2 billion for VHA in FY2009, with a $2 billion increase from FY2008. The total resources, including medical collections, would have provided $41.1 billion for VHA. Additionally, $4.7 billion was requested for the medical facilities account, a $561 million increase from FY2008. The Administration's budget proposal for FY2009 requested $442 million for the medical and prosthetic research account, a 7.9% decrease from FY2008. The House passed the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2009, providing $40.8 billion for VHA, including $500 million for the medical and prosthetic research account. The Senate Appropriations Committee also marked up its version of the FY2009 budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $41.1 billion for VHA for FY2009, a 4.8% increase over the FY2009 request. S. 3301 also provided $5.0 billion for medical facilities and $527 million for the medical and prosthetic research account. H.R. 6599 and S. 3301 were included in the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, signed into law on September 30, 2008 as P.L. 110-329. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of 2009 allocated $40.9 billion for VHA, with $1.0 billion for non-recurring maintenance projects and renewable energy initiatives. President Obama's FY2010 budget proposal requested $45.1 billion for VHA, a 7.4% increase from FY2009. The FY2010 budget proposal requested $45.1 billion for VHA, a 7.4% increase from FY2009. This includes funding for medical services and enrollment expansion for Priority Group 8 veterans. Additionally, $5.1 billion was requested for medical support and compliance, and $4.7 billion for medical facilities, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration plans to use $490 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for non-recurring maintenance and energy projects in FY2009, with $510 million allocated for FY2010. The budget proposal includes $580 million for medical and prosthetic research, but no specific amounts for advance appropriations for veterans medical care in FY2011. The House approved the FY2010 budget resolution on April 2. The House approved H.Con.Res. 85 on April 2, providing $53.3 billion in discretionary budget authority and $53.1 billion in mandatory budget authority for VA programs. Majority of the funding is for VA medical care. The resolution affirmed that VA should not bill private insurance for treatment related to veterans' military service. The Senate also agreed to S.Con.Res. 13 on April 2, which provides $53.2 billion in discretionary budget authority and $53.1 billion in mandatory budget authority for VA programs. The Senate approved S.Con.Res. 13 with $53.2 billion in discretionary budget authority and $53.1 billion in mandatory budget authority for VA programs. Senator James Inhofe's amendment allowed for advance appropriations for VHA accounts without a point of order. The House and Senate agreed on a conference report with $53.4 billion in discretionary budget authority and $53.1 billion in mandatory budget authority for VA programs, exempting certain VA accounts from a point of order against advance appropriations. The House Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies marked-up a draft version of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2010, providing approximately $45.1 billion for the Veterans Health Administration for FY2010. This included allocations for medical services, medical support and compliance, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research accounts. The House Committee approved $580 million for medical and prosthetic research accounts, with minor adjustments to funding levels. The House also provided $48.2 billion in advance appropriations for medical services, an 8.3% increase over the previous year. H.R. 3082 was passed by the House, with amendments transferring funds to VHA's Education Debt Reduction Program. The House Committee approved $580 million for medical and prosthetic research accounts, with minor adjustments to funding levels. Additionally, H.R. 3082 was passed by the House, with amendments transferring funds to VHA's Education Debt Reduction Program. On July 6, 2009, the Senate Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies approved a draft version of its MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of FY2010, providing a total of $45.2 billion for VHA, a $159.3 million increase over the House-passed amount. The Senate passed H.R. 3082 with a total of $45.2 billion for VHA, including $5.1 billion for medical support and compliance account, $4.8 billion for medical facilities, and $580.0 million for medical and prosthetic research account. This amount is higher than the House-passed amount and the President's request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2010, signed into law on December 16, 2009, provided $48.2 billion for medical services, medical support, and compliance, and medical facilities accounts. It included $45.1 billion for VHA without medical care collections, matching the Administration's FY2010 request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2010 allocated additional funding for various programs within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for FY2010. This included $1.0 million for the Education Debt Reduction Program to incentivize hiring mental health professionals and $2.0 million for the Guide and Service Dog Program. The agreement also included advance appropriations to ensure reliable and timely funding for VHA services. Veterans' service organizations have been advocating for sufficient, timely, and predictable budgets for VHA. Veterans' service organizations have advocated for reliable and timely funding for VHA, proposing advance appropriations to address operational challenges. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 1016 and S. 423 were introduced to authorize two-fiscal year budget authority for certain medical care accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The House passed H.R. 1016, and the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee reported S. 423. The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee reported S. 423 on July 8, which passed the Senate on August 6 as a substitute amendment to H.R. 1016. The House agreed to the Senate amendment on October 8, and the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 (H.R. 1016) was signed into law on October 22. This law authorizes advance appropriations for VHA medical services and facilities starting from FY2011, requiring detailed budget estimates in the President's annual budget request to Congress. The Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 requires the Comptroller General to study health care expenditure projections and report to Congress and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs annually. The reports must assess the consistency of the President's budget requests with projected health care expenditures using the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model. The Comptroller General must submit these reports within 120 days of the President's budget request. Since January 17, 2003, the VA has not enrolled veterans in Priority Group 8 unless they were previously enrolled in another priority group. The Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 requires annual reports on health care expenditure projections. Since January 17, 2003, the VA has suspended enrolling Priority Group 8 veterans, except those previously enrolled in another group. Veterans advocates urge Congress to lift the suspension for all veterans to receive care. The VA could not provide timely medical services to all enrolled veterans due to increased demand. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 allocated $375 million for increased enrollment of Priority Group 8 veterans. VA plans to enroll 258,705 new Priority Group 8 veterans. The VA plans to enroll 258,705 new Priority Group 8 veterans, starting June 15, 2009. The President's FY2010 Budget Request aims to enroll 550,000 new nonservice-connected veterans by 2013. Veterans with incomes exceeding VA's means test thresholds by 10% or less will be placed in Priority Group 8b. The new financial threshold for enrollment in the VA health care system is based on income levels exceeding VA's means test thresholds by 10% or less. Veterans who were denied enrollment before January 1, 2009 can reapply for enrollment under the new threshold. They can also self-determine their eligibility by using VA's online calculator. The VA's online calculator determines eligibility for free health care based on financial assessment using previous year's total household income. Veterans with projected lower current year income can request a hardship determination. This may place them in Priority Group 5 even if prior year income exceeds VA means test threshold. The VA may use projected income for the current year in certain financial hardship circumstances to determine eligibility for Priority Group 7, even if prior year income is above the means test threshold. Financial hardship considerations include loss of employment, business bankruptcy, or unreimbursed medical expenses. Hardship determination is valid through the end of the approved calendar year. Veterans must contact their nearest VA for more information. The VA's beneficiary travel program reimburses veterans for travel costs to VA medical facilities for health care. Laws such as P.L. 76-432 and P.L. 85-857 authorize VA to pay for travel expenses related to examination, treatment, or care. The VA's beneficiary travel program underwent changes in 1987, shifting to discretionary authority for travel reimbursement. Eligibility was restricted to specialized medical transportation, compensation exams, and travel over 100 miles from a VA facility. VA could also cover transfer costs between healthcare facilities for continued care. The VA's beneficiary travel program underwent changes in 1987, shifting to discretionary authority for travel reimbursement. Eligibility was restricted to specialized medical transportation, compensation exams, and travel over 100 miles from a VA facility. VA could also cover transfer costs between healthcare facilities for continued care. Transportation costs not authorized included excess travel expenses by privately owned vehicle, routine travel for domiciliary care, and travel for family members of veterans receiving mental health services unless beyond a 100-mile radius from the nearest VA medical care facility. Other veterans could claim travel expenses with clear evidence of inability to pay or for medically-indicated ambulance transportation. The Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 restored travel reimbursement benefits for VA beneficiaries, with a $3 deductible for most travel. Exceptions include ambulance transportation, air ambulance, wheelchair van, and compensation and pension exams. The FY2008 Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) increased the beneficiary travel mileage reimbursement rate from 11 cents per mile to 28.5 cents per mile for veterans meeting specific criteria, including those with service-connected disabilities or receiving a VA pension. An $18-per-calendar-month cap on the deductible was imposed for veterans needing frequent travel for VA medical care. The VA increased deductible amounts for mileage reimbursements to $7.77 for a one way trip, $15.54 for a round trip, with a maximum of $46.62 per month. The deductibles could be waived for financial hardship. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of 2009 provided $133 million to raise the mileage reimbursement rate to 41.5 cents per mile and freeze deductibles at FY2008 levels. The Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 required the VA to align reimbursement rates with the General Services Administration's rate. The VA adjusted reimbursement rates to match the GSA's rate for federal employees using private vehicles for official business. The deductible amounts for beneficiary travel were restored to pre-2008 levels, with a maximum of $18 per month. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of 2010 recommended continuing beneficiary travel reimbursements at 41.5 cents per mile. Combat veterans discharged from active duty on or after January 28, 2003 are eligible for enrollment in Priority Group 6 for five years following discharge unless eligible for a higher enrollment priority. Combat veterans discharged before January 28, 2003, applying for enrollment on or after January 28, 2008, are eligible for Priority Group 6 until January 27, 2011. After the special eligibility period ends, veterans will be reassigned to the appropriate priority group and may be subject to copayments for certain conditions. The financial income thresholds for VA health care benefits in 2010 are based on specific criteria, excluding pre-existing developmental conditions like scoliosis unless aggravated by combat service."
