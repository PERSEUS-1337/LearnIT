    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the threat posed by toxic cyanobacterial blooms in California's waters, linked to factors like watershed degradation, nutrient loading, water diversions, and climate change. The state's warm climate and stressed waterways make it especially susceptible to these blooms. Cyanobacteria in California's waters produce cyanotoxins, including microcystins, anatoxin-a, and saxitoxin. These toxins are harmful to humans, pets, livestock, birds, and wildlife through ingestion, inhalation, or skin exposure. Microcystins can cause prolonged toxicity by cycling between the liver and intestines. (g) Toxic cyanobacteria blooms are threatening California's water supply and health, with areas like the Klamath and Sacramento Rivers, Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, Clear Lake, Pinto Lake, Copco Lake, Iron Gate Reservoir, and segments of the Klamath River facing recurrent pollution. Bird deaths from microcystins have been reported at the Salton Sea. The Pinto Lake watershed is under evaluation for microcystin regulation and potential superfund site status. California's southern sea otters, a threatened species, have died from microcystin poisoning, likely from contaminated freshwater runoff and prey. Sea otters and humans share some marine foods that can contain microcystin, raising food safety concerns. The state requires a coordinated effort to prevent toxic blooms and cyanotoxin pollution. The Safe Water and Wildlife Protection Act of 2016, also known as Chapter 10, defines terms like \"Board\" as the State Water Resources Control Board and \"Waters of the state\" as any surface waters in California. A Task Force, created under this act, aims to address issues like toxic blooms and cyanotoxin pollution in order to protect wildlife and ensure safe water. The Algal Bloom Task Force, established under the Safe Water and Wildlife Protection Act of 2016, includes representatives from various state departments and agencies to address issues like toxic blooms and cyanotoxin pollution. The task force's functions and duties are outlined in the act. The Algal Bloom Task Force, established under the Safe Water and Wildlife Protection Act of 2016, assesses and prioritizes actions to prevent toxic algal blooms in California waters. It solicits proposals for research and programs to mitigate cyanotoxin pollution and establish monitoring programs. The Algal Bloom Task Force evaluates proposals for research and programs to address toxic blooms of cyanotoxins and microcystin pollution in California waters, providing funding recommendations to relevant agencies. The Algal Bloom Task Force will review risks and impacts of toxic algal blooms and microcystin pollution on various ecosystems and develop prevention recommendations. They will submit findings and recommendations to legislative committees and relevant authorities by January 1, 2018. Meetings and workshops will be organized as needed to implement these measures. The Algal Bloom Task Force will establish a notification procedure for public involvement in ongoing activities and research projects. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute. The Algal Bloom Task Force can enter contracts and provide grants for research projects recommended by the task force, using funds from various departments and agencies."
