Congress acknowledges that the national policy of promoting global free trade has led to the loss of American jobs without adequate support for retraining or creating new economic opportunities. The loss of jobs and economic opportunities due to global free trade policies has left individuals in depressed states without health insurance coverage, impacting state economies. The responsibility for economic transformation lies with the government unit that caused the economic dislocation, as states cannot solely mobilize financial resources to address declining tax revenues and funding for health programs. In Michigan, the high unemployment rate, lasting over 56 months, has led to the loss of factory jobs with no immediate solutions for re-employment. This has left individuals unable to find new jobs to replace lost wages, risking their ability to pay for health insurance.
