    "content": "The \"School Enhancement of Talented Students Act\" may also be known as the \"School EATS Act.\" The Act includes a finding section. Congress finds that in the school year beginning July 2007, the school lunch and breakfast programs provided millions of meals to students. These meals are a significant part of children's daily caloric intake, with commercially prepared products contributing to a large portion of fat, sodium, and calories in lunches. Childhood obesity rates have tripled among kids ages 12 to 19 since 1980, with one-third of America's youth now overweight or obese. States like West Virginia are taking steps to improve school meal guidelines by reducing fat and sodium while increasing fruits and vegetables. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend enhancing nutrition literacy and cooking skills, providing schools with an opportunity to promote healthier eating habits. Schools can promote healthier eating habits by teaching children how to prepare foods. The School Eats Grant Program is established under SEC. 3. It aims to promote healthier eating habits in schools. The School EATS Grant Program, established under SEC. 3, aims to reduce processed food in school meals through competitive grants awarded by the Secretary within 90 days of funds appropriation. Priority is given in awarding grants. The School EATS Grant Program gives priority to eligible entities with high percentages of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals and located in states with high adult and child obesity rates. Eligible entities must submit an application to receive a grant. The School EATS Grant Program requires eligible entities to submit an application with specified information. Grant funds must be used to provide healthy, unprocessed foods in school lunch and breakfast programs by procuring foods, training staff, and purchasing equipment.
