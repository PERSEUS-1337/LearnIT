    "content": "The \"Ultrasound Informed Consent Act\" is added to the Public Health Service Act, including definitions related to informed consent. The term 'abortion' is defined as the intentional termination of an unborn child's life or a woman's pregnancy, with exceptions for live birth, ectopic pregnancy, or removal of a deceased unborn child. An 'abortion provider' is someone legally qualified to perform abortions under Federal and State laws. The term 'unborn child' refers to a human at any stage before birth, while an 'unemancipated minor' is a minor under parental control. 'Woman' is defined as a female human regardless of age. Requirement of informed consent is specified in Section 3. Prior to performing an abortion, providers must comply with ultrasound requirements including performing an ultrasound, explaining the images, displaying them to the patient, and providing a medical description. The ultrasound requirements for abortion include assessing the embryo or fetus dimensions, cardiac activity, external members, and internal organs if visible. Pregnant women have the right to turn away from viewing the ultrasound images without penalty. SEC. 4. EXCEPTION FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. This section exempts abortion providers from certain provisions if the abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother endangered by physical conditions related to the pregnancy. A certification of the medical circumstances must be included in the pregnant woman's file. SEC. 5. PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY. The Attorney General can impose civil penalties on abortion providers for violations of the title, with fines up to $100,000 for the first violation and $250,000 for subsequent violations. The State medical licensing authority must be notified of any penalties imposed. Additionally, women have a private right of action in cases of abortion. Private Right of Action: A woman can sue an abortion provider for damages if the abortion was performed in violation of the title. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act does not override any State laws that have stricter disclosure requirements or penalties for non-compliance with abortion regulations than those outlined in the Act.\n\nSEC. 7. SEVERABILITY.\n\nIf any part of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
