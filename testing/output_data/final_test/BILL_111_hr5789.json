The Department of Energy set minimum efficiency standards for these systems and manufacturers were required to request exception relief to sell them in the United States. The \"SDHV Energy Efficiency Standards for America Act of 2010\" sets efficiency standards for small-duct high-velocity systems, with specific ratings for products manufactured after January 23, 2006. The Act also defines a small-duct, high-velocity system as a heating and cooling product designed to meet certain criteria. The \"SDHV Energy Efficiency Standards for America Act of 2010\" establishes efficiency standards for small-duct high-velocity systems, with specific ratings for products manufactured after January 23, 2006. The Act allows the Secretary to amend the standards for these systems, with a minimum 5-year effective date for any changes. The Secretary will publish a final rule by June 30, 2011, to determine if standards for small-duct, high-velocity systems should be amended. SEC. 4. CREDIT FOR NONBUSINESS SMALL-DUCT, HIGH-VELOCITY AIR CONDITIONING AND HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code introduces criteria for a small-duct high-velocity central air conditioning and heat pump system to qualify for energy efficiency credits. The system must meet specific energy efficiency and air leakage standards. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code defines a small-duct high-velocity central air conditioning and heat pump system as a product meeting specific energy efficiency and air leakage standards. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code sets standards for small-duct high-velocity central air conditioning and heat pump systems, with specific requirements for energy efficiency and air leakage. The amendment also includes termination provisions and an effective date for when the changes apply."
