    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"10 Million-Solar Roofs Act of 2008\". Congress acknowledges the vast potential of increasing electricity production in the US through distributed solar photovoltaics. Utilizing photovoltaics on 10% of existing buildings could meet 70% of peak electric demand. Investment in this technology will lead to cost-competitive electricity prices and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing national energy security. Investments in renewable energy, such as distributed solar photovoltaics, create green jobs and economic benefits. States like California and New Jersey have successfully increased solar energy through rebate programs. Germany has installed a significant amount of distributed solar photovoltaics, showing substantial growth due to supportive laws. SEC. 3. REBATES FOR PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS. The Secretary of Energy will provide rebates for the purchase and installation of photovoltaic systems to increase solar system installations in the US over a 10-year period. Eligible recipients include homeowners, businesses, nonprofits, and government entities. The local government in the United States purchased and installed a photovoltaic system with a capacity limit of 4 megawatts. The buildings where the system is installed must achieve a minimum Energy Star rating of 75 or an equivalent benchmarking metric. The rebate program requires buildings to achieve a 30-point rating improvement under the Energy Star program or an equivalent benchmarking metric. The Secretary may also identify other eligible entities in the United States. The rebate amount is subject to specific criteria. The rebate for purchasing and installing a photovoltaic system must be at least $3 per watt, with a maximum rebate of 50% of the system's cost. This authority is in addition to other financial assistance for installing such systems, and necessary funds are authorized for implementation."
