SEC. 3. SMALL SUPPLIER PROTECTIONS. (a) Qualified Supplier Participation.--Section 1847(b) of the Social Security Act is amended to allow suppliers to continue participating at selected award prices if they submit bids below the fee schedule amount. (b) Restoration of Due Process.--Section 1847(b)(10) of the Act is amended to restore appeal rights for administrative or judicial review. The amendment allows suppliers to participate at selected award prices by submitting bids below the fee schedule amount. Appeal rights for administrative or judicial review are restored. Administrative and judicial review are only available under section 1869 for significant savings requirements. The Secretary demonstrates the potential for significant savings of at least 10 percent by including items or services in the program. A comparability analysis is required before implementing certain rate applications in non-competitive acquisition areas. The Secretary completed a comparability analysis to ensure the application's appropriateness, including analyzing costs and beneficiary access. This requirement also applies to certain Part B items and services under section 1847(a). The amendments made by this section shall be effective as if included in the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173). SEC. 4. REPORT ON QUALITY AND ACCESS IMPACT OF IMPLEMENTATION AT 10 INITIAL COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION AREAS. After implementing the initial 10 competitive acquisition areas, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will analyze the impact on beneficiary access and provider services. A report will be submitted to Congress. Expansion of competitive acquisition programs is prohibited until Congressional action is taken. The Medicare Durable Medical Equipment Access Act of 2007 prohibits the expansion of competitive acquisition programs beyond the initial 10 areas without Congressional authorization. Section 1847(a)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act is amended accordingly."
