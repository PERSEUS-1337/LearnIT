    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bi-State Aircraft Noise Correction Act of 1996\" and includes findings, declaration, and purpose. Congress finds that the Expanded East Coast Plan of the Federal Aviation Administration has led to increased aircraft noise over New Jersey and northwestern Staten Island, New York. The FAA has been uncooperative in addressing the noise issue, especially in New Jersey, and their efforts in mitigating noise levels on Staten Island have been insufficient. The Federal Aviation Administration's efforts to mitigate aircraft noise levels on Staten Island have been inadequate. Congress declares that the FAA should formulate and implement plans to mitigate aircraft noise over certain areas of New Jersey and Staten Island, with the purpose of compelling the Administrator to address the issue. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must develop a plan to reduce aircraft noise in New Jersey by 6 decibels for 80% of residents near Newark International Airport. A similar plan is required for Staten Island. The Administrator must develop a plan to reduce aircraft noise over Staten Island by implementing new departure procedures from Newark International Airport, aiming for a 25% decrease in noise. Additionally, a straight-out southbound departure from runway 22 will be investigated. SEC. 5. OTHER MEASURES. The Administrator will undertake remediation efforts to reduce aircraft noise within a specific sound level contour. SEC. 6. PROCEDURE. The Administrator is not required to prepare an environmental impact statement for activities under this Act. The New Jersey Citizens for Environmental Research and a group designated by the Staten Island Borough President have standing in US district court to compel the Administrator to comply with the Act. The venue for such actions is the US district court in Newark, New Jersey. The Administrator must pay court costs and attorney fees for these organizations, except for punitive damages, if compelled to comply with the Act. Sanctions can be imposed under rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on an attorney, law firm, or party in the plaintiff's case if the suit is dismissed by a judge on a motion for summary judgment by the defendants. The Federal Aviation Administration must implement plans within 90 days of publication or judicial order, without reducing aircraft operations at Newark International Airport."
