    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Blue Collar Computing and Business Assistance Act of 2006\". Congress finds that computational science is crucial for scientific leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security. Advances in this field provide a competitive edge by enabling faster simulations and more precise models. The Federal Government invests in research for new computational science capabilities, as highlighted by the Council on Competitiveness. Small businesses and manufacturers can benefit from high-performance computing technologies, but barriers like cost and technology hinder their access. Establishing an advanced computing software institute can make these resources more accessible to them. The purpose of this Act is to provide grants for the creation of an Advanced Multidisciplinary Computing Software Institute that will develop high-performance computing software and algorithms for small businesses and manufacturers, facilitate the transfer of new technologies, and assist in their utilization. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"Advanced Multidisciplinary Computing Software Center,\" \"Advanced Multidisciplinary Computing Software Institute,\" \"nonprofit organization,\" and \"small business or manufacturer.\" The term \"business or manufacturer\" refers to a small business concern as defined by the Small Business Act, including a small manufacturing concern. The term \"Under Secretary\" refers to the Under Secretary of Technology of the Department of Commerce. SEC. 4. GRANTS. The Under Secretary of Technology of the Department of Commerce will award grants to establish up to 5 Advanced Multidisciplinary Computing Software Centers at eligible entities in the US. Each Center will conduct outreach to small businesses and manufacturers in a specific geographic region and technology transfer programs for a specific industry sector nationwide. Eligible entities include nonprofit organizations, consortia of nonprofits, or partnerships between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. Each eligible entity seeking a grant under this Act must submit an application to the Under Secretary, following specified requirements published in the Federal Register within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The application must include a proposal for the allocation of funds. The Under Secretary evaluates applications based on merit review criteria, including partnerships with relevant organizations and use of academic resources. The eligible entity must have expertise in computational needs, a history of working with businesses, experience in providing educational programs for high-performance computing, partnerships with education/training organizations, and accessibility to businesses and academia. The eligible entity must have expertise in computational needs, a history of working with businesses, experience in providing educational programs for high-performance computing, partnerships with education/training organizations, and accessibility to businesses, academia, incubators, or other economic development organizations via high-speed networks. It should also be capable of partnering with small businesses and manufacturers to enhance their competitiveness in the global marketplace. Additionally, the entity should successfully enter into collaborative agreements with small businesses and manufacturers to experiment with new high-performance computing and computational science technologies, along with other factors identified by the Under Secretary. The grant awarded under this section shall not exceed a certain amount. The grant awarded under this section shall not exceed $5,000,000 for any year and may not exceed 5 years in duration. Grants may be renewed at the discretion of the Under Secretary. An eligible entity receiving a grant must provide at least 50% of the required funds to create and maintain a Center. The Under Secretary may establish a limitation on administrative expenses for grants awarded under this section. A Center established under this Act can collect fees from small businesses and accept funds from other Federal departments. The Center can accept funds from other Federal departments for capital costs or operating expenses, subject to certain conditions. SEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS. An eligible entity receiving a grant must use the funds to create a repository of federally-funded software, test and validate software, determine industry sector benefits, work with vendors to commercialize software, make software available to small businesses, and help test or utilize software. Manufacturers test software on high-performance computing systems and maintain a research team to aid small businesses in identifying software for solving problems or meeting business needs. The eligible entities receiving grants must submit annual reports on their Center's goals and progress. The Under Secretary will establish a peer review committee to evaluate each Center. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2007-2011 for the Act's provisions, with funds remaining available until expended."
