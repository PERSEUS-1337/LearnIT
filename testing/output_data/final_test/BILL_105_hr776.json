The \"Decennial Census Improvement Act of 1997\" outlines the importance of conducting a census every 10 years to apportion Representatives, determine district boundaries, and allocate funds. The Constitution mandates these enumerations to be conducted as directed by Congress. The 1990 decennial census used mail questionnaires and personal interviews with over 350,000 enumerators. In August 1992, it was found to have undercounted four million people (1.6% of the population), with varying rates among different groups and regions. For example, African Americans were undercounted by 4.4%, American Indians by 4.5%, Asians or Pacific Islanders by 2.3%, and Hispanic Americans by 5%. New Mexico had a 3.1% undercount, Texas 2.8%, California 2.7%, and Florida 2%. The Bureau faced challenges with the accuracy of the 1990 census, leading to lawsuits. The Supreme Court upheld the decision not to adjust the enumeration. For the 2000 census, the Bureau planned to use a combination of methods. The 2000 decennial census planned to use mail questionnaires and personal interviews to collect data from households. Witnesses raised concerns about the Bureau's sampling technique potentially increasing disparities in undercounts among different geographic areas and racial/ethnic groups. The 2000 decennial census planned to use a sampling technique that would save $500 million compared to the method used in the 1990 census. The Chairman of the Panel on Census Requirements testified about the trade-off between cost savings and potential adverse effects. The 2000 decennial census planned to use a sampling technique to save money, but there were concerns about adverse effects on sampling variability, public perception, and political consequences. The purpose of the Act is to ensure the accuracy of the census data and promote public confidence in it. The Act aims to ensure the accuracy of census data and boost public confidence in it by setting requirements. The 2000 decennial census will attempt direct contact with every household, using sampling only after contacting 90% of households in a tract. The Bureau will also utilize non-federal resources to reduce undercount, including state and local government offices. The Bureau will provide a description of measures to carry out the census.
