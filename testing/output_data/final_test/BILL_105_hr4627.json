    "content": "The Act titled \"Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1998\" aims to provide fairness in prescription drug pricing for seniors. The Congress finds that manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price discrimination practices, causing older Americans to pay significantly more for drugs than favored customers. On average, seniors pay twice as much and in some cases over 15 times more for prescription drugs. This discriminatory pricing sustains major drug manufacturers' profits but leads to financial hardship and health issues for older Americans. The policy set forth in this Act aims to reduce prescription prices for Medicare beneficiaries by more than 40 percent, addressing the financial hardship and health issues faced by older Americans due to discriminatory pricing practices by drug manufacturers. The Act aims to lower healthcare costs for older Americans and improve their well-being by reducing prescription drug prices through non-discriminatory pricing practices. Pharmacies can purchase drugs for Medicare beneficiaries at reduced prices under the Federal Supply Schedule. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide Medicare beneficiaries with a drug benefit card to purchase prescription drugs at reduced prices from participating pharmacies. Any qualified pharmacy can enter into an agreement with the Secretary to sell covered outpatient drugs to Medicare beneficiaries at reduced prices. The agreement allows pharmacies to purchase drugs listed on the Federal Supply Schedule at a discount price. Participating pharmacies can buy as much of a covered outpatient drug as they sell to Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary determines a participating pharmacy discount price for covered outpatient drugs by adding the price available to Federal agencies from the Federal Supply Schedule and administrative costs. The Secretary will administer the Act using existing methods for drug distribution efficiently. Regulations will be issued as needed. Additionally, reports on the Act's effectiveness will be submitted to Congress. SEC. 6.
