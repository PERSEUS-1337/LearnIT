    "content": "The Medicaid program covers a range of health care services for low-income populations, including rehabilitation services. The definition of rehabilitation under Medicaid is broad and can be difficult to describe, leading to confusion about what can be included. States have used the Medicaid rehabilitation benefit to cover various services, therapies, and treatments, leading to confusion about what is considered rehabilitative. To address this, CMS issued a proposed rule in 2007 to clarify definitions and ensure services claimed as rehabilitation are truly rehabilitative. Rehabilitation under Medicaid now includes a broader range of therapies and treatments beyond physical rehabilitation, such as mental health and substance abuse treatment, occupational and speech therapy. Services are delivered in various settings by different practitioners. Medicaid covers a variety of rehabilitation services for mental illness, disabilities, substance abuse, and other conditions. These services are provided by a range of practitioners in different settings, such as outpatient clinics, mobile crisis vehicles, and community settings. Medicaid expenditures for rehabilitation have increased nationally. In FY1999, total state and federal rehabilitation expenditures reported to CMS were approximately $3.6 billion, increasing to $6.4 billion in FY2005. The number of beneficiaries receiving rehabilitation services also increased from 1.2 million to 1.6 million during the same period. Per beneficiary rehabilitation expenditures rose by 30% from $3,020 to $3,916. Overall Medicaid expenditures increased by 86.9% from approximately $147 billion in FY1999 to $276 billion in FY2005. Overall, Medicaid expenditures increased by 86.9% from approximately $147 billion in FY1999 to $276 billion in FY2005. The number of Medicaid beneficiaries also rose by 43.1% during this time period. Per beneficiary spending on rehabilitation services increased by 30.7% from $3,657 to $4,781. Some states do not report rehabilitation expenditures in their data compiled by CMS, leading to efforts to define and regulate rehabilitation service benefits. In 1989, Congress permitted states to cover habilitative services for mentally retarded individuals after the Secretary initially approved 17 state plans. However, CMS later withdrew approval due to not meeting qualifications for the rehabilitation benefit. Congress prohibited other states from gaining approval for these services. In June 1992, a Medicaid director letter (SMDL) provided guidance on using the rehabilitation option for mentally ill beneficiaries. It emphasized that rehabilitation services should aim to reduce disability and restore recipients to their best functional level. Examples of covered services included basic living skills, social skills, counseling, and therapy. The letter also outlined services that were not considered rehabilitation, such as vocational training and direct personal care. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS/OIG) criticized states and CMS for practices related to rehabilitation services in Medicaid. GAO reports highlighted CMS's lack of guidance on federal financial participation rules, leading to increased federal matching payments for services like rehabilitation. States were found to boost payments by reallocating funds to non-Medicaid agencies serving Medicaid beneficiaries, while HHS/OIG audits revealed non-compliance with reimbursement requirements. State reimbursement requirements for rehabilitation services or comply with state and/or federal Medicaid rules. States often receive explicit guidance on specific services that can be covered under the rehabilitation benefit when preparing and submitting state plan amendments (SPAs) to CMS's Regional and Central Offices. SPA approvals are dependent on states making changes to their Medicaid service offerings, and new rehabilitation rules are needed to guide states in making changes to their rehabilitation benefit offerings. CMS issued a proposed rehabilitation services rule in August 2007 to define the scope of the rehabilitation benefit for states. The rule aims to clarify allowable services claimable under Medicaid, requiring written treatment plans with therapeutic goals, treatment timelines, and responsible healthcare providers. Rehabilitation plans must engage beneficiaries and families in care management, delivered by qualified providers under professional responsibility. States must amend Medicaid plans to include descriptions of services, provider qualifications, and reimbursement methods. The rule proposes reimbursement methodologies for Medicaid providers, excluding FFP for services intrinsic to non-Medicaid programs. Beneficiaries of non-Medicaid programs may still receive Medicaid rehabilitation services if program requirements are met. Therapeutic foster care is cited as an example of a non-covered service, deemed a model of care rather than medically necessary. The proposed rule outlines Medicaid reimbursement for rehabilitation services provided to Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries in Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC). Services must be medically necessary and part of a supervised treatment plan. Non-Medicaid programs like foster care, child welfare, and education are not considered rehabilitative under the rule. Medicaid rehabilitation does not cover room and board for residents in various settings. The proposed rule clarifies Medicaid reimbursement for rehabilitative services in various settings, excluding room and board costs. It distinguishes between rehabilitative and habilitative services, with rehabilitation focusing on restoring functional levels and habilitation on acquiring new abilities. The proposed rule would prohibit habilitative services for states grandfathered under OBRA 1989, requiring them to transition to other Medicaid authorities such as HCBS waiver programs. CMS was forbidden from taking adverse action against states approved for habilitation services until regulations specifying covered services were issued. The proposed rehabilitation rule under OBRA 1989 conditions would phase out habilitation services for states, leading to varying estimates of its financial impact. CMS estimated a reduction in federal Medicaid spending, while the CBO forecasted a decrease in federal outlays. A survey by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform estimated the financial impact to be around $5.2 billion. Reform estimated the financial impact of the proposed rehabilitation rule to be approximately $5.2 billion over five years from FY2009-FY2013. There are three perspectives on rehabilitation policy issues: federal regulatory agency CMS, advocates for Medicaid recipients, and state governments. CMS believes additional guidance is needed to clarify rehabilitation services, citing criticism from GAO and HHS/OIG. Confusion among states about rehabilitation and habilitation has been noted. Organizations and advocacy groups have raised concerns about the potential misuse of federal funds in rehabilitation services for Medicaid beneficiaries. They argue that a \"person-centered\" approach may not be suitable for individuals with serious mental health issues who may not be able to actively participate in their therapy decisions. Flexibility in rehabilitation plans is suggested for non-compliant beneficiaries instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. Child welfare groups and organizations representing special-needs children are concerned that the proposed rule on rehabilitation for Medicaid beneficiaries may create barriers and restrict access to services. They argue that the distinction between rehabilitation and habilitation is irrelevant in addressing children's health needs. Children should receive rehabilitation treatment under Medicaid's EPSDT provisions, ensuring comprehensive coverage for categorically needy beneficiaries. Advocates emphasize the importance of children receiving treatment for physical or mental conditions, regardless of when they developed. Determining loss of functioning or lack of skill development in children can be complex due to various factors. Advocates for mentally retarded and developmentally disabled individuals are concerned that proposed rehabilitation regulations could reduce funding for community-based mental health services, leading to service reductions for needy individuals and potentially pushing MR/DD individuals towards institutional care, which could increase Medicaid expenditures. Health advocates are worried that proposed Medicaid rehabilitation regulations may limit services for individuals with mental and emotional disabilities. States are concerned about the new administrative burdens and potential long-term costs of reduced rehabilitation expenditures. Governors argue that Medicaid expenditures increase during economic downturns, impacting the ability to provide necessary care. State governors argue that federal Medicaid expenditures should not be reduced as economic conditions worsen, leading to rising Medicaid costs. Some states are already facing shortages of mental health professionals willing to participate in Medicaid, which could be exacerbated by additional administrative burdens. Legislation such as the MMSEA and H.R. 5613 have imposed moratoriums on Medicaid program changes, including rehabilitation services, to address these concerns. H.R. 5613, related to Medicaid and rehabilitation services, was sent to the full House by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The bill requires the Secretary to submit a report to address specific problems with Medicaid regulations by July 1, 2008. Additionally, an independent contractor must prepare a comprehensive report by March 1, 2009, detailing strategies to address these problems. The Senate introduced a similar measure to H.R. 5613, the Economic Recovery in Health Care Act of 2008 (S. 2819), which imposed a one-year moratorium on rehabilitation and other Medicaid regulations until April 1, 2009. The Senate also passed the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 (H.R. 2642) with a moratorium on the rehabilitation regulation until April 1, 2009. H.R. 2642 included moratoria for six Medicaid regulations, retained requirements from H.R. 5613 for the Secretary to report to committees, and hire an independent contractor. The Senate passed H.R. 2642 without changes to delay implementation of six Medicaid regulations, including rehabilitation services, until April 1, 2009. The legislation also requires reports on the regulations to be submitted to the House Energy and Commerce and Senate Finance Committees. P.L. 110-252 was signed into law on June 30, 2008, and the budget resolution included provisions for deficit-neutral reserve funds and a delay in Medicaid administrative regulations. The Senate provision would delay Medicaid administrative regulations, including rehabilitation services."
