    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. WAIVER OF OXYGEN CONTENT REQUIREMENT FOR REFORMULATED GASOLINE.\" is a condensed summary of a specific section related to the waiver of oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline. Section 211(k)(1) of the Clean Air Act is amended to allow Governors to waive oxygen content requirements for gasoline sold in their State. Governors can waive oxygen content requirements for gasoline in their State, allowing gasoline to be considered reformulated even if it does not comply with certain provisions. Gasoline sold in specific States is exempt from certain regulations, and the Administrator must ensure emission reduction benefits are maintained within 270 days of this provision. The Administrator will develop regional designations in cooperation with the Secretary of Energy to ensure that emission reduction benefits are maintained in States where the Governor waives the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline. The Administrator will establish annual performance standards for each region based on the phase II reformulated gasoline model and annual emissions reductions achieved in the region under the reformulated gasoline program. The reformulated gasoline program in calendar years 1998 and 1999 will have applicable performance standards applied on an annual average basis to the manufacture of reformulated gasoline sold or introduced into commerce by a refinery in a State where the Governor waives the oxygenate requirement. The reformulated gasoline program in 1998 and 1999 will have annual average regional performance standards, with exceptions for more stringent requirements under section 202(l) or paragraph (3)(B)(ii) standards. Regulations under clause (i) will not apply in certain states. The phase II reformulated gasoline complex model toxic performance standards will remain in effect until new regulations are promulgated. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will conduct a study on the need for additional standards to control releases of MTBE from underground storage tanks. Additionally, measures will be taken to prevent air or water pollution from oxygenated fuel additives. The Clean Air Act is amended to allow the Administrator to control or prohibit the sale of oxygenated fuel additives if they contribute to air or water pollution that endangers public health. Additionally, there is a limitation on the use of MTBE. The Clean Air Act is amended to limit the sale of gasoline containing MTBE to 1 percent by volume for certain calendar years. The Clean Air Act prohibits the sale of gasoline with more than a specified level of methyl tertiary butyl ether. The Administrator will establish regulations for a phase-down program and may allow trading among refiners, blenders, and importers. The Clean Air Act prohibits the sale of gasoline with excess methyl tertiary butyl ether. The Administrator will regulate a phase-down program allowing trading among refiners, blenders, and importers to ensure gasoline contains no more than 1 percent MTBE. State Authority To Revise Implementation Plan: A State can submit a plan to reduce or eliminate the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether in gasoline if it's necessary for public health or the environment, and won't disrupt gasoline availability or price. The text discusses the conditions under which a State can regulate the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether in gasoline, ensuring it does not cause greater issues than the additive itself. It also mentions that certain States have the authority to enforce controls on this additive. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide technical assistance and personnel to States applying for new permits or modifications under the Clean Air Act for butyl ether. SEC. 5. ASSURANCE OF ADEQUATE FUEL SUPPLY. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must consider the need for reasonable schedules for refinery investment projects and fuel distribution system modifications when regulating fuel properties. Fuel industry flexibility should be maintained in implementing these regulations."
