It serves as a gateway to markets in mainland China and has a high standard of living, surpassing many European nations. Hong Kong is a member of various economic organizations like the WTO and APEC. Its economy heavily relies on trade, with significant exports and imports in 2004. About 30% of China's trade passes through Hong Kong. In 2004, Hong Kong's economy saw a shift from manufacturing to services, especially in trade-related sectors like banking and financial services. This change was driven by the transfer of manufacturing to the Mainland, where 50,000 Hong Kong firms employ about 6 million Chinese workers in the Pearl River Delta region. Hong Kong remains a crucial hub for China's trade, with about 30% of China's trade passing through the city. Taiwan also relies on Hong Kong for its trade with China, as it does not have direct commercial links with the mainland. In 2004, Hong Kong's economy shifted to services, particularly in trade-related sectors like banking and financial services. The economy faced challenges in 1997 due to the Asian financial crisis, leading to interventions by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to stabilize the currency and stock market. The HangSengIndex saw a 24% increase in share value from 33 blue-chip companies, despite criticism of government intervention. The Asian economic crisis in 1998 caused a major recession in Hong Kong, with a 5.0% GDP drop, rising unemployment, and declining exports and imports. The economy partially recovered in 1999 and 2000 but faced setbacks from terrorist attacks in 2001 and the SARS outbreak in 2003. Hong Kong's economy was severely impacted by the SARS outbreak in 2003, leading to a record high unemployment rate of 8.7%. However, the economy rebounded sharply in 2004 with a 7.7% estimated GDP growth, driven by rising exports and strong domestic demand. The United States was a key economic partner for Hong Kong in 2003, being the largest market for domestic exports and the fourth-largest supplier of imports. In 2004, Hong Kong rebounded with a 7.7% GDP growth driven by exports and domestic demand. The US is a key economic partner, with over 1,000 US businesses in Hong Kong and $44.3 billion in US foreign direct investment. Hong Kong serves as a base for US firms doing business in China, with $16.0 billion in US exports to Hong Kong and $9.3 billion in imports. Top US exports to Hong Kong include electrical machinery, non-electrical machinery, and miscellaneous goods. The United States treats Hong Kong as a separate economic territory for trade data and export controls. U.S. officials work with Hong Kong to prevent illegal circumvention of export controls and combat violations of intellectual property rights. The top U.S. imports from Hong Kong include apparel, telecommunications equipment, and miscellaneous manufactured items. The United States treats Hong Kong separately for export controls, with concerns raised about China using Hong Kong to acquire restricted items. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 requires reporting on conditions and cooperation in export controls. The United States has raised concerns about China using Hong Kong for acquiring restricted items, leading to a need for cooperation in export controls. Hong Kong has been commended for its effective export control regime but faces challenges due to economic integration with China, resulting in illegal re-exports of U.S. technology. Efforts are being made to enhance cooperation on licensing and enforcement information and educate the public on export control laws. Hong Kong was designated as a watch list country under Special 301 due to piracy issues but was later removed after making significant improvements in IPR protection. The USTR praised Hong Kong for its efforts to combat piracy, including shutting down illicit manufacturing lines. Hong Kong has shut down illicit manufacturing lines but faces challenges in commercial end-use piracy and patent protection for pharmaceuticals. International economic forecasting organizations predict positive long-term prospects for Hong Kong's economy if it maintains free trade policies and autonomy from mainland China. The Economist Intelligence Unit and Global Insight project GDP growth rates for Hong Kong in 2005. China's WTO accession presents opportunities and challenges for Hong Kong's economy, with increased trade and investment expected. Hong Kong's economy faces challenges in piracy and patent protection but has positive long-term prospects if it maintains free trade policies. The city is the largest investor in China and stands to benefit from a more open Chinese market. However, its role as a middleman for foreign firms could diminish if China establishes direct trade links with Taiwan."
