    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Carbon Capture and Storage Technology Act of 2007\" and defines terms like \"Secretary\" and \"Task Force\". It also includes provisions for carbon dioxide sequestration commercial demonstration projects. The Secretary will establish a grant program for 3-5 commercial demonstration projects to show the long-term effects of carbon dioxide sequestration in deep geological formations. Projects must inject at least 1,000,000 tons of CO2 annually and involve intensive site monitoring. The commercial demonstration project will evaluate the security and leakage of carbon dioxide storage during and after the project, develop best practices for storage management, integrate data, and assess cost-efficient methods. The commercial demonstration project will evaluate cost-efficient ways to undertake carbon dioxide sequestration, integrate it with capture and transportation, monitor and verify injected carbon dioxide, and manage associated hazards and risks. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary, and projects will be selected in diverse geological and geophysical locations. The commercial demonstration project will assess cost-efficient carbon dioxide sequestration methods in various geological locations with a population density range. The non-Federal share of project costs should be 20-50%, but the Secretary can waive this requirement. Reports to Congress are due within 8 years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will submit a preliminary report to Congress on commercial demonstration projects and evaluations conducted under this section within 8 years of the Act's enactment. A final report, including required information, will be submitted within 10 years. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of Appropriations: $1,600,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2015. SEC. 4. CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. The Secretary will establish a grant program for commercial demonstration projects capturing carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Projects must involve plants with a capacity of 250-500 megawatts and prioritize carbon capture with sequestration. Entities must submit applications to be eligible for assistance. The Secretary may require information for commercial demonstration projects, with a cost-sharing requirement of at least 50% from non-Federal sources. Exceptions may apply if technology is critical and resources are insufficient. $2.4 billion is authorized for fiscal years 2008-2015. SEC. 5. CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE REGULATIONS. An interagency task force has been established to develop regulations for capturing and storing carbon dioxide. The task force includes the Secretary, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Secretary of the Interior. The Administrator of the EPA serves as the chairperson, and the task force consults with industry, legal, and technical experts. The regulations developed by the Task Force, which includes industry, legal, and technical experts, will address existing underground injection control program requirements, certification and closure of carbon dioxide capture and storage sites, liability transfer to governmental entities, safe transportation and storage of carbon dioxide, cost estimates, and outcomes of demonstration projects. The Task Force will develop proposed regulations within 3 years of the Act's enactment, to be submitted to Congress. The EPA Administrator must promulgate the regulations within 18 months of submission. The regulations will be updated as needed within 3 years of promulgation to reflect demonstration project results. The EPA Administrator is responsible for enforcing and inspecting the regulations outlined in the Act. SEC. 6. CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND STORAGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Director of the Office of Science, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy, will conduct a program for researching and developing carbon dioxide capture technologies, including coal gasification, air-blown and oxy-fueled coal combustion, oxygen separation at power plants, and advanced biological systems. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, will also work on carbon dioxide storage technologies. The research and development of carbon dioxide storage technologies include understanding geological sequestration processes, simulation activities at storage sites, and hazard management. The Secretary will develop recommendations based on these activities for optimal storage features. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for these activities. The Secretary authorizes $100,000,000 for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for various subsections and subparagraphs related to carbon dioxide storage technologies. Additionally, $50,000,000 is allocated for specific activities in subsection (b)(1). SEC. 7. CARBON DIOXIDE STORAGE CAPACITY ASSESSMENT. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as assessment, capacity, engineered hazard, risk, and Secretary. These definitions are crucial for understanding the national assessment of carbon dioxide storage capacity. The Secretary, defined as the Secretary of the Interior, is tasked with developing a methodology for assessing potential storage formations for industrial carbon dioxide. This assessment will consider the geographical extent, capacity, and injectivity of the formations, as well as estimate potential volumes of oil and gas. The Secretary will consult with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on data sharing, format, methodology, and content of the assessment for potential storage formations for industrial carbon dioxide. The Secretary will cooperate with relevant entities to ensure the success of the assessment. State coordination and external review will also be conducted to gather feedback from experts and the public. The methodology developed under this section will be periodically updated, incorporating new data every 5 years. A panel of experts will review the methodology and publish the revised final version in the Federal Register. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and State geological surveys, will conduct a national assessment of carbon dioxide storage capacity using geological data. This includes a drilling program to gather well log, core, and fluid sample data. Partnerships with other entities may be formed for this drilling program. The Secretary of Energy will partner with other entities to collect data from drilling programs relevant to carbon dioxide storage. The assessment results will be incorporated into the NatCarb database for ranking potential storage sites within the United States. A report must be submitted within 180 days of completing the assessment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress detailing the findings of the assessment. The national assessment will be updated every five years to support decision-making. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of State, will offer agreements to China, India, and other coal-dependent countries to fund carbon capture and storage technologies, share knowledge, and provide training."
