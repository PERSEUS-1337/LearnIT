    "content": "The \"Nuclear Facility and Material Security Act of 2008\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions regarding nuclear reactor designs concerning aircraft impact. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must issue a final rule within 1 year of the Act's enactment, requiring new commercial nuclear power reactors to withstand large commercial aircraft impacts. Design features must ensure safety functions operate post-impact and prevent release of radioactive materials to the environment. The EPA and Public Protection Action Guide Limit recommend evacuation if a community member receives a dose that triggers it. SEC. 3. SPENT FUEL SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must issue a final rule within 18 months to enhance storage safety for spent fuel assemblies, including minimizing fire risk and transferring fuel to dry cask storage promptly. Additionally, mitigation features like water-spray systems must be in place for emergencies. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must issue a final rule within 1 year to enhance security for Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations, incorporating them into security evaluation requirements and design basis threat rules. SEC. 4. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must consider the risk of terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities in its reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. SEC. 5. Potassium Iodide. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will now have full authority over the distribution of potassium iodide for radiological exposure in humans, following the repeal of waiver authority. Additionally, the Secretary will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences for studies on emergency response plans to releases of radioactive materials. The studies will focus on emergency response to radiological releases, including evacuation, sheltering, food interdiction, and medical prophylaxes for radioiodine and other radioisotopes. They will review past evacuations and food interdictions, assess potential consequences of exposure, recommend best practices for response, and evaluate new medical prophylaxes for radioisotopes released in such events. Recommendations may include procuring additional medical prophylaxes for stockpiles. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will consider procuring medical prophylaxes for the Strategic National Stockpile and updating potassium iodide distribution guidelines based on study findings. Guidelines will be amended to include new recommendations within 60 days. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish guidelines for stockpiling and distributing potassium iodide tablets in the event of a nuclear incident within 60 days of the Nuclear Facility and Material Security Act of 2008. SEC. 6. AUDIT OF SAFETY AND SECURITY ANALYSIS AND REVIEW ACTIVITIES: A unit within the Office of the Inspector General of the Commission will audit regulatory oversight activities related to safety and security of civilian nuclear facilities. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose. SEC. 7. RADIATION SOURCE PROTECTION. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to include a new paragraph requiring a task force to evaluate materials listed in the Code of Conduct and make recommendations to amend regulatory requirements for radiation sources to address risks associated with deliberate dispersal and contamination of large areas. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to require a task force to evaluate radiation sources listed in the Code of Conduct and recommend regulatory changes to address risks from deliberate dispersal and contamination. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must implement these recommendations through regulations, including revising security requirements for transporting Category 1, 2, and 3 sources within 18 months. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must issue a final rule requiring carriers and transporters to be licensed for transporting radiation sources within the United States. Additionally, a national radiation source tracking system must be established within 2 years to enable location tracking and recovery of stolen or diverted sources. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will issue a final rule to revise regulations for the National Source Tracking System, requiring real-time tracking of Category 1, 2, and 3 radiation sources, as well as sources with \\1/10\\ or more of the activity threshold of Category 3 sources. Additionally, within 2 years, high-risk radiation sources security and replacement rules will be implemented. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will issue a final rule to establish requirements for replacing high-risk radiation sources within 10 years of the enactment of the Act. This rule will discontinue licensing for new high-risk radiation sources unless technologically feasible alternatives are not available. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will issue a final rule to establish requirements for replacing high-risk radiation sources within 10 years of the enactment of the Act. The rule will discontinue licensing for new high-risk radiation sources unless technologically feasible alternatives are not available. Additionally, the rule will ensure that the costs of disposition of high-risk radiation sources will be covered, provide incentives for decommissioning and replacing existing sources, prohibit the export of high-risk sources to other countries, and prescribe enhanced security measures for existing sources. The Task Force on Radiation Source Protection and Security will review the rule or any updates within 4 years of issuance. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will review and update the rule issued to replace high-risk radiation sources every 5 years, considering new technologies and security threats. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission authorizes appropriations for addressing security threats related to high-risk radiation sources, including cesium chloride, and the Department of Energy is allocated funds for the management of these sources. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission authorizes funds for security threats related to high-risk radiation sources, including cesium chloride, designated by the Task Force on Radiation Source Protection and Security."
