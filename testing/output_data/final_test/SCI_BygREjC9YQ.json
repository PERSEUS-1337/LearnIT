    "content": "We present a novel Bayesian approach to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), leading to BRMSprop and BAdam, Bayesian variants of RMSprop and Adam. This approach recovers features of adaptive SGD methods like root-mean-square normalization and Nesterov acceleration. Empirical comparisons show that Bayesian methods can significantly reduce test loss and classification error. The development of adaptive SGD methods, including ADAGrad, RMSprop, Adam, and variants like Nesterov acceleration and AdamW, has led to successes in machine translation, dialogue systems, handwriting generation, and image generation. A unified theoretical understanding of adaptive SGD methods is explored by reconciling state-of-the-art algorithms with early Bayesian filtering work. Recent attempts connect adaptive SGD algorithms to natural gradient variational inference, providing momentum-free algorithms with mean-square normalizer. The curr_chunk discusses the modification of natural gradient VI updates to incorporate momentum and the root-mean-square normalizer to achieve a closer match to popular adaptive methods like Adam. There is a loose connection between successful adaptive SGD algorithms and natural gradient VI, with a formal correspondence between natural gradient VI and Bayesian filtering. The equivalence of a particular filtering approach and natural gradient VI indicates issues in obtaining momentum or the root-mean-square normalizer. The curr_chunk discusses how BID22 introduces dynamics into the Kalman filter by adding artificial process noise, which may not correspond to a real generative process. The heirarchy of generative models underlying the updates is shown in Figure 1, with a full model for gradients and a graphical model obtained by integrating over trajectories. To convert the graphical model in B into a tractable hidden Markov model (HMM), a new variable z i (t) is defined to incorporate w * i and other dynamics information. The goal is to develop a principled Bayesian filtering approach that captures momentum and the root-mean-square normalizer features of adaptive SGD algorithms. Past approaches have used a complex generative model with strong factorization approximations, raising concerns about disrupting the true posterior distribution. Incorporating factorization into the generative model allows for Bayesian inference to optimize updates efficiently. By splitting the large inference problem into smaller ones, high-dimensional correlations are simplified into low-dimensional dynamics. Bayesian SGD is shown to be an adaptive method that uses uncertainty to precondition the gradient. Bayesian adaptive SGD methods like AdamW and Nesterov acceleration aim to eliminate symmetries in the posterior distribution to obtain informative estimates of weights. The approach involves conditioning on current parameter estimates to narrow down the posterior distribution. The optimal weight, w * i, is a random variable dependent on current estimates of other weights, \u00b5 \u2212i, which are influenced by random initialization and optimization algorithms. Bayesian methods cannot infer w * i directly from data as it assumes data is generated from model parameters, w, not w * i. The updates for neural network optimization algorithms depend on the current parameter value and backpropagated gradients. A generative model for backpropagated gradients can be used to infer the optimal weight, w * i, by approximating the likelihood with a second-order Taylor series expansion. The gradient of the log-likelihood is a random variable, dependent on the minibatch and current parameter estimates. The distribution of gradients is studied with a specific value for the negative Hessian. The expected gradient is zero at the optimal weight, w * i, with equality if the expected value of the parameter is independent. The distribution of the gradient is studied with a specific value for the negative Hessian. An alternative approach is proposed to choose a model for the gradients that closely matches any given approximation of the original likelihood. The variance is the negative Hessian, \u03bb like,i, reminiscent of Fisher-Information like results. The log-likelihood induced by conditioning on the gradient has the same form as the original likelihood. The key difference in the current chunk is that Bayesian filtering involves inferring a single distribution over all weights jointly, while in the proposed alternative approach, N separate inference problems are considered where the optimal weight, w * i, is inferred from the gradient. This introduces dynamics as w * i varies over time depending on other parameters in the network. The simplified dynamics for optimizing parameter w * i are evaluated empirically, incorporating a new random variable z i with Markovian generative process. For Adam, z i includes w * i and momentum p i, while for RMSprop it only includes w * i. The text discusses the optimal setting for a parameter that changes over time, using a Gaussian form for these changes and a second-order Taylor expansion of the likelihood. It also mentions the use of Bayesian (Kalman) filtering as adaptive SGD with Gaussian prior and approximate likelihood for two-step Kalman filter updates. The text discusses two-step Kalman filter updates for incorporating new data and relating Kalman filtering to gradient ascent. It emphasizes the use of uncertainty in preconditioning for optimal parameter settings that change over time. The text introduces a Bayesian variant of RMSprop called BRMSprop, where uncertainty is used to precondition gradient updates based on past data confidence. The updates for posterior covariance can be rewritten using the Sherman Morrison formula, and Fisher information is used to estimate parameters. Each parameter is considered a separate Bayesian inference problem, with a latent variable z representing a single parameter. In the Bayesian variant BRMSprop, a single scalar z represents a parameter. The updates for prior and posterior are described, and it is shown that BRMSprop closely approximates RMSprop in steady state. The comparison is based on the implied learning rate when the average squared gradient and uncertainty reach steady state. In the Bayesian variant BAdam, momentum is introduced through an auxiliary variable p(t) for each parameter, evolving independently through time with decay \u03b7p and noise variance \u03b7. This coupling ensures momentum's influence on the weight is similar to unit-variance Gaussian noise. The weight dynamics include a momentum-dependent term. In BAdam, weight dynamics include a momentum-dependent term with momentum coupling and noise variance. The updates closely approximate Adam with suitable parameter choices. In BAdam, weight dynamics involve momentum coupling and noise variance. The updates depend on \u03a3ww and \u03a3wp, related to e2 but not present in standard Adam. Comparisons are made by reaching steady-state values for these quantities. The text discusses the relationship between learning rates and evidence strength in neural network training algorithms, aiming to improve upon the Adam method by incorporating Bayesian filtering principles. The goal is to capture the essential insights of Adam while achieving a close approximation through specific relationships between parameters. The text compares filtering updates to Adam updates, showing similarities with a slight difference in root-mean-square normalization location. It discusses Bayesian vs. standard methods on MNIST, training a CNN with specific architecture details. The CNN model used 5x5 convolutional kernels and a fully connected layer with 50 units, initialized with draws from a Gaussian distribution. Bayesian-specific parameters were set to 1/(2N inputs), with lower values giving better performance. Default parameters were used for RMSprop and Adam. Bayesian methods showed lower test loss compared to non-Bayesian methods. The Bayesian methods exhibit lower test loss and slightly lower classification error compared to non-Bayesian methods. The local maximum in test-loss may be due to conditioning on each datapoint multiple times, which is not theoretically justified. The study examines weight decay, L2 regularization, and Bayesian priors in adaptive SGD methods like Adam, suggesting new ideas for optimization. The alternative method of normalizing only the gradient of the objective, while keeping weight decay constant, known as AdamW, shows improved test accuracy compared to the standard approach. This method naturally arises in BRMSprop and BAdam, potentially explaining its better performance. Nesterov accelerated gradients (NAG) involve computing the gradient at a predicted location formed by applying a momentum update to the current parameters, which aligns with the Bayesian scheme's evaluation of the required gradient term at \u00b5 prior. Our novel method, \"Nesterov accelerated weight decay\" (NAWD), combines Nesterov acceleration with weight decay through the dynamics matrix A. This approach addresses convergence issues of RMSprop and Adam by coupling the learning rate to the timescale of the exponential decay of squared gradients. Our method addresses convergence issues of RMSprop and Adam by coupling the learning rate to the timescale of the exponential decay of squared gradients. ADAM first updates the root-mean-square gradient normalizer before computing the parameter update, ensuring updates are bounded in pathological cases. Bayesian filtering naturally recovers this choice as the gradient preconditioner in the posterior covariance. The method combines temporal changes induced by factorised approximations with other inference methods like probabilistic backpropagation and assumed density filtering. It is closely related to natural gradient variational inference methods, using Fisher Information to approximate likelihood. The key difference is the introduction of rich dynamics in Bayesian filtering for optimal inference in neural network optimization. The Bayesian approach introduces a statistical model for gradient optimization in neural networks. It provides a method for developing optimal algorithms in scenarios where the gradient is not readily available, such as in noisy or biological settings. Future work can involve empirical investigations in large scale systems or finding closed-form expressions for dynamics in simplified domains. The text discusses the Bayesian interpretation of adaptive stochastic gradient descent methods for reducing generalization error in neural networks. It suggests new stochastic regularization schemes and filtering methods to represent the covariance of weight matrices. The reparameterization of networks is proposed to simplify the initialization process for optimization algorithms. The text discusses reparameterizing the network for optimization, focusing on capturing insights from Nesterov accelerated gradient within a Bayesian framework to suggest improved methods. It highlights the link between the approach and Nesterov accelerated gradient, with updates similar to standard momentum. The key difference between momentum and Nesterov accelerated gradient is where the gradient is evaluated. Nesterov accelerated gradient evaluates the gradient at a \"predicted\" location, while Bayesian filtering requires evaluating the gradient at a prior location. This suggests using updates based on Nesterov accelerated gradient rather than standard momentum."
