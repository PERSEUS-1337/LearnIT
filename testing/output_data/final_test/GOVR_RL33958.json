    "content": "Most animal agriculture products are not eligible for federal price and income support programs like major crops. Meat and poultry producers rarely seek assistance, except for ad hoc aid after natural disasters. They do not qualify for federal crop insurance, but some cattle and hog producers in certain states participate in livestock revenue insurance programs. Animal agriculture relies on the government for resolving trade disputes and establishing rules for importing and exporting products. The 2007-2008 farm bill addressed various animal-related provisions, including regulations for livestock and poultry markets. The legislation aimed to ensure the safety, quality, and disease-free nature of animal products for domestic and foreign buyers. Public policy concerns also focused on environmental protection, food safety, and animal welfare in animal agriculture. The final version of the 2007-2008 farm bill included provisions such as permitting state-inspected meat and poultry products to enter interstate commerce, bringing catfish under mandatory USDA inspection, and modifying the country-of-origin labeling law. Amendments were also made to protect companion animals under the Animal Welfare Act. Additionally, a new disaster assistance trust fund was created to aid livestock producers affected by weather events. The final version of the 2007-2008 farm bill included provisions for state-inspected meat and poultry products to enter interstate commerce, mandatory USDA inspection for catfish, and modifications to the country-of-origin labeling law. A new disaster assistance trust fund was established to help livestock producers impacted by weather disasters, with a focus on the economic significance of animal production in the U.S. agriculture industry. The beef, pork, and poultry industries in North America are becoming more economically integrated, with Canada and Mexico supplying live animals to feeding operations and processing plants. This trend is happening as feed costs rise due to global demand for grains, higher fuel costs, and government promotion of ethanol. The United States is a world leader in meat and poultry production, with a growing reliance on international trade. The share of U.S. domestic production exported in the animal sector has significantly increased over the past 35 years. Broiler meat exports grew from 1.3% in 1970 to nearly 16.2% in 2007. Pork exports increased from 1.3% to 14.3%, and beef exports climbed from 0.2% in 1970 to 9.6% in 2003. Beef exports dropped in 2004 due to BSE cases but gradually rebuilt to 5.4% in 2007, presenting new challenges despite the U.S.'s dominant world player status. The United States has been a dominant player in world trade of beef, veal, pork, broilers, and turkey. However, reliance on exports brings new challenges as other countries compete for the same markets. Export sales efforts can be reversed by animal disease outbreaks, leading to market restrictions that take years to regain. Countries may impose sanitary standards affecting U.S. imports, causing disputes over scientific principles and international violations. The United States faces challenges in international trade due to disputes over scientific principles and violations of trade rules. Examples include delays in reopening borders for U.S. beef and the EU's refusal to accept beef treated with growth hormones. Efforts are being made to resolve these issues and adapt to changes in animal agriculture towards larger operations. The trend in animal agriculture in the United States is moving towards fewer and larger operations, with smaller cow-calf operations still holding a majority of cattle. Larger feedlots in the middle part of the country market the majority of fed cattle. Live hog production has also undergone significant changes in the past 25 years. Live hog production in the U.S. has shifted towards fewer and larger operations over the past 25 years. The number of farms with hogs has drastically decreased, with operations with at least 10,000 hogs now accounting for over half of total U.S. hog output. The average hog farm now specializes in a single stage of production, such as finishing, and there are about 30 key firms in the industry. Iowa, southern Minnesota, and North Carolina are key areas for hog production. In North Carolina, cattle and hog producers sell to fewer packers, with recent concentration levels resembling those of the early 1900s. Vertical integration and coordination are more common in the livestock and poultry sectors today, with supply chains managing the transformation of livestock to meat. This business model was pioneered by the poultry industry after World War II. The poultry industry led the way in integrating and controlling costs post-World War II, with the hog industry following suit. Contract production arrangements with large integrators are now common, reducing cash transactions at auction barns in favor of long-term business agreements. Agricultural contracts and alternative marketing arrangements are used to facilitate these relationships. In 2003, contracts covered 47% of all livestock production value, up from 33% in 1991-93. Alternative marketing arrangements (AMAs) include forward contracts, marketing agreements, production contracts, and more. Cash transactions are immediate, while AMAs provide alternatives to the cash market. A study funded by USDA's GIPSA describes various AMAs in livestock transactions. The study by RTI International found that AMAs accounted for a significant portion of livestock volume sold to packers between 2002 and 2005. In the beef sector, the majority of cattle were obtained through cash market transactions, with packer ownership of livestock being less common. Cash market transactions were noted to be important for small producers and packers. Cash prices are commonly used as the basis for pricing livestock and meat in the cash market and AMA purchases. Critics argue that consolidation and vertical control have allowed a few industry players to dominate markets, weakening farmers' negotiating power. Structural changes in animal agriculture are seen as positive due to technological advancements and changing consumer demands. Federal laws like the Packers and Stockyards Act ensure market competitiveness. The Packers and Stockyards Act (P&S Act) of 1921 prohibits anti-competitive practices in meat and poultry markets. The Agricultural Fair Practices Act (AFPA) protects farmers from retaliation by handlers. The Sherman and Clayton Acts also address anti-competitive behavior. The Act prohibits certain activities like mergers and acquisitions that restrict market access. The Capper - Volstead Act provides limited antitrust liability exemption for farmer cooperatives. Producers express concerns about \"captive supply\" when packers own or commit to animals before slaughter, affecting market transparency and disadvantaging producers. Some argue that packers owning or controlling livestock disadvantages producers. Legislation to ban packer ownership was considered in the 110th Congress. Opponents claim a ban could reverse efficiency gains and limit marketing options for producers. Interest groups advocate for stronger enforcement against price manipulation. The Department's Office of Inspector General found that GIPSA has not effectively overseen its investigative activities, leading to a lack of enforcement of existing laws. Proposed solutions include creating a new USDA Counsel to investigate violations and establishing an Agriculture Competition Task Force. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the AFPA to address contracting inequities between agricultural producers and buyers. Proposed amendments aim to tackle concerns about agricultural consolidation, where few processor-buyers impose unfavorable contract terms on producers, forcing them out of business. Small farm advocates have filed lawsuits challenging anticompetitive behavior under the P&S Act and other laws. Advocates have called for a competition title in a new farm bill to strengthen antitrust authorities and provide contract protections for farmers. Opponents argue that contracting arrangements ensure a steady supply of animals and allow for necessary price adjustments. Proposed changes could also negatively impact producers. The final farm bill includes a new Livestock title that scales back regulations on livestock and poultry markets. Provisions such as prohibiting major packers from owning livestock and establishing a Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition were deleted. Title XI of the bill changes definitions of associations and handlers under the AFPA. The final farm bill includes changes to regulations on livestock and poultry markets. Senate provisions to strengthen USDA oversight and enforcement were removed, but an annual report on P&SA violations was added. Contractual arrangements between producers and integrators were also narrowed down, giving growers the right to cancel contracts within three days. The possibility of additional capital investments by contractors was addressed in the conference language. The conference bill includes provisions for additional capital investments in contracts, along with protections for producers in disputing contract terms. Senator Harkin's bill, S. 622, served as the basis for developing the competition title in the new farm bill, although many of its provisions were not retained in the final version. During the farm bill debate, Senator Grassley introduced bills that would have prohibited meat packers from owning or feeding livestock, with exceptions. The bills also proposed establishing a USDA Special Counsel for Competition Matters, a Deputy Attorney General for Agricultural Antitrust Matters, and an Agriculture Competition Task Force. Some provisions from these bills were included in the Senate-passed farm bill. The packer ban would have applied to certain packers based on their annual cattle slaughter numbers. The House version of S. 622, introduced by Representative Boswell, included a provision on arbitration clauses in livestock and poultry contracts. However, other elements of the bill were not included in the draft forwarded to the full committee. The arbitration provision directed USDA to establish regulatory standards for arbitration provisions in livestock and poultry contracts. The House-passed bill included a provision on arbitration clauses in livestock and poultry contracts, allowing producers to seek relief in small claims court regardless of the contract's arbitration clause. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 has long collected livestock and meat price information, disseminated through various reports to provide accurate market information. Congress passed the Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act in 1999 to address concerns about the voluntary system. The Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 1999 aimed to address concerns about the voluntary system not working due to increased private marketing arrangements. Producers had difficulty determining fair market prices. Despite initial opposition, a consensus was reached for a mandatory reporting law, supported by packers, processors, and importers meeting specific slaughter thresholds. The Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 1999 requires packers and importers to report data on cattle, hogs, and lambs. Penalties are in place for non-compliance. The program collects and publishes data on a daily basis, covering a significant portion of the meat market. It was extended through September 30, 2010, with minor changes. The Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 1999 was extended through September 30, 2010 with minor changes. The new farm bill includes a USDA study on the economic impacts of pork product sales and improvements in electronic reporting. The Senate version proposed a new program for daily product information reporting for dairy products and changes to the swine reporting program. The House bill did not include any changes to the current program. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for inspecting meat and poultry for safety and proper labeling. Federal inspectors are present in slaughter plants and establishments processing meat and poultry products. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of other human foods, including seafood, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The controversial farm bill issue debated whether to lift the ban on interstate shipment of state-inspected meat and poultry products. Proponents argued that state inspection programs were already on par with federal standards. Advocates for change argued that foreign plants operating under USDA-approved programs should not be treated less fairly than U.S. plants. They claimed that foreign programs were not as closely scrutinized as state programs. Opponents believed that state-inspected products did not have the same level of safety oversight as federal or foreign plants. The debate on food safety issues in the farm bill includes concerns about the safety of state-inspected meat and poultry compared to federally inspected products. Other issues raised include the notification of agencies about adulterated products, clearer recall authorities, safety of meat and milk from cloned animals, and the need for a potential overhaul of the U.S. food safety system. Provisions in the farm bill address some of these concerns, such as permitting interstate shipment of state-inspected products under certain conditions. A new program in the farm bill would allow state-inspected plants with 25 or fewer employees to opt into a federally directed but state-operated inspection program, enabling them to ship interstate. States would receive at least 60% reimbursement of their costs. This provision is a compromise acceptable to both opponents and supporters of House farm bill language. The House farm bill language allowed state-inspected plants to apply for interstate shipment, causing concerns about leaving federal oversight. The provisions were adapted from companion bills introduced by Representative Pomeroy and Senator Hatch. Other bills aimed to strike interstate bans in the FMIA and PPIA. Senate provisions on food safety, such as Reportable Meat and Poultry Registries, were also addressed. The conference substitute in the Senate bill requires USDA to establish \"reportable food registries\" for meat and poultry products to report potential health risks. Meat and poultry establishments must notify USDA of any adulterated or misbranded products entering commerce and maintain written recall plans. Additionally, new USDA initiatives include a voluntary grading program for domestic catfish and mandatory safety inspection by FSIS. The final version of the bill establishes a voluntary catfish grading program and extends mandatory inspection to catfish processors. The amendment does not cover other fish and shellfish, but the Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to add species if needed. Imported catfish must meet USDA regulations before being imported into the United States. The Senate bill included provisions for a Congressional Bipartisan Food Safety Commission to report on modernizing food programs, but this was deleted. FDA had requested companies to refrain from marketing meat and milk from cloned animals until a final safety assessment was completed, but a provision in the Senate bill regarding this was also deleted. The market impacts of introducing products from cloned animals include the requirement for country-of-origin labeling for fresh beef, pork, and lamb. This labeling was initially set to be in place by September 30, 2004, but was delayed for two years by the FY2004 consolidated appropriations act. The implementation of country-of-origin labeling (COOL) for meats, produce, and peanuts was postponed multiple times by Congress, reflecting lawmakers' differing opinions on the need for a federally mandated labeling program. Proponents argued that mandatory COOL would give U.S. products a competitive advantage and strengthen demand and prices for domestic foods. Supporters of the COOL law argued for the right of U.S. consumers to know the origin of their food, especially with increasing food imports and safety concerns. They believed it was unfair to exempt meats and produce from country labeling, as almost all other imported products require it. Opponents of mandatory COOL included the American Meat Institute, the Food Marketing Institute, and producer groups. Opponents of COOL argue that labeling is unnecessary and could increase costs for importers. They believe that food safety issues can arise from domestic sources as well as imports, and that all food imports already meet U.S. safety standards. The final farm bill includes compromise language to address differences between COOL supporters and opponents. It directs the implementation of COOL starting October 1, 2008, and extends labeling to goat meat, chicken, ginseng, pecans, and macadamia nuts. Critics argue that the costs of implementing COOL outweigh the benefits, with estimated costs of $3.9 billion in the first year and $458 million annually. The 2008 farm law introduces new label categories to simplify compliance for the meat and poultry industries. COOL restricts the use of the U.S.A. country of origin label to meats from animals exclusively born, raised, or slaughtered in the United States. Retailers can designate meat products with multiple countries of origin. Ground meat products must list all countries of origin. The 2008 farm law introduces new label categories to simplify compliance for the meat and poultry industries. Ground meat products must list all countries of origin, including \"reasonably possible\" countries. Provisions aim to ease industry record-keeping for COOL, extend penalties to suppliers, and debate continues on whether animal producers should keep detailed records on their animals' identity and whereabouts. The potential threats of animal diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, brucellosis, and tuberculosis highlight the need for a universal animal identification program. The economic impacts of outbreaks, such as production losses and market closures, emphasize the importance of addressing animal health issues. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has the authority to implement such a program under the Animal Health Protection Act. The Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA) was adopted in the 2002 farm bill to monitor, control, and eradicate animal diseases. Despite efforts and funding, a universal U.S. animal identification system faces challenges in design and purpose. Questions remain about mandating animal ID, types of information collected, privacy of producer records, traceability of meat products, and other uses like food safety or labeling certification. The USDA envisions a voluntary universal system for animal identification involving federal, state, tribal, producer, and breed organizations. Conferees removed a provision from the Senate bill regarding the protection of trade secrets and confidential information. Other bills proposing animal health ID systems have not progressed in Congress. H.R. 1018 would prohibit a mandatory animal ID program and aim to protect producer privacy. H.R. 2301 and S. 1292 propose animal ID systems for livestock, poultry, and meat industries. H.R. 3485 also calls for a comprehensive traceability system. Lawmakers provide guidance through USDA appropriations. Farm animals are not covered by the Animal Welfare Act. The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) enforced by the Animal Care Division of APHIS regulates the treatment of warm-blooded animals in commercial sale, research, transportation, and public exhibition. Farm animals are covered by the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act and the Twenty-Eight Hour Law restricts the confinement of animals in vehicles. Lawmakers prefer voluntary approaches to farm animal care. Major food industry players are adopting humane animal care guidelines in response to customer demand. For example, McDonald's and Burger King have made changes. Smithfield announced a 10-year phase-out of individual gestation stalls for sows. Animal activists push for legislation to regulate on-farm animal activities, such as bills to prohibit horse slaughter for human food. The 2008 farm law amended the Animal Welfare Act to strengthen prohibitions on animal fighting activities and increase maximum imprisonment to five years. It also requires regulations prohibiting the importation for resale of animals. The final bill increases fines for Animal Welfare Act violations to $10,000 per violation and directs USDA to review expert recommendations on obtaining dogs and cats for research. Conferees omitted a provision to prohibit using live animals for marketing medical devices. Feed costs are a significant concern for livestock producers. Poultry producers are concerned about government policies affecting feed prices, such as crop supply control and conservation programs. The rapid growth of the U.S. ethanol industry, mainly using corn as feedstock, has led to increased corn usage for ethanol production. USDA estimates show a significant portion of the corn crop being used for ethanol, with expectations of further increases in the coming years. The increasing demand for corn due to ethanol production is driving up corn prices, leading to higher feed costs for livestock producers. USDA projects record feed costs for 2008, impacting profit margins for beef, dairy, pork, and poultry sectors. Rising feed costs are a concern for poultry producers, who worry about government policies affecting feed prices. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) expanded Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) for biofuels, increasing mandates from 9 billion to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Federal incentives include a tax credit for ethanol blending, an import tariff on ethanol, and grant programs for biofuels research. Distortions in protein-meal markets may arise due to increased production of distiller's dried grains (DDG) from ethanol processing. The ethanol processing by-product distiller's dried grains (DDG) with 30% protein content can substitute in certain feed markets. However, not all livestock species can adapt to increased DDG consumption. DDG must be dried before transport, adding to feed costs. Large-scale livestock producers may need to relocate near new feed sources, impacting regional economies. A Tufts University study offers a perspective on high feed prices. The study highlighted how leading U.S. meat companies benefited from years of low-priced feed, resulting in significant savings for the poultry and hog industries. This was due to U.S. agricultural policies that lowered prices for agricultural commodities. The agriculture committees included incentives for renewable fuels in their farm bills, such as cellulosic ethanol production. The new farm bill reduced the ethanol blender's tax credit to 45 cents per gallon for calendar 2009 and beyond. The import tariff on ethanol was extended for two more years. The import tariff on ethanol was extended for two more years, through calendar 2010. Federal crop insurance and emergency disaster loans are key policy tools to help mitigate financial losses for crop farmers due to natural disasters. Livestock losses are eligible for federal loans, but not for federal crop insurance, except under certain pilot programs. The USDA's Risk Management Agency enables producers to purchase income insurance protection for pasture, rangeland, and forage losses. Congress provides supplemental assistance for crop and livestock losses due to natural disasters. The federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized and was discussed for modifications in the 2007-2008 farm bill. Policymakers debated expanding the program or implementing a permanent disaster payment program. Some suggested cost reductions in the crop insurance program to fund new initiatives in the farm bill. The new farm bill includes a tax title creating an Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund for crop years 2008-2011, costing $3.8 billion. It introduces new programs for livestock disaster relief, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, Livestock Forage Disaster Program, and Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish. Up to $50 million from the Trust Fund is available for emergency relief to producers of these animals with losses due to adverse weather or other conditions. Some federal environmental laws exempt agriculture from regulations, but as animal agriculture intensifies, concerns about environmental impacts grow. Large feedlots are regulated under the Clean Water Act for managing manure to protect water quality and human health. Operations emitting air pollutants may fall under the Clean Air Act. Superfund regulations may also apply to address environmental concerns. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees play a role in addressing concerns about the applicability of Superfund to livestock and poultry operations. The 2008 farm bill extended the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) to provide financial and technical assistance to farmers, with 60% of funds going to livestock. The new bill extends EQIP through FY2012, increases budget authority, includes conservation practices for organic certification, allocates funds for air quality activities, and provides mandatory funding for agricultural water enhancement. The new law reduces the EQIP payment cap to $300,000 per person over six years, with USDA authority to allow up to $450,000 in special cases. Other conservation provisions include the Conservation Stewardship Program, Grasslands Reserve Program, and Wetlands Reserve Program."
