    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Retirement Savings for Working Americans Act\" and includes modifications to the Saver's Credit. The \"Retirement Savings for Working Americans Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to pay the full credit amount into designated retirement accounts of taxpayers. The \"Retirement Savings for Working Americans Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to deposit the full credit amount into designated retirement accounts of taxpayers for the taxable year. This includes accounts or plans where qualified retirement savings contributions are considered, designated by the taxpayer on their tax return, and accept the required payment. The credit determined under subsection (a) cannot be used as a credit against any tax imposed by this title. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code includes a 50 percent applicable percentage for the tax credit, which is subject to reduction based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The reduction cannot go below zero and is calculated based on the phaseout range. The reduction under this paragraph is rounded to the nearest multiple of 1 percent. The applicable dollar amount and phaseout range are determined according to a specific table. The phaseout for different filing statuses is as follows:\n- Joint return: $60,000 with a $10,000 range\n- Head of a household: $45,000 with a $7,500 range\n- Any other case: $30,000 with a $5,000 range. The amendment allows contributions to education savings accounts to be treated as retirement savings contributions. Additionally, there is an inflation adjustment for retirement contributions taken into account. Beginning in a calendar year after 2007, dollar amounts in subsection (a) will be increased by a cost-of-living adjustment determined for that year. Any increase will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $100. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the Code. Section 30D of the Code will have its heading amended to read as follows: \"and 24''. Section 30D, also known as the Saver's Credit, is being amended to change the language regarding the tax credit allowed for the taxable year. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007."
