    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 6604 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to subject proposed projects for partial removal of offshore oil structures to the California Environmental Quality Act. The commission will be the lead agency for environmental reviews. Section 6612 outlines the process for determining the completeness of applications for offshore oil structure removal. Upon determination of a complete application, the applicant must provide financial assurances to ensure funding for environmental review, net environmental benefit determination, cost savings determination, management plan preparation, and ongoing maintenance of the structure. The department consults with relevant agencies to develop a spending plan for activities required by the article, including reviewing applications, approving projects, and conducting environmental assessments. Funds provided for these activities are not considered in cost savings calculations or apportionment. The first applicant after January 1, 2011, to remove an offshore oil structure under this chapter must pay startup costs incurred by the department or commission. Prospective applicants can pay a portion of these costs before filing an application. The department will reimburse these startup costs as outlined in Section 6618. The lead agency initiates environmental review once financial assurances are provided by the applicant. The applicant can withdraw the application before final approval, and any unspent funds will be returned. The council determines if partial removal of offshore oil structures benefits the marine environment compared to full removal. The council establishes criteria for evaluating the net environmental benefit of full and partial removal of offshore oil structures based on credible science. Criteria include depth of partially removed structure as habitat and proximity to other reefs, excluding consideration of funds generated by partial removal. The council consults with various entities to establish criteria for determining the net environmental benefit of partial removal of offshore structures. They consider factors like the structure's contribution to marine life protection and productivity. The council evaluates the environmental impacts and benefits of full versus partial removal of offshore structures, including effects on biological resources, water and air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and marine environment management requirements. They consider the best available credible information to determine the appropriate weight for their decision. The council evaluates environmental impacts of offshore structure removal, considering air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and biological resources. Cost savings benefits are not included in net environmental benefit determination. The council may collaborate with other entities for assistance. The determination submitted to the department is final and cannot be revised except by the council. Timely completion is prioritized to align with the department's schedule. Section 6614 of the Fish and Game Code is amended. Upon certification of environmental documents, the commission will determine cost savings from partial offshore oil structure removal compared to full removal. The commission will ensure accurate calculation of cost savings by collaborating with other agencies or experts. The commission will consider estimates of cost savings from various governmental agencies and provide a written explanation for any differences. The applicant must provide necessary documentation for the commission to calculate cost savings, and the determination made by the commission will be final and cannot be revised except by the commission. Failure to provide requested information may result in rejection of the application. Prior to granting conditional approval of an application for partial removal of an offshore oil structure, the department must prepare a plan to manage the structure post-removal, including measures to protect marine life and fisheries. Management measures may include a restricted buffer zone. The department must prepare a plan for managing an offshore oil structure post-removal, including measures to protect marine life and fisheries. Public comment and hearings are required under the California Environmental Quality Act for the application. The department may grant conditional approval for partial removal if it complies with relevant laws. The federal laws and programs relevant to offshore oil structure removal include the National Fishing Enhancement Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, California Coastal Management Program, Marine Life Management Act, Marine Life Protection Act, water quality laws, and navigational safety laws. Partial removal of offshore oil structures can benefit the marine environment, cost savings from conversion have been assessed, and sufficient funds have been provided by the applicant. The applicant has provided sufficient funds for overall management of the structure by the department, including ongoing operations, maintenance, monitoring, and enforcement. The department has an indemnification agreement with the applicant to protect against liability, including active negligence, defending the state, and paying any resulting judgments. The agreement can take the form of insurance, cash settlement, or other mechanisms determined by the department. The department will consult with the office of the Attorney General in preparing and entering into the agreement. The applicant must obtain all necessary permits and approvals from governmental agencies for the proposed project, including a lease from the commission for state tidelands. For structures in federal waters, agreements with the department, permits from the Army Corps of Engineers, and approval for partial removal from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement are required. Section 6618 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to specify the apportionment and transmission of cost savings from the partial removal of offshore oil structures. The applicant is required to transmit a portion of the cost savings to the department based on specified percentages, depending on the date of transmission. Upon conditional approval, the applicant must pay a portion of startup costs before filing the first application to partially remove an offshore oil structure. They must transmit a portion of cost savings to the department based on specified percentages: 55% before January 1, 2017, 65% between January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2023, and 80% after January 1, 2023. If the department's final approval for partial removal of an offshore oil structure is invalidated, the applicant must carry out full removal and will receive a prompt return of cost savings. Upon final judicial decisions upholding the department's approval for partial removal of an offshore oil structure, funds will be distributed to the California Endowment for Marine Preservation and the General Fund. Two percent of funds from offshore oil structure removal will be deposited into the Fish and Game Preservation Fund for costs and conservation efforts. (4) Two percent of funds from offshore oil structure removal will be deposited into the Coastal Act Services Fund to support state agency work related to coastal management policies in state and federal waters.\n(5) One percent will be given to the county adjacent to the facility for management in accordance with the Public Resources Code."
