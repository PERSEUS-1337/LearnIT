Congress finds that opioid prescription rates have significantly increased, leading to a rise in overdose deaths involving heroin and cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The incidence of NAS has risen from 1.20 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 3.39 per 1,000 hospital births in 2009. The average cost of treating NAS in hospitals increased from $39,400 in 2000 to $53,400 in 2009, mostly covered by Medicaid. Preventing opioid abuse in pregnant women and childbearing age women is crucial. Medically appropriate opioid use during pregnancy is common, and addressing NAS effectively requires a focus on women of childbearing age, pregnant women, and infants. NAS can result from the use of prescription drugs. According to a Government Accountability Office report, more research is needed to optimize the identification and treatment of babies with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and to understand long-term impacts. The Department of Health and Human Services lacks a focal point to address prenatal opioid use and NAS effectively. The GAO report emphasizes the need to improve planning and coordination of Federal efforts on prenatal opioid use and NAS due to the increasing use of heroin and abuse of opioids for pain management. SEC. 3. Developing recommendations for preventing and treating prenatal opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, will conduct a study and develop recommendations for preventing and treating prenatal opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome. Input will be sought from various organizations, and a report with recommendations will be published on the Agency's website within a year of the Act's enactment. The study and report will assess existing research on neonatal abstinence syndrome, opioid use disorders among women of reproductive age, and barriers to treatment. The study will assess current practices in healthcare for pregnant women with opioid use disorders and infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, as well as recommendations for prevention and treatment. Pregnant women and individuals of reproductive age are at risk of opioid dependence. Improving prevention and treatment for prenatal opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The Secretary will lead a review of planning and coordination within the Department of Health and Human Services regarding prenatal opioid use and neonatal abstinence syndrome. A strategy will be developed to address research and program gaps, including treatment of pregnant women with opioid use disorders, management of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, and long-term effects of prenatal opioid exposure on children. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within a year of enacting the Act, detailing the findings of the review on prenatal opioid use and neonatal abstinence syndrome, as well as the strategy developed to address program gaps and coordination in federal efforts. Improving data on and public health response to neonatal abstinence syndrome. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide technical assistance to States to enhance data collection and surveillance of neonatal abstinence syndrome, including incidence, causes, demographics, and make the collected data publicly available online. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will encourage increased utilization of public health measures to reduce neonatal abstinence syndrome, with data publicly available online. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 8, 2015. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
