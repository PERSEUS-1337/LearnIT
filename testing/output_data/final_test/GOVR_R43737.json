    "content": "The increasing number of unaccompanied children arriving in the United States is raising policy questions, including implications for education. States and LEAs must provide equal access to education for all children, regardless of immigration status. Upon arrival, these children receive basic education services through HHS's ORR programs. Once released to a sponsor, they may enroll in local school systems. The report addresses federal support for schools enrolling unaccompanied alien children, including Title I-A Grants, English Language Acquisition Grants, and Part B Grants to States administered by the U.S. Department of Education. The report examines federal programs such as Title I-A Grants, English Language Acquisition Grants, and Part B Grants to States under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that could support unaccompanied alien children. It also discusses previously funded programs like the Emergency Immigrant Education Act and Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students. The report discusses the Refugee School Impact Aid program administered by ORR to support the education of refugee children. It also addresses the challenge of funding for LEAs and schools absorbing newly arriving unaccompanied children, highlighting the lack of local area data on the number of children released from ORR custody. Existing federal education programs administered by ED, such as Title I-A Grants, can be utilized to support the education of unaccompanied alien children. Title I-A Grants to LEAs, English Language Acquisition Grants under Title III-A, and Part B Grants to States under IDEA are key programs for serving unaccompanied alien children. These federal programs provide educational aid and services to disadvantaged students from pre-kindergarten to grade 12. Title I-A grants provide educational aid and services to low-achieving students in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 schools with high concentrations of low-income families. The program received $14.4 billion in funding for FY2014 and is allocated by the U.S. Department of Education to state educational agencies, which then distribute grants to local educational agencies. Funding is allocated under four different formulas and used for various purposes by recipient LEAs. Title I-A funds are allocated to local educational agencies based on formulas using estimated numbers of children in poor families and state expenditure factors. These funds are used to provide educational services to students in public schools with high percentages of low-income families. Schools must meet certain criteria to participate, such as having a greater percentage of low-income students than the LEA's average. LEAs can choose to focus services on specific grade levels. Title I-A funds are allocated to schools with high percentages of low-income families. Schools can choose to focus services on specific grade levels, but must provide services in all schools where over 75% of students are from low-income families. Funds are allocated based on the number of low-income students. There are two types of programs: schoolwide programs for schools with 40% or more low-income students, and targeted assistance programs for specific students. The original Title I-A program provides targeted assistance to the lowest achieving students in schools. Services include intensive instruction by specialist teachers, after-school programs, or teacher's aides. Unaccompanied alien children may immediately be eligible for services if enrolled in a Title I-A funded school. Low-income students may eventually be included in data used for Title I-A grants. Title III-A program provides support for limited English proficient (LEP) students, including immigrant students, to achieve English proficiency and academic success. The program received $723 million in FY2014, with grant allocations to states based on the proportion of LEP and immigrant students. Formula grants are weighted by 80% for LEP students and 20% for immigrant students. The Title III-A program allocates funds to states based on the number of LEP and immigrant students, with grants weighted 80% for LEP students and 20% for immigrant students. States then distribute subgrants to eligible entities based on the number of LEP students in schools served. States can reserve up to 15% of funds for entities with a significant increase in immigrant students. States have the discretion to increase this percentage if needed. Recent immigrant students can benefit from funds allocated for immigrant students and LEP students. The funds allocated for immigrant students and English Language Acquisition program focus on increasing English proficiency and academic achievement. Subgrants must be used for instructional programs and professional development for LEP students. Immigrant student funds support activities for immigrant students. Increasing funds specifically for immigrant students to support enhanced instructional opportunities. Options include increasing overall program appropriation, raising the 15% cap on reserved funds for LEAs with more immigrant students, or changing the formula for state grant allocations. One option to address funding disparities for immigrant students is to adjust the formula used for state grant allocations under IDEA Part B. This could result in some states receiving more funding while others receive less. IDEA Part B provides federal funding for the education of children with disabilities, ensuring the provision of a free appropriate public education. To be covered under IDEA, a child with a disability must meet categorical definitions and require special education services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP). Unaccompanied alien children must be evaluated by the LEA to determine eligibility for IDEA services. Unaccompanied alien children must be evaluated by the LEA to determine eligibility for IDEA services. If they meet the IDEA eligibility criteria, they are eligible for services. Additionally, there are federal education programs that can assist LEAs in meeting the needs of recent immigrant students, including programs that focus on immigrant students or provide aid for schools experiencing an influx of students. The English Language Acquisition program was established under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 to assist LEAs with large increases in immigrant student populations. It aimed to provide quality instruction, aid in their transition into American society, and help them meet state performance standards. Immigrant children and youth aged 3-21 were the focus of the program. The EIEA program provided formula grants to states based on their share of immigrant children enrolled in public schools. Only students in LEAs with a significant number of immigrant children were included in the grant calculation. Funds had to be used for enhanced instructional opportunities. The EIEA program provided formula grants to states based on their share of immigrant children enrolled in public schools for enhanced instructional opportunities. A comparable program could be developed for recent immigrant students, but funds reserved for immigrant students under the English Language Acquisition program may already be addressing this need. Section 107 of P.L. 109-148 authorized the Secretary of Education to award Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students Grants to SEAs for students displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Aid was provided on a per-student basis, with a maximum of $6,000 per student. The Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students Grants provided funding up to $7,500 per displaced student served under IDEA, Part B. Awards were proportionately reduced if funds were insufficient. LEAs and eligible BIA-funded schools could use the funds to assist displaced students in the 2005-2006 school year. LEAs in areas with displaced students in nonpublic schools had to deposit funds into student accounts, which nonpublic schools could access for authorized uses. Nonpublic schools had to waive or reimburse tuition as needed. The Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students program provided $645 million in FY2006, with an additional $235 million from P.L. 109-234. Funds were used for personnel compensation, curricular materials, classroom supplies, and basic instructional services for displaced students in 49 states and the District of Columbia. The Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students program provided funds for educational services, transportation, health services, and support services for displaced students in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Funds could not be used for construction or major renovations, and were temporary for the 2005-2006 school year. SEAs were required to notify parents of displaced students about enrollment options in public or non-public schools. The Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students program in 2005-2006 allowed federal funds to be used by non-public schools for religious instruction and materials. Parents could request funds for their child, who had the option to opt out of religious activities. There was no prohibition on funds being used for religious activities on a schoolwide basis. A program could be developed to support unaccompanied alien children in schools, with the ORR responsible for determining eligibility and placement. Decisions on program structure, funding levels, duration, and eligibility for IDEA services would need to be made. Funding could be provided for children in public or private schools. The Refugee School Impact Aid program provides funding for unaccompanied alien children who receive asylum. Established in 1980, this program offers special impact aid to LEAs for the education of refugee children, including Cuban, Haitian, and Indochinese children. The ORR's Refugee School Impact Aid program granted $15 million in FY2012 for activities aimed at the effective integration and education of refugee children. The ORR's Refugee School Impact Aid program provided $15 million in FY2012 to assist local school systems with refugee children. Only 108 unaccompanied alien children received asylum in the US by the third quarter of FY2014, with most cases from prior years. Congress would need to amend the law to include more unaccompanied alien children for the program to be a major funding source. Congress may need to consider amending the provision to include unaccompanied alien children temporarily released to a parent or sponsor by ORR for the Refugee Education Assistance Act. Providing funds to LEAs for newly arriving unaccompanied children is challenging due to a lack of local area data. ORR has started releasing state-level data on unaccompanied alien children released to sponsors, with the most complete data available from January 1, 2014, to July 31, 2014, showing 37,477 children released during this period. A total of 37,477 unaccompanied alien children were released between January 1, 2014, and July 31, 2014. Texas, New York, California, and Florida were the main states hosting these children. Six counties received over 1,000 children each during this period: Harris, TX; Los Angeles, CA; Suffolk, NY; Miami-Dade, FL; Nassau, NY; and Fairfax, VA."
