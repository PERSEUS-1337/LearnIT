    "content": "The federal government supports career and technical education through the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (Perkins III). The act was reauthorized and amended by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV). The House and Senate versions of the legislation were introduced in 2005, with the House passing H.R. 366 by a vote of 416 to 9. The legislation, initially introduced as S. 250 in 2005, went through various stages in both the Senate and House before being signed into law as P.L. 109-270 on August 12, 2006. Key steps included the Senate passing S. 250 by a vote of 99 to 0, the House substituting H.R. 366 for the Senate version, and the President signing the bill after both chambers agreed to the conference report. The report analyzes changes in funding formulas, accountability requirements, state and local plans, tech-prep program, and general provisions of the bill, notably regarding private school student participation in career and technical education programs. Table 1 provides a comparison of key changes made by Perkins IV, with detailed discussions in subsequent sections. The act provides funding to eligible agencies and recipients. An eligible agency, as defined by P.L. 109-270, is the state board responsible for career and technical education oversight. Eligible recipients, such as local educational agencies and higher education institutions, receive funding for CTE programs leading to industry-recognized credentials. Perkins IV amends the Perkins Act, authorizing funding for CTE programs from FY2007-FY2012. The focus is on CTE rather than vocational education, with technical changes made while retaining the overall structure of the Perkins Act. P.L. 109-270 retains the structure of the Perkins Act, with Title I focusing on assistance to states for career and technical education, Title II authorizing the tech-prep program, and Title III containing general provisions. Section 9 authorizes appropriations for Title I, except for specific sections with separate authorizations. Perkins IV, under P.L. 109-270, makes changes to reservations of funds for certain purposes, including reducing assistance for outlying areas from 0.2% to 0.13% due to changes in eligibility. Additionally, the amount of direct grants to outlying areas is increased under Section 115. Under P.L. 109-270, changes in Perkins IV include increasing direct grants to outlying areas. Guam now receives $660,000, while American Samoa and the Northern Marianas each receive $350,000. Remaining funds are divided equally among the three areas in subsequent years. Palau receives a direct grant of $160,000. Assistance for Indians and Native Hawaiians remains unchanged under Section 116. The reservation for incentive grants has been repealed under Perkins IV, with funds now distributed to states based on the State Allotment Formula. Over 98% of funds under Section 9 are allotted to states using a formula based on population groups and adjusted by states' per capita income. Perkins IV maintains the state allotment formula from Perkins III unless additional funds are available. The state allotment formula under Perkins IV is based on population groups and adjusted by states' per capita income. States with growing populations will receive increased grants, while states at their FY1998 grant amounts will continue to receive the same. P.L. 109-270 modifies the formula when there are \"additional funds\" available above the FY2006 funding level. The state allotment formula under Perkins IV is based on population groups and adjusted by states' per capita income. States with growing populations will receive increased grants, while states at their FY1998 grant amounts will continue to receive the same. P.L. 109-270 modifies the formula when there are \"additional funds\" available above the FY2006 funding level. Funds allotted to states for FY2006, plus the amount set-aside for incentive grants and $827,671, ensure that funds previously reserved for outlying areas no longer eligible for funding are not considered \"additional funds.\" Table 3 illustrates how \"additional funds\" would be calculated assuming a 1% overall increase in FY2006 appropriations under Section 9. The FY2006 \"base\" amount is $1.163 billion, with any excess funds considered new money. In Table 3, the additional funds amount to $11.631 million. Up to one-third of the additional funds would be allotted to states with grants below the minimum amount. These qualifying states include Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. The \"additional funds\" for qualifying states (Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming) would be allotted based on how much below the minimum grant amount each state's FY2006 grant is. None of these states could receive more than the minimum grant amount of \u00bd% of the current amount allotted to states. The remaining funds would be distributed to other states based on the underlying formula, ensuring no state receives a grant less than its FY1998 grant. The Perkins Act specifies how funds received by states must be allocated at the state and local levels. The Perkins Act specifies the percentage of funds reserved at the state and local levels, with states required to distribute at least 85% of grant funds to eligible recipients. States can reserve up to 10% for rural areas and high-need career and technical education students. They have discretion in allocating funds for secondary and postsecondary career and technical education. Additionally, states can reserve up to 5% for administrative purposes. P.L. 109-270 requires states to match administrative funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis and allows up to 10% of the state grant for state leadership functions. Perkins IV specifies substate formulas for distribution of grant funds to eligible recipients based on Pell grant and Bureau of Indian Affairs recipients. The distribution for postsecondary institutions remains unchanged, while the substate formula for secondary school CTE funds has been altered. P.L. 109-270 changes the substate formula for distributing funds for secondary school CTE programs, but this change is not expected to have a practical impact. Previously, funds were distributed based on population and poverty data for ages 15 to 19, but now states can use data for ages 5 to 17 at the school district level. P.L. 109-270 codifies the distribution of funds for secondary education programs based on school districts' shares of resident population ages 5 to 17 and shares of residents ages 5 to 17 from poor families. Section 114 of the Perkins Act authorizes national programs and activities for vocational education. Perkins IV includes an independent advisory panel for evaluating CTE programs funded under the act. Perkins IV mandates a detailed assessment of CTE programs, including teacher qualifications, student achievement, integration of academic and technical education, and preparation for math and science-related occupations. An interim report must be submitted to Congress by January 1. The Secretary must submit an interim report to Congress by January 1, 2010, and a final report by July 1, 2011. A single national research center focused on conducting research to address the education, employment, and training needs of CTE participants must be established. The research should also aim to improve the implementation of CTE programs aligned with challenging academic standards and enhance the preparation and professional development of CTE staff. Perkins IV authorizes funding for state-designated entities to support the recruitment and retention of CTE staff. These entities are designated by the Governor and state agency overseeing CTE. The state application process requires submission of an application to the Secretary along with the state plan. The application must include required information and trends based on the Wagner-Peyser Act. Perkins IV also modifies state-level activities under Section 118. Perkins IV brings changes to state-level activities under Section 118, emphasizing career and occupational decision making programs for students and parents. It also strengthens accountability requirements and sanctions for failing to meet them. The changes under Section 123 of Perkins IV include specifying core indicators of performance for secondary and postsecondary levels, linking them to ESEA, requiring recipients to meet adjusted performance levels or negotiate them with the agency, disaggregating data for reporting, setting a 90% performance target, and allowing the Secretary to withhold funds for lack of progress. Perkins IV establishes core indicators of performance for secondary levels, requiring agencies and recipients to establish measures for each indicator. The indicators are similar to Perkins III but include modifications linked to ESEA. Funds can be withheld from agencies or recipients for lack of progress, with the requirement that withheld funds be used to provide services to students. Perkins was last reauthorized in 1998 before the new requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. Perkins IV requires eligible agencies to include measures of student attainment of challenging academic content standards and career and technical skill proficiencies in their core indicators of performance. These standards must be adopted by the state under Title I-A of the ESEA. Student attainment of these standards must be based on state proficiency levels for assessments in math, language arts, and science. Perkins IV requires eligible agencies to measure student attainment of career and technical skill proficiencies, aligned with industry standards. They must also measure student rates of attaining a high school diploma, GED credential, or equivalent, including alternative standards for individuals with disabilities. Additionally, states must measure student rates of attaining a proficiency credential, certificate, or degree in conjunction with a secondary school. Perkins IV requires measuring student attainment of career and technical skill proficiencies, high school diploma or equivalent, and proficiency credential in conjunction with a secondary school diploma. Only 17 states offer the option of earning a proficiency credential or degree alongside a high school diploma. Graduation rates are measured under Title I-A of the ESEA, excluding students who take longer to graduate or earn alternative diplomas. Perkins III did not have a similar performance indicator. Perkins IV requires measuring student attainment of career and technical skill proficiencies, high school diploma or equivalent, and proficiency credential in conjunction with a secondary school diploma. The eligible agency must measure student placement in postsecondary education or advanced training, placement in military service, and placement in employment, as well as student participation in and completion of CTE programs leading to employment in non-traditional fields. Perkins IV includes five core indicators of performance at the postsecondary level, with measures required for each indicator. Perkins IV emphasizes measuring student achievement on technical assessments aligned with industry standards, completion of industry-recognized credentials or degrees, retention in postsecondary education, and placement in military service or employment. It is more specific than Perkins III, requiring measures of student transfers and apprenticeship placement. Perkins IV expands on measuring student achievement by including placement in apprenticeship programs and high-skill, high-wage, or high-demand occupations. Eligible agencies and recipients must negotiate performance levels for core indicators, similar to Perkins III. Perkins IV requires eligible agencies to negotiate performance levels for core indicators with the Secretary, taking into account characteristics of participants and services offered to promote continuous improvement. Recipients must also establish performance levels in their local plans. Eligible recipients can accept state-adjusted performance levels or negotiate new local levels. The agreement must consider characteristics of participants and services to promote continuous improvement. Annual reports on progress must be submitted to the Secretary. Perkins IV requires eligible recipients to submit annual reports on their performance indicators to the Secretary. Data must be disaggregated by various student categories, and any discrepancies in performance must be identified. States failing to meet 90% of adjusted performance levels may face consequences. Under Perkins IV, states failing to meet 90% of adjusted performance levels must develop and implement a program improvement plan focusing on performance gaps among student categories. This is a change from Perkins III, where states only had to develop a plan if they missed their adjusted levels of performance in the aggregate. If the Secretary finds an eligible agency not meeting the goals of the act, action may be taken. If an eligible agency is not meeting the goals of the act, the Secretary may provide technical assistance for improvement. Failure to implement required improvement plans or meet performance indicators may result in funding withholding after a hearing. This differs from Perkins III sanctions. Perkins IV allows the Secretary to sanction agencies for not meeting performance levels, withholding funds for technical assistance and improvement plans. Funds withheld cannot be redistributed to other agencies. Waivers for financial sanctions are possible under exceptional circumstances. Under Perkins IV, eligible recipients must develop a program improvement plan if they fail to meet 90% of agreed upon performance levels. The plan must address performance gaps among student categories. In contrast, under Perkins III, agencies were required to assess educational needs and enter into improvement plans with recipients not making substantial progress. Under Perkins IV, eligible recipients must develop an improvement plan and undergo regular assessments to meet state performance levels. Agencies provide technical assistance to recipients failing to meet requirements. Financial sanctions may be imposed on recipients failing to show improvement, similar to those on agencies. Under Perkins IV, eligible recipients may have their funding withheld if they fail to improve on performance indicators or meet state performance levels for three consecutive years. Funds withheld must be used for student services in the same area. Financial sanctions can be waived in exceptional circumstances or if the recipient's CTE program size affects performance. Perkins IV allows funding withholding for eligible recipients who do not improve on performance indicators or meet state levels for three years. The Performance Measurement Initiative aims to develop new assessment measures for CTE programs to address data comparability issues. The Performance Measurement Initiative under Perkins IV aims to address data comparability issues by requiring valid and reliable measures of core indicators of performance from each state. This would allow for comparisons of individual state performance over time, even if data comparability among states is challenging due to varying definitions used. Eligible agencies must submit a state plan to the Secretary to receive funding under Section 122 of Perkins IV. Under Perkins IV, eligible agencies must submit a state plan to the Secretary covering a six-year period. Transition provisions allow agencies to submit a transition plan for the first fiscal year before submitting state plans for the remaining five years. The transition timeline includes submitting plans in April 2007, a transition year for data collection in 2007-2008, and establishing performance levels in Summer 2008. Perkins IV requires eligible agencies to consult with various parties when developing the state plan. The plan must include specific information and describe career and technical programs of study. Perkins IV modifies existing requirements and adds new ones. Key changes and additions to the plan contents are summarized. The eligible agency must detail how career and technical programs of study will be developed and implemented, assist recipients in creating articulation agreements, publicize programs offered, promote academic achievement and technical skill improvement, address occupational opportunities, prepare secondary students for graduation, and align CTE courses with academic standards. The eligible agency must ensure that best practices are shared among recipients, link academic and career education to improve achievement, report on the integration of CTE programs with state academic standards, and promote professional development to enhance teacher quality and student learning. The eligible agency must improve data use, integrate with professional development activities, enhance recruitment and retention of CTE faculty, facilitate student transitions, integrate CTE with academics, negotiate performance levels, ensure compliance with requirements, and report data. Significant changes include specifying CTE program elements and emphasizing academic achievement. CTE programs must align with academic standards and lead to industry credentials or degrees. State plans must show how funds will improve CTE courses aligned with academic standards. The eligible agency must align CTE courses with academic standards, including core academic subjects. States have the option to submit unified plans under the Workforce Investment Act or fulfill state plan requirements for basic state grants and tech-prep under Perkins IV. Perkins IV retains similar uses of state leadership funds as Perkins III. Perkins IV introduces new uses of state leadership funds, including professional development focused on research-based instruction and career guidance. It emphasizes high-quality, sustained training for teachers and staff to enhance academic and industry skills in CTE. Additionally, Perkins IV allows for transitions from subbaccalaureate programs and supports applied learning. The state leadership funds under Perkins IV support career guidance, academic counseling, technical skill assessments, data systems development, and CTE staff recruitment. Incentive grants are awarded for exceeding performance levels, integrating academic and technical content, and supporting innovative initiatives. Eligible agencies can also use funds to facilitate transitions from subbaccalaureate CTE programs to baccalaureate institutions. Under Perkins IV, eligible recipients must submit a local plan to the agency, covering a six-year period and integrating academic and technical skills aligned with challenging standards. The plan must also include provisions for improving CTE student outcomes. Under Perkins IV, eligible recipients must submit a local plan to the agency, covering a six-year period and integrating academic and technical skills aligned with challenging standards. The plan must also include provisions for improving CTE student outcomes, such as enrolling in rigorous courses, providing professional development, offering career and technical programs of study, improving recruitment and retention of CTE staff, and transitioning individuals from business and industry into CTE. Stipulated uses of funds for local recipients include both required and allowable expenses, with modifications from Perkins III. The Perkins IV local plan requires eligible recipients to integrate academic and technical skills aligned with challenging standards over a six-year period. Significant changes and new uses of funds include establishing linkages between academic subjects, secondary and postsecondary CTE, providing training for staff, and preparing special populations for high-demand occupations. New uses of funds allow for career and academic counseling, information on postsecondary education, and establishing local education and business partnerships. The funds provided can be used by local recipients to develop new CTE courses, establish partnerships with businesses, create articulation agreements for students, and support innovative initiatives for professional development. The Perkins Act allows eligible recipients to use up to 5% of funds for administrative costs. There was debate over integrating tech-prep into the basic state grants program, but a compromise was reached to allow tech-prep to remain separate with the option to combine funds with state grants. Perkins IV expands tech-prep programs to include coordination with other activities in the state plan, integration of technical skills and academic subjects, and work-based learning experiences. Tech-prep programs must provide technical preparation in a career field, lead to skill proficiency or credentials, and result in placement in further education or high-wage employment. They should also use CTE programs of study, articulation agreements, and offer professional development for teachers and counselors. Coordination with activities under Title I of the act is required. Perkins IV expands the permissible uses of tech-prep funds to include improving career guidance and academic counseling, developing curricula for transitions between secondary and postsecondary CTE programs. It also introduces accountability requirements and sanctions for tech-prep consortia, including reporting on performance indicators for tech-prep participants. The tech-prep funding under Perkins IV includes accountability requirements for consortia to report on performance indicators such as enrollment in postsecondary education, completion of credentials, and placement in related employment within 12 months of graduation. Tech-prep funding recipients must meet performance indicators and core indicators at secondary and postsecondary levels. Failure to meet performance levels for three consecutive years may result in reapplication or termination of funding. Perkins IV authorizes funding for tech-prep from FY2007-FY2012, but the demonstration program was not reauthorized. Perkins III allowed eligible agencies and recipients to include secondary education in their programs. Perkins IV modifies Perkins III by requiring eligible agencies and recipients to include private school personnel in career and technical education professional development activities upon written request. It also adds provisions for optional participation of secondary school students from nonprofit private schools in funded programs and activities. Perkins IV allows eligible recipients to request meaningful participation of secondary education students from nonprofit private schools in career and technical education programs funded under the act. Recipients must consult with private school representatives in a timely manner upon request."
