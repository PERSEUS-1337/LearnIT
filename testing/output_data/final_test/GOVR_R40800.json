    "content": "The federal government's role in the mortgage market is significant, dating back to the Depression era with the creation of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. These entities guarantee the majority of newly issued mortgage-backed securities, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac alone responsible for about 45% of residential mortgages. The residential mortgage market, with nearly $10 trillion in mortgages outstanding, is crucial for households and lenders. Additionally, other government agencies like FHA, Ginnie Mae, VA, and USDA play roles in the mortgage market. The government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ensure mortgage availability to creditworthy households by purchasing mortgages from lenders and pooling them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). They guarantee timely payment of principal and interest to investors, with an implicit federal backing. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered conservatorship under the FHFA due to mortgage delinquencies. Treasury has provided $116 billion to Fannie Mae and $72 billion to Freddie Mac to keep them solvent. The agreement may require up to an additional $125 billion for Fannie Mae and $149 billion for Freddie Mac. Treasury receives senior preferred stock in return for the financial support. The Treasury and Federal Reserve provided support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through senior preferred stock and MBS purchases. The Federal Reserve initiated a program to buy $45 billion of MBS monthly in 2012. Congress is discussing the future of federal control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The proposals aim to reduce government support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by selling off their assets and revoking their congressional charters. Some suggestions focus on replacing these institutions with new ones. The report delves into the roles of the GSEs and the government in supporting home mortgages, including purchasing mortgages from lenders, packaging them into MBS, and selling bonds to investors. The GSEs' bonds are considered safer due to their close ties to the federal government and implicit guarantee. The financial turmoil of 2008 led Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be placed under voluntary conservatorship with FHFA, akin to bankruptcy reorganization. Senior executives were replaced, and stockholders had no say in the company's management. The GSEs were placed under conservatorship to stabilize their financial situation, with the goal of eventually returning control to stockholders. If this is not possible, receivership may be necessary. The GSEs' mission has evolved over time, leading to debates in Congress about regulatory reform. The GSEs' mission has evolved over time, with current charters containing five purposes to stabilize the secondary mortgage market, increase liquidity, promote access to mortgage credit, and manage federally owned mortgage portfolios. They have fulfilled these goals except for operating with minimum loss to the federal government. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Both GSEs entered into voluntary conservatorship with FHFA, selling senior preferred stock to the Treasury. Treasury also received warrants to purchase common stock. Additionally, Treasury agreed to purchase up to $200 billion in senior preferred stock to maintain the GSEs' positive net worth. The amendments to the agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac increased support to $200 billion each, with unlimited assistance from 2010 to 2012. Quarterly profits are now paid to Treasury instead of a 10% cash dividend. The Federal Reserve provided financial assistance by purchasing MBS and bonds. Conservatorship will end with return to stockholder control if solvent, or receivership if unable to pay debts as per HERA provisions. The report discusses alternatives for restructuring or replacing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, considering their return to financial health and exit from conservatorship. Congress may need to address the profit-sweep dividend preventing accumulation of funds for stockholder control. The report discusses alternatives for restructuring or replacing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, considering their return to financial health and exit from conservatorship. Congress may need to address the profit-sweep dividend preventing accumulation of funds for stockholder control. For the futures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Congress might wish to consider whether the five goals are still germane. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 may have made promoting mortgage credit throughout the nation unnecessary due to more equal access to credit. Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's business models involve selling bonds to purchase mortgages, guaranteeing investors, and pooling mortgages to create MBS. The GSEs sell MBS to investors or keep them in their portfolios, using proceeds to finance mortgages. Their profitability was due to an implicit federal guarantee, tax exemptions, and lower capital requirements. They used various techniques to enhance profits. The GSEs enhance profits by using techniques like short-term borrowing for MBS investments, reducing interest rate risk with financial derivatives, geographic diversification, and purchasing insurance from guaranty companies. The GSEs used tax planning techniques and credit enhancements to satisfy mortgage requirements, resulting in larger mortgages and increased fees. However, these strategies also increased the severity of losses when defaults occurred. Additionally, the GSEs kept less capital reserves compared to other financial institutions, allowing for higher profits but also increasing leverage and potential losses. The increased leverage of the GSEs led to higher profits but also increased the risk of financial failure. If FHFA's conservatorship fails to restore financial health, a \"bad bank\" approach could be used to transfer problem assets, such as delinquent mortgages and MBS, to a new entity to attract new capital. The bad bank could be funded by the federal government to purchase problem assets like delinquent mortgages and MBS. Restructuring GSEs' senior preferred stock could lessen financial burdens by paying dividends as stock instead of cash. This would allow the GSEs to return to stockholder control. The senior preferred stock restructuring would enable GSEs to regain stockholder control, potentially leading to future government support expectations. HERA allows for voluntary and involuntary receivership, with FHFA authorized to create a temporary successor. Options to restructure government support for homeownership post-financial solvency of GSEs may include returning Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to their original form. Options for Congress to consider regarding the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac include returning them to stockholders, converting them into private corporations or government agencies, or making supplementary changes to support the secondary mortgage market. The GSEs' conservatorship will end if they meet minimum capital requirements or if the FHFA director deems it in the public interest. Options for Congress to consider regarding the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac include maintaining them as GSEs with various possibilities such as returning control to stockholders, imposing additional regulations, guaranteeing MBS, setting profitability limits, merging with the Federal Home Loan Bank System, or issuing additional charters. Little or no change to the GSEs' charters could also be an option, allowing them to remain stockholder-owned companies with special obligations to support the housing market. This would involve common stockholders regaining voting rights, preferred stockholders receiving dividends, and the GSEs deciding on the retirement of senior preferred stock. The GSEs would decide whether to retire the senior preferred stock held by the federal government, resume common dividends, and continue bond payments. They must shrink their portfolios annually by 15% until less than $250 billion. Returning to stockholder control assumes profitability, but profits are paid to Treasury, hindering accumulation of necessary funds to exit conservatorship. Agreement with the government on warrants and senior preferred stock disposition would be needed before control is returned to common stockholders. In the third quarter of 2013, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's stock prices were $1.20 and $1.10 respectively. The government could dispose of warrants and senior preferred stock through various methods like federal government exercise, open market auction, or cancellation. The GSEs have succession until dissolved by Congress, raising questions about limits on outside companies purchasing them. The GSEs have been successful since becoming stockholder owned, leading to improvements in the mortgage market such as standardizing mortgages, automating underwriting, and tapping new funding sources. It is unclear what limits exist on outside companies purchasing the warrants. The GSEs have been successful in tapping new funding sources, standardizing mortgages, and automating underwriting. There are debates on the effectiveness of these innovations and concerns about returning the GSEs to their former status due to past financial and management problems. In the early 2000s, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced accounting and management issues, leading to fines and leadership changes. The argument is made that changes in the mortgage market could have occurred without the GSEs, such as standardizing and automating the lending process. Ginnie Mae issued the first MBS, indicating that these changes would likely have been sustained without the GSEs. The Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 allowed interstate banking, leading to uniform interest rates nationwide. The GSEs played a role in moving funds to areas with high demand for home mortgages. The conservatorship of the GSEs has changed their future financial environment. The conservatorship of the GSEs has altered their financial future, making it challenging to return to the previous system. The federal government's intervention may lead to continued financial support despite charter provisions. Recaptalizing the GSEs and attracting new stockholders could be difficult due to government control and halted dividend payments. Additional oversight upon returning the GSEs to stockholder control could mitigate risks to taxpayers. Increased regulatory oversight, such as higher capital requirements, limits on executive compensation, and portfolio size restrictions, could reduce risks for taxpayers with the GSEs. Government assistance may require broader support for affordable housing. Returning GSEs to stockholders while imposing regulations offers a familiar model with continued affordable housing support. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 authorized HUD to set explicit affordable housing goals for the GSEs, which were not guaranteed to be as profitable as other mortgages. The implicit guarantee in the GSEs' charters prior to 1992 came at an implicit cost due to the lack of clearly defined terms. The implicit guarantee in the GSEs' charters prior to 1992 had undefined terms, making it hard to value and limit. A solution could be for the government to charge an explicit guarantee fee with clearly stated terms. This fee could be paid by homebuyers or the GSEs, incentivizing prudent lending and expanding the FHA's guarantee program. The federally guaranteed mortgages could be bundled and securitized by Ginnie Mae to cover more of the mortgage market. One issue would be deciding what types of mortgages could be guaranteed and how new types could be added. The government may need to regulate GSEs' profit margins to prevent excessive profits. Regulators control utility profits by adjusting profit margins based on previous year's earnings. This aims to discourage risky actions for profit gain. The federal government can approve new GSE products or regulate them through guarantee rates. Public utilities' regulation is justified by economies of scale, reducing the need for multiple utility connections. The regulator balances economic interests of consumers with the monopoly provider in constructing utility lines. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's profitability from MBS portfolios is debated, with potential restrictions to simplify oversight. Competition is favored over monopolies, as seen with the GSEs dominating the mortgage market, leading to high prices and profits. Prior to the financial turmoil in 2007, the private label MBS market had many non-GSEs competing. Splitting the GSEs into smaller entities could increase competition and prevent the need for government intervention. Each resulting GSE would have a smaller mortgage portfolio and guarantees, potentially improving market dynamics. The proposal suggests splitting the GSEs into smaller entities to promote diversity and reduce financial stress. New GSEs could have different geographic coverage or specialize in specific types of housing. Existing stockholders would receive shares in the new GSEs, which would continue to be regulated. Another option is to incorporate the GSEs into the Federal Home Loan Bank system for increased competition and oversight. The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) system consists of 12 regional banks that raise funds for loans through advances to member banks. Freddie Mac, created as part of the FHLBank system, sells mortgages on the secondary market. There is a proposal to incorporate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into the FHLBank system or divide their assets among the 12 FHLBanks. The proposal suggests merging some resources, like mortgage securitization, into the FHLBanks' Office of Finance. The FHLBank system has a history of not losing money on advances, but there are concerns about future risks and incentives for excessive risk-taking. FDIC insurance covers FHLBank members in case of failure, with the FHLBank having priority claims over collateral. The FHLBanks may take excessive risks as they keep the profit while the FDIC bears the risk. In case of member failure, FHLBanks have priority over FDIC on assets. One option is to issue new GSE charters with Congress setting requirements and limiting activities. The GSEs could contribute to an insurance fund like the FDIC. Either the FHFA or a new regulator would oversee the GSEs. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would keep their assets and liabilities, potentially leading to objections from stockholders due to new competition. The government could charge a fee for the GSE charters to promote market competition. The government could charge a fee for the GSE charters, promoting market competition. Legislative action could repeal the GSE charters, raising concerns about financial compensation and liabilities. Treasury holds warrants to purchase a significant portion of each GSE's common stock, ensuring stockholder approval of a government proposal. The GSEs could potentially continue with state charters like other financial intermediaries. In the early 1990s, Sallie Mae sought to relinquish its GSE status. In 1996, Sallie Mae relinquished its GSE status and became a stockholder-owned company with no special privileges. Congress may need to decide if government agencies should continue the securitization of mortgages if GSE charters are repealed. GSEs have competed with government programs by offering a broader product range and competitive pricing. Their close relationship with the private sector has been a significant advantage. The GSEs had a funding advantage over private sector mortgage lenders due to their relationship with the federal government, allowing them to borrow funds at lower rates. There is uncertainty about whether the private market could provide mortgage funding during times of stress. Since the GSEs entered conservatorship, there has been limited private sector issuance of MBS backed by mortgages too large for the GSEs to purchase. The impact of the GSEs on mortgage interest rates is a topic of debate, with the current spread between conforming and jumbo mortgages being higher than the historical average. The current spread between conforming and jumbo mortgages is greater than the historical average. Research suggests that there could be a small increase in mortgage interest rates if the GSEs were to cease securitizing mortgages. Without GSEs, institutional investors might shift money to other securities or countries, potentially causing mortgage interest rates to rise more than expected. Another option proposed is to make the GSEs a government agency. Ginnie Mae, a part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, purchases and securitizes government-insured mortgages through contracts with investment banks. Despite having only 60 employees, Ginnie Mae manages over $1.3 trillion in MBS. Fannie Mae was once part of Ginnie Mae before becoming stockholder-owned in 1968. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were to become government agencies, current GSE staff and directors could be affected. If GSEs were fully privatized, current staff and directors may seek other employment due to salary reductions. Privatized GSEs would no longer have special government status, being owned by investors with stock trading on exchanges. They would assume existing GSE assets and liabilities. Congress may consider dividing GSEs into multiple companies to reduce dominance in the market. If GSEs were privatized, they could be divided into multiple companies to reduce market dominance. This could involve creating specialized non-GSEs to lower financial risks but may eliminate diversification benefits. An alternative to GSE guarantees could be a co-op insurance model similar to Lloyd's of London. The co-op model for mortgage securitization involves members buying stock proportional to mortgages sold, with collateral posted against losses. Government supervision ensures safety, with risk borne by the government. This approach could promote competition in the mortgage market. The co-op model for mortgage securitization involves members buying stock proportional to mortgages sold, with collateral posted against losses. Government supervision ensures safety, with risk borne by the government. This approach could promote competition in the mortgage market by encouraging responsible behavior among members. Additionally, government reinsurance and covered bonds are supplementary options that could operate independently of any GSE restructuring, providing further support to the secondary mortgage market. The federal government could provide compensation to financial institutions in the secondary mortgage market. Factors to consider include the size of losses before reinsurance kicks in, eligibility for the program, and premium determination. Covered bonds offer more security to purchasers compared to non-GSE MBS. Private-label MBS issuers do not guarantee timely payment in case of default. Losses flow to the MBS holder as outlined in the prospectus. Covered bonds provide more security to bond purchasers compared to regular bonds. They have collateral and a claim on the issuer's income and assets. Treasury recommends at least 5% extra collateral coverage, only including 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, and a maximum 80% loan-to-value ratio. In the event of bankruptcy, covered bondholders have a priority claim on the issuer's assets, potentially leaving other claimants with less compensation. Covered bonds, popular in Europe, provide more security to bond purchasers compared to regular bonds. They limit the ability of insured depository institutions to issue them, with a current limit of 4% of liabilities. Some suggest issuing covered mortgage bonds using MBS from GSEs. Covered bonds align the interests of originators and bond holders, with a history of no defaults in countries like Germany. They could reduce risks for purchasers of private label MBS and increase competition in the secondary mortgage market."
