    "content": "This paper extends the MASO framework to include a wider range of nonlinearities by connecting deterministic MASOs with probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Under a GMM, piecewise affine, convex nonlinearities like ReLU, absolute value, and max-pooling can be seen as solutions to hard VQ inference problems, while sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and softmax are solutions to soft VQ inference problems. The framework is extended to create a $\\beta$-VQ inference that combines hard, soft, and linear VQ inference. The swish nonlinearity is a prime example of a $\\beta$-VQ DN nonlinearity. Enforcing orthogonality in linear filters can significantly improve DN performance. Deep neural networks (DNs) utilize scalar nonlinearities like ReLU, absolute value, sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent to prevent the network from collapsing to a simple affine transformation. Recent progress has been made in understanding the role of piecewise affine and convex nonlinearities such as ReLU, leaky ReLU, and absolute value activations, as well as downsampling operations like max-pooling, average-pooling, and channel-pooling. The key result of recent progress in understanding deep neural networks is that any layer constructed from a combination of linear and piecewise affine and convex operations is a max-affine spline operator (MASO). MASOs enable DNs to find locally optimized piecewise affine approximations to prediction operators, making the entire DN a composition of MASOs. The signal space in deep neural networks is determined by affine parameters, linking to vector quantization and K-means clustering. A new framework is developed to unify various nonlinearities in DNs, including classical ones like sigmoid and new ones like swish BID20. The Soft MASO (SMASO) model leverages the relationship between VQ, K-means, and GMMs to extend the concept of a deterministic MASO DN layer. It interprets piecewise affine and convex nonlinearities as solutions to hard inference problems under a GMM. The Soft MASO (SMASO) model introduces soft MAP inference for VQ parameters, enabling the use of classical and new nonlinearities like sigmoid gated linear unit and softmax pooling. The MASO framework introduces a new type of DN layer incorporating sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and softmax functions. They also propose a \u03b2-VQ inference method with a learnable parameter \u03b2, ranging from linear to probabilistic to deterministic VQ. Additionally, they extend the SMASO GMM to a factorial GMM for jointly optimal VQ across all units in a layer. The paper introduces a new model for efficient VQ inference in deep neural networks by ensuring orthogonal linear filters feeding into nonlinearities. Two strategies for learning orthogonal weights are proposed, showing significant classification performance improvements on various datasets. The paper also extends the SMASO GMM to a factorial GMM for optimal VQ inference across all units in a layer. The paper discusses the swish nonlinearity and extends the SMASO to a factorial GMM, showcasing the power of DN orthogonalization. Future research directions are outlined in Section 6, with proofs of results in appendices. MASOs are briefly reviewed, consisting of slopes and offsets/biases parameters, producing output z from input x. The paper discusses the power of DN orthogonalization and extends the SMASO to a factorial GMM. MASOs are determined by slope and offset parameters, with an optimized partition of the input space automatically computed. The key result is that the layers of a large class of DN are MASOs. The layers of a large class of DN are MASOs, composed of specific parameters A and B. Any DN layer with a linear operator and a convex, piecewise affine operator is a MASO. The parameters for the MASO corresponding to each layer can be found in Appendix A. The MASO analysis framework extends to various nonlinearities by linking deterministic MASOs with probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). The focus is on a single unit k from a MASO DN layer, containing both linear and nonlinear operators. The MASO mechanism relies on VQ variables to determine the output. A special bias choice makes the VQ variable computation equivalent to the K-means algorithm. In a layer using ReLU activation, each unit partitions the input space using a K-means model with centroids. The input is mapped to the closest centroid region, and the affine mapping produces the layer output. The relationship between K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models is leveraged to GMM-ize the deterministic VQ process of max-affine splines. The MASO mechanism relies on VQ variables for output determination, with a bias choice equivalent to K-means. In a layer with ReLU activation, each unit partitions input space using centroids from a K-means model. The relationship between K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models is utilized to GMM-ize the deterministic VQ process of max-affine splines, relaxing constraints with nonuniform priors. The GMM generates independent vector inputs for each unit in the layer, referred to as the Soft MASO (SMASO) model. The MASO mechanism uses VQ variables for output determination, with a bias choice similar to K-means. The MAP inference of the latent selection variable can be computed via MASO HVQ. The HVQ inference sheds light on drawbacks of using piecewise affine, convex activation functions in DN. The MASO mechanism utilizes VQ variables for output determination, with a bias choice akin to K-means. HVQ inference reveals limitations of using piecewise affine, convex activation functions in DNs. HVQ inference lacks information on VQ region confidence, leading to unexpected gradient jumps during learning. Soft inference of categorical variables can overcome these limitations by replacing 1-hot entries with probabilities based on GMM structure. The MASO mechanism uses VQ variables for output determination, with a bias choice similar to K-means. HVQ inference highlights limitations of using piecewise affine, convex activation functions in DNs. Soft inference of categorical variables can address these limitations by replacing 1-hot entries with probabilities based on GMM structure. The transition from HVQ to SVQ MASO inference allows for the recovery of classical nonlinearities and the derivation of new ones. The layer-output of a DN can be derived into two different DNs based on HVQ and SVQ inference. GMM and SVQ shed light on parameter initialization impact in DC learning. Soft DN layers can derive classical nonlinearities from a soft inference perspective. A hybrid optimization for a new \u03b2-VQ combines HVQ and SVQ, recovering hard, soft, and linear VQ inference as special cases. The \u03b2-VQ optimization problem utilizes a new hyper-parameter to balance the impact of the regularization term, allowing for interpolation between linear, soft, and hard VQ. The unique global optimum covers all cases, with \u03b2 = 1 yielding HVQ and \u03b2 = 0 yielding SVQ. The model can be extended to a factorial model for layer units, enabling synthesis combinations. The model is a mixture of Gaussians with means and identical isotropic covariances. The factorial aspect leads to exponential growth in possible combinations of values, making inference of latent variables intractable. Efficient VQ inference is achieved by constraining MASO slope parameters to be orthogonal. Orthogonality is achieved in fully connected and convolution layers by ensuring rows are orthogonal. The MASO model utilizes orthogonal slope parameters to enable optimal inference independently per factor, reducing computational complexity and promoting uncorrelated unit firing. This orthogonalization strategy can also be applied to other factorial models like factorial GMMs and factorial HMMs. The utility of orthogonal DN layers is demonstrated through improved classification accuracy in various settings. Empirical exploration shows that orthogonal or near-orthogonal filters lead to enhanced performance, as seen in experiments with the largeCNN architecture. The study demonstrated that adding an orthogonality penalty to the standard cross-entropy loss improved accuracy across different datasets and learning settings. They reparametrized matrices using the Gram-Schmidt process to ensure true orthogonality, allowing for backpropagation of the loss. The use of swish activation was also highlighted as a beneficial nonlinearity. The study showed that adding an orthogonality penalty improved accuracy, with the largeCNN achieving 61.2% on CIFAR100. The development of the SMASO model opens up new research questions on exploring new activation functions and pooling operators. Replacing the entropy penalty with a different one could lead to new classes of nonlinearities. The study demonstrated that adding an orthogonality penalty improved accuracy, leading to new classes of nonlinearities. The work was supported by various grants and proposed a tractable inference method with an apodization scheme. The study introduced a method using apodized patches and filters for input representation. By minimizing per patch reconstruction loss, overall input modeling is improved. This approach leads to global minimum optimization and demonstrates the effectiveness of the factorial model across filters and patches.
