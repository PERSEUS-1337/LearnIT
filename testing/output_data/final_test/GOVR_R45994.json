    "content": "The Constitution prohibits withdrawing funds from the Treasury without appropriation by law. Congress faces decisions on the type of appropriations, whether mandatory or discretionary, and how to fund them. Considerations include the use of funds in mandatory accounts for agency activities, revenue sharing, or grant programs. Congress weighs various factors in determining the type of appropriations for a program or activity. Deciding between discretionary or mandatory appropriations for programs involves considering whether authorizing or appropriating laws will control funding. Discretionary spending programs are established through authorization laws, with annual appropriations determining actual funding. Mandatory spending is controlled by authorization laws, with funding specified in the same law. Many mandatory appropriations fall under the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The frequency of Congress reviewing program funding can influence the decision between mandatory or discretionary appropriations. Authorizing laws provide mandatory appropriations, which are permanent and reviewed as needed. Mandatory funding may be stable but can fluctuate depending on revenue sources. Discretionary appropriations are generally provided annually, allowing for more flexibility in program funding. Congress provides discretionary appropriations annually, allowing for adjustments in program funding based on changing conditions and priorities. This approach may result in less funding certainty as programs compete with other congressional priorities. Some programs receive funding from both mandatory and discretionary appropriations, allowing for flexibility but potentially leading to inefficiencies. Congress determines the funding sources for programs. Congress determines funding sources for programs, with a primary consideration being whether funds should come from the General Fund or a specific collection. The General Fund is the default for government collections, but few FY2018 mandatory accounts for land management agencies received funding from it. In FY2018, agencies like BLM and FS received funding from the General Fund for programs like the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. The funding for these programs is determined by a formula based on historical revenue payments and comes from agency receipts and transfers from the General Fund. Alternatively, Congress may choose to fund mandatory accounts for land management agencies from specific collections, such as agency receipts, taxes, license fees, and donations. This approach may be preferred as the revenues come from activities related to land management and can be used to invest in the lands. In FY2018, federal land management agencies received funding from specific collections derived from agency receipts under laws allowing for the retention of money from land use activities like timber harvesting, recreation, and livestock grazing. Different laws dictate how much of the receipts agencies can retain, with some allowing agencies to keep 100% while others specify a percentage to be retained. In FY2018, federal land management agencies received funding from specific collections derived from agency receipts under laws allowing for the retention of money from land use activities like timber harvesting, recreation, and livestock grazing. The FS Knutson-Vandenberg Trust Fund contains revenue from timber sales, with deposits determined by FS on a case-by-case basis. Federal excise taxes funded FY2018 mandatory appropriations, including programs like Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration and Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration. Taxes on items like guns and ammunition fund wildlife restoration programs. In FY2018, funds were primarily used for wildlife restoration programs, including the Sport Fish Restoration program funded by taxes on sport fishing equipment and motor boat fuels. Licensing fees were used for the Migratory Bird Conservation Account and to support other programs like the acquisition of lands and easements for waterfowl habitat protection. In FY2018, licensing fees supported Smokey Bear and Woodsy Owl programs, with proceeds shared between the contractor and FS. Tariffs and import duties funded mandatory accounts, such as FS's Reforestation Trust Fund and FWS's Sport Fish Restoration and Migratory Bird Conservation accounts. Federal land management agencies can accept donations for projects, with FWS and NPS having primary mandatory donation accounts in FY2018. BLM had two small donation accounts. In FY2018, federal land management agencies accepted donations for specific purposes, with FWS and NPS having primary mandatory donation accounts. BLM had two small donation accounts for rangeland improvements and cadastral surveys. The question for Congress is whether to retain receipts for agency use or share them with state or local governments. Considerations for agency use include whether funds should be available for a broad array of activities or restricted to specific purposes. Shared accounts raise questions on how to divide funds among states and other entities. In FY2018, federal land management agencies considered how to use funds from mandatory accounts, including Recreation Fee accounts for maintenance and habitat restoration. Supporters believe reinvesting in lands can support continued land uses, while critics fear revenue-generating uses may overshadow conservation priorities. Additionally, NPS Concession Franchise Fees can be used for visitor services and resource management programs. Franchise Fees are authorized for visitor services and high-priority resource management programs. Most fees are retained at the collecting site. Mandatory accounts in FY2018 funded specific agency activities related to receipt derivation, such as salvage timber sales and transportation services within the National Park System. Some spending authorities require revenue sharing with state or local governments. Issues of debate have focused on compensation for the tax-exempt status of federal lands. In FY2018, compensation programs varied in scope and restrictions, with some covering broad land bases while others were more limited. Payments to states from FS are restricted to roads and schools, while BLM sharing of grazing receipts can benefit counties. The proportion of revenues granted to state and local governments varies widely, even within one agency like BLM. The proportion of revenues granted to state and local governments varies widely within agencies like BLM. State shares of revenues from land sales and grazing fees differ, with some compensation programs reducing payments under certain programs. Mandatory accounts provide funding through formula or competitive grants, typically based on state area and population size. Payments usually cover less than 100% of project costs in grant programs like Wildlife Restoration and Sport Fish Restoration. States and territories can receive up to 75% of project costs for wildlife restoration and sport fish habitat through formula allocations. Mandatory funding provides predictability for federal funding, with some accounts allocated through competitive grants. The Migratory Bird Conservation account requires approval for waterfowl habitat acquisitions by a federally appointed panel. This section details mandatory appropriations for federal land management agencies, comparing the number and dollar amounts of accounts collectively before providing specifics for each agency. In FY2018, four agencies collectively received $3.17 billion in mandatory appropriations, which accounted for 19% of their total appropriations. Discretionary appropriations made up the remaining 81%. The total dollar amount of mandatory appropriations varied widely among the agencies.
