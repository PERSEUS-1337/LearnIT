    "content": "The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 defined the roles of federal agencies for high-level radioactive waste disposal. The EPA sets safety standards, the NRC licenses and regulates, and the DOE operates the repository. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 added requirements for the Yucca Mountain site, including new environmental standards specific to that location. EPA standards previously issued could no longer be applied to Yucca Mountain. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 added new environmental standards for the Yucca Mountain site, which could not be met by the previous EPA standards. The National Academy of Sciences recommended setting a limit on risk to individuals near the repository, rather than specific limits on radioactive material releases or doses. The study also found no scientific basis for predicting human behavior thousands of years into the future. The EPA issued a final Health and Safety Standard for the Yucca Mountain High-Level Radioactive Waste Repository on June 13, 2001. The regulation established exposure standards for 10,000 years based on projected doses to a Reasonably Maximally Exposed Individual (RMEI) and required DOE to continue projections beyond that time frame. EPA's standard aimed to result in an annual risk of fatal cancer for the RMEI of seven chances in a million. The EPA issued a final Health and Safety Standard for the Yucca Mountain High-Level Radioactive Waste Repository on June 13, 2001, establishing exposure standards for 10,000 years based on projected doses to a Reasonably Maximally Exposed Individual (RMEI) to result in an annual risk of fatal cancer for the RMEI of seven chances in a million. The nuclear industry criticized the EPA proposal as being unnecessarily stringent, particularly the groundwater standard. Despite DOE's opposition, the Yucca Mountain site was deemed able to meet the EPA standards. NRC revised its repository regulations on September 7, 2001, to conform to the EPA standards, leading to lawsuits challenging various aspects of the 2001 regulation filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed challenges to the EPA's Health and Safety Standard for the Yucca Mountain Repository, except for the 10,000-year compliance standard. The Court ruled that the 10,000-year timeframe was not scientifically justified and vacated the standard. The EPA proposed a new version of the Yucca Mountain standard in response to a court decision, retaining dose limits for the first 10,000 years but proposing a higher annual dose for the period of 10,000 years through 1 million years. The standard was based on natural background radiation variations between Colorado and Amargosa Valley, Nevada, with the agency arguing it was reasonable to use natural background as a benchmark for exposure up to 1 million years in the future. EPA also proposed basing the post-10,000-year standard on the median dose. In response to a court decision, EPA proposed a new Yucca Mountain standard with dose limits for the first 10,000 years and a higher annual dose for 10,000 to 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the proposed standard as too lenient. Comments on the proposal varied, with some praising the unprecedented time frames while others claimed it violated public health protection principles. EPA established a dual compliance standard in its final ruling: 15 mrem/yr for the first 10,000 years and 100 mrem/yr for 10,000 to 1 million years. The EPA introduced a dual compliance standard for the Yucca Mountain disposal system, with dose limits of 15 mrem/yr for the first 10,000 years and 100 mrem/yr for 10,000 to 1 million years. Critics argue that the dual standard may provide lesser protection for future generations and benefit the Department of Energy. EPA now requires the mean of the distribution of results to demonstrate compliance at all times, departing from the previous use of the median post-10,000 years. In the final rule, EPA chose 100 mrem/yr as the standard for the 10,000 to 1 million-year time period, abandoning the controversial \"variations in natural background\" approach proposed in 2005. The approach would have compared background radiation levels between Amargosa Valley and Colorado. The EPA chose 100 mrem/yr as the standard for the far future, citing international precedent and the difficulty in estimating background radiation levels for comparisons between locations. Comparisons to background radiation were deemed insufficient for regulating the Yucca Mountain disposal system. The EPA finalized the 100 mrem/yr standard for the far future, citing national and international standards, as well as the NCRP endorsement. Public comments on the proposal were mixed, with some praising the unprecedented time frame. The EPA's 2005 proposal for a repository standard faced opposition from Nevada state officials who criticized it as too lenient and unlawful. In response, the EPA lowered the numerical standard from 350 mrem/yr to 100 mrem/yr, addressing concerns about public health protection and legal defensibility. The EPA faced criticism for its 2005 proposal on repository standards, leading to a reduction in the numerical standard from 350 mrem/yr to 100 mrem/yr. However, concerns remain about the level of protection for public health and the dual standard for future generations. EPA's original 2001 Yucca Mountain regulation adopted a 15 mrem/yr standard for 10,000 years. The EPA adopted a 15 mrem/yr standard for 10,000 years, maintaining it in the final 2008 regulation. For the next 10,000 years, the agency argues for a different framework, proposing a 100 mrem/yr standard for up to 1 million years. EPA considers this standard protective and reasonable due to the uncertainty in projecting doses over such long time frames, citing a \"broad consensus\" on its protective nature. Critics disagree with EPA's assessment of a 100 mrem/yr exposure, arguing that the risk level over a 70-year lifetime is unacceptable in today's regulations. They believe EPA's standard may be legally vulnerable and does not fully address the District Court's direction to be based on the NAS report. The court's direction should align with the NAS report. Critics argue that any standard allowing greater individual risk in the future than today is not protective. Senate leaders predict legal challenges due to perceived weaknesses in the standard, potentially putting people at risk. DOE must demonstrate through probabilistic models that the facility design meets regulatory standards. The Yucca Mountain repository must model performance over an extended time span, with uncertainties due to natural and man-made variables. DOE estimates the maximum mean annual individual dose at 2 mrem/yr, meeting EPA's standard, but warns that challenges to assumptions could change this estimate during the licensing process. The DOE believes it can meet EPA's standard for the maximum annual individual dose at the Yucca Mountain repository, but critics, including the state of Nevada, are skeptical. The focus now shifts to the licensing process and addressing technical and policy issues. The NRC's review and licensing process will take several years, regardless of legal challenges to EPA's standard. Congress will need to oversee whether DOE's technical work is sufficient to demonstrate compliance with EPA's standard and address safety issues related to storage and transportation of nuclear waste. The debate over storage and transportation of nuclear waste to a licensed facility continues, with some advocating for on-site storage at power plants. The controversy surrounding the Yucca Mountain Project raises questions about the future of the U.S. nuclear power industry and its role in national energy policy."
