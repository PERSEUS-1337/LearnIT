    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop the Sequester Job Loss Now Act Through 2014\" aims to repeal the 2013 and 2014 sequesters, reduce Defense Discretionary Limits, and protect veterans programs from sequester. It also includes a one-year extension of agricultural commodity programs, excluding direct payment programs, and addresses oil and gas subsidies. The Act includes provisions such as prohibiting last-in, first-out accounting for major integrated oil companies, limiting deductions for oil and gas activities, and imposing a fair share tax on high-income taxpayers. Additionally, it calls for a bipartisan approach to long-term deficit reduction and repealing the 2013 and 2014 sequesters. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to change the years for deficit reduction calculations and allocations. It also adjusts defense and nondefense function reductions and discretionary reductions for fiscal year 2015. Additionally, there are provisions for restoring sequestered funds. The Presidential sequestration order for fiscal year 2013 issued under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Act of 1985 allows budgetary resources sequestered to be available for obligation until October 1, 2013. A conforming change eliminates the OMB Sequestration Preview Report for Fiscal Year 2014 and Joint Committee Reductions for Fiscal Year 2014. SEC. 102. REDUCTION OF DEFENSE DISCRETIONARY LIMITS. The discretionary limits for the security category for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 are adjusted to: 2017 - $586B, 2018 - $595B, 2019 - $604B, 2020 - $614B, 2021 - $624B. SEC. 103. PROTECTING VETERANS PROGRAMS FROM SEQUESTER. Repeal of section 256(e)(2)(E) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. TITLE II--AGRICULTURAL SAVINGS. Extension of agricultural commodity programs for one year, excluding direct payment programs. The extension of authorities from the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 will continue until September 30, 2014, except for the termination of direct payment programs for covered commodities and peanuts. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 will be extended until September 30, 2014, with the termination of direct payment programs for covered commodities and peanuts. Section 1303 of the Act will take effect on the earlier of the enactment of this Act or September 30, 2013. TITLE III--OIL AND GAS SUBSIDIES\n\nProhibition on using last-in, first-out accounting for major integrated oil companies. The amendment prohibits major integrated oil companies from using a specific inventory method for taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act. The taxpayer-initiated change requires consent from the Secretary of the Treasury and adjustments must be spread over a period of up to 8 taxable years. SEC. 302 amends the deduction for income from domestic production activities, excluding oil and gas activities of major integrated oil companies. The amendment increases the deduction percentage for major integrated oil companies. SEC. 303 imposes limitations on the deduction for intangible drilling and development costs of major integrated oil companies. The changes apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. The amendment to Section 263(c) of the Internal Revenue Code exempts major integrated oil companies from certain deductions. The amendment applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, the \"Buffett Rule\" introduces a fair share tax on high-income taxpayers in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"Buffett Rule\" introduces a fair share tax on high-income taxpayers, imposing an additional tax based on adjusted gross income. The fair share tax is determined as the excess of the tentative fair share tax for the taxable year over the sum of the regular tax liability, tax imposed by section 55, and payroll tax for the taxable year, minus the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A. The tentative fair share tax is calculated as 30 percent of the excess of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income over the modified charitable contribution deduction for the taxable year. The modified charitable contribution deduction is based on a ratio of itemized deductions allowable under section 170 for the taxable year. The modified charitable contribution deduction is determined based on the ratio of itemized deductions allowable under the regular tax for the taxable year. If an individual does not itemize deductions, the deduction will be zero. A high-income taxpayer is defined as someone with adjusted gross income exceeding a certain threshold for the taxable year. The adjusted gross income threshold for high-income taxpayers is $1,000,000 ($500,000 for married individuals filing separately) and is subject to inflation adjustments starting from 2014. The adjusted gross income threshold for high-income taxpayers is $1,000,000 ($500,000 for married individuals filing separately) and is subject to inflation adjustments starting from 2014. In cases where the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $10,000, it will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of $10,000. The payroll tax for a taxable year is calculated as the excess of taxes imposed on the taxpayer under specific sections over the deduction allowable for that year. For estates and trusts, adjusted gross income is computed according to section 67(e). The tax imposed under section 67(e) is not considered as tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes. Section 26(b)(2) of the Code is amended to include section 59B (fair share tax). A clerical amendment is made to the table of parts for subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. Title V of the bill emphasizes the need for a fair, balanced, and bipartisan approach to long-term deficit reduction. The amendments regarding the fair share tax on high-income taxpayers will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2013. The House emphasizes the need for a balanced, bipartisan approach to deficit reduction, advocating for replacing the sequester with a plan that increases revenues without burdening middle-income Americans and reduces long-term spending while protecting vital services and making strategic investments. Investments in education, science, research, and critical infrastructure are essential for global economic competitiveness."
