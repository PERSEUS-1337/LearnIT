Title III of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008 is amended to allow the United States to be substituted for electronic communication service providers in covered civil actions if the Attorney General certifies that the assistance provided was in connection with authorized intelligence activities involving communications post-September 11, 2001. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008 allows the United States to substitute for electronic communication service providers in civil actions related to authorized intelligence activities post-September 11, 2001. The activities must be designed to detect or prevent terrorist attacks against the United States and authorized by the President. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008 allows the United States to substitute for electronic communication service providers in civil actions related to authorized intelligence activities post-September 11, 2001. Upon receiving a certification, a court shall substitute the United States for the service provider as the defendant for specified claims. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008 allows the United States to replace electronic communication service providers in civil actions related to authorized intelligence activities post-September 11, 2001. Upon certification by the Attorney General, the court must dismiss specified claims against the service provider and enter a final judgment on those claims. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008 allows the U.S. to substitute electronic communication service providers in civil actions related to authorized intelligence activities post-9/11. If not all alleged assistance was provided under a written request, the provider remains a defendant until the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court determines substitution. The electronic communication service provider may be considered compliant with the law if they acted in good faith and believed their actions were permitted by law when providing assistance under a written request. The communication service provider did not provide alleged assistance. The Attorney General can certify questions to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, leading to a stay in relevant litigation proceedings. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allows parties in a civil action to appear and the Attorney General can file a declaration to protect national security. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court limits public disclosure on national security determinations, without revealing the basis for the decision. The procedures for substitution and tolling of claims under title VIII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 are outlined in this section. Procedures for substitution and tolling of claims under title VIII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 are detailed in this section. Upon substitution, tort claims are deemed filed under section 1346(b) of title 28, US Code, with exceptions, and timely filed against the United States if filed against the electronic communication service provider. Constitutional and statutory claims are also addressed. The claim shall be deemed to have been filed against the United States under section 1331 of title 28, United States Code. For claims under a Federal statute without a cause of action against the United States, the plaintiff can amend the claim to substitute a cause of action under specific sections of the United States Code. The statutes of limitation applicable to causes of action identified in clause (ii) apply to any amended claim under that clause, subject to tolling requirements. Any cause of action against the electronic communication service provider is timely filed if any Federal statutory cause of action was timely filed. In covered civil actions, the United States becomes a defendant for amended claims, allowing plaintiffs to proceed under specific statutes. In covered civil actions, plaintiffs can serve third-party discovery requests to electronic communications service providers after all claims are dismissed. If a plaintiff serves deposition notices or requests for admission to a dismissed provider, the provider is considered a party-defendant for specific rules. In covered civil actions, plaintiffs can serve third-party discovery requests to electronic communications service providers after all claims are dismissed. If a plaintiff serves deposition notices or requests for admission to a dismissed provider, the provider is considered a party-defendant for specific rules. The answers and admissions of a party-defendant under rule 30(b)(6) or rule 36 are binding upon the Government. Certifications for substitution proceedings can be provided and reviewed in camera, ex parte, and under seal. The authority and duties of the Attorney General under this section can be performed by the Attorney General or a designee not lower than the Deputy Attorney General. The Deputy Attorney General is the sole waiver of sovereign immunity in covered civil actions. Any covered civil action brought in a State court is deemed to arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States. This section does not limit any immunity, privilege, or defense under other laws. The section applies to covered civil actions pending or filed after enactment."
