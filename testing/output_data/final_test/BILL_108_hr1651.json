    "content": "The Act titled \"Sierra National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2003\" defines Federal land as approximately 160 acres in California and non-Federal land as approximately 80 acres in the same state. The Secretary of Agriculture is referred to as the Secretary in this Act. The Act involves a land exchange in Sierra National Forest, California. During the one-year period after the Act's enactment, the owner of non-Federal land can offer to exchange the land and pay $50,000 to the United States. The Secretary will convey the Federal land to the owner by quit claim deed, subject to certain conditions. The title of the non-Federal land must meet approval standards and be acceptable to the Secretary. The Secretary, in consultation with the owner of non-Federal land, may correct legal descriptions and make minor modifications not exceeding five percent in value. The non-Federal land is valued at $200,000 and the Federal land at $250,000. Once acquired, the Secretary will manage the non-Federal land according to the Weeks Act. The Secretary will convey Federal land to the Sequoia Council of the Boy Scouts of America under certain conditions, including the transfer of all 160 acres within four months. The owner of the easement granted in section 4 will have the right of first offer for any reconveyance. Cash equalization funds will be disposed of as per regulations. The Secretary will deposit cash equalization payment in a fund for acquiring lands in California. The owner of non-Federal land is responsible for costs associated with the land exchange, which will be deposited in a cost collection account for the Secretary's use. Any remaining funds will be used for the exchange. Any excess funds from the land exchange will be refunded to the owner of the non-Federal land. SEC. 4. GRANT OF EASEMENT FOR HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT NO. 67. To protect the owner of Project No. 67's ability to operate the hydroelectric project on Federal land, an easement must be granted before the land exchange under section 3. The owner will have the right to use the land for hydroelectric power purposes and must indemnify the Secretary for any related claims. The easement granted under this section allows the owner of Project No. 67 to have exclusive rights for hydropower activities on certain real property, including inundation, reservoir management, and compliance. The Grantee is granted rights to use the Property for hydropower activities, including inundation and reservoir management, in compliance with regulations. The Grantee can also allow others to use the Property for purposes like recreation. The Grantee has the right to assign these rights to others and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The Grantor must not deposit any materials on the Property that could interfere with hydropower and reservoir purposes. No other easements, leases, or licenses can be granted without the consent of the Grantee. These terms apply to successors and assigns of both parties. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER FOR SUBSEQUENT CONVEYANCE OF FEDERAL LAND. As a condition of conveying Federal land to the Sequoia Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the Secretary must require the Council to offer the easement owner the right of first offer if the Council ever decides to sell, transfer, or convey the land. The Council must provide written notice to the easement owner with the terms of the conveyance and offer the land to them first. The easement owner has 90 days to accept or reject the offer. Within 90 days of receiving the notice, the easement owner must accept or reject the offer. If rejected or not responded to, the property may be conveyed to another person under the same terms. The easement owner must accept or reject the offer within 90 days. Rejection of one offer does not affect their right of first offer for any other proposed conveyance by the Council. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 18, 2003."
