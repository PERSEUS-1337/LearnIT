    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fiscal Accountability and Intergovernmental Reform Act\" (FAIR Act) and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Congress finds that federal legislation and regulations burden State and local resources without fully evaluating costs or providing adequate financial assistance, hindering local governments' ability to prioritize the use of public resources. Federal legislation and regulatory programs can lead to inefficient use of economic resources, reducing resources available to enhance productivity, increase goods and services, and improve international competitiveness. Federal agencies should implement statutory requirements in a way that minimizes inefficient resource allocation and reduces the burden on State and local public resources. The purposes of this Act are to minimize the burden on State and local governments' public resources and inefficient allocation of economic resources in Federal legislation. The Act aims to minimize inefficient allocation of economic resources and reduce adverse effects on State and local governments' ability to use resources for local needs and priorities, as well as on economic growth, job creation, and international competitiveness. Federal agencies must implement statutory requirements in a manner consistent with their mission. The Act aims to minimize the impact of regulations on State and local governments' ability to use resources for local needs and on economic growth, job creation, and international competitiveness.

When a committee of the Senate or House of Representatives reports a bill or resolution of a public character mandating unfunded requirements on State or local governments or the private sector, the accompanying report must include an analysis detailing the impact of the new requirements on government expenditures and private businesses. The Congressional Budget Office analyzes the economic impact of bills mandating unfunded requirements on State or local governments and the private sector. Legislation exceeding certain cost thresholds requires certification from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office conducts economic analysis on bills to assess their impact on State or local governments and the private sector. Legislation must include this analysis to be considered by the House of Representatives or the Senate, or it may face a point of order. Title II of the Act pertains to Federal Intergovernmental Relations and outlines the exercise of rulemaking powers by Congress. The provisions in this title are considered part of the rules of each House and can supersede other rules if inconsistent. The Act applies to any bill or resolution introduced in the House or Senate after its enactment. Title II of the Act focuses on Federal Intergovernmental Relations and includes provisions for intergovernmental and economic impact assessments.

SEC. 202. INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT. When an agency promulgates a final rule, it must prepare an Intergovernmental and Economic Impact Statement.

The agency must provide an Intergovernmental and Economic Impact Statement with a good-faith estimate of the rule's effect on productivity, economic growth, job creation, and competitiveness. This statement must be made available to the public and published in the Federal Register with instructions on how to obtain a copy. SEC. 203. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.
