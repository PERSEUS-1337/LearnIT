    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 1999\". The Congress finds that each year over 250,000 adults suffer cardiac arrest, with a high mortality rate due to delayed CPR and defibrillation. Every minute delay in restoring normal heart rhythm reduces survival chances by 10%. Communities with defibrillation programs have seen a 20% improvement in survival rates from cardiac arrest. Survival from cardiac arrest relies on the chain of survival, which includes recognizing the emergency, starting CPR, and using a defibrillator. This chain must be initiated immediately and continued until the patient reaches the hospital. The Federal Government should facilitate programs for the placement of AEDs in public buildings, including training personnel in CPR and AED use. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide recommendations for placing automated external defibrillators in buildings. The Secretary will recommend placing automatic external defibrillators in Federal buildings to improve survival rates of individuals experiencing cardiac arrest. Federal agencies will implement programs for defibrillator placement within 180 days of the recommendations being published. Federal agencies with buildings meeting specific criteria must assess their ability to meet certain goals. The Secretary will provide recommendations for placing defibrillators in public venues for informational purposes. The goals for survival rates will be considered in implementing these recommendations. The Secretary will consider national public-health goals for improving survival rates of individuals experiencing cardiac arrest in nonhospital settings. Recommendations will include procedures for training in CPR and defibrillator use, device maintenance, and ensuring direct involvement in emergency response. The Secretary will determine criteria for selecting locations for automatic external defibrillators in public buildings, considering factors like the number of employees and visitors, and the need for security measures. The Secretary will establish criteria for the placement of automatic external defibrillators in public buildings, considering factors such as security needs, special circumstances like extreme temperatures, and other relevant factors. This includes criteria for device maintenance and coordination with emergency medical services in the area. SEC. 4. IMMUNITY FROM CIVIL LIABILITY FOR EMERGENCY USE OF AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS. This section provides immunity from civil liability for the emergency use of automated external defibrillators. Sec. 248 provides immunity from civil liability for persons using automated external defibrillators in emergency medical care, except as specified in subsection (c). Other persons involved with AEDs are also immune from liability for personal injury or wrongful death, as outlined in the section. A person who acquired an automated external defibrillator for nonmedical use (referred to as the 'acquirer') is immune from liability if they notify emergency personnel of the device's placement and ensure it is maintained according to manufacturer guidelines. The person who acquires an automated external defibrillator is immune from liability if emergency care is provided by an employee within expected guidelines and with proper training approved by the Secretary or Chief Public Health Officer. The person who acquires an automated external defibrillator is immune from liability if emergency care is provided by an employee within expected guidelines and with proper training approved by the Secretary or Chief Public Health Officer. This immunity does not apply if the person engaged in gross negligence or willful misconduct, or if they were a licensed medical professional using the defibrillator within the scope of their license and employment. This section provides immunity from civil liability for personal injury or wrongful death resulting from emergency medical care using an automated external defibrillator, except for Federal officers or employees. It does not waive liability protection for Federal officers or employees under specific sections of the United States Code. This section clarifies that the requirement for automated external defibrillators does not apply to all buildings or locations. It also extends civil liability immunity under Federal law to actions arising in Federal areas adopting state law. The requirement for automated external defibrillators does not apply to all buildings or locations. Civil liability immunity under Federal law extends to actions arising in Federal areas adopting state law. The Senate passed the bill on November 19, 1999, as attested by Secretary Gary Sisco."
