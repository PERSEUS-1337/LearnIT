    "content": "We propose a novel framework for combining datasets by aligning their intrinsic dimensions. The approach assumes the datasets are from a common latent space, with a natural alignment of data manifolds. No individual correspondence between data points is assumed, instead relying on the correspondence of data features. Relations between intrinsic manifold dimensions are estimated using diffusion map coordinates, and a correlation matrix is computed by considering graph Fourier coefficients of corresponding data features. By orthogonalizing the correlation matrix of graph Fourier coefficients, an isometric transformation is formed between diffusion maps of datasets. This corrects misalignment artifacts and allows for integrated data, especially useful in biology to align datasets measured from the same system but with different sensors or on different days. This approach ensures effective further analysis by globally and locally aligning datasets for combined analysis. Harmonic alignment corrects misalignment artifacts in datasets, allowing for effective combined analysis by aligning data points based on the manifold assumption. The method involves learning low dimensional manifolds separately from two datasets using diffusion geometric approaches and finding an isometric transformation to align them, focusing on the geometry of the data rather than point-by-point matching. The method involves utilizing diffusion coordinates and geometric harmonics to align representations of two datasets by finding a transformation based on feature correspondences. Feature correspondences are easier to obtain than datapoint correspondences, making it feasible to align datasets even with batch differences. The method utilizes diffusion coordinates and geometric harmonics to align representations of two datasets by finding a transformation based on feature correspondences, allowing for alignment even with batch differences. This involves creating a correlation matrix between eigenvectors of the datasets and finding a linear transformation that maximizes correlations by orthogonalizing the matrix. The method aligns two datasets by building a unified diffusion geometry that is invariant to batch effects and denoises the manifold. It successfully aligns manifolds in various scenarios and shows improved performance compared to other methods. Transfer learning is also demonstrated after alignment. The BID10 method demonstrates significant improvements in performance and denoising ability by assuming high dimensional data originates from a low dimensional manifold mapped via nonlinear functions. Manifold learning methods aim to learn a low dimensional representation that approximates the manifold geometry, often by constructing diffusion geometry and embedding data into diffusion coordinates. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of biological data collection due to batch effects, which introduce variance between different data batches. This variance is caused by uncontrollable factors such as variations between subjects, experimental settings, and times of day. In such settings, it is important to consider the impact of these batch effects on data analysis. In biological data collection, batch effects introduce variance between data batches due to uncontrollable factors. To address this, embedding each batch separately in diffusion coordinates and aligning them with an isometric transformation is proposed to create a unified geometry of multiple batches. This approach utilizes the duality between diffusion coordinates and geometric harmonics for alignment. The approach involves using diffusion coordinates to capture the intrinsic geometry of each batch separately, aligning them with an isometric transformation to create a unified diffusion geometry that is invariant to batch effects and artifacts. Diffusion maps construct a data manifold using local similarities defined by a Gaussian kernel. These similarities are normalized to transition probabilities organized in a stochastic matrix, describing a Markovian diffusion process. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix define a diffusion map for the dataset, mapping each data point based on diffusion-time. Diffusion maps use eigenvalues and eigenvectors to create a data manifold based on local similarities. As the diffusion time increases, most eigenvalue weights become negligible, allowing for dimensionality reduction. Diffusion coordinates are related to Laplace operators and graph Laplacians, with applications in data analysis. The graph structure defined over the data involves determining edge weights based on similarities measured in K. The Laplacian eigenfunctions can be seen as generalized Fourier harmonics in graph signal processing. Anisotropic weight matrices are computed to further analyze the data. The text discusses graph harmonics, anisotropic weight matrix computation, normalized graph Laplacian construction, diffusion map computation, and graph Fourier transform in spectral graph theory. It also mentions the relation between Laplacian eigenvectors and discrete Fourier basis on ring graphs. The text discusses the duality between diffusion coordinates and graph harmonics in relation to data manifolds. It explores capturing relations between data manifolds of individual batches and aligning their intrinsic coordinates to construct a unified data manifold. The focus shifts to the relation between two batches via their intrinsic data manifold structure captured by diffusion coordinates or graph harmonics. The Gaussian kernel used for data normalization is crucial to preserve the intrinsic shape of the data. By defining a graph structure over each batch with an anisotropic kernel, the intrinsic harmonic structure is constructed. While the graph structures should describe similar shapes for both datasets, there is no guarantee that their computed intrinsic coordinates will match perfectly. In practical settings, batch effects can cause misalignments between intrinsic coordinates. To recover relations between batches, quantifying relations between their graph harmonics is essential. Without predetermined overlap, other properties independent of individual data points must be relied upon. The text discusses the importance of quantifying relations between graph harmonics in different batches to recover relationships. It mentions using feature functions and the GFT to compute crossbatch correlations, extending the GFT definition from functions to matrices. This allows for the comparison of data features and graph harmonics between batches. The Fourier matrixX (s) for each batch expresses graph harmonics in terms of data features, allowing for cross-batch harmonic correlations. Correlations are computed within local frequency bands using graph filters. Smooth window functions are used to define wavelet windows for analysis. The itersine filter bank consists of \u03c4 equally spaced wavelet windows that partition the spectrum of each data graph. These windows ensure smooth transitions between frequency bands and uniform behavior across the spectrum when filtering. The filter bank also maintains robust cross-batch correlations between harmonics within and between bands. The harmonic correlation matrix is constructed to ensure robust cross-batch correlations between harmonics within and between bands. An isometric transformation is defined to align the intrinsic coordinate systems of the two data manifolds without breaking their rigid structure. This transformation involves finding the best approximation of the harmonic correlation matrix by an orthogonal matrix. The problem of finding the best approximation of M (s1,s2) by an orthogonal matrix is well studied, dating back to BID19. This approximation can be obtained directly from the singular value decomposition M = U SV T by taking T (s1,s2) = U V T. By defining an isometric transformation with T (s1,s2), the data manifolds of two batches can be aligned, creating a unified intrinsic coordinate system. The transformed embedding matrix E is constructed using diagonal matrices \u039b (s) and eigenvectors \u03a8. The truncated eigenvalues correspond to zero frequencies, encoding global shifts removed in alignment. This construction is equivalent to diffusion map using a discretized heat kernel. Harmonic alignment of circular manifolds is demonstrated using rotated MNIST examples of the digit '3'. In this example, harmonic alignment is demonstrated on rotated MNIST digit '3' manifolds. The aligned embeddings show in-phase relationships between nearest neighbors, unlike the out-of-phase embeddings. The ability of harmonic alignment to recover k-neighborhoods after random feature corruption is also assessed. In an experiment with random samples from MNIST datasets, a corruption matrix was created by substituting columns to vary feature corruption. The corrupted images were used for lazy classification to assess recovery of k-neighborhoods. Multiple trials were conducted for different levels of corruption, showing results in figure 2a. Harmonic alignment outperforms MNN and unaligned classifications in recovering k-neighborhoods under total corruption. It quickly achieves \u2265 80% accuracy for small filter choices. The ability of harmonic alignment to reconstruct corrupted data was examined, showing promising results in recovering the original images. The reconstructions produced by harmonic alignment resemble the original input examples, showing promising results in recovering corrupted data. Comparison of runtime, k-nn accuracy, and transfer learning capabilities with other alignment methods is also presented. A more scalable approach to manifold alignment has emerged recently in computational biology, with experiments conducted on datasets with 35% uncorrupted columns. The method's computational cost was high, and k-neighborhoods could not be recovered for datasets with this level of corruption. Additionally, a lazy classification scheme was used to classify points in a distorted dataset, showing promising results in recovering corrupted data. The study focused on using transfer learning to classify points in a dataset using a nearest neighbor vote. Different ratios of labeled and unlabeled points were sampled and corrupted with 35% column identity. The method of computing mapping between datasets involved building a knearest neighbors graph for each dataset. The performance of the method was compared to another approach called MNN, which was able to recover 20-30% of k-neighborhoods with 35% feature matching. Harmonic alignment outperformed both methods in terms of performance. In transfer learning, harmonic alignment outperformed MNN in aligning up to 60% correct k-neighborhoods in a lazy classification experiment using MNIST digits. Our algorithm outperformed Wang and MNN by aligning up to 60% correct k-neighborhoods, demonstrating robustness to dataset imbalances. Using manifold alignment in transfer learning, we highlight the need for robust alignment in computational biology with a real-world example from a PBMC dataset collected from dengue fever patients exposed to Zika virus strains. In the PBMC dataset, the relationship between IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 was explored without denoising, showing a substantial difference between sample 1 and sample 2. Denoising the cytokine data using a graph filter introduced technical artifacts, increasing the difference between batches. Harmonic alignment corrected the differences in IFN\u03b3 distributions between the two patients. The harmonic alignment method corrected differences in IFN\u03b3 distributions between samples, restoring the correlation with TNF\u03b1. This method aligns intrinsic manifold dimensions by maximizing the similarity of frequency harmonics in two datasets, successfully aligning misaligned and batch-effect biological data. Our method aligns manifold geometry, denoises datasets, and aligns significant manifold dimensions. Future applications can integrate data from different measurement types with known correlations."
