    "content": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a federal corporation established under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA, P.L. 93-406). It insures private pension beneficiaries against the complete loss of accrued benefits if their defined benefit pension plan is terminated without adequate funding. PBGC's operations are financed by insurance premiums, investment income, and recoveries from companies responsible for trusteed plans. There are two types of pension plans: \"defined benefit\" and \"defined contribution.\" In a defined benefit plan, participants receive a fixed benefit at retirement based on a formula set forth in the plan. Under a defined contribution plan, benefits are based on individual account balances and investment experience. Employees may make contributions, and the PBGC insures qualified defined benefit pensions in the private sector. Qualified plans meet IRS and ERISA requirements for tax benefits. The PBGC insures defined benefit plan benefits up to certain limits to protect plan participants in the event of plan termination without sufficient assets to pay promised benefits. Minimum funding standards in the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA require employer contributions to fund promised benefits in defined benefit plans. The PBGC insures pension benefits of workers in private-sector defined benefit plans, paying out $4.3 billion in benefits in FY2007. It guarantees basic pension benefits for underfunded single-employer plans when they terminate. In 2007, the PBGC's single-employer program insured pensions for 33.8 million workers and retirees in about 28,900 plans. The program reported a deficit of $13.11 billion, which was $5 billion less than the previous year, primarily due to investment income and actuarial credits. The PBGC's single-employer program had incurred net claims of $29.0 billion by the end of FY2006, with the majority of the largest claims occurring between 2001 and 2005. These claims will need to be covered through premiums, earnings on PBGC assets, or other revenue sources. The PBGC's multiemployer program provides financial assistance through loans to insolvent plans, without becoming the trustee of these plans. In 2007, the PBGC's multiemployer program insured pensions for 9.9 million workers and retirees in 1,530 plans, with a net deficit of $955 million. The program had assets of $1.2 billion and liabilities of $2.2 billion. There is a statutory ceiling on insured benefits, with different limits for each program. For plans terminating in 2008, the annual limit for the single-employer program is $51,750, while the multiemployer program guarantee is lower. The PBGC's multiemployer program has a lower annual benefit limit compared to the single-employer program. This has resulted in retirees from insolvent plans not receiving their full benefits. The PBGC currently faces a $14.1 billion deficit in assets to cover all claims made through 2007. The Government Accountability Office has labeled the single-employer program as \"high-risk.\" In 2007, the PBGC's estimated potential exposure to future claims was approximately $66 billion, down from $73 billion in 2006. The PBGC's liabilities are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, but if the agency becomes financially insolvent, Congress may face pressure to bail it out at taxpayer expense. The PBGC receives no appropriations from general revenues and is financed by insurance premiums paid by covered private sponsors. The PBGC is financed by insurance premiums, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from sponsors in bankruptcy. It cannot set premiums and must borrow from the U.S. Treasury if needed. Premiums are set by Congress and have been the main revenue source. In 2007, the agency received $1.557 billion in premium revenue. Employers with defined benefit pension plans must pay annual premiums per participant. The PBGC's single-employer premium income was $1.48 billion in FY2007. In FY2007, the PBGC's single-employer premium income was $1.48 billion. Congress has periodically raised premiums since 1974, with the variable rate premium reaching a maximum of $72 per participant in 1991. The cap on the variable rate premium was phased out over a three-year period starting in 1994. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased the per capita premium from $19 to $30 in 2006 and tied it to the national average wage growth. A new premium of $1,250 per participant was introduced for underfunded single-employer plans undergoing distress termination. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 made this special termination premium permanent. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA, P.L. 109-280) made the special termination premium permanent for distressed or involuntarily terminated plans. It also expanded the variable rate premium to apply to all underfunded plans, regardless of past funding status. The premium for multiemployer plans increased from $0.50 to $8.00 per participant due to the DRA of 2005. The PBGC's multiemployer premium income equaled $81 million in FY2007, with growth in premium revenue outpaced by benefit payments and expenses since 1998. The net position improved $9.2 billion since 2004 but fell $31.0 billion from 2001 to 2004 due to terminations of underfunded pension plans in steel and airline industries. Falling interest rates and poor stock market returns also impacted PBGC's liabilities and investment income. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was passed to address the PBGC's declining funded status. It established new funding rules for defined benefit plans, increased premiums for pension plan sponsors, and required underfunded plans to pay variable premiums. However, the impact of these reforms is uncertain, and the CBO has noted that the increased premiums may not be enough to cover future unfunded pension claims. The future financial condition of the PBGC is uncertain due to the termination of private pension plans and their underfunding. Economic conditions, industry prosperity, and company funding levels will influence future terminations. The PBGC's exposure to underfunding can vary significantly from year to year. The PBGC's exposure to pension plan underfunding can fluctuate due to market conditions and interest rate changes. A report by Credit Suisse estimated a $170 billion decline in funded status of pension plans in the S&P 500 from 2007 to 2008. Pension plans were overfunded by $60 billion in 2007 but underfunded by $110 billion in 2008. Funding levels had improved since 2002 when plans had over $200 billion in underfunding. Investment income from PBGC's assets has surpassed premium income in recent years. The PBGC's investment portfolio includes premium revenues, terminated plan assets, and recoveries from plan sponsors. As of September 30, 2007, total investments were $62.6 billion with an investment income of $4.76 billion in FY2007. The PBGC maintains separate financial programs for single-employer and multiemployer plans, investing in US debt obligations and other debt securities. Premium revenues are accounted for in revolving funds included in the federal budget. The PBGC's investment portfolio includes premium revenues, terminated plan assets, and recoveries from plan sponsors. As of September 30, 2007, total investments were $62.6 billion with an investment income of $4.76 billion in FY2007. The PBGC invests in US debt obligations and other debt securities. The revolving funds' value was $14.5 billion at the end of FY2007, while trust fund assets were valued at $48.1 billion. There are no statutory limitations on how the PBGC can invest the assets in its trust fund. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the PBGC's financing and guaranteed benefits to plan participants. Figure 3 illustrates the growth of PBGC's trust fund since 2003, with steady revolving fund size despite premium increases. The PBGC's investment portfolio includes premium revenues and terminated plan assets. The revolving fund is a budgetary account, while the trust fund is nonbudgetary. Investment returns to the revolving fund affect the federal budget, but returns to the trust fund do not. The PBGC's investment policy statement must be approved by the Board of Directors. The PBGC's investment policy is reviewed and approved by the Board every two and four years, respectively. The new policy aims to increase investment returns and reduce deficit risk. It allocates 45% to fixed-income investments, 45% to equity investments, and 10% to alternative investments. The previous policy had a target of 15-25% for equity investments. The PBGC's investment policy, adopted in 2004, set an equity investment target of 15% to 25%, with the remaining assets primarily allocated to fixed income investments. The actual asset allocation differed slightly from the target, expanding exposure to alternative asset classes and equity securities. Throughout its history, the PBGC shifted between bonds and stocks based on leadership changes and risk management theories. Initially investing in equity securities to maximize returns, it later reduced equity exposure and increased long-term bond investments before switching back to greater equity investment in 1994. The PBGC's investment policy shifted back to greater equity investment in 1994, with a target of investing 45% of assets in equities to maximize returns and meet future obligations. The new policy aims to reduce risk by diversifying asset allocation, including investment in alternative assets like private equity. The PBGC's new investment policy, recommended by Rocaton analysis, includes a shift from fixed income to equities and alternative assets. This change is projected to increase the likelihood of full funding within ten years to 57%, compared to 19% under the previous policy. The new asset mix is expected to raise the funded ratio while lowering the worst-case funded ratio. Despite the higher risk associated with increased equity exposure, the PBGC anticipates reduced overall risk through asset diversification, with 45% in equities, 45% in bonds, and 10% in alternative investments. The PBGC's new investment portfolio consists of 45% equities, 45% bonds, and 10% alternative investments, aiming to benefit from time diversification theory. Rocaton's analysis suggests that investors with long-term horizons are well-positioned to wait out market volatility and realize the rewards of riskier assets. While there is agreement on the benefits of asset diversification, opinions differ on whether investment risk decreases over time. The PBGC's new investment strategy focuses on increasing equity investments to benefit from higher expected returns, following a \"total return\" approach. This approach aims to grow assets faster than liabilities by taking on more risk with common stocks. Investors often allocate more assets to equities for higher expected returns despite higher risk. PBGC's new strategy involves increasing equity investments to benefit from higher returns, following a \"total return\" approach. The PBGC's new strategy involves increasing equity investments to benefit from higher returns, following a \"total return\" approach. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, this allocation would have increased the assets of the PBGC by an estimated $2.3 billion, with a portfolio invested 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds. Unlike a corporate pension plan, the PBGC is fully exposed to the risk of investment losses. The GAO has noted that investments in riskier assets with higher expected rates of return may allow financially weak plan sponsors and their plan participants to benefit from the upside of large positive returns on pension plans. The PBGC's strategy involves increasing equity investments to benefit from higher returns, following a \"total return\" approach. The assumption that the risk of holding stocks decreases over time is disputed by some economists, who argue that the risk actually rises with the length of time they are held. Financial market participants do not offer long-term put option contracts on stocks, indicating a lack of willingness to guarantee against losses over extended periods. Despite the belief that the risk of long-term put option contracts increases over time, modern portfolio theory suggests that the risk-adjusted rates of return on stocks and bonds are equal. The higher expected return on stocks, known as the \"equity premium,\" compensates investors for the additional risk of holding stocks instead of bonds. This risk should be considered when choosing asset allocation to minimize the risk of being unable to pay liabilities in the future. The approach of asset-liability matching in pension plans involves investing in fixed-income instruments like bonds to match the plan's liabilities. Changes in interest rates affect the value of liabilities, which increase when rates fall and decrease when rates rise. Some economists suggest investing all assets in bonds matched to expected cash flows to avoid selling bonds prematurely during rising interest rates. Investing assets in equities can be a poor hedge against interest rate swings. Stock prices often rise when interest rates fall, providing protection from interest rate risk. In 2004, the PBGC reduced its equity exposure in favor of fixed-income securities matched to its liabilities, aligning its portfolio with insurance companies that limit their equity exposure. Bonds represent the majority of assets in this approach. According to the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI), bonds make up 72% of assets held by private life insurance providers, with equity representing only 5%. Corporate pension plans are also considering asset-liability matching as an investment strategy, encouraged by the Pension Protection Act (PPA) and Financial Accounting Standard No. 158. These regulations incentivize pension fund managers to move away from volatile investments like stocks. Milliman, Inc. reported that the percentage of pension plan assets invested in equities has decreased. In a recent study, Milliman, Inc. found that the percentage of pension plan assets invested in equities declined from 60% in 2006 to 55% in 2007. Despite this decrease, the median equity allocation in 2007 was still 63%, down slightly from 65% in 2006. Firms in the S&P 500 index are shifting their pension plans' investments from equities to bonds, hedge funds, and private equity. The PBGC, which insures pension plans heavily invested in equities, should consider an asset-liability matching approach to protect its financial condition. The PBGC's decision in 2008 to reduce asset-liability matching in favor of a strategy aimed at generating higher expected returns was driven by concerns about its deficit. The previous investment policy aimed to prevent further deficit deterioration while reforms were pursued. Despite the PPA, the PBGC still lacks resources to fully meet long-term obligations to plan participants. The PBGC has limited authority to adopt policies directly impacting its financial condition. The PBGC lacks authority to set premiums or funding requirements for insured plans, as these powers rest with Congress. Companies with defined benefit pension plans lobby Congress to keep PBGC premiums low. PBGC invests income in government-backed securities but can invest its trust fund assets. The PBGC has the legal authority to invest its trust fund in assets of its choice to maximize investment income and reduce its deficit. The new investment policy adopted in 2008 aims to be less risky in the long-term, but some assumptions underlying this assertion are questionable. The policy change was influenced by an analysis conducted by Rocaton Investment Advisors, LLC, with conclusions sensitive to methods and assumptions. The relative risks of the previous and new investment policies depend on the risk associated with each asset class in the portfolio. The risk associated with holding financial assets is measured by the standard deviation of the rate of return. Rocaton assumed a standard deviation of 11.2% for long-term Treasury bonds, while CRS found it to be 8.4% for 10-year Treasury bonds and 11.2% for 30-year Treasury bonds. The Rocaton study estimated a 15% standard deviation for U.S. equities, while historical data showed a 20% standard deviation. This discrepancy could impact the perceived risk of investing in stocks. The PBGC's new investment policy's riskiness compared to the previous policy depends on the volatility of stock and bond returns. It is unclear if Rocaton conducted a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. The shift to a new investment policy by PBGC could increase risk due to higher rates of return focus. A sensitivity analysis on key assumptions, like stock and bond return volatility, is recommended. In a market downturn, PBGC's exposure to equities may lead to a decline in investment value while plans become underfunded. The PBGC's new investment policy could expose it to double-exposure to stock market declines, as its liabilities increase. While emphasizing a long-term horizon, the PBGC still needs short-term cash for beneficiary benefits. Rocaton noted that the duration of current liabilities allows for weathering short-term volatility, but did not assess contingent liabilities. The PBGC's new investment policy aims to address the uncertainty of liabilities, contrasting with the PPF's strategy of mitigating risks. The PPF primarily invests in fixed income securities, while the PBGC's previous strategy had little impact on its deficit. The new policy is expected to generate higher returns but may expose the PBGC to stock market declines. The PBGC's new investment policy aims to generate higher returns, potentially increasing underfunding of insured plans. If the policy results in higher expected returns with reduced risk, taxpayers will benefit. However, if higher risk leads to investment losses and a growing deficit, taxpayers will be worse off. Fundamental reforms in PBGC financing, such as risk-based premiums, could be delayed by higher investment returns. Fundamental reforms in PBGC financing, like risk-based premiums, could be delayed, hindering long-term financial improvement and increasing the risk of needing to bail out an insolvent PBGC in the future."
