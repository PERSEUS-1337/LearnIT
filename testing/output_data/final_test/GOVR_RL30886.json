Despite being fully certified each year, resolutions of disapproval were introduced in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. After the election of President Vicente Fox in 2000, some Members called for modification of the certification procedures. President Bush certified Mexico as fully cooperative in drug control efforts on March 1, 2001, citing the arrest of key members of the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix Organization, aggressive eradication programs, and continuing cooperation with the United States. Mexico is the primary transit point for cocaine entering the United States from South America and a major source country for heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine. Mexico's share of illicit traffic has remained high over the years, with variations in estimates and concerns about the methodology for making these estimates. Estimates of drug trafficking through Mexico are uncertain and vary, with different sources providing conflicting percentages. The State Department's INCSR report mentioned DEA estimates that 55% of cocaine sold in the US transits Mexico, while other officials stated different figures. Similar uncertainties exist for heroin trafficking. Mexico produces only about two percent of the world's opium, with most destined for the United States. Production in Mexico has decreased due to eradication efforts and a severe drought. 14% of heroin seized in the US comes from Mexico, while an independent study suggests Mexico is the source of 29% of heroin in the US. Mexico-based criminal organizations are the largest distributors of methamphetamine and precursor chemicals in the US. Methamphetamine seizures in the US have been increasing, with virtually all marijuana smuggled into the US either grown in Mexico or shipped through Mexico. Mexico is a major money-laundering center and a key route for smuggling drugs into the United States. Mexican drug control efforts from 1994 to 2000 included seizures, arrests, and eradication measures. The U.S.-Mexico border is the main entry point for marijuana smuggled into the United States. The INCSR provides eradication estimates for crop destruction in Mexico, while the Mexican government supplies raw estimates of areas sprayed. Data on ephedrine seizures from December 1999 to November 2000 were reported. Various factors can influence trends in drug trafficking control efforts in Mexico. The results in 2000 showed setbacks and successes in Mexican drug seizures, with a 31% decline in cocaine seizures compared to 1999. This decline could be seen as lagging performance, success from Mexico's investment in interdiction technology, or the challenge of capturing traffickers using multiple maritime routes. Mexican drug traffickers use various maritime and overland routes for smuggling. In 2000, cocaine seizures increased slightly to 27.6 metric tons, while opium seizures decreased to 0.41 metric tons. Heroin seizures rose to 0.302 metric tons, showing a positive trend in drug interdiction efforts. In 2000, seizures of heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and ephedrine increased significantly compared to previous years. Heroin seizures reached 0.302 metric tons, marijuana seizures were at 2,005 metric tons, methamphetamine seizures were 0.638 metric tons, and ephedrine seizures were 0.560 metric tons. These increases indicate a growing importance of these drugs in illicit activities. In 2000, there was a significant increase in drug seizures in Mexico, with a 65% increase in illicit drug labs seized compared to 1999. The Attorney General reported that cocaine seizures nearly doubled, marijuana seizures increased by 116%, and heroin seizures climbed over 500% compared to the previous administration. The number of people arrested on drug-related charges in Mexico also increased across all categories in 2000. In 2000, arrests of foreigners increased by 15%, reaching the highest level since 1998. The numbers of arrests of Mexicans and total arrests also rose by over 5%, the highest in the last seven years. Key arrests included members of the Arellano Feliz or Tijuana cartel, heroin traffickers Isaias and Juan Hernandez Ibarra, and Agustin Vazquez Mendoza, wanted for killing a DEA agent. Other significant arrests were drug cartel collaborators Hugo Baldomero Medina Garza and Olegario Meraz Gutierrez. In 2000, Mexico made significant arrests of drug cartel collaborators Hugo Baldomero Medina Garza and Olegario Meraz Gutierrez. The arrests were seen as accomplishments in operational planning and interagency cooperation. Critics argue that corruption still exists in Mexican authorities, major drug traffickers remain at large, and enforcement of anti-money laundering legislation is lacking. In 2000, Mexico saw arrests related to drug cartel activities, including the investigation of unexplained funds, a staged car accident/murder, and the arrest of Mexican Generals with links to a trafficking organization. The Mexican government extradited 12 individuals to the United States, including U.S. citizens, Argentines, and a Mexican national, on drug-related charges. The Zedillo Administration extradited Mexican nationals to the United States between 1996 and 2000, despite Mexican courts being reluctant to approve extraditions. Mexican courts raised questions about the constitutionality and appropriateness of extraditions, especially involving capital punishment or life sentences. At the end of 2000, 51 individuals were in Mexican custody pending extradition, including notable figures like Agustin Vasquez Mendoza and Ismael Higuera Guerrero. The Mexican Supreme Court ruled in January 2001 that Mexican citizens can be extradited to the United States for drug charges under Mexican guidelines. Lower court decisions on life imprisonment and capital punishment still hinder the extradition process. The decision was a result of efforts by the Zedillo Administration, and the Mexican Senate approved a protocol to the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty in December 2000. In December 2000, the Mexican Senate approved a protocol to the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty, allowing temporary surrender of fugitives serving sentences in one country but wanted for criminal charges in the other. President Fox aims to strengthen democracy, fight corruption and crime, and professionalize the police to address security concerns. President Fox sent additional federal police to hot spots of drug trafficking and crime, but they were later removed without significant accomplishments. He has been criticized for failing to act swiftly against corruption, leading to recent cases of drug-related corruption. In response, President Fox announced a national crusade against drug trafficking in January 2001, promising to eliminate corruption in the police and prison systems. President Fox's national crusade against drug trafficking in Mexico led to questioning and charging of prison officials in Jalisco and removal of customs officials in Chihuahua. Despite declines in illicit crop cultivation, eradication efforts are complicated by differing data on areas sprayed versus crop destroyed. The US reported a 4% decrease in effective eradication of opium poppy cultivation in 2000 compared to 1999. In 2000, opium cultivation decreased by 4% compared to 1999 and 6% compared to the average from 1994-1999. The estimated potential harvest was only 1,900 hectares, a 47% decline from 1999. The potential yield of opium gum was 24 metric tons, a 55% decline from 1999. Effective eradication of Mexican marijuana in 2000 decreased by 33% from 1999 but increased by 9% compared to the average from 1994-1999. The estimated potential yield of marijuana was slightly higher than 1999 at 7,000 metric tons. In an Administration briefing on the certification decisions on March 1, 2001, Robert Brown from the ONDCP praised Mexico's eradication program as \"extraordinary\" and \"world class.\" U.S.-Mexico cooperation in counter-narcotics increased during President Zedillo's administration, involving various law enforcement and military agencies. Despite high drug flow and corruption, the Clinton Administration expressed confidence in Zedillo's commitment to combat corruption and work closely with the U.S. The Binational Commission, established in 1977, operates at the highest diplomatic level. The Binational Commission, established in 1977, brings cabinet-level officials together annually to discuss U.S.-Mexico relations, including legal and anti-narcotics affairs. The High Level Contact Group, established in 1996, focuses on counter-narcotics issues with cabinet-level coordination twice a year. Subordinate working groups meet regularly to coordinate policies and promote conferences on drug demand reduction. The Mexico-U.S. Senior Law Enforcement Plenary, coordinated by the Attorneys General, meets several times a year on law enforcement issues. In May 1997, an Anti-Drug Alliance was agreed upon during a visit to Mexico by President Clinton. In May 1997, an Anti-Drug Alliance was established during President Clinton's visit to Mexico. Subsequent agreements were made regarding extradition, firearms trafficking, and coordination of anti-drug activities. Despite some disagreements, cooperation continued with the signing of agreements on law enforcement and the establishment of a new interdiction working group in November 1999. Mexico strengthened its efforts to combat money laundering by signing agreements with the United States and joining global and regional task forces. Domestic legislation was passed to enhance reporting of large currency transactions. Negotiations were ongoing for new agreements on chemical control and asset sharing. The United States was involved in training Mexican law enforcement agencies during the Clinton Administration. Mexico implemented various agencies and laws to combat drug trafficking, including the Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Health (FEADS), the Organized Crime Unit, Border Task Forces (BTFs), and a Financial Intelligence Unit for anti-money laundering. Legislation was passed to use seized assets in counter-narcotics operations and regulate precursor chemicals. The United States provided counter-narcotics training during the Clinton Administration. During the Clinton Administration, the United States provided counter-narcotics training to Mexican military personnel and some military equipment. However, the 73 Huey helicopters provided in 1996 were returned in 1999. In 2000, a protocol was developed to enhance communication and coordination of maritime interdiction operations between the two countries. Cooperation between Mexico and the United States on anti-drug activities at the UN and OAS has been extensive. They also collaborated on adopting a multilateral evaluation mechanism to assess counter-narcotics performance in member countries. President Bush met with President Fox in Mexico in 2001, pledging a partnership for prosperity. They agreed to strengthen law enforcement cooperation on drug trafficking. President Bush certified Mexico's full cooperation with U.S. counter-narcotics efforts in 2000. Hope and danger are seen in the future according to the INCSR report. The Fox Administration has committed to combating drug traffickers and ending impunity, offering opportunities for cooperation with the United States. However, corruption and challenges in implementing reforms hinder the success of Mexico's counterdrug strategy."
