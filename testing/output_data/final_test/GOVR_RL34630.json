    "content": "Every four years, political parties select their presidential nominees at conventions run by and for parties, without federal government involvement. Federal funds provide financial support to convention committees and for securing venues. Some question the use of public funds for conventions, citing the availability of private resources and the dominance of \"soft money\" in funding. The use of public funds to support party conventions is a topic of debate in campaign finance policy. Conventions receive taxpayer-supported revenue from presidential public campaign funds and security funds. In 2012, the Democratic and Republican conventions received approximately $136.5 million from these sources. It is important to distinguish between presidential public funds and security funds, as they come from separate revenue sources and serve different purposes. Two federal funds, presidential public funds and security funds, support conventions for different purposes and are subject to debate. Congress may reassess them separately, with funds for convention operations coming from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund (PECF) and security costs funded by Congress through the Department of Justice (DOJ). No appropriations are made for PECF funds. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43976. The Presidential Election Campaign Fund (PECF) is funded by individuals' tax designations, with $3 for individuals and $6 for married couples. The two major parties' conventions received grants of $18.2 million each in 2012, with third parties rarely qualifying for funds. The grants for 2016 have not been announced yet. The PECF convention grants for presidential public funding are reserved before other funds can be distributed. The FEC determines eligibility for PECF funds based on federal laws and regulations. Another source of federal convention funds comes from the OJP within the DOJ, available in select years due to events like the September 11, 2001, attacks. In 2004, Congress allocated $100 million for the Democratic and Republican presidential nominating conventions in Boston and New York City. In 2008, the same amount was allocated for convention security in Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul. In 2012, the funding was used for convention security in Charlotte and Tampa through OJP's Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Programs. The U.S. Secret Service was responsible for planning and implementing security operations at the conventions, not the DOJ. The USSS is the lead federal agency for convention security during National Special Security Events (NSSE), including presidential nominating conventions. In 2012, approximately $136.5 million was provided by the federal government for the Democratic and Republican conventions, with each allocated around $68.2 million. No third parties qualified for federal funding in 2012, with the last third party receiving funds in 2000. The Reform Party qualified for $2.5 million in federal funds for their convention. Congress has never allocated funds for a third party's convention security. Parties receiving public funds must agree not to raise or spend additional funds, with exceptions for legal or accounting fees. They must also file disclosure reports, provide requested documents to the FEC, and undergo an audit of their spending. Federal law has few restrictions on how convention funds are spent as long as expenses are related to the convention. FEC regulations offer further guidance on permissible spending. FEC regulations provide guidance on permissible spending for presidential nominating conventions. Permissible expenses include site preparation, staff costs, security, transportation, entertainment, administrative items, gifts for staff or volunteers, candidate biographical films, and investment of funds for convention costs. However, individual convention committees may not fund all activities listed. Prohibited spending includes candidate or delegate participation using PECF funds. The FEC regulations outline permissible spending for presidential nominating conventions, including site preparation, staff costs, security, transportation, entertainment, administrative items, and gifts. Prohibited expenses include candidate or delegate participation using PECF funds, violating laws, penalties from federal election law enforcement, and replacing lost or stolen items. Security funding for conventions is limited to specific presidential nominating events, with the 2012 Democratic convention in Charlotte and Republican convention in Tampa being the only authorized recipients of federal security funding. The $100 million appropriated for the FY2012 presidential nominating conventions was primarily to reimburse states and localities for law enforcement costs. State and local law enforcement incurred overtime costs for activities such as securing the convention venue, advance planning, training, and communications. Additional security costs incurred by the federal government may have included USSS protection of major presidential candidates. The federal government incurred security costs for presidential nominating conventions, including the use of law enforcement officers and securing venues with fencing and barricades. Nonfederal funds also support convention activities and security operations. Amounts of nonfederal funds vary widely and are not centrally reported. The Campaign Finance Institute estimated that over 75% of funding for the 2004 Democratic and Republican conventions came from private sources. In 2008, it was estimated that 80% of funds for the conventions would come from nonfederal sources. Private fundraising for conventions remains steady, with the 2012 Democratic host committee raising $37.5 million and the Republican host committee raising $57.1 million. State and local governments may also contribute additional funds for convention activities. State and local governments may spend additional amounts on security for conventions. Nonfederal funds are not subject to federal campaign finance limits, but some FEC reporting requirements apply. Local host committees can solicit and spend private contributions for convention-related activities. The regulation of federal versus nonfederal funds depends on how FECA and the FEC treat each source. FEC has determined that nonfederal funds do not explicitly support the conventions. The FEC has reaffirmed that nonfederal funds supporting conventions are distinct from other donations by prohibited sources. State or local governments and municipal funds can also provide financial assistance to conventions. Corporations and labor unions are allowed to make contributions for convention-related activities. The use of nonfederal funds for convention security is based on costs incurred by state and local law enforcement working with federal agencies. State and local governments, as well as corporations and labor unions, can provide financial support for convention-related activities. Commercial vendors may also offer goods or services at reduced rates or for free to convention committees. The House passed H.R. 2019 (295-103) on December 11, 2013, which would eliminate PECF convention funding and create a \"10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund.\" Other bills introduced in the 113th Congress, such as H.R. 94, H.R. 95, H.R. 260, H.R. 1724, H.R. 2857, and S. 118, aim to eliminate convention financing or revamp the presidential public financing program. In the 112th and 113th Congress, bills were introduced to eliminate PECF convention funding and revamp the presidential public financing program. Various bills aimed to eliminate convention financing, with some also proposing to eliminate the entire public financing program. In the 110th, 111th, and 112th Congress, multiple bills were introduced to eliminate PECF convention funding and alter the presidential public financing program. Various bills aimed to eliminate convention financing, with some also proposing to eliminate the entire public financing program. The 112th Congress appropriated $100 million for convention security in FY2012. Congress is considering the role of federal funds in modern conventions, including PECF convention grants. Nonfederal funds, such as \"soft money,\" also play a significant role in convention financing. The tension between federal and nonfederal funds is likely to shape future discussions on convention funding. The tension between federal and nonfederal funds shapes congressional consideration of convention financing. Advocates of public funds argue for insulating conventions from undue influence, while opponents see it as an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds. Nonfederal funds, like \"soft money,\" also play a significant role in convention financing. The policy options discussed could change the amount of federal funding available to conventions, with some proposed in recent legislation and others offering additional approaches. If Congress makes no changes, the role of PECF convention funds will remain the same, with convention committees bound by regulations and nonfederal funds continuing to play a role in financing. The amount of PECF funds available will increase with inflation unless there is a statutory change. Expanding federal funding for conventions could reduce the need for nonfederal funds, but without additional regulation or voluntary spending decreases, it could also increase the total funding. Any changes to federal convention funding would require amending current federal law. Prioritizing funding for candidates over conventions is an option Congress could consider to address this issue. Prioritizing convention funding de-prioritizes convention funding to avoid financial shortfalls in the public financing program. Congress could appropriate funds annually or every four years for conventions instead of the current PECF grant structure. This change could result in more or less funding for conventions compared to the current $18.2 million per major party. Appropriating convention funds would mark a departure from Congress's traditional approach to presidential public financing, which relies on taxpayers' checkoff designations. Congress could alter the checkoff by posing separate questions for candidate and convention financing, allowing taxpayers to provide more or less funding to conventions. Increasing the checkoff amount for convention funding has been proposed to provide additional funds to the PECF. Congress tripled the checkoff amount in 1993, but it did not increase taxpayer participation. If Congress decides convention funding is no longer necessary, grants could be eliminated to focus on candidate campaigns. This could potentially threaten available funds in the long term. The possibility of eliminating convention grants for candidate campaigns by repealing relevant federal law or amending it to prohibit FEC certification or Treasury Secretary payments. Concerns about private money influence in convention financing may arise if conventions rely solely on private funds. DOJ provided funding for convention security in presidential election years 2004, 2008, and 2012, but USSS is the lead agency for security operations during National Special Security Events like presidential inaugurations. The USSS is responsible for coordinating convention security operations with nonfederal entities and using its own funding. State and local governments must apply to DOJ for reimbursement of their security costs post-convention, as the USSS cannot reimburse these costs. Federal security activities by the USSS require coordination. The USSS coordinates federal security activities for conventions, requiring collaboration with state and local law enforcement. The 112th Congress allocated $19 million for NSSE costs in FY2012. If no policy changes are made, convention security funds would continue to be appropriated during presidential election years. State and local entities assist in securing venues and seek reimbursement from DOJ. State and local governments can utilize DHS grants for security purposes. State and local governments can utilize DHS grants like the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) for convention security, although DHS does not administer specific convention security grants. The grant approval process for DHS programs is not flexible, limiting their application to conventions. States and localities hosting conventions must include plans for using HSGP funding in their grant applications. Reprogramming HSGP funding with DHS Secretary approval may divert funds from other homeland security activities. Policy options could impact federal security funding for conventions in presidential election years, but none have been proposed in legislation. Congress could fund convention security through DHS's HSGP grants by increasing allocations for election years or requiring specific funding for convention security. This option would remove DOJ from the funding cycle and states could utilize established grant mechanisms. Another option is authorizing the USSS to reimburse state and local security costs. The USSS could be authorized to reimburse state and local convention security costs, potentially increasing effectiveness in auditing and determining reimbursement amounts. This option would remove DOJ from administering the funding but would require the USSS to establish and administer a grant process. Alternatively, Congress could choose not to appropriate funding for state and local governments, potentially reducing the security role of law enforcement entities. The federal government's role in funding convention security has been debated since the 1976 election cycle. With the focus on homeland security and protecting presidential candidates, Congress has options to revisit PECF funding. The federal funding of convention security is a recent development post-9/11, with discussions on presidential public financing and campaign money. Congress may consider different options for how the federal government provides funding for state and local costs incurred in securing convention venues."
