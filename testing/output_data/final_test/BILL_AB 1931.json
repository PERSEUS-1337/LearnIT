    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1797.184 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to include guidelines and regulations for disciplinary actions, certifications, and recertifications of EMTs to ensure public health and safety. Section 1798.200 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow employers of EMTs to conduct investigations and take disciplinary action for violations of conduct, with a requirement to notify the regulating entity within three days of validated allegations. Employers of EMTs must notify the regulating entity within three days if an EMT is terminated, suspended, resigns following an impending investigation, or is removed from EMT-related duties for disciplinary reasons. EMT-P employers must provide supporting documentation at the time of notification. Employers must notify the regulating entity within three days if an EMT is terminated, suspended, resigns following an impending investigation, or is removed from EMT-related duties for disciplinary reasons. At the conclusion of an investigation, the employer may develop and implement a disciplinary plan for the EMT, which must be submitted to the regulating entity within three working days. The plan may include a recommendation for further action against the EMT's certificate or license. If an EMT is not employed by a licensed ambulance service or public safety agency, the director will conduct investigations and take disciplinary action as necessary. The director will develop a disciplinary plan for the EMT, which may include action against their certificate or license. The director may deny, suspend, or revoke an EMT certificate or license for disciplinary cause, based on specific actions and findings. If an employer fails to discipline or does so inadequately, the director can take action against the certificate or license. The director can temporarily suspend an EMT certificate or license if the holder's conduct warrants disciplinary action and poses a threat to public health or safety. The regulating entity notifies the certificate or license holder of a temporary suspension, conducts a joint investigation with the employer, and decides within 15 days whether to serve an accusation. The regulating entity must hold a hearing within 30 days if a notice of defense is filed by the certificate or license holder. If a final determination is not made within 15 days after the administrative law judge's proposed decision, the temporary suspension order is considered vacated. The director must refer any complaint on an EMT-I, EMT-II, or EMT-P to the relevant employer within three days. Definitions for \"director\" and \"regulating entity\" are provided for clarity. Any actions that threaten public health and safety, such as fraud, negligence, incompetence, or dishonesty, can lead to denial, suspension, or revocation of a certificate or license issued under this division. The regulating entity, which includes the local EMS agency and the EMS Authority, has jurisdiction over violations in the county. Conviction of crimes related to prehospital personnel duties, violating regulations, federal or state drug laws, substance abuse, and working without medical control supervision may result in denial, suspension, or revocation of a certificate or license. Demonstration of irrational behavior or physical disability impairing duties may lead to suspension or revocation of license. Unprofessional conduct includes mistreatment or abuse of patients beyond reasonable force. The failure to maintain patient confidentiality, commission of sexually related offenses, and sharing of information among EMT employers are grounds for disciplinary action. Disciplinary actions against EMTs are considered public records unless protected by law. The reporting requirements for EMT-P disciplinary actions do not apply to peace officers. Proceedings against EMT-P license holders follow specific government code regulations. The EMS Authority can share investigation results with employers or prospective employers upon notification to the EMT-P. An EMT-P licensee can request to view closed investigation files during business hours. The medical director of the local EMS agency can evaluate information on EMT-P license holders for possible disciplinary action. The medical director can recommend further investigation or discipline of an EMT-P license holder to the authority, notifying the employer within three days. All documentary evidence collected by the medical director will be included in the recommendation. The authority will consult with the medical director in deciding on disciplinary action. Section 1798.202 of the Health and Safety Code allows for temporary suspension of an EMT-P license if there are grounds for revocation and it poses a threat to public health or safety. The suspension can be initiated by the local EMS agency or the director of the authority. The local EMS agency notifies the licensee of EMT-P license suspension, providing reasons. Documentary evidence is sent to the authority and employer within three days. The authority reviews the evidence within two days to determine if the suspension should continue. If not, the suspension is lifted immediately. The authority reviews documentary evidence to decide on continuing temporary suspension of the licensee's EMT-P license. If suspension continues, the licensee is served with a temporary suspension order and accusation within 15 days. The director of the authority initiates a temporary suspension by filing an order and accusation. If the licensee files a notice of defense, a hearing must be held within 30 days. If a final determination is not made within 15 days after the proposed decision, the suspension order is vacated. Section 1799.112 of the Health and Safety Code is repealed."
