    "content": "The public debt limit is increased to $4,920,000,000,000. This change also applies to federal trust funds and other federal accounts. Protection of Federal Funds: Federal officers or employees are prohibited from delaying deposits or credits into Federal funds, or refraining from investing in public debt obligations to avoid increasing the outstanding public debt obligations. They are also not allowed to disinvest funds from public debt obligations with the purpose of reducing the outstanding debt. During periods when cash benefits or administrative expenses cannot be paid due to the public debt limit, public debt obligations in covered benefits funds can only be used to pay for benefits or expenses when cash assets are insufficient. Corresponding debt can be issued for this purpose. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue public debt obligations to obtain cash for payment of benefits or administrative expenses from covered benefits funds, despite the public debt limit. Advance notice must be given to Congress and the Comptroller General before undertaking a sale or redemption authorized under this provision. The Comptroller General reviews compliance with the issuance of public debt obligations and issues findings to Congress. The term \"public debt obligation\" refers to obligations subject to the public debt limit. The term \"Federal fund\" refers to trust funds or Government accounts where the Secretary of the Treasury can issue obligations. The Comptroller General reviews compliance with the issuance of public debt obligations, which are obligations subject to the public debt limit. The Secretary of the Treasury can issue obligations from Federal funds, including the covered benefits fund for retirement, separation, insurance, and survivor benefits. The Unemployment Trust Fund, railroad retirement funds, Department of Defense Education Benefits Fund, Post-Vietnam Era Veterans Education Fund, and Black Lung Disability Trust Fund are included in the provisions. Certain subsections of title 5, United States Code, are repealed. The restoration requirements imposed on the Secretary of the Treasury are retained for actions taken before the date of enactment. The restoration requirements for the Director under subsections of title 5, United States Code, refer to actions taken before the enactment of this Act. After December 31, 2001, there is a limitation on issuing public debt obligations subject to section 3101(b) of title 31, United States Code. However, obligations issued to refund those before January 1, 2002 are exempt. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to manage the cash position of the United States Government based on priorities set by the President when borrowing funds is insufficient due to the limit set in subsection (b) of section 3101. PROHIBITION OF SALES OF ASSETS TO AVOID PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT: No officer or employee of the United States can sell any property to circumvent the public debt limit set forth in section 3101(b) of title 31, United States Code."
