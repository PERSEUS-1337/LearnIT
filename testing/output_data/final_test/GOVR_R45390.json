Views range from advocating for all care to be provided by the VA to utilizing private sector providers for specialized services or to address access barriers. Concerns exist about the potential impact on the quality of care within the VA system. Some stakeholders debate the role of the private sector in providing healthcare for veterans, with concerns about the impact on the quality of care within the VA system. Private sector community providers may lack necessary training for specialized care, but competition could potentially improve services in the VA system. Balancing care between the VA health care system and non-VA providers remains a challenge for policymakers and stakeholders. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 addressed the issue of providers for veterans by establishing the Veterans Community Care Program. This legislation aimed to improve the delivery of healthcare to veterans by involving private sector community providers. The report provides a brief history of legislative changes to community care for veterans, highlighting the establishment of the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) under the VA MISSION Act. It outlines the major provisions of the Act and includes implementation and reporting deadlines. Since the early 1920s, Congress has authorized the VA to contract for care in the community, including language in the World War Veterans Act of 1924. The VA's Hometown Medical Care Program, established in FY1946, allowed for contracting with private facilities in exceptional cases. The Hometown Medical Program, also known as the fee-basis care program, was established by the VA in FY1946. It involved contracts with state medical societies or designated agencies for authorized services, reimbursed based on a VA fee schedule. The program provided outpatient care, including dental care for veterans with service-connected disabilities, saving them time and offering treatment in their hometown by a doctor of their choice. The Veterans' Benefit Act of 1957 authorized the VA to contract with private facilities for hospital care for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The Veterans Health Care Expansion Act of 1973 expanded outpatient care to nonservice-connected veterans. The Veterans Omnibus Health Care Act of 1976 addressed overcrowded conditions in VA health care facilities. The Veterans Omnibus Health Care Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-581) made changes to the fee-basis program, limiting care to specific categories of veterans. The Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1979 (P.L. 96-22) expanded fee-basis care to veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities. The Veterans Omnibus Health Care Act of 1976 and the Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1979 expanded fee-basis care to veterans with disabilities. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 clarified the definition of \"Veterans' Administration facilities\" and authorized the VA to contract for medical care in private facilities. The VA MISSION Act amended the legal framework around existing veterans care programs, including the Veterans Choice Program. The VA MISSION Act amended existing veterans care programs and created new ones, including walk-in care. It also maintained provisions for emergency care and sharing resources with the Department of Defense. The Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA) established the temporary Veterans Choice Program (VCP) to address wait time manipulation and access issues at VHA hospitals. It also created the Veterans Choice Fund (VCF) with $10 billion in appropriations. Challenges in implementing the VCP are documented in various reports and hearings. The Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015 mandated the VA to consolidate existing community care programs, in response to challenges with the Veterans Choice Program. Congress introduced measures to improve access to care, such as the Improving Veterans Access to Care in the Community Act and the Veterans Choice Improvement Act of 2016. At the end of the 114th Congress, no major legislative action occurred to revamp veterans community care programs. In the 115th Congress, implementation issues regarding the Veterans Choice Program (VCP) arose, leading to the passage of P.L. 115-26 to extend the VCP. Additional funding of $4.2 billion was provided through the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 to continue the VCP. The VA submitted a plan to consolidate community care programs to replace the VCP in October 2017. The plan, called the Veterans Coordinated Access & Rewarding Experiences (CARE) plan, focused on eligibility criteria for veterans to access care in the community. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee held a hearing on the CARE plan and other legislative proposals in October 2017. The VA Care in the Community Act (H.R. 4242) was introduced on November 3, 2017. The VA Care in the Community Act (H.R. 4242) was introduced and marked up by the HVAC. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee also marked up a draft measure, but no further action occurred. In the second session of the 115th Congress, provisions of various acts were combined into the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 (H.R. 5674) was introduced and passed into law as S. 2372 (P.L. 115-182) on June 6, 2018, with amendments and technical corrections made by the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2018 (S. 3479; P.L. 115-251). The VA MISSION Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-182) provides $5.2 billion for the VCF. The CBO estimates a total cost of $46.5 billion for implementing all provisions, including $21.4 billion for the Veterans Community Care Program and $6.7 billion for expanding the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-182) provides $6.7 billion for expanding assistance to family caregivers of veterans injured or disabled before September 11, 2001. The CBO estimates that the act would increase the deficit by $5.2 billion over six years and almost $4.5 billion over 11 years. This report summarizes the major provisions of the VA MISSION Act and amendments made by the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2018. The report provides a summary of the VA MISSION Act of 2018, detailing amendments to current law regarding care for service-connected disabilities and disabilities of veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are key entities referenced throughout the report. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 amends current law to provide care for veterans with service-connected disabilities, including total permanent disabilities. It establishes the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) for greater flexibility in accessing community care, hospital care, medical services, and extended care services for enrolled veterans. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 establishes the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) for broader eligibility for enrolled veterans, regardless of service-connected disability. It will replace the current Veterans Choice Program (VCP) one year after enactment. The Act requires the Secretary to set access and quality standards for medical care and extended care services, allowing the VA to enter into Veteran Care Agreements (VCAs) without typical contracting regulations. State Veterans Homes can also enter into VCAs with the VA, not considered federal contracts but still subject to relevant federal laws. Title I of the VA MISSION Act of 2018 expands eligibility for veterans to access walk-in care from private community providers, amends VA's prompt payment standards for all community care providers, requires education programs for veterans on health insurance interactions, improves information sharing with community providers, ensures competency of private community providers, and provides VA clinicians access to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). Title I of the VA MISSION Act of 2018 expands eligibility for veterans to access walk-in care from private community providers and improves information sharing with community providers. It also grants VA clinicians access to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) and establishes a VA Innovation for Care and Payment Center. Additionally, it allows for telemedicine care regardless of location and authorizes pilot programs for innovative payment and healthcare delivery models. The Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers is extended to pre-9/11 veterans with serious service-connected injuries. The \"Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2018\" amends current law to establish the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) for eligible veterans to receive hospital care, medical services, and extended care services from non-VA providers. The program will replace current provisions and require the Secretary to coordinate care provided. Section 1703 of the \"Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2018\" requires the Secretary to coordinate care provided through the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) for eligible veterans. This includes timely scheduling of medical appointments, ensuring continuity of care, coordinating among regional networks, and preventing lapses in care for all eligible veterans. The Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) provides eligible veterans with care through non-VA health care providers like Medicare participants, DOD and IHS medical facilities, FQHCs, and other approved providers. The Secretary can authorize care for eligible veterans through VCCP under specific conditions, subject to annual appropriations. Eligible veterans can elect to receive care through VCCP if certain criteria are met. Eligible veterans can receive care through the Veterans Community Care Program if specific conditions are met, such as the VA not offering required care, not having a full-service facility in the veteran's state, or meeting distance eligibility criteria. Eligible veterans can receive care through the Veterans Community Care Program if the VA is unable to provide care meeting access standards, the veteran's clinician agrees it's in their best interest, or the veteran elects to receive care through VCCP. The VA can authorize care through the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) if a VA medical service line fails to meet access and quality standards. The Secretary must develop these standards, considering factors like timeliness and quality of care. The number of medical service lines compared is limited to three per facility and 36 nationwide. Care under this authorization ends when specified criteria are met. The Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) allows the VA to authorize care when a VA medical service line fails to meet standards. Care ends when the issue is resolved. Eligible veterans can receive care through VCCP until the completion of an episode of care, with coordination ensured by the Secretary. The Secretary must publish a notice annually with details on available care. Appeals for care decisions can be made through VHA's internal process, not the Board of Veterans' Appeals. The Secretary is authorized to develop a tiered network of eligible providers for the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP), with contracts established through competitive bidding. Eligible veterans can choose their own VCCP health care provider, and the Secretary must ensure advanced technology for appointment scheduling. Eligible veterans can make their own appointments using advanced technology. The Secretary is responsible for scheduling appointments and can terminate contracts with health care providers for non-compliance with regulations or quality standards. The Secretary has the authority to terminate contracts with health care providers if they fail to meet contractual obligations or if their continued participation is not in the best interests of veterans or the VA. A report must be submitted to SVAC and HVAC regarding contract terminations, including reasons for termination and the impact of the contractor's failure to meet obligations. The Secretary has the authority to terminate contracts with health care providers for failing to meet obligations. A report must be submitted to SVAC and HVAC detailing the impact of contractor failures and actions taken to mitigate them. The Secretary is required to instruct awarded entities to recognize and accept credentials of providers under community care programs. The Secretary must monitor the quality of care in provider networks before contract renewal. Rates for care under VCCP cannot exceed Medicare rates, except for eligible veterans in rural areas. Alaska follows VA Alaska Fee Schedule, while states with All-Payer Model agreements use Medicare payment rates. The Secretary may establish payment rates for care not covered by Medicare under VCCP. Alternative value-based reimbursement models can be used to promote high-quality care. The Secretary must collect charges for care provided to eligible veterans with third-party insurance. Recovery and collections are limited to what would be payable by a third-party payer. The section outlines copayments for eligible veterans receiving nonservice-connected care, authorizes organ transplants at non-VA facilities, and requires reporting on care provided under VCCP. The report, due within 540 days of the Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2018, and annually after, must include data on top care types not provided by VA, care frequency sought by veterans, reasons for unprovided care, VA steps taken, and VCCP care costs. The Secretary must compile data on care types, patient numbers, gaps in VCCP care, and assessments. The Secretary is required to report on gaps in care and services provided through VCCP community care networks, ways to fix these gaps, total amounts spent by the VA on care for eligible veterans, timeliness of VA referrals to VCCP networks, and timeliness of VCCP networks in accepting referrals and scheduling appointments. The report must also include data on VA medical service lines not meeting standards, use of academic affiliates and federal health care facilities, and must be submitted to SVAC and HVAC within 540 days of enactment and annually thereafter. This section of the legislation prohibits the Secretary from limiting hospital care, medical services, or extended care services under VCCP if it is in the best interest of the eligible veteran. It clarifies that no changes are made to a veteran's eligibility criteria for these services under VCCP. The effective date of VCCP implementation is tied to the exhaustion of funds in the Veterans Choice Fund. This section of the legislation amends current law to authorize the Secretary to enter into agreements with community providers known as Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs) if care cannot be feasibly delivered through VA facilities or other statutory authorities. It also requires the Secretary to continue existing contracts with American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian health care systems. The legislation authorizes the Secretary to enter into Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs) with community providers if care cannot be feasibly delivered through VA facilities. The Secretary must review each VCA of material size at least every four years. Material size for extended care services is defined as exceeding $5 million annually. Eligible entities and providers can enter into VCAs. Entities and providers eligible to enter into Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs) include Medicare providers, State Medicaid program participants, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, centers for independent living, and others determined by the Secretary. The Secretary must establish a certification process with deadlines and standards for approval or denial. The section outlines standards for approval or denial of certification for entities entering Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs), requiring exclusion from federal health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Rates for care under VCAs must be similar to VCCP rates, set by CMS. Regulations will define terms for entering VCAs, with providers required to accept set payment rates and not hold veterans liable. Entities entering Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs) must adhere to set payment rates, not bill veterans' third-party insurance, and meet quality of care standards. The Secretary can discontinue a VCA if the entity fails to comply, is excluded from federal health programs, or has a criminal conviction. The Secretary must establish a monitoring system for quality of care in Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs) and can terminate agreements if they are not in the best interests of veterans or the VA. VCAs are not subject to competitive procedures for federal contracts and entities are not considered federal contractors. However, entities and providers must comply with federal laws on integrity, ethics, fraud, and employment discrimination. This section amends current law to authorize the VA to enter into Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs) with State Veterans Homes, exempting them from certain federal contracting laws and competitive procedures. Eligible individuals for VCAs include those eligible for VA hospital care, medical services, or extended care services. Care provided through VCAs should be similar to care in VA facilities. The VA can enter into Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs) with State Veterans Homes, exempting them from federal contracting laws. State Veterans Homes under VCAs must adhere to federal laws on integrity, ethics, and fraud. New sections require the Secretary to establish access and quality standards for care provided under the VCCP. The Secretary must establish clear access standards for care under the VCCP, consulting various entities. Reports on access standards must be submitted to congressional committees within specific timeframes, with periodic reviews required. The Secretary is required to establish access standards for care under the VCCP, with periodic reviews every three years. Eligible veterans can request care through the VCCP if a VA facility cannot provide care based on these standards. Quality standards for hospital care and medical services must also be established, considering existing health quality measures in both private and public healthcare systems. The Secretary must establish quality standards for health care systems to provide veterans with comparative information. Consultation with various entities is required, and a report detailing the standards must be submitted to specific committees within 270 days of enactment. Updates must be provided periodically, with the first update due 120 days after enactment. Additionally, procedures must be developed to allow certain veterans to access walk-in care through community providers. Eligibility for veterans to access walk-in care clinics is based on receiving VA care within 24 months. Clinics must have agreements with the VA to participate. Walk-in care is defined as nonemergent episodic care. Veterans may have to pay copayments for care at these clinics, depending on their copayment status at VA facilities. The first two visits in a calendar year may be free for veterans not required to pay copayments at VA facilities. The Secretary will determine copayments for walk-in care visits at VA facilities. The first two visits in a calendar year may be free, with additional visits potentially requiring copayments. Regulations must be published within one year of enactment, and quadrennial market area assessments for VHA health care services are required. The VA must assess demand for health care services, capacity of providers, and academic affiliates for veterans' health care. The assessment data will be used for the President's budget request to Congress. The VA is required to submit quadrennial market area assessments to various committees and provide a strategic plan every four years. The OFCCP's moratorium will now apply to VCAs, denying certain previous VA health care providers from serving veterans due to misconduct or loss of medical license. GAO to report on implementation within two years of enactment. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on implementing provisions to improve VA medical service lines that do not meet quality standards. This includes increasing personnel, using hiring incentives like EDRP, providing training, purchasing equipment, and making structural modifications. An annual report to Congress on remediation actions taken is required. Additionally, prompt payment standards for care are outlined in new law 38 U.S.C. \u00a71703D. The new law 38 U.S.C. \u00a71703D outlines prompt payment standards for care provided to eligible veterans in the community. It requires the Secretary to pay health care providers within specific timeframes and mandates timely notification and request for additional information in case of claim denial. Community health care providers must submit claims for payment to the VA within 180 days of providing care. Penalties and civil action apply to false or fraudulent claims. The new law 38 U.S.C. \u00a71703D outlines prompt payment standards for care provided to eligible veterans in the community. Penalties and civil action apply to false or fraudulent claims for payment. Claims pending for more than 45 calendar days (paper) or 30 calendar days (electronic) are considered overdue and subject to the Prompt Payment Act. The Secretary may deduct overpayments and use other means to recover them. The Secretary is required by federal law to provide documentation to community health care providers for clean claims processing. The Secretary may contract with a private medical claims processor for community care claims. A report on adopting a funding mechanism similar to other federal agencies is due within 90 days. A new law authorizes the Secretary to compensate for care provided to veterans. The Secretary is authorized to compensate for care provided to veterans, even without a contract with the VA. This includes recovering costs for nonservice-connected conditions and emergency services for nonveterans. The Secretary can also seek collections for care paid for by the VA. The Secretary is authorized to compensate for care provided to veterans, including nonservice-connected conditions and emergency services. An agreement can be made with a third party for processing medical claims electronically. Education programs are required for veterans on their health care options, VCCP eligibility, and financial obligations. Training programs for VA employees and contractors cover VCCP, reimbursement for non-VA emergency services, safe opioid prescription management, and program administration. The Secretary is required to establish a continuing medical education program for non-VA medical professionals, providing education on identifying and treating conditions of veterans and the VA health care system. The program must have a defined curriculum, credit hour requirements, and be evaluated for effectiveness, with reports submitted to Congress annually. The Secretary must ensure non-VA medical professionals are knowledgeable about opioid-prescribing practices and share medication history of eligible veterans. VA is responsible for monitoring prescriptions as part of the Opioid Safety Initiative. The amended law allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to share VA medical records with non-VA entities for healthcare purposes and with third-party insurance providers for billing. Standards for non-VA providers must focus on clinical areas where VA has expertise, such as PTSD and traumatic brain injuries. The new law allows non-VA community providers to treat eligible veterans for conditions like PTSD, military sexual trauma, and traumatic brain injuries. Providers must meet VA standards and training requirements. VA healthcare providers can now access prescription drug-monitoring programs to check controlled substance prescriptions. VA health care providers in states without a PDMP must join the nearest state or regional PDMP. The Secretary must justify any requested appropriations to Congress and can use remaining VCF funds for community care programs. The Secretary cannot use VCF funds for VCCP and is prohibited from authorizing care under the VCP program after June 6, 2019. VA providers can practice across state lines. The VA finalized a rule on May 11, 2018, to exempt its providers delivering care via telemedicine from certain state licensing laws. The VA MISSION Act codified this rule, allowing VA providers to practice across state lines in VA facilities with clinical privileging and a single state license. The VA MISSION Act allows telemedicine care without geographical barriers, protects VA providers from state licensure issues, and requires annual reports on telemedicine effectiveness. The VA MISSION Act allows telemedicine care without geographical barriers and requires annual reports on telemedicine effectiveness. A new section establishes a Center for Innovation for Care and Payment within the VA to develop innovative approaches for testing payment and service delivery models. The Secretary is prohibited from testing models that would allow the VA to bill Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE. The VA MISSION Act allows telemedicine care without geographical barriers and requires annual reports on telemedicine effectiveness. A new section establishes a Center for Innovation for Care and Payment within the VA to develop innovative approaches for testing payment and service delivery models. The Secretary may waive certain requirements but must notify Congress before doing so. A new law requires the Secretary to provide care to live donors before and after conducting transplant procedures for eligible veterans. Family caregivers are recognized for their significant role in providing personal care services and supports to veterans. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-163) established two programs: General Caregiver Support Services for all veterans and Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers for post-9/11 veterans. Subtitle C expands the Comprehensive Care Program to include pre-9/11 veterans over time. This section expands the Comprehensive Caregiver Program to include pre-9/11 veterans with serious injuries incurred in the line of duty before May 7, 1975. Eligibility is extended over a two-year period after the implementation of an IT system, and after two years, it is extended to all pre-9/11 veterans. The Comprehensive Care Program is extended to all pre-9/11 veterans, expanding eligibility criteria for the Comprehensive Caregiver Program to include veterans in need of personal care services. Assistance available to family caregivers now includes financial planning and legal services. The text chunk discusses amendments to the monthly stipend determination for eligible veterans in need of personal care services provided by their caregivers. It emphasizes the assessment by the family caregiver, the veteran's ability to function independently, and the evaluation of additional support for the family caregiver. The text discusses amendments to evaluate family caregivers' skills for eligible veterans and provide necessary support. It includes entering contracts with entities for assistance, ensuring quality services, and compensating providers. The text discusses amending the definition of personal care services for veterans to include supervision based on symptoms or impairment. It also mandates the implementation of an IT system to support the Comprehensive Caregiver Program and assess program effectiveness. The Secretary is required to use an IT system to monitor and assess program workload for the Comprehensive Caregiver Program. A report must be submitted to relevant committees on the status of the IT system development and deployment, including an assessment of family caregiver needs and resource requirements. The GAO will review the report and update committees on the Secretary's progress in implementing the IT system. The Secretary is required to submit a final report by October 1, 2019, on the implementation of the IT system and program monitoring. Reporting requirements have been added to the annual evaluation report regarding caregiver programs, including barriers to accessing care and training sufficiency for family caregivers. The VHA operates in approximately 5,670 buildings. The VHA operates in numerous buildings and leased facilities. The CARES program was established in 2000 to evaluate veterans' healthcare needs and realign VA infrastructure. The DNCP recommended closing seven VA facilities and eliminating duplicative services at over 30 other locations. The DNCP recommended closing VA facilities in Canandaigua, NY; Pittsburgh, PA; Lexington, KY; Cleveland, OH; Gulfport, MS; Waco, TX; and Livermore, CA. New major medical facilities were proposed for Las Vegas, NV, and East Central, FL. Infrastructure upgrades were recommended at various sites. A 16-member independent commission was appointed to study the draft plan. The CARES Commission reviewed proposals outside the federal government using six factors. They conducted public hearings and site visits in 2003, submitting recommendations to the Secretary in February 2004. The final CARES plan, announced in May 2004, included consolidating facilities, building new hospitals in Orlando and Las Vegas, adding new CBOCs and centers, and expanding mental health services. Critics argued against closures. Critics of the CARES plan raised concerns about the closure of VA medical facilities, questioning the lack of assessment for long-term care and mental health needs. Some believed the plan did not address future nursing home needs and could lead to privatization. Veterans' groups doubted that new facilities would be built, and Congress members felt they had little control over the process. The Independent Assessment found that current facilities often do not meet current needs. The majority of VHA hospitals were designed for inpatient care, but now outpatient clinic workload has increased significantly. Facilities need upgrades to meet current care models and provide adequate space for veteran care. As facilities age and care shifts to outpatient settings, the capital needs of VHA could continue to grow. The Commission on Care was established to examine veterans' access to healthcare. The VACAA established a commission to examine veterans' access to healthcare and recommended developing a strategy for managing VHA's facility and capital asset needs. The HVAC began examining VA's capital asset program in 2017, with some recommendations accepted and others rejected. On November 3, 2017, the VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Act of 2017 (H.R. 4243) was introduced based on input from stakeholders. It became Title II of the VA MISSION Act, establishing a process for modernizing VHA facilities. The VA will develop criteria for selecting facilities to dispose of, modernize, or acquire to better meet veterans' healthcare needs. Recommendations will be submitted to the Asset Infrastructure Review Commission for review before being sent to the President. The VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Act of 2017 established a process for modernizing VHA facilities. An independent commission, known as the Asset and Infrastructure Commission, reviews recommendations for realignment and modernization of VHA facilities. The President can approve or disapprove the list of recommendations, with VA required to implement approved recommendations within three years unless Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval. The Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission, established by the VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Act of 2017, consists of nine members appointed by the President with Senate approval. The President must consult with congressional leaders and veterans organizations when selecting nominees. The Commission must reflect the demographics of veterans and include members with specific healthcare and asset management experience. The Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission, established by the VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Act of 2017, consists of nine members appointed by the President with Senate approval. Nominations for the Commission must be submitted by May 31, 2021. The Commission will meet in 2022 and 2023, with all proceedings open to the public. Members serve without pay, and a Director will be appointed.

Nominations for the Commission must be submitted by May 31, 2021. The Commission will meet in 2022 and 2023, with all proceedings open to the public. Members serve without pay, and a Director will be appointed. The Commission shall appoint a Director who has not served as an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the one-year period preceding the date of such appointment, and who is not otherwise barred or prohibited from serving as Director under federal ethics laws and regulations. The Director shall be paid at the rate of basic pay established for Level IV of the Executive Schedule. The Director may, with the approval of the Commission, appoint and fix the pay of additional personnel. Not more than two-thirds of the personnel employed by or detailed to the Commission may be on detail from the VA. A person may not be detailed from the VA if, within the previous six months, that person participated substantially in the development of recommendations regarding VHA facilities. The head of any federal department or agency may provide detailees to the Commission. To the extent funds are available, the Commission may (1) procure the temporary or.

Nominations for the Commission must be submitted by May 31, 2021. The Commission may procure temporary services of experts, lease real property, and acquire personal property. It shall terminate on December 31, 2023. VA employees can communicate with the Commission freely, except for unlawful communications. The Secretary must publish criteria for modernization and realignment of VHA facilities by February 1, 2021, after consulting with VSOs. There is a 90-day public comment period, and final criteria must be published by May 31, 2021. The VA must consult with VSOs to develop recommendations for the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission by May 31, 2021. The recommendations must consider factors like efficient access to healthcare for veterans and the reconfiguration of federal properties. The final recommendations must be published by January 31, 2022. The VA must consider factors such as reducing operating costs, aligning real property with the VA's mission, and assessing staffing levels when providing health care services to veterans. Other considerations include potential costs and savings, impact on other VA missions, stakeholder inputs, and commercial market assessments. The VA is required to assess the capacity of each VISN and medical facility to provide care to veterans, identify gaps, and fill them through various means. This includes forecasting demand, conducting market assessments, and considering federal resources and personnel.

All information used to prepare recommendations must be made available to the Commission and the Comptroller General. The Commission must conduct public hearings on the VA's recommendations, including regions affected by a recommendation to close or modernize a facility. Witnesses at each hearing must include a veteran enrolled in the VA health care system and a local elected official. The Commission must transmit its recommendations to the President by January 31, 2023, and can deviate from the VA's recommendations under certain conditions. The Commission must notify the proposed change in the Federal Register at least 45 days before sending recommendations to the President and hold public hearings. It must justify any differing recommendations from the VA, submit reports to Congress, and provide information upon request. The President must approve or disapprove the Commission's recommendations by February 15, 2023. If approved, the President must transmit the recommendations to Congress. The President must transmit the Commission's recommendations to Congress with a certificate of approval. If the President disapproves, reasons must be given by March 1, 2023. The Commission will review and provide revised recommendations by March 15, 2023. If approved, the President must transmit the revised recommendations to Congress by March 23. The VA must implement Commission recommendations within three years of the President's report to Congress. If a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, facility projects cannot proceed. The Secretary is authorized to modernize or realign facilities and undertake necessary actions, subject to congressional approval. The VA is authorized to reimburse federal agencies for work performed at its request, carry out environmental mitigation, and comply with historic preservation requirements for surplus properties. The Secretary may use delegated authorities to transfer or dispose of surplus real property at VHA facilities. Consultation with state governors and local government heads is required before disposing of surplus real property. The VA must consult with state governors and local government heads before disposing of surplus real property. The Secretary may transfer the title of a VHA facility approved for closure to a redevelopment authority for leasing to a federal department or agency for up to 50 years without rental payments. Environmental and liability laws apply to property transfers, and the McKinney-Vento Act applies to VA facility closures. The McKinney-Vento Act applies to VA facility closures, and the National Environmental Policy Act applies during real property disposal and relocation of functions. The Secretary can close or realign VHA facilities without restrictions on fund use or compliance costs. Transfer of facilities may occur if compliance costs exceed fair market value. The VA can close or realign VHA facilities without fund use restrictions. Transfer of facilities may occur if compliance costs exceed fair market value. A VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Account is established to receive funds from property disposal. The account can be used for facility disposal and construction costs. The VA must provide a budget justification display for the account's credits and expenditures. The VA must provide budget justification for the VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Account. The account will be closed as per appropriations accounts procedures, with unobligated funds held by the Treasury until transferred by the VA Secretary. Expedited procedures are defined for congressional consideration of the commission report, streamlining the process for introducing joint resolutions of disapproval. The commission procedure establishes expedited congressional consideration for introducing joint resolutions of disapproval. A simple majority in the Senate can call up and vote on the measure without needing 60 votes for cloture. Joint disapproval resolutions must be submitted within five days of the President transmitting a certified commission report to Congress. The commission procedure allows for expedited congressional consideration of joint resolutions of disapproval. Resolutions can be referred to the SVAC or other House committees. Multiple disapproval resolutions can be introduced, but submission is not mandatory. The text of the disapproval resolution must be specified, and it cannot contain a preamble. The joint resolution of disapproval under expedited procedures must not include a preamble. The title should be \"Joint resolution disapproving the recommendations of the VHA Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission.\" The resolution states that Congress disapproves the recommendations submitted by the President. The commission procedure sets deadlines for House and Senate committees to act on the resolution and allows for its removal if they do not comply. The expedited provisions ensure that a joint resolution of disapproval cannot be delayed or blocked in committee. If a committee does not act on the resolution within a specified timeframe, it is automatically discharged, and the resolution is placed on the chamber's calendar. Amendments to the resolution cannot be reported by the committee. After the expedited provisions, if a House committee has reported a joint resolution of disapproval or been discharged from further consideration, any Member can move to proceed to consider the measure on the House floor. The motion is not debatable and cannot be made if the House has already dealt with a similar motion. If adopted, the House would immediately consider the joint resolution of disapproval, with all points of order waived. In the Senate, a motion to proceed to consider a joint resolution of disapproval is not debatable and may not be postponed. A motion to reconsider the vote on the motion to proceed is not allowed. This provision allows for repeated motions to proceed until it passes, encouraging a vote on the joint resolution of disapproval. If a motion to proceed is defeated, supporters can reoffer it until it passes or force the chamber to dispose of repeated motions. Once adopted, the Senate will immediately consider the joint resolution, which becomes the unfinished business until disposed of. Floor consideration rules vary between the House and Senate, with the Senate allowing unlimited debate unless cloture is invoked or special procedures are used. Floor consideration of a commission joint resolution of disapproval is limited in both houses, with debate restricted to two hours. Amendments and motions that could delay consideration are not allowed under the commission procedure. Floor consideration of a joint resolution of disapproval is limited to two hours with no amendments or motions to delay. Once a chamber decides to take up the resolution, a final vote is inevitable. A motion to recommit or reconsider the vote is not allowed, and all votes are simple majority votes. Before voting on its own disapproval resolution, if a chamber receives a joint resolution from the other chamber, it can proceed with its own resolution until final disposition. The Senate can expedite a House joint resolution if it does not introduce its own. If the Senate receives a House companion measure after passing a joint resolution, the House measure is nondebatable. The Senate must treat a joint resolution of disapproval as nondebatable. To become law, it needs the President's signature, override his veto with a two-thirds vote, or become law without his signature. The expedited procedure can be altered by either chamber of Congress. The rules governing expedited procedures, including those for the Commission, can be changed or waived by either chamber of Congress at any time. This can be done through special rules, suspension of rules, or unanimous consent agreements in the House, and by unanimous consent or suspension in the Senate. The expedited procedures in the statute can be altered or suspended by unanimous consent or the suspension of rules. The VA must publish online any information related to the act within 24 hours. The VA is prohibited from halting VHA construction projects, long-term planning of VHA infrastructure, or VHA budget processes due to approved recommendations. The VA can include other capital asset processes in its budget submissions after consulting with VSOs. This section defines terms like Facility and Land. The curr_chunk defines terms related to facility management, including Facility, Infrastructure, Modernization, Realignment, and Redevelopment authority. It outlines actions such as construction, purchase, lease, sharing, closure, disposals, exchanges, and collaborations between VA and other entities. The curr_chunk discusses the responsibilities of the redevelopment authority in developing and implementing a plan for the closure or realignment of VHA facilities. It also mandates training programs for construction and facilities management personnel, OMB review of VA-enhanced use leases, and a report assessing the VA's ability to provide services to veterans in U.S. territories. The report focuses on addressing VHA clinical workforce shortages by amending and creating programs to provide scholarships, loan repayments, and bonuses to VA personnel in hard-to-recruit fields. It aims to prioritize recruiting physicians and extend the Health Professional Scholarship Program's authorization. Additionally, it amends the Education Debt Reduction Program to provide loan repayment to VHA clinical employees in hard-to-recruit fields. The Debt Reduction Program is being amended to increase limits and add new provider types eligible for loan repayment. A pilot program is also being created to recruit veterans into medical schools in exchange for clinical care commitments at the VHA. Changes are being made to the Health Professional Scholarships program to ensure at least 50% of scholarships go to individuals in medicine or dentistry training programs. The Health Professional Scholarships program requires physicians and dentists to serve as full-time VHA employees for 18 months for each year of scholarship support received. The program aims to address staffing shortages by awarding scholarships to individuals in training to become physicians and dentists, with a preference for Veteran applicants. The section amends various statutes related to the Health Professional Scholarships program, including extending the program's authority to December 31, 2033, increasing the maximum forgiveness amounts under the EDRP to $200,000 total and $40,000 annually, and requiring the VA to assess the demand for loan repayment and staffing needs within one year of enactment. The new provision creates the Department of Veterans Affairs Specialty Education Loan Repayment Program to recruit physicians in hard-to-fill specialties for the VA. It includes eligibility criteria, funding preferences, payment amounts, and service requirements. The Secretary is required to report on loan repayment demand, staffing needs, and overall demand for medical professionals to congressional committees. The new provision in Title 38 U.S.C. establishes the Department of Veterans Affairs Specialty Education Loan Repayment Program to recruit physicians in hard-to-fill specialties for the VA. It includes eligibility criteria, funding preferences, payment amounts, and service requirements. The Secretary must consider VHA's staffing needs for the future, assess facility underservice, establish a pilot program for 18 eligible veterans in medical school, and set specific eligibility criteria for veterans applying to the program. Eligible veterans can apply for admission to covered medical schools in 2019 under Title 38 U.S.C. Chapters 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, or 35 or Title 10 U.S.C. Chapters 1606 or 1607. They must meet minimum admission criteria, agree to a service commitment to the VA, and may receive support for medical school expenses. Covered schools must reserve two seats for eligible veterans with the highest admissions rankings. Eligible veterans must complete medical school, residency training, and obtain a medical license to receive support. They must serve as a full-time clinical practice employee at the VA for four years. The provision allows covered medical schools to accept up to two eligible veterans for the 2019 entering class. A report evaluating the pilot program must be submitted to Congress annually. The section increases bonuses for VA employees and ensures Vet Center clinical staff can participate in the Education Debt Reduction Program. It aims to improve health services for veterans in underserved areas by designating VA facilities accordingly. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 addresses shortages of health professionals by designating underserved VA facilities and implementing provisions to address staffing issues. It establishes mobile teams for clinical services and a medical residency training program at certain facilities, including those operated by the Indian Health Service. Prior to this act, the VA lacked a process to designate facilities as underserved. The VA designates underserved tribes or prisoners based on specific criteria to direct resources, such as loan repayment for providers and higher reimbursement rates. The VA supports medical residency training through partnerships with non-VA hospitals and medical schools, covering resident training costs during their time at VA facilities. The VA is increasing GME positions by 1,500 over 10 years, focusing on primary care and mental health. Expansion includes new programs in underserved areas, with completion targeted for 2025. VA supports resident training at VA facilities, not at non-VA facilities. The GAO has raised concerns about medical residency training, emphasizing the need for more training in rural areas and outpatient settings. The Teaching Health Center GME Program funds training in outpatient settings, particularly at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). The Choice GME expansion prioritized training in rural or underserved areas but did not require training in outpatient settings. The VA is required to establish GME programs at community-based facilities under a pilot program. The VA is required to establish GME programs at community-based facilities, including those operated by FQHCs, IHS, or Indian Tribes, or at underserved VA facilities. The VA would pay for program development costs and residents' time when not in training at VA facilities. Criteria will be developed to designate medical centers, ambulatory care facilities, and CBOCs as underserved facilities based on various factors. The section requires VISN directors to determine annually which facilities are underserved based on specific criteria. The Secretary must submit an annual plan to Congress to address these underserved facilities, including personnel-related elements like mobile deployment teams and hiring incentives. A three-year pilot program for mobile deployment teams will be implemented. The Secretary is mandated to establish a three-year pilot program providing mobile deployment teams to underserved facilities, considering staffing and oversight elements. Annual plans will guide the composition of these teams with necessary medical personnel. Reporting to Congress is required within one year of enactment, with a final report due upon program termination, including recommendations for extending or making the pilot program permanent. The Secretary is required to establish a pilot program to create medical residency positions at covered facilities, including IHS, Indian Tribes, FQHCs, DOD facilities, or other designated facilities. The program will place at least 100 residents in these facilities, considering factors like the ratio of veterans to providers, specialty of providers, and HPSA designation. The pilot program requires the Secretary to place at least 100 residents in covered facilities, including those operated by IHS, Indian Tribes, or underserved areas. Stipends and benefits are authorized regardless of VA facility assignment. Covered facilities establishing new residency programs will be reimbursed for associated costs. Annual reports to Congress are mandated, with the program set to terminate on August 7, 2024. The pilot program requires the Secretary to place residents in covered facilities, with stipends and benefits authorized regardless of VA facility assignment. It mandates annual reports to Congress and terminates on August 7, 2024. The title addresses various topics within the VA, including performance awards, bonuses for high-level employees, appointment of podiatrists to supervisory positions, publicizing staffing information, raising the dollar threshold for congressional authorization of major medical facility projects, and authorizing specific projects like the East Bay CBOC and Central Valley Engineering and Logistics support facility. The title establishes pilot programs for peer specialists on patient-aligned care teams and increased use of medical scribes at VAMCs. It also postpones VA Home Loan guarantee fee reductions and extends the $90 per month limit on VA pension for certain veterans. Additionally, it authorizes $5.2 billion for VCF to continue VCP. The new law requires the Secretary to report annually on performance awards and bonuses for high-level employees. It also allows the appointment of podiatrists to supervisory positions in the VHA. The new law allows podiatrists to be appointed to supervisory positions within the VHA and includes them in the physician and dentist pay schedule. It also defines a major medical facility as any facility under the jurisdiction of the Secretary for healthcare services. The new law increases the dollar threshold for congressional authorization of major medical facility projects to $20 million. It authorizes specific projects in Livermore, CA including the construction of a new East Bay CBOC, Central Valley Engineering/Logistics support facility, and flood plain mitigation at CBOCs. The Secretary must submit a report on facility projects. The Secretary is required to submit a report on facility projects, including expenditures and future budget amounts, within 90 days of enactment. Up to $117.3 million is authorized for these projects. Information on filled positions, accessions, vacancies, and new hires must be published on the VA website by VAMC, updated quarterly. The Secretary can withhold sensitive information like law enforcement details. The Secretary is required to establish a program to assign peer specialists to patient-aligned care teams in the VA to promote mental health services. The program must be implemented in at least 15 VAMCs by May 31, 2019, and in at least 30 VAMCs by May 31, 2020. Selection criteria for VAMCs to establish the program are specified. The criteria for selecting VAMCs to establish the peer specialists program include having at least 5 polytrauma centers and 10 nonpolytrauma centers. The Secretary must also consider feasibility in rural areas, areas not near military installations, and different geographical locations. Female veterans' needs should be considered, with female peer specialists available. A report to Congress on program progress is required, along with recommendations for expanding the program. The Secretary must establish a two-year pilot program to increase the use of medical scribes in at least 10 VAMCs, with specific locations in rural, urban, and areas in need of increased access. The VA must hire 20 new medical scribes and contract with entities for 20 more. Medical scribes will be assigned to physicians in emergency and specialty care, with 30% in emergency care and 70% in specialty care with long patient wait times. The VA will employ medical scribes in specialty care with long patient wait times or low efficiency ratings. The Secretary must report to Congress every 180 days on the pilot program's progress. An analysis on medical scribes under contract is required, including metrics on provider efficiency, patient satisfaction, and wait times. The GAO must submit a report to Congress within 90 days after the pilot program ends. The GAO is required to submit a report to Congress on the pilot program involving medical scribes in specialty care. The program defines a medical scribe as an individual assisting physicians in entering information into electronic health records. Additionally, the authorization period for certain veterans to obtain home-loan guarantees from the VA is extended until September 30, 2028. The VA pension benefits for veterans and survivors in Medicaid-approved nursing homes will be reduced to $90 per month until September 30, 2028. $5.2 billion is authorized and appropriated for the VCF established by VACAA, with funds remaining without fiscal year limitation. The VA MISSION Act's budgetary effects are not included in PAYGO scorecards, preventing sequestration. The CBO estimates the act will increase the deficit by $5.2 billion over six years and almost $4.5 billion over 11 years. PAYGO scorecards track budget deficit changes from legislative actions on mandatory spending and revenues. PAYGO scorecards at year-end would trigger mandatory spending reductions through sequestration."
