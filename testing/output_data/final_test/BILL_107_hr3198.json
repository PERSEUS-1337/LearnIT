    "content": "The \"Agricultural Terrorism Prevention and Response Act of 2001\" enhances security for the United States agricultural production and food supply system. Congress finds that the agricultural production sector in the US economy contributes 13% to the gross national product and is vulnerable to terrorism, especially attacks targeting key food commodities with harmful agents. The United States agricultural sector is vulnerable to terrorist attacks involving contagious agents that could damage public confidence in the food supply. The sector is at risk due to the lack of natural resistance to foreign diseases, concentration of crops and animals in fewer facilities, and frequent transport among these facilities. Terrorism threats to agriculture should be prioritized and addressed in a coordinated manner. The Department of Agriculture must strengthen its internal and external structures to defend against terrorism threats to the United States agricultural sector. It is a critical component in dealing with such threats and must be positioned to anticipate and protect against them. An Interagency Agricultural Terrorism Committee should be established to prioritize and address these threats in a coordinated manner. The President will establish an Interagency Agricultural Terrorism Committee to coordinate counterterrorism efforts for protecting the US agricultural production and food supply system. Key agencies involved include the Department of Agriculture, US Customs Service, FDA, and State departments of agriculture. The committee's responsibilities include preparing a plan defining each agency's role. The Interagency Agricultural Terrorism Committee is responsible for preparing a plan defining the role of each agency in safeguarding agricultural production, improving crisis planning, safeguarding critical infrastructures, and supporting research efforts related to counterterrorism capabilities. The Department of Agriculture is required to cooperate with other agencies involved in counterterrorism programs. The Department of Agriculture collaborates with the National Security Council on food and agricultural protection issues in counterterrorism efforts. The Department of Agriculture Counterterrorism Policy Council, chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, coordinates department-wide support for terrorism issues. An agricultural liaison on terrorism reports to the Homeland Security Office for all agricultural security and terrorism threats. The Secretary of Agriculture establishes an Industry Working Group on Agricultural Terrorism to develop measures against threats to the food supply system. Training programs for producers are also set up. Increased resources are needed for surveillance and detection of agricultural terrorism threats at State and Federal levels. To enhance interception of harmful agricultural products at ports of entry, more inspectors and detection devices will be deployed. Additionally, a Biosafety Level 4 facility will be established at the Plum Island Diagnostic Laboratory to develop tests and vaccines for protecting the swine industry from biological threats like the Nipah virus. This facility will prevent microorganism contact with personnel and environmental escape, while also creating a database to link animal and human disease information systems."
