    "content": "The Congress acknowledges that some Americans have sincere conscientious objections to funding military expenditures through taxes. To address this, the policy aims to allow conscientious objectors to pay their full tax liability without compromising their beliefs, reduce administrative burden, recognize conscientious objector status for tax purposes, and allocate funds for nonmilitary use through congressional appropriations. The United States Peace Tax Fund is established to allow conscientious objectors to pay taxes without funding military expenditures. The United States Peace Tax Fund is created as a special trust fund within the Treasury of the United States to receive amounts equivalent to certain taxes designated by individuals for peace-related purposes. The United States Peace Tax Fund is established within the Treasury to receive designated taxes for peace-related purposes. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers funds monthly based on estimates and reports annually to Congress on the total amount transferred into the Fund. SEC. 4. INCOME TAX PAYMENTS TO UNITED STATES PEACE TAX FUND. This section allows individuals to designate their income tax payments to be transferred to the United States Peace Tax Fund. Every eligible individual (other than a nonresident alien) with an income tax liability of $1 or more can designate their tax payment to the United States Peace Tax Fund if they are conscientiously opposed to war participation due to religious beliefs and have been exempted from military service. The text chunk discusses the verification process for taxpayers who designate their tax payment to the United States Peace Tax Fund if they are conscientiously opposed to war participation. Taxpayers must attach a questionnaire return receipt to their tax return as proof of their conscientious objection. The Secretary may require additional information from taxpayers who designate their tax payment to the United States Peace Tax Fund to verify their eligibility. If the Secretary determines a taxpayer is not eligible, they can deny the designation, and the taxpayer can challenge this decision. The Secretary can be challenged in court for a ruling on a taxpayer's eligibility for designating their tax payment. Income tax liability is the tax amount reduced by credits and designated amounts. The term 'income tax payment' refers to taxes paid or withheld by a taxpayer for a taxable year, not exceeding their income tax liability. Designation can be made at the time of filing the tax return or at a later time specified by regulations. The Secretary prescribes the manner of designation, with specific rules if made at the time of filing the tax return. Designation of income tax payment for a taxable year must be made on the page with the taxpayer's signature. In the case of a joint return, with the spouse's consent, the joint income tax payment can be designated. General instructions for income tax returns must include an explanation of the United States Peace Tax Fund purposes, criteria for eligibility, and the process for making the designation. Designation of income tax payments for transfer to United States Peace Tax Fund is provided in this section. Clerical amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to add a new part for this purpose. Additionally, information regarding the designation process is included in the amendments. The section outlines the requirement for taxpayers to submit a questionnaire return when making a designation for the United States Peace Tax Fund. The return must certify the taxpayer's beliefs about participation in war and how it affects their life. Upon receipt, the Secretary will issue a receipt indicating timely filing. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993, and any taxable year ending before January 1, 1994, if the time for filing a claim for refund has not expired. Penalties for failure to pay tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be vacated and set aside. Penalties for failure to pay tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be vacated if the person pays the tax due with interest and proves conscientious objection to war participation. Amounts collected will be transferred to a Fund for specific purposes outlined in the Act. SEC. 5. ESTATE TAX PAYMENTS TO UNITED STATES PEACE TAX FUND. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow estate tax payments to be designated for transfer to the United States Peace Tax Fund. An eligible individual may elect to transfer the tax imposed on their estate to the United States Peace Tax Fund. The election can be made by the executor or administrator of the estate with written authority from the decedent, as prescribed by the Secretary. Designation of estate tax and gift tax payments can be transferred to the United States Peace Tax Fund. The amendments apply to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1993. An eligible individual may elect to transfer the tax imposed by section 2501 to the United States Peace Tax Fund. The election must be made as prescribed by the Secretary. A new section 2506 is added to designate gift tax payments for transfer to the Fund. These amendments apply to gifts made after December 31, 1993. The Comptroller General certifies the percentage of military appropriations each fiscal year to Congress and the President. A certain portion of the Fund is authorized for appropriation annually based on the transferred funds and determined percentage. The remaining funds in the Fund will accrue interest at the prevailing rate of long-term Government bonds. Any surplus after deductions is transferred to the general fund of the Treasury, with restrictions on military expenditures. SEC. 8. ELIGIBLE APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nFunds appropriated under section 7(b) can be used for grants, loans, or arrangements for specific activities like WIC, Head Start, US Institute of Peace, and Peace Corps. The Fund should not replace funds for military expenses.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.
