    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1995\" and includes definitions. The \"Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1995\" provides definitions for key terms used in the Act. Damage is defined as any impact or contact with an underground facility requiring repair. Excavation is defined as any operation involving moving earth, rock, or material, excluding certain agricultural and lawn/garden practices. The \"Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as excavation, excavator, facility operator, person, Secretary, State, and State program. It excludes certain activities like normal lawn and garden practices and grave excavation in a cemetery. The \"Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1995\" defines key terms related to excavation and establishes the requirement for a one-call notification system for underground facilities in interstate commerce. Within 1 year of this Act's enactment, the Secretary will establish a nationwide toll-free telephone number system for State one-call notification systems. Each State must consider adopting a comprehensive one-call notification program to protect underground facilities from excavation damage. The program should include public notice, hearing, and compliance within 3 years. Failure to comply may result in consequences. If a State fails to comply with the one-call notification program requirements, the Secretary or an aggrieved party can take civil action to compel compliance. States have the authority to determine if adopting the program is appropriate under their own laws. The State program must include specific elements as outlined in Section 5. Each State's consideration under section 4(a) must include program elements for a one-call notification system that applies to all excavators and facility operators, operates statewide without duplication, records excavation information, notifies facility operators of nearby excavations, and informs excavators of notified operators. The State program must notify operators of excavation plans, provide 24-hour emergency coverage, ensure public awareness of the one-call number and program requirements, inform excavators of State procedures, and require contact with the one-call system based on excavation type. The State program must require facility operators to mark their facilities at excavation sites, enforce penalties, establish fees, allow citizen suits for enforcement, and mandate railroad accident reporting. Excavation by or for a person is exempt from these requirements. The State program may exempt a person from contacting the one-call notification system before excavation if the person owns or leases the property and operates all underground facilities at the site. SEC. 6. PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT. Penalties for violations of State excavation programs include administrative or civil penalties, with increased penalties for damage exceeding $50,000 or resulting in death or serious bodily harm. Reduced penalties may be considered for promptly reported violations. Equitable relief and mandamus actions are also part of State considerations. Consideration under section 4(a) includes provisions for equitable relief and mandamus actions. Each State must also consider procedures for issuing citations of violations at the site and time of the violation. \"Grants to states are provided under Section 7.\" The Secretary will make grants to States or operators of one-call notification systems to establish or improve systems using allocated funds for fiscal years 1996-1998. Grants can be used for enhancing communication systems within one-call notification systems. The Secretary may provide grants to States for improving communication systems, location capabilities, record retention, public information campaigns, enforcement mechanisms, and other purposes of the Act. States may receive grants for programs that are equally protective of public health and safety as described in the Act. The Department of Commerce is addressed in Section 8 of the Act. The Secretary will coordinate with other federal agencies to implement the Act and review Department of Commerce programs for alignment. A model State program will be developed within a year of enactment. The Secretary will develop a model State program for enforcement, which may be amended based on reports from States or workshops. The program will include elements of a State program and may incorporate a one-call notification system for excavations. The excavator must contact the one-call notification system and provide their name, address, telephone number, specific location, starting date, and description of the intended excavation activity. Records of each notice of intent to excavate must be maintained for a certain period. The regulations include provisions for maintaining records for claims, providing information on excavation requirements, contacting the one-call notification system before excavation, and having alternative notification procedures for ongoing excavation activities. The regulations require facility operators to locate and mark their underground facilities within 2 business days of notification before excavation, following specific color codes or identification standards. Excavators must be notified if no monitoring is in place. Procedures for improving underground facility location capabilities, including notifying excavators and facility operators of any new information. The Secretary shall conduct workshops with stakeholders to improve underground facility location capabilities and ensure timely compliance with State program requirements, including procedures for licensing and revocation of permits for habitual violators. The Secretary will work with stakeholders to develop and promote a model program for one-call notification systems, as well as public education initiatives to raise awareness about these systems. State reports are required under this Act, with an initial report due within 3 years of enactment and status reports due within 4.5 years and annually thereafter. A simplified reporting form will be developed by the Secretary within 3 years of enactment. Additionally, more protective systems will be implemented under Section 10. Section 10 of the Act allows states to implement more protective systems for underground facilities. Section 11 emphasizes the purchase of American-made equipment and products with funds from the Act and requires recipients of financial assistance to be notified about this preference."
