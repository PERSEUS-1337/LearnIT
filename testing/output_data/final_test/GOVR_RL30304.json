    "content": "The federal government imposes excise taxes on motor fuels for highway use, with rates of 18.3 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon for diesel fuel. An additional 0.1 cents per gallon tax funds fuel regulation expenses. These rates have not been adjusted for inflation since 1993. Special motor fuels like kerosene and compressed natural gas have specific tax rates. Taxes do not apply to non-highway use fuels or federal government fuel purchases. Revenue from these taxes goes to the Highway Trust Fund and Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is a federal transportation fund divided into mass transit and highways accounts. It mainly supports state and local highway and transit programs, with fuel taxes historically providing 90% of its revenue. The LUST Trust Fund receives 0.1 cents per gallon from fuel taxes and is used for EPA expenses related to underground storage tank leaks. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the Highway Trust Fund's sustainability due to declining tax collections from inflation, improved vehicle fuel efficiency, and less growth in vehicle miles traveled. Future declines in tax collections are expected due to scheduled increases in corporate average fuel economy standards. Congress has temporarily prevented shortfalls in the HTF by transferring money from the Treasury's general fund and the LUST Trust Fund. Increasing excise tax rates or finding other revenue sources are being considered by some Members of Congress. Some Members of Congress are considering increasing excise tax rates or cutting programs to address declining tax collections for the Highway Trust Fund. This report provides an overview of the federal motor fuels excise tax and analyzes tax collections from gasoline and diesel motor fuels for highway use. It also includes a legislative history of the gas tax dating back to 1932. Issues related to infrastructure financing are not covered in this report. The curr_chunk provides additional analysis and resources on transportation finance issues, including federal highway finance options, economic effects of gasoline tax changes, transportation spending programs, and infrastructure financing. It references various CRS reports for more in-depth information on these topics. Federal tax rates on motor fuels for transportation purposes are detailed in various CRS reports. Gasoline is taxed at 18.3 cents per gallon, diesel at 24.3 cents per gallon, with an additional 0.1 cents per gallon for the LUST Trust Fund. Alternative fuels like liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas are taxed at different rates. Gasoline and diesel tax rates are set to decrease to the permanent law rate. The tax rates on gasoline and diesel motor fuels are set to decrease to 4.3 cents per gallon after September 30, 2022, with the expiration of the 0.1 cent LUST Fund Tax. The history of the motor fuels excise tax dates back to 1932 when it was used for deficit reduction and later transferred to the Highway Trust Fund in 1956. Gas tax rates were raised in the 1990s for HTF funding and deficit reduction purposes. The motor fuels excise tax history dates back to 1932, with rates raised in the 1990s for Highway Trust Fund funding. State and local governments also levy their own fuel excise taxes, with varying administration rules. The point of taxation for fuel varies by state, with some taxing at the distributor level and others at the bulk terminal. Federal excise taxes are collected by the IRS when fuel is removed from storage terminals, contributing to fuel price variations. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) was self-sustaining through motor fuel taxes before 2008 but has faced revenue shortfalls since then, requiring funding transfers from the Treasury. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has faced revenue shortfalls since 2008, requiring transfers from the Treasury's general fund to meet obligations. Congress has transferred over $139.9 billion to the HTF to prevent shortfalls, with additional transfers from the LUST Trust Fund. Concerns have been raised about the HTF's ability to be self-financed. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has faced revenue shortfalls since 2008, requiring transfers from the Treasury's general fund to meet obligations. Congress has transferred over $139.9 billion to the HTF to prevent shortfalls, with additional transfers from the LUST Trust Fund. Concerns have been raised about the HTF's ability to be self-financed. While ad hoc transfers in general funding would not enable the HTF to be self-sustaining, they could ensure that HTF obligations to the states are met through FY2020. Members have discussed options to raise the federal gas tax to offset inflation and address projected HTF shortfalls. President Obama signed the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 to provide short-term reauthorization for the HTF. The House and Senate approved a $10.8 billion extension of HTF expenditure authority to fund transportation programs through May 31, 2015. The funding came from transfers from the general fund and the LUST Trust Fund. The Senate adopted the legislative language in the House bill on August 31, 2014. The Senate adopted the House bill's legislative language on August 31, 2014, one day before the Department of Transportation was to implement emergency cash management procedures for highway programs. P.L. 113-159 funded surface transportation programs for approximately nine months through May 2015, with transfers from the general fund and the LUST Trust Fund. Funding provisions in P.L. 113-159 were included in both House and Senate bills, with additional Senate provisions focused on tax compliance and modernization. The Senate bill included provisions for tax compliance and modernization, as well as lowering the tax rate on liquefied petroleum gas. There were discussions on longer-term changes to funding the Highway Trust Fund, including proposals to increase the gas tax or transfer more responsibilities to the states. The Transportation Empowerment Act aimed to reduce excise tax rates on motor fuels. The Transportation Empowerment Act, introduced by Senator Mike Lee, aimed to phase in reductions in excise tax rates on motor fuels over a three-year period starting in 2015. Gasoline tax would have decreased from 18.3 cents per gallon in 2014 to 3.7 cents by October 2018, while diesel and kerosene taxes would have dropped to 5.0 cents by October 2018. The Act also proposed transferring highway and transit program responsibilities to states over five years, providing funding through block grants. Supporters argued that states are better equipped to prioritize transportation needs than the federal government. The Transportation Empowerment Act proposed transferring highway and transit program responsibilities to states over five years, providing funding through block grants. Supporters argued that states are better situated to understand their transportation priorities than the federal government, and efficiencies for taxpayers could result from reducing the costs of managing surface transportation programs. Opponents raised concerns about states' ability to fund transportation adequately and the potential need for a one-time transfer of funds to reimburse states for outstanding spending. The Surface Transportation and Taxation Equity Act (H.R. 3497) proposed allowing states to opt out of the federal transportation program and reducing federal tax rates on motor fuels in proportion to any state tax rate increases. Representative Scott Garrett aimed to reduce state reliance on federal funds for transportation and increase efficiencies for taxpayers. Another similar bill, H.R. 3636, introduced by Representative Earl Blumenauer, sought to increase federal excise tax rates on gasoline. H.R. 3636, introduced by Representative Earl Blumenauer, aimed to increase federal excise tax rates on gasoline, diesel, and kerosene fuels for the first time since 1993. The bill would have raised around $170 billion over 10 years by increasing tax rates on gasoline by 15 cents and on diesel and kerosene by 15 cents as well. Additionally, the bill would have indexed further tax rate increases to changes in inflation from 2016 to 2024. The bill proposed an increase in gas tax to maintain HTF solvency and fund higher spending levels. ASCE estimated an additional $500 billion investment in transportation by 2020. Critics argued for better allocation of taxpayer money between projects. Senators called for a 12 cent increase in gas and diesel tax rates. The proposal includes phased tax increases on gasoline and diesel, reaching 33.3 and 39.3 cents per gallon, respectively. It was part of a discussion draft for comprehensive tax reform but was not introduced as legislation. The bill aimed to provide a special tax rate for foreign subsidiaries bringing untaxed earnings back to the US. The Highway Trust Fund would have received $126.5 billion over 10 years from a one-time provision under the Highway and Transportation Funding Act. This provision aimed to reduce projected shortfalls in the fund and was part of a transition towards a territorial form of corporate taxation. President Obama signed the Act, extending trust fund expenditure authority for two months. President Obama signed the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-41) on July 31, 2015, extending authority to expend from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and spend on surface transportation programs for three months. The Act also transferred $8.068 billion from the general fund to the HTF. Additionally, the Senate passed the DRIVE Act, outlining a six-year spending plan for transportation programs as a competing policy option to shorter-term HTF extension proposals. The Senate passed a short-term extension of the HTF to allow for more time to negotiate a longer-term transportation bill in 2015. The DRIVE Act was intended to cover the first three years of a six-year spending bill, with overlapping offsets in P.L. 114-41. President Obama signed the FAST Act, authorizing federal highway and public transportation programs for five years, with funding from a $70 billion transfer from the general fund to the HTF. The FAST Act reauthorized tax rates for motor fuels and the LUST Fund through FY2022. Representative Earl Blumenauer reintroduced the UPDATE Act of 2015 (H.R. 680) to increase the motor fuels excise tax over three years and index the tax rate for inflation over a 10-year period. H.R. 680, the UPDATE Act of 2015, proposes tax rate changes for motor fuels over a 10-year period, tying them to inflation. The Bridge to Sustainable Infrastructure Act (H.R. 1846) also suggests adjusting excise taxes on motor fuels based on the Consumer Price Index. Representative Jim Renacci predicts an increase in gasoline and diesel fuel taxes in 2016. Additionally, a Bipartisan Task Force for Sustainable Highway Funding would be established to address long-term fiscal issues. The Highway Trust Fund Certainty Act (H.R. 2971) would immediately raise gasoline and diesel fuel taxes by 10.1 cents each. The Highway Trust Fund Certainty Act (H.R. 2971) proposes a tax increase on gasoline and diesel fuel by 10.1 cents per gallon, adjusted for inflation. It is estimated to raise $12.6 billion in FY2016 and $214.5 billion over 10 years for the HTF. Additional revenue would go to the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund, with offsets resulting in revenue losses to the LUST Trust Fund and the general fund. Overall, the fuel tax increase would generate a net $161.1 billion in new revenue. The TRAFFIC Relief Act (S. 1994) proposes a gradual increase in motor fuels tax on gasoline and diesel over four years, with indexing to inflation. It also includes provisions to restore higher levels for the child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, and expand EITC access for childless workers. There is a possibility of debate on reducing federal gas tax rates and the federal government's role in transportation policy. The FAST Act shifted transportation policy responsibility to states. The Transportation Empowerment Act proposed reducing federal motor fuel taxes gradually. The Invest in Transportation Act suggested funding the Highway Trust Fund through a repatriation tax holiday. The Transportation Act (S. 981) proposes funding the Highway Trust Fund through a voluntary repatriation tax holiday for U.S. multinational corporations. Key provisions include a 6.5% tax rate on foreign-source earnings exceeding companies' recent repatriations, with funds earned in 2015 or earlier. Companies must transfer funds within five years, with tax revenues going to the Highway Trust Fund. At least 25% of repatriated funds must be used for specific purposes like hiring, research, and development, and cannot be used for executive compensation increases. The proposed Transportation Act includes a provision for a voluntary repatriation tax holiday for U.S. multinational corporations. Companies must transfer funds within five years, with tax revenues going to the Highway Trust Fund. Repatriated dividends under the holiday would be taxed at a lower rate. Media reports estimate the cost of the Boxer-Paul bill at $117.9 billion over 10 years. The Boxer-Paul proposal allows firms to repatriate earnings over five years at a lower tax rate. It is uncertain how this could impact revenue. Some firms may choose to repatriate earlier, potentially addressing shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund. However, others may wait until the end of the five-year window, resulting in little immediate revenue increase. The Boxer-Paul proposal allows firms to repatriate earnings over five years at a lower tax rate, potentially addressing shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund. However, revenue raised may not be enough to cover deficits. The proposal aims to prevent net-revenue losses outside the 10-year budget window by requiring repatriated funds to be spent or invested. Studies show that the 2004 repatriation holiday did not stimulate the economy as intended, with some companies even reducing U.S. employment post-holiday. The 2004 repatriation holiday saw money distributed to shareholders and used for stock repurchases. Legislation to prevent misuse of repatriated funds depends on its wording. The Boxer-Paul proposal could deter some companies from inverting for tax benefits. Treasury actions since 2014 have already reduced tax benefits for inversions. The Boxer-Paul proposal for a repatriation holiday differs from previous tax reform proposals and the President's FY2016 proposal. The President's FY2017 budget includes funding for a new \"21st Century Clean Transportation System\" initiative. The Department of Transportation's \"21st Century Clean Transportation System\" initiative aims to invest in sustainable transportation, reduce reliance on oil, cut carbon pollution, and strengthen resilience to climate change. The President proposes funding of $176 billion from transition revenue raised through business tax reform, including a one-time tax on untaxed foreign income and a minimum tax on future foreign income. The President's business tax reform proposal includes a 19% minimum tax on foreign income, ending deferral of tax on foreign-earned income, and measures to prevent U.S. corporates from expatriating. It also involves lowering the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 28%. Additionally, $319 billion of the initiative would be funded by a new fee on crude oil and finished oil products consumed in the United States. The President's proposal includes a new fee on oil producers and importers, exempting exports. It is estimated to raise $35.1 billion in the first year and $319.1 billion over 10 years. Home heating oil would be temporarily exempt, with 15% of revenue used to assist households with high energy costs. Taxing oil could improve market efficiency by reflecting societal costs. The proposal includes a new fee on oil to reflect societal costs like carbon emissions. Higher oil prices would be passed on to consumers in the short run, potentially increasing gasoline prices by at least 25 cents per gallon. This fee is predicted to have minimal effects on output and employment in the oil industry in the short term. In the long run, higher oil prices could help consumers internalize external costs associated with oil production and consumption, including environmental and national security risks. Costs include environmental costs and national security risks from reliance on imported oil. Consumers can adapt to higher oil prices by switching to fuel-efficient vehicles, manufacturers using non-oil inputs, and workers reducing commuting costs. The impact on future U.S. oil industry output is uncertain due to global supply and demand forecasts. Taxing oil instead of transportation fuels moves away from user-fee financing for the HTF. Not all oil is used for transportation, some is used for home heating or industrial products. A tax on oil could weaken the linkage between beneficiaries of public goods. A standalone fee on oil may weaken the linkage between beneficiaries of public goods provided by transportation programs. Lower-income households would bear a higher tax burden compared to higher-income households, making it regressive. Geographically, households in the Northeast using oil for home heating may face higher energy costs. This uneven distribution of the tax burden needs to be addressed. The President proposes assistance programs for households with high energy costs, aiming to offset the regressive nature of the oil tax. Some Members of Congress suggest broadening the federal motor fuels excise tax base to adapt to transportation changes. Various options are discussed in a CRS report on funding highways and public transportation. Various options are being considered to reform HTF funding, including indexing fuel taxes to inflation, implementing an ad valorem tax rate based on sales price, and a distance-based user charge based on vehicle miles traveled. These options aim to address transportation changes and ensure adequate funding for highways and public transportation. The federal manufacturers excise tax on gasoline was first introduced in 1932 to increase tax revenue. Prior to this, states had been levying gasoline taxes since 1919. Various options are being considered to reform HTF funding, including indexing fuel taxes to inflation and implementing a distance-based user charge based on vehicle miles traveled. In 1932, federal government faced budget deficit due to reduced revenues and increased expenditures during the Great Depression. The Secretary of the Treasury projected deficits of $2.1 billion in FY1932 and $1.4 billion in FY1933. To address this, tax-raising and expenditure-reduction proposals were submitted. The Secretary of the Treasury proposed tax increases and expenditure cuts to address the federal budget deficit in 1932. Among the tax recommendations were increases in individual and corporation income, estate and gift, and excise taxes. A new federal manufacturer's excise tax on gasoline was proposed at one cent per gallon, estimated to yield $165 million in revenues during FY1933. Initially, the House of Representatives rejected the gasoline tax, but the Senate later approved it. Congress ultimately included the tax in the final bill signed into law. The Revenue Act of 1932 imposed a federal tax on gasoline at one cent per gallon, effective from June 21, 1932, to June 30, 1933. The tax included refiners, compounders, and dealers selling gasoline exclusively to producers. The tax generated $124.9 million in revenue for the federal government, representing 7.7% of total Internal Revenue collection. The federal gasoline tax, initially set at one cent per gallon under the Revenue Act of 1932, generated $124.9 million in revenue for the government. Congress extended the tax until June 30, 1934, and increased the rate to 1.5 cents per gallon under P.L. 73. The National Industrial Recovery Act also included provisions for the tax rate adjustments based on federal receipts and expenditures. In 1933, federal receipts exceeded expenditures, leading to the repeal of the 18th amendment for additional revenue from alcohol taxes. President Roosevelt repealed the amendment on December 5, 1933. The federal gasoline tax reverted to one cent per gallon on January 1, 1934, and was continued at that rate by the Revenue Act of 1934. The tax rate was increased just before World War II due to national defense requirements. During World War II, the federal gasoline tax was increased to 1.5 cents per gallon as part of a defense tax. This rate was made permanent in 1941 and continued until the Korean War, when it was raised to two cents per gallon. Congress authorized this rate until March 31, 1954, when it was reduced back to 1.5 cents per gallon. The federal gasoline tax rate was reduced to 1.5 cents per gallon after the Excise Tax Reduction Act of 1954. Congress extended the two-cent per gallon rate until March 31, 1955, and further extensions were granted until March 31, 1957. P.L. 466 allowed for tax refunds on gasoline used for farming purposes purchased after December 31, 1955. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 led to a significant expansion in the federal-aid highway program. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 authorized federal funding for the interstate highway program over a 13-year period from FY1957 through FY1969. The Highway Revenue Act of 1956 imposed new taxes on highway users to make the program self-sustaining, including an increase in the federal gasoline tax from two to three cents per gallon until June 30, 1972. The Highway Revenue Act of 1956 increased the federal gasoline tax to 3 cents per gallon until June 30, 1972. Congress scheduled a reduction to 1.5 cents per gallon and authorized the creation of the Highway Trust Fund to receive highway-user taxes for funding the federal aid highway program. The fund was expected to receive $38.5 billion in revenues over a 16-year period, covering anticipated expenditures of $37.3 billion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1959 increased the federal gasoline tax from three to four cents per gallon, effective from October 1, 1959, through June 30, 1961. Subsequent legislation extended and increased the rates imposed on gasoline, with a scheduled reduction deferred until October 1, 1972. Congress has passed laws to extend the life of the Highway Trust Fund and refund federal gasoline taxes used for non-highway purposes or local transit systems. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 deferred the scheduled reduction in the federal gasoline tax rate to 1.5 cents per gallon from September 30, 1972, to September 30, 1977. In 1976, the extension of excise tax rates without reductions allocated to the Highway Trust Fund was provided to ensure funding continuity due to delays in the completion of the Interstate Highway System. Congress delayed decision-making to gather more information before implementing any changes. Congress delayed decision-making to gather more information before implementing any changes to the Highway Trust Fund and its related taxes. The Ways and Means Committee approved a five-year extension of the trust fund and taxes payable to it, which became part of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978. Extensive information on highway finance and taxes was gathered in 1982 through major studies and hearings before the passage of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. This act included the 4R Program. The Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, known for the 4R Program, focused on interstate reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation. It increased the gasoline excise tax from four to nine cents per gallon, reallocating one cent for mass transit purposes. Additionally, the act established the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund in 1986 to address concerns about petroleum product leaks. The LUST Trust Fund received revenues from a tax on gasoline sales. The tax was set to expire when net revenues reached $500 million or by December 31, 1991. The tax ended in August 1990 due to reaching the revenue target. The tax on gasoline was increased by five cents per gallon under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The gasoline tax increased from 9 to 14 cents per gallon, with half of the revenue going to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and the other half to the Treasury's general fund for deficit reduction. Of the 2.5-cent increase for the HTF, 0.5 cents were allocated to the Mass Transit Account. The LUST Trust Fund was reinstated with a 0.1-cent-per-gallon tax rate. The gasoline tax was set to expire on September 30, 1995, and the LUST tax on December 31, 1995. The traditional view of the gasoline tax as a user tax was challenged with the passage of OBRA90. The Surface Transportation Revenue Act of 1991 extended the gasoline tax without a rate increase through September 30, 1999. States were allowed to use Highway Trust Fund grants for alternative transportation modes to reduce highway congestion. The ISTEA included provisions for establishing the National Recreational Trails Trust Fund, funded by tax transfers from the Highway Trust Fund. The gasoline excise tax was changed under the OBRA93, transferring an additional 2.5-cent tax rate to the Highway Trust Fund for deficit reduction starting October 1, 1995. The gasoline excise tax was changed under the OBRA93, transferring an additional 2.5-cent tax rate to the Highway Trust Fund for deficit reduction starting October 1, 1995. This increased funding allocated two cents to the highway portion and 0.5 cents to the mass transit account. Additionally, a permanent 4.3 cents per gallon tax on gasoline was implemented on October 1, 1993, resulting in a total of 6.8 cents per gallon dedicated to deficit reduction between October 1, 1993, and October 1, 1995. The federal gasoline excise tax rate was 18.3 cents from January 1, 1996, to October 1, 1997, before increasing to 18.4 cents. The federal gasoline excise tax rate was 18.3 cents from January 1, 1996, to October 1, 1997, before increasing to 18.4 cents with the reintroduction of the LUST tax. Proponents debated whether to repeal the 4.3 cents increase in federal excise taxes imposed under OBRA93, with some arguing for its retention to fund long-term capital improvements in the Highway Trust Fund. The federal gasoline excise tax rate was debated for funding long-term capital improvements in the Highway Trust Fund. A bi-partisan group was appointed to examine the tax treatment of transportation modes. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 returned the general fund portion of the tax back to the HTF, dividing it between the highway and mass transit accounts. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 divided the federal gasoline excise tax between the highway and mass transit accounts of the Highway Trust Fund. This change allocated 15.44 cents to the highway account and 2.86 cents to the mass transit account. Additionally, the act reinstated the LUST Trust Fund excise tax at a rate of 0.1 cent per gallon on motor fuels, effective from October 1, 1997, through September 30, 2005. The federal gasoline tax, imposed under IRC Section 4081, was extended through September 30, 2011, by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The 14 cents scheduled to expire in 1999 was also extended, along with other highway-related excise taxes, through September 30, 2005, under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). TEA-21, also known as the Surface Transportation Revenue Act of 1998, made changes to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) including no longer earning interest on unspent balances and canceling excess funds over $8 billion. It also repealed the National Recreational Trails Trust Fund and extended funding through short-term extensions in the 108th Congress. The Extension Act of 2004, Part V (P.L. 108-310) extended programs authorized by TEA-21 until May 31, 2005, providing $31.8 billion in contract authority. Revenue sources for the HTF included various excise taxes on highway motor fuels, heavy highway vehicles, heavy vehicle tires, and heavy vehicles. These excises were unaffected by the temporary extensions. In the 109th Congress, multiple short-term extensions of TEA-21 were enacted to keep the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) operational until a longer-term reauthorizing measure was passed. These extensions, known as the Surface Transportation Extension Acts of 2005, included provisions such as depositing ethanol tax revenue into the HTF for one year, generating an estimated $940 million in new revenue. Additionally, there was a one-year extension of budgetary firewalls tying gas tax revenue to highway and transit programs. In the 109th Congress, short-term extensions of TEA-21 were enacted to keep the Highway Trust Fund operational. The extensions included provisions like depositing ethanol tax revenue into the HTF for one year, generating $940 million in new revenue. Congress also passed legislation (H.R. 3) extending trust fund expenditures through FY2009 and highway-related taxes through FY2011, with provisions to combat fuel fraud and provide tax-exempt financing for highway projects. President Bush signed the legislation into law. President Bush signed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) into law on August 10, 2005, extending HTF excise taxes until 2011. The act also established the Motor Fuel Tax Enforcement Advisory Commission. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund financing rate. Extensions in the 110th Congress were made to address projected shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund. On September 15, 2008, P.L. 110-318 transferred $8.017 billion from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund to address shortfalls. In the 111th Congress, multiple short-term extensions were passed to maintain the HTF's balance. The Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extension Act, 2011 extended SAFETEA-LU authorization through March 4, 2011. Extensions continued in the 112th Congress with four short-term measures. In the 112th Congress, short-term extensions of surface transportation legislation reauthorized highway, mass transit, and safety programs. Gasoline and diesel fuel taxes provided majority funding for the Highway Trust Fund and mass transit. President Obama signed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) in 2012, authorizing appropriations for federal transportation programs until 2014 and extending gasoline tax rates. The extended gasoline tax rate was 18.4 cents per gallon and the extended diesel tax rate was 24.4 cents per gallon, including a 0.1 cent per gallon tax deposited in the LUST Trust Fund."
