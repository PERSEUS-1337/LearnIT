    "content": "The \"Bear Protection Act of 1999\" is the short title of this Act. Congress finds that all 8 extant species of bear are listed on Appendix I or II of CITES, allowing for stricter domestic measures to reduce illegal trade in bear parts due to significant population declines. In recent years, habitat loss and poaching for bear viscera due to high demand in traditional medicines and cosmetics have led to concerns. Federal and State undercover operations have uncovered poaching of American bears for their viscera. While most American black bear populations are stable or increasing, commercial trade could fuel poaching and threaten certain populations. Prohibitions on importation, exportation, and interstate trade of bear viscera will help prevent the decline of bear populations in the United States. The commercial trade in bear viscera does not contribute to the decline of any bear population. The Act aims to protect bear species by banning international trade in bear viscera and products containing it, promoting efforts to stop such trade, and ensuring appropriate legislation for domestic trade. In this Act, \"bear viscera\" refers to the body fluids or internal organs of a bear, excluding blood or brains. \"Import\" means bringing something into the US jurisdiction. \"Person\" includes individuals, corporations, and government entities. The term \"transport\" in the Act refers to moving or conveying items by any means. The term \"State\" includes various territories and possessions of the United States. The term \"Secretary\" specifically refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"transport\" in the Act refers to moving items by any means for the purpose of conveyance or shipment. SEC. 5. PROHIBITED ACTS. In general, it is prohibited to import, export, sell, or possess bear viscera or any product containing bear viscera in the United States. However, there is an exception for wildlife law enforcement purposes where certain individuals can import, export, or transport bear viscera. Importing, exporting, or transporting bear viscera is prohibited in the US, except for wildlife law enforcement purposes with a valid permit under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. SEC. 6. PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT. Penalties for violating section 5 include fines, imprisonment up to 1 year, or both. Civil penalties may also be imposed, with a maximum fine of $25,000 per violation. Violations may result in seizure of bear viscera or related products. The Secretary shall issue regulations to enforce this section, with penalties and forfeiture of property. Enforcement will be carried out similar to the Endangered Species Act. Penalty amounts will be used in accordance with the Lacey Act Amendments. The Secretary and the Secretary of State will discuss trade practices related to bear viscera with key countries and aim to collaborate on bear protection efforts. A report on progress in ending illegal bear viscera trade must be submitted to the Senate and House committees within a year of this Act's enactment."
