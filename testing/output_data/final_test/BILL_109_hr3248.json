The Secretary is authorized to award grants for these purposes to eligible State agencies. The application for respite care grants must be submitted by each Governor on behalf of the eligible State agency, in accordance with subsection (d). The Secretary will collaborate with the National Family Caregiver Support Program and other respite care programs to ensure coordination of services for family caregivers of individuals with special needs.

A condition for receiving a grant is that the agency must provide non-Federal contributions of at least 25% of the costs, which can be in cash or in-kind contributions.
