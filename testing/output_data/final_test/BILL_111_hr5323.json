The \"Save America's Future Economy Act of 2010\" mandates OMB to sequester nonexempt spending accounts by a calculated uniform percentage to control the total government spending increase. OMB must provide a report in January each year detailing the projected federal spending level and the Consumer Price Index percentage change. The \"Save America's Future Economy Act of 2010\" requires OMB to sequester nonexempt spending accounts by a calculated percentage to control government spending. OMB must report on the projected federal spending level, Consumer Price Index change, population increase, and total spending increase for the upcoming budget year. The OMB is required to prepare a preview report by August 20 each year, containing updated information from the previous report and the estimated reduction in nonexempt spending accounts to limit total Federal spending. Additionally, a final sequestration report must be prepared within 15 days after Congress adjourns, detailing updated information for the budget year. The OMB must provide an updated reestimate of information from the previous report, including the required reduction in nonexempt spending accounts to limit total Federal spending. The President must issue an order implementing all necessary sequestrations based on the OMB calculation. The Congress can designate provisions as emergency requirements, which will be treated as such for budget purposes. OMB will not include the budgetary effects of these provisions in its estimates. Certain payments and obligations are exempt from reduction under any order issued. A conforming amendment is made to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include new provisions designated as emergency requirements, exempt from budgetary reduction orders. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to eliminate the expiration date of Section 275(b. This change applies to fiscal year 2012 and beyond."
