A framework is developed to analyze how well a network's structure aligns with the algorithmic structure of reasoning tasks. This framework explains the success of popular reasoning models and unifies tasks like intuitive physics and visual question answering under dynamic programming. GNNs can effectively handle these tasks. Neural networks, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), excel in reasoning tasks such as visual and text-based question answering, intuitive physics, mathematical reasoning, and visual IQ tests. Successful models in reasoning tasks often follow the GNN framework, showing alignment with dynamic programming (DP) algorithms. Many successful models in reasoning tasks follow the Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, explicitly modeling pairwise relations and updating object representations by aggregating relations with other objects. Understanding the generalization ability and network structure for reasoning tasks is crucial for designing better models. This paper aims to characterize what tasks a neural network can efficiently learn to reason about. The paper aims to characterize tasks neural networks can reason about efficiently by studying algorithmic alignment with the network's computation graph. Tasks include finding maximum value difference among treasures, colors of furthest objects, optimal path cost to defeat a monster, NP-hard problems, and subset sum. Algorithmic alignment is key for better sample efficiency in reasoning tasks. Algorithmic alignment is crucial for efficient reasoning tasks in neural networks. Deep Sets and GNNs can efficiently learn summary statistics, while GNNs excel at relational argmax and dynamic programming. However, GNNs struggle with subset sum, but NES can generalize well. Empirical results support the hypothesis that alignment aids learning, with a sample complexity bound decreasing with better alignment. The framework explains the success and limitations of popular reasoning models, with examples of increasingly complex reasoning tasks studied. The text discusses how different neural network architectures are suited for specific tasks such as learning summary statistics, relational argmax, and dynamic programming. It highlights the alignment between multi-iteration GNNs and dynamic programming, which allows for efficient learning of complex tasks. The results explain the popularity of GNNs in relational reasoning but also point out limitations for tasks with more complex structures. The text discusses the limitations of neural networks in handling tasks with complex structures, using subset sum as an example. Empirical results align with theoretical analysis based on algorithmic alignment, suggesting the importance of considering task structure in designing new architectures. The concept of algorithmic alignment quantifies the relation between network and task structure, providing insights into learning capabilities. Algorithmic alignment is introduced to analyze learning for reasoning tasks, diverging from common structural assumptions in learning theory. The framework suggests that algorithmic alignment is crucial for generalization and can guide the design of networks for new reasoning tasks. Experimental results confirm the theoretical findings, showing that Graph Neural Networks align well with dynamic programming for a variety of reasoning tasks. Our framework suggests that better algorithmic alignment improves generalization. Graph Neural Networks can simulate algorithms like Bellman-Ford efficiently by learning simple algorithm steps. In contrast, giant MLPs struggle to align well because they need to learn the entire for loop. Experimental results confirm that GNNs generalize better when learning tasks like shortest path algorithms. In contrast to giant MLPs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can simulate algorithms efficiently by learning simple steps like Bellman-Ford. GNNs generalize better for tasks like shortest path algorithms, as they align well with algorithmic principles. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) update node representations by aggregating neighboring nodes' information. GNNs can be used for reasoning by treating objects as nodes in a complete graph. GNNs focus on pairwise relations and include various reasoning models like Relation Networks and Interaction Networks. Recurrent Relational Networks apply LSTMs after aggregation. The theory explores how different network structures interact with tasks and their implications for generalization. While GNNs excel at learning relations, Deep Sets often struggle. Despite being universal approximators, their varying test accuracy stems from generalization. Many neural networks can represent algorithms, such as Deep Sets for permutation-invariant set functions. This ability extends to GNNs and MLPs as well. Propositions 3.1 and 3.2 discuss the approximation capabilities of permutation-invariant functions over sets with bounded cardinality. While any GNN can represent functions that an MLP can, not all network structures generalize well. The concept of algorithmic alignment is introduced to explain how neural network architecture influences function computation. The architecture of a neural network induces a computational structure on the function it computes, aligning with specific algorithms. For example, in the shortest paths problem, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can match the structure of the Bellman-Ford algorithm by learning simple update equations in its MLP modules. This alignment with correct algorithms can lead to better sample complexity and improved performance in reasoning tasks. In this paper, the focus is on reasoning tasks with exact algorithms and clear structures, leaving approximation algorithms for future study. The PAC learning framework formalizes simplicity in terms of sample complexity, ensuring low test error with high probability. The sample complexity of a function generated by a learning algorithm is key to determining its simplicity. The PAC learning framework formalizes simplicity in terms of sample complexity, ensuring low test error with high probability. Algorithmic alignment measures how well a neural network can simulate an algorithm with simple modules. Good alignment implies easy learning of algorithm steps, avoiding complex constructs like for-loops. The alignment value M is computed similar to Kolmogorov complexity for neural networks. Algorithmic alignment in neural networks is akin to Kolmogorov complexity. Obtaining optimal alignment is challenging, but decent sample complexity suffices. By minimizing \"for loops\" in algorithm steps, a nearly-tight alignment can be achieved. The sample complexity of algorithm steps with respect to modules like MLPs can be computed. Recent studies analyze sample complexity for overparameterized MLPs, showing how infinitely-wide GNNs can be proven. Theorem 3.5 extends sample complexity bounds for overparameterized MLP modules, showing that simple functions expressed as polynomials are efficiently learnable. Complex algorithm steps like \"for loops\" may require many samples for an MLP module to learn due to increased complexity in computation. Algorithmic alignment is crucial for generalization, as demonstrated by Theorem 3.6. This theorem shows that the sample complexity bound increases with the algorithmic alignment value M. Even without auxiliary labels, the same pattern is observed in end-to-end learning experiments. The proof of Theorem 3.6 is provided in Appendix D, stating that algorithmic alignment improves sample complexity. In Theorem 3.6 and 3.5, GNN has a polynomial Corollary 3.7. The sample complexity bound for MLP is O(2) times larger than for GNN. The framework is applied to analyze neural networks for reasoning, including MLP, Deep Sets, and GNNs. Experimental confirmation of theoretical analysis is provided in Appendix G, comparing sample complexity of different models through hyperparameter tuning for test accuracy. The test accuracy reflects how well a model generalizes, and GNNs are successful in reasoning tasks like visual question answering. Deep Sets use MLP to learn summary statistics for reasoning tasks, aligning with algorithms that compute statistics over individual objects. This is demonstrated through an example question from CLEVR. The Deep Sets framework uses MLP to extract and aggregate features for reasoning tasks, showing better sample complexity compared to MLP. Test accuracies improve faster when neural networks align well with algorithmic solutions, as seen in the example of GNN4 in a reasoning task. The test accuracy of GNN4 increases significantly when the number of training samples doubles, outperforming Deep Sets. Models are trained to predict the difference in value between the most and least valuable treasure, with Deep Sets achieving 96% test accuracy compared to MLP's 9%. Sorting the treasures by value improves MLP's accuracy, showcasing the impact of sample complexity on reasoning tasks. The text discusses how GNNs have high test accuracies due to their ability to learn relational argmax tasks efficiently. By comparing pairwise relations, GNNs can answer questions about object shapes and distances without the need for extensive training samples, unlike Deep Sets. This is because GNNs can sum over object pairs and compare information via softmax, making them more effective in handling relational tasks. The experiment confirms that GNNs outperform Deep Sets in learning relational argmax tasks, such as identifying the furthest pair among objects. Deep Sets struggle with poor sample complexity, achieving only 21% test accuracy, while GNNs excel with over 90% accuracy. This highlights the effectiveness of GNNs in handling a wide range of relational reasoning tasks. The powerful algorithmic paradigm dynamic programming (DP) can unify a broad class of relational reasoning tasks with more than 90% accuracy. GNNs align well with DP algorithms, where node representations are updated recursively. The framework suggests that GNN can efficiently learn any DP algorithm with enough iterations. An experiment with GNN on Shortest Paths, a standard DP problem, shows good alignment with the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Our framework predicts that GNN has good sample complexity when learning to find shortest paths. Testing different models on a monster trainer game confirms that GNN aligns well with an optimized version of Bellman-Ford, requiring fewer iterations for similar accuracy. The test accuracies of different models vary with the number of sub-sampled training points. Models that align worse with the task require more training samples to achieve similar generalization performance. GNNs can efficiently learn DP and are effective in visual question answering and intuitive physics tasks. The problem of jumping to the closest object k jumps away can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). DP computes answers for k jumps based on answers for (k-1) jumps. Various studies have trained neural networks to predict object dynamics in rigid body scenes and n-body systems. Physical interactions can change the force acting on an object, requiring a DP algorithm to recursively compute force changes and update states like velocity and momentum. The text discusses how Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to recursively compute force changes in a system and update object states based on learned forces and physics laws. It mentions that in rigid body systems, force changes only occur at collisions, while in n-body systems, forces change continuously. The text also highlights that DP has limitations, such as being unable to solve NP-hard problems, which also applies to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in learning these hard problems efficiently. The text discusses limitations of Dynamic Programming (DP) in solving NP-hard problems, which also applies to Graph Neural Networks (GNN). A solution is proposed where a network can be designed based on the structure of the underlying reasoning algorithm. An example is given with the subset sum problem, which is NP-hard and cannot be solved by DP. A new architecture called Neural Exhaustive Search (NES) is designed to tackle this problem by enumerating all subsets. The Neural Exhaustive Search (NES) algorithm is introduced as a solution to the subset sum problem, achieving 98% test accuracy compared to other models with below 80% accuracy. This approach aligns well with subset-sum by using LSTM and MLP layers to learn simple steps, showcasing the potential for neural networks to learn reasoning tasks. The paper suggests exploring neural network design inspired by algorithmic alignment for learning various algorithmic paradigms. The universal approximation of Deep Sets is explored by Zaheer et al. (2017) and Wagstaff et al. (2019), showing that Deep Sets can approximate any continuous function on a set with permutation invariance. Results indicate that Deep Sets can be expressed by a GNN with one message passing iteration. Sets can be expressed by a GNN with one message passing iteration, where the computation structure of one-layer GNNs involves parameterized MLPs. Deep Sets can be represented by a one-layer GNN if \u03c6 ignores X t and \u03c1(X s ) = \u03c1. GNNs with multiple layers can also be universal approximators for permutation invariant continuous functions. Any GNN can be represented by an MLP that performs the same computations. The MLP can simulate GNNs by representing the computation structure of N with parameterized MLPs. For fixed size inputs, MLPs can simulate GNNs, and for variable sized inputs, M MLPs are constructed to simulate the GNN for each input set size. The meta-layer selects the output from an MLP that matches the input set size to simulate the GNN. Theorem 3.5 generalizes a previous theorem and involves an overparameterized two-layer MLP trained with gradient descent. The sample complexity for vector-valued functions is extended by treating each output component independently. By applying a union bound, the error rate and failure probability for the output vector can be bounded, leading to an overall sample complexity. With given error rate and failure probability, the probability of failing to learn each component is at most \u03b4 0, and by a union bound, the probability of failing to learn any component is at most m \u00b7 \u03b4 0. Therefore, with probability at least 1 \u2212 m\u03b4 0, successful learning is achieved. The error for each entry in the vector output is bounded by 0, with successful learning of all components achieved with probability at least 1 - m\u03b4 0. By setting appropriate parameters, the entire vector-valued function can be learned with a certain error rate and failure probability. This leads to an overall sample complexity bound, simplifying the learning process. At test time, the goal is to bound g(S) \u2212 \u011d(S) with high probability by considering the error of intermediate representation vectors. For the first module N1, the error for the input of N2 is O( ) with failure probability O(\u03b4). This sequential learning process ensures learnability at all layers and iterations, leading to successful function learning. The error for the input of N2 is O( ) with failure probability O(\u03b4), and the goal is to bound f(\u1e91) \u2212 f(z) by considering the Lipschitzness assumption of f. Our key insight is that a learnable correct function f is close to the function learned by algorithm A on correct samples. The function f generated on perturbed samples should also be close to f. By the algorithm stability assumption, f and f should be close if input samples are slightly perturbed. This leads to the conclusion that with high probability, certain bad events will not occur, completing the proof. The proof of Corollary 3.7 shows that a giant MLP learns the function (X i \u2212 X j ) 2 twice and encodes it in the weights, leading to extra sample complexity. By applying an MLP to learn functions f and g, aggregation errors are incurred, but the sample complexities can be compared without considering this effect. The proof of Claim 4.1 shows that if there exists a function f such that f(x) + f(y) = g(x, y) for any x and y, then f(x) must be 0 for all x. This contradicts the assumption, leading to the conclusion that there exist x and y where f(x) + f(y) = g(x, y). In the dataset generation for the FANTASTIC TREASURE experiment, 50,000 training data, 5,000 validation data, and 5,000 test data are sampled. Each training sample consists of 25 treasures with different values, locations, and colors. The task is to determine the difference in value between the most and least valuable treasure in the universe. The answer label is generated by finding the maximum value difference among all treasures. In the experiment, the dataset includes 60,000 training data and 6,000 validation data. The models are trained with different hyperparameters such as learning rates and batch sizes. The hidden dimensions and layers of MLP modules are varied for different models. Dropout is applied before the last two hidden layers of MLP. In dataset generation, 60,000 training data, 6,000 validation data, and 6,000 test data are sampled. Each training sample consists of 25 treasures with location, value, and color attributes. The task is to identify the colors of the two most distant treasures. The answer label is generated by ordering the colors of the distant treasures. The label y is computed based on the colors of two treasures, with a one-hot encoding representing the minimum cost among 21 classes. Models are trained using the Adam optimizer with varying learning rates and cross-entropy loss for 150 epochs. Different hyperparameters are tuned for each model type, including batch size, number of hidden layers, and hidden dimensions. In a monster training game, the trainer must defeat monsters with varying levels and locations to complete quests. The trainer's level upgrades after defeating a monster, and the cost of challenging a more powerful monster is based on the travel distance and level difference. The goal is to minimize the cost of completing the quest. The study focuses on a monster training game where the trainer must defeat monsters to complete quests. A DP algorithm is proposed for finding the shortest path with fewer iterations than Bellman-Ford. The dataset includes training, validation, and test data for model evaluation. The input universe consists of the trainer and 10 monsters. In each training sample, the input universe consists of the trainer and 10 monsters. The label y is a one-hot encoding of minimum cost with 200 classes. Rejection sampling is applied to ensure the shortest path length is not trivial.

The Neural Exhaustive Search (NES) model enumerates subsets of the input data and passes them through an MLP and LSTM for feature extraction. The Neural Exhaustive Search (NES) model uses an aggregation function on hidden states from LSTM, with 4 hidden layers in the last MLP and 3 in the prior MLPs. Hidden dimensions range from 128 to 256 in all MLP modules."
