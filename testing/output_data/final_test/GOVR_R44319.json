    "content": "The FEC, created in 1974, has faced controversy over its enforcement activities, with some finding them too vigorous and others too lax. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed restructuring the agency to enhance enforcement powers. Recent Congresses have also overseen the FEC's enforcement practices and transparency. The controversy surrounding the FEC's enforcement of campaign finance laws continues. The 40th-anniversary media coverage highlighted tensions among FEC commissioners over enforcement regulations. Debates have arisen about the agency's enforcement activities being inadequate or overzealous, reflecting broader controversies on campaign finance policy. The report emphasizes why enforcement controversies matter to Congress in shaping overall agency direction and campaign finance policy. This report does not provide a comprehensive discussion of specific enforcement matters but highlights key issues of interest to Congress regarding FEC enforcement. It does not cover criminal enforcement by the Justice Department or activities regulated by agencies like the IRS. The report does not offer compliance guidance and uses terms like \"FEC,\" \"commission,\" and \"agency\" interchangeably. Other CRS products provide additional information on related topics. Members of Congress play a dual role in campaign finance policy as regulators and the regulated. They establish rules for campaigns, including their own, and provide resources for compliance. Enforcement is a key topic in federal campaign finance policy, often reflecting the health of the FEC and the extent of government regulation of political speech. Enforcement is a crucial aspect of federal campaign finance policy, reflecting the health of the FEC and government regulation of political speech. Understanding enforcement can provide insight into how emerging campaign practices will be regulated. Congress regularly considers legislation that impacts FEC enforcement duties, with recent developments such as H.R. 2931 in the 114th Congress being particularly relevant. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 2931 proposed changes to the FEC, including a five-member commission with enhanced enforcement powers. The AFP was extended until 2018, covering late reports by non-candidate committees and independent expenditures. Hearings on campaign finance law enforcement were held in the 113th and 112th Congresses, with the FEC providing additional information on its enforcement activities. The FEC, a six-member independent regulatory agency, released information about its enforcement activities. Commissioners are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The commission has three major enforcement options: general enforcement process, Alternative Dispute Resolution Program, and Administrative Fine Program. Matters Under Review (MURs) are complex cases that may involve investigations, negotiations, civil penalties, or litigation. The FEC's enforcement activities involve three major options: general enforcement process, Alternative Dispute Resolution Program, and Administrative Fine Program. Cases can range from complex Matters Under Review to simpler AFP and ADR cases, with a five-year statute of limitations for campaign finance enforcement. The enforcement process begins with a complaint or referral from various entities. The FEC's enforcement process involves handling complaints or referrals through the MUR, ADR, or AFP methods. Once complaints are complete, the respondent is notified and given a chance to reply, with enforcement determined by the commission based on FECA guidelines. The process must seek voluntary compliance before penalties are imposed, with commissioners voting on key enforcement decisions. The FEC's enforcement process involves handling complaints through various methods. Commissioners must vote on key enforcement decisions, requiring at least four affirmative votes for certain actions. The process aims for voluntary compliance before penalties are imposed. Table 2 outlines major steps and timelines for cases routed through the MUR process. The FEC's enforcement process involves handling complaints through various methods, with key details outlined in Table 2. Two transparency issues are central to the process: confidentiality of enforcement matters until cases are closed and recent efforts to improve agency transparency in providing enforcement information. In November 2011, the Committee on House Administration, Subcommittee on Elections, held an FEC oversight hearing emphasizing transparency in the enforcement process. Negotiations between the committee and commission led to efforts to approve and release a new FEC enforcement manual. In May 2012, over 1,200 pages of documents on enforcement and audit procedures were released. Controversy arose in 2013 over proposed revisions to an Office of General Counsel draft of the enforcement manual. The FEC manual was under debate regarding restrictions on staff sharing information with other agencies without commission authorization. Disagreements among commissioners delayed the approval process, leading to acrimonious public meetings. The General Counsel expressed concerns about proposed restrictions, citing increased administrative burden. The General Counsel expressed concerns about proposed restrictions on information-sharing policies, leading to disagreements among commissioners and acrimonious public meetings. Amid a stalemate, the General Counsel resigned, leaving the position vacant for over two years. Proposed changes to information-sharing policies are still under consideration. The FEC appointed an acting general counsel, and its relationships with other federal agencies for enforcement interests have varied over time. The current state of these relationships is not well-documented. The FEC's memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department became outdated after the 2002 BCRA, and negotiations for a revised MOU have not been successful. Media reports in 2015 indicated that the MOU had not been updated, and referrals to the DOJ for FECA violations were rare. The FEC's interpretation of confidentiality obligations has evolved over time, leading to debates on document release policies. Litigation has influenced disclosure practices. Recent FEC meetings suggest revisions to Directive 68 for case status reports. In 2007, probable cause hearings were introduced, and a pilot audit program was established in 2009. The FEC established a pilot program for audit hearings in 2009 and has revised its website to provide more information on enforcement procedures. Since 2013, individuals with legal disputes can request the commission to consider the issue before enforcement actions. The commission has faced criticism for deadlocked votes on key policy and enforcement matters. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) requires authorization for significant agency activities like rule-making, issuing advisory opinions, and approving enforcement actions. Deadlocked votes, where there is no majority decision, can halt substantive commission action. Data on deadlocks are not regularly compiled, but recent analysis shows a 24.4% deadlock rate in 2014. In 2014, commissioners deadlocked on 24.4% of closed MURs, sparking debate on the implications of split votes for agency enforcement. Deadlocked votes may indicate a failure to enforce campaign finance law or careful consideration of legal boundaries. Even MURs without deadlocks can be controversial, while those with deadlocks may still find agreement on some issues. For example, in MUR 6660, commissioners released competing statements despite avoiding deadlock. Additionally, in MURs 6722 and 6723, allegations of impermissible coordination between political committees were considered. The commission voted unanimously on February 25, 2014, that there was \"no reason to believe\" impermissible coordination had occurred between political committees. However, three commissioners noted that some activities considered coordination under the statute were not clearly covered by the Commission's regulations. Deadlocks on votes can lead to substantive decisions on some issues even when consensus is not reached on others, as anticipated by Congress to prevent partisan use of the Commission. The FEC's six-member structure creates conflict to prevent partisan use. Deadlocks require a mixed majority for formal action, leading to enforcement uncertainty. Deadlocks can be positive if actions are seen as excessive but hinder law enforcement and guidance clarity. The FEC faces challenges in resolving enforcement cases, with some cases taking months or even years to resolve. A backlog of 191 serious enforcement cases was reported in March 2015, with disagreements among commissioners contributing to delays. Complex issues and the need for comprehensive audits also contribute to prolonged enforcement cases. Some FEC commissioners propose revising policies to expedite handling of cases and increase transparency. The agency typically seeks civil penalties through voluntary settlements, with modest amounts assessed. Financial penalties peaked in the mid-2000s due to large assessments on some organizations. Penalties peaked in the mid-2000s due to large assessments on organizations under Section 527 of the IRC. There is debate over whether lower penalty amounts indicate lax enforcement or better compliance. Commissioners are discussing the need for more transparency in penalty calculations and whether existing penalties are sufficient. The FEC's enforcement tools include assessing corrective actions like training seminars. High-profile vacancies in senior staff positions have caused divisions among commissioners. Enforcement is crucial for compliance with campaign finance laws and regulations. The FEC's enforcement process is seen as complex and lacking transparency by some, while others believe it is too lenient. There is a consensus that clear and consistent enforcement is important for political actors to know the boundaries. Congress could pass legislation to provide more guidance on enforcement issues, but this may not always be feasible. Structural reform may be needed as the commission often deadlocks on various issues. Some suggest structural reform as a solution to the FEC's routine deadlocks on various issues, advocating for a restructuring to prevent split votes. Critics propose eliminating the even-number commissioner structure to reduce deadlocks, while others caution that an odd number of commissioners could lead to politicized enforcement. The bipartisan design of the FEC is seen as crucial for legitimate regulations, with concerns raised about the agency's effectiveness in enforcing campaign finance laws. Congress is examining how they want the FEC to enforce campaign finance laws and regulations. Key questions include prioritizing enforcement, relationships with other agencies, enforcement priorities, expectations clarification, appropriations, personnel, and statutory authority. The Federal Election Commission is considering how to carry out enforcement duties and whether to wait for pending litigation to resolve before making determinations. Questions include whether Congress should specify standards for enforcement, if current civil-enforcement requirements meet needs, and if time frames for enforcement cases are reasonable. Additionally, concerns about limitations on sharing information and negotiating compliance are being addressed. The Federal Election Commission is grappling with how to enforce regulations effectively. Congress may need to clarify the division of responsibilities between the commission and enforcement staff, as well as consider granting the FEC more flexibility in conducting audits and enforcement actions. Despite the agency's ability to prioritize enforcement activities and fill staff vacancies, much of the enforcement process is dictated by statute. As long as campaign finance remains contentious, enforcement will continue to be a challenging issue."
