It also includes changes to the Deemed Approval process under Section 218(c)(3)(A) of the Act.

It also eliminates the 50 Percent Rule and specifies that illegal work experience cannot count towards job requirements. Wage rate requirements are adjusted as well.

The BARN Act amends the Deemed Approval process under Section 218(c)(3)(A) of the Act, requiring a determination on applications within 30 days. It also adjusts wage rate requirements, specifying that no employer is required to pay a wage rate greater than 115 percent of the Federal, State, and local minimum wage rates. Additionally, the period of authorized nonimmigrant status is limited to 1 year, with a possible extension of up to 1 year upon positive recruitment efforts by the employer. The Act includes obligations for nonimmigrants to depart the United States after a 2-year period and restrictions on reapplying for a visa for 2 months. Work lapse periods of 60 days or more result in visa revocation and departure from the United States. The BARN Act amends Section 218(c)(4) of the Act regarding housing requirements for employers applying for workers under subsection (b). Employers must offer housing at no cost to workers in certain job opportunities and occupations beyond normal commuting distance. Compliance is met if the employer provides housing to the workers. The BARN Act amends housing requirements for employers providing housing to workers in certain job opportunities. Housing must meet Federal or local standards for temporary labor camps or rental accommodation. Inspections are required for compliance. The BARN Act amends housing requirements for employers providing housing to H-2A workers. Employers must request a certificate of inspection from an approved agency when filing an application for H-2A workers. The Secretary of Agriculture must ensure an inspection is conducted within 28 days of the request. The BARN Act amends housing requirements for H-2A workers. The Secretary of Agriculture must issue regulations for housing provision and ensure timely inspections. Governors can certify housing allowance authority to the Secretary of Agriculture. Compliance with deadlines is mandatory. The State can certify to the Secretary of Agriculture the availability of housing for migrant farm workers and H-2A workers. Employers in the State may offer a housing allowance instead of providing housing. Employers are not required to reserve housing for workers, and assistance in locating housing can be provided upon request. Upon request, an employer offering a housing allowance must make a good faith effort to help a worker find housing in the area of intended employment. The housing allowance cannot be used for employer-owned housing. Providing a housing allowance does not make the employer a housing provider under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act allows employers to provide housing allowances to workers in nonmetropolitan counties based on the statewide average fair market rental for existing housing. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines housing allowances for workers based on the United States Housing Act of 1937. If workers are in a metropolitan county, the allowance is equal to the statewide average fair market rental. The employer must provide a housing allowance to H-2A employees based on the statewide average fair market rental for metropolitan counties, as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. If provided, the employer must also submit a list of names and local addresses of the workers receiving the allowance. The Legal Services Corporation cannot offer legal assistance to aliens unless they are present in the US at the time of assistance and have attempted non-binding dispute resolution. The Legal Services Corporation respects arbitration arrangements between employers and nonimmigrant workers. Employers are not required to allow individuals from the Legal Services Corporation onto their property without a pre-arranged appointment with a specific nonimmigrant worker. Additionally, violations of nonimmigrant status may result in inadmissibility to the United States. An alien may not be admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) if they violated their previous admission terms, committed fraud, or committed an offense that made them deportable while in the country. The Secretary of Labor may not issue a certification under subsection (a) if the employer knowingly hired an H-2A worker whose period of authorized admission had expired or engaged in fraud. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall not approve petitions filed by such employer. Compliance with the requirements of this Act establishes an affirmative defense in legal actions."
