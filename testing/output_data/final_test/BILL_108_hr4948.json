Congress finds a unique legal and political relationship between the US and Indian tribes, reflected in various treaties and laws. Native Americans face significant social and economic challenges, with high unemployment and poverty rates. Native Americans in the United States face low levels of educational attainment and economic challenges, with unsuccessful external efforts at economic development in Indian Country. Empowering Native communities to make their own decisions and improve educational achievement is crucial for economic development. Businesses are hesitant to locate in Indian Country due to the lack of an educated workforce, as only 12 percent of Native Americans nationwide have a bachelor's degree or higher. Only 6 percent of Native Americans in Indian Country have a bachelor's degree or higher, leading to a lack of job opportunities in their communities. Intervening factors are needed to break this cycle. Loan forgiveness for employment in Indian Country is being addressed through an amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965. This aims to support Native Americans in accessing job opportunities in their communities. The purpose of this section is to increase the number of individuals with higher education degrees working in Indian country, promote economic growth, Tribal sovereignty, and public service, as well as encourage investment through an educated workforce. The Secretary is authorized to carry out a program using appropriated funds. The Secretary will implement a program to repay loans for borrowers with bachelor's or graduate degrees who secure employment in Indian country. Loan repayment will be based on availability of funds and priority will be given based on regulations set by the Secretary. The program will prioritize loan repayment for individuals working in Indian country based on factors like poverty level, tribal membership, employment location, debt-to-income ratio, and employer. The Secretary will notify institutions of higher education and the Bureau of Indian Affairs about the availability of loan repayment under this section. The Secretary will assume or cancel 15 percent of the amount of all loans made after the date of enactment. The Indian Country Educational Empowerment Zone Act allows for loan repayment to students working in Indian country. The repayment amounts are structured as follows: 20% for the third and fourth years of employment, and 30% for the fifth year. The maximum repayment is $20,000 for students with a bachelor's degree and $20,000 for students with a graduate degree. The loan repayment program for students working in Indian country allows for repayment of $20,000 per year for students with a graduate degree. Consolidation loans can be considered qualified loan amounts under certain conditions. No refunding of previous payments is allowed, and interest repayment is required for a portion of the loan. The loan repayment program for students working in Indian country allows for repayment of a portion of the loan by the Secretary, including interest repayment. Double benefits are prohibited for student borrowers receiving benefits from other programs for the same service. The loan repayment program allows eligible individuals working in Indian country to apply for repayment of loans each fiscal year. Applicants must submit a complete application with verification from their employer, and can apply after completing each year of employment in Indian country. The loan repayment program allows eligible individuals working in Indian country to apply for loan repayment. Borrowers receive forbearance while employed in Indian country, with the Secretary authorized to issue necessary regulations. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2005, with additional funding for the following years.
