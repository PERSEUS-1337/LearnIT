An eligible community can use loan funds for essential facilities like water conservation, drainage improvements, transportation, and affordable housing. Funds can also be used for land acquisition, municipal staff, and updates to community plans. To receive a loan, the community must submit an application to the Secretary of Agriculture. An eligible community must submit an application to the Secretary of Agriculture with details of projects for loan fund usage, a certification for loan purpose, and proof of financial capacity to repay the loan, including evidence of dedicated energy tax revenue.
