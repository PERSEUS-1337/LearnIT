    "content": "SECTION 1. AUTHORITY. The head of an agency may offer early retirement to employees to avoid involuntary separations due to various actions. Employees taking early retirement will have a reduction in benefits as specified in the code. The code allows for a modified reduction in annuity benefits for employees based on specific circumstances after their birthday. This redetermined amount is calculated based on the reduction required at the date of separation if the employee had reached a certain age. Eligibility for early retirement is subject to certain conditions. To be eligible for early retirement under this section, an employee must not accept a voluntary separation incentive payment and must separate from service before the end of the 3-month election period offered by their employing agency. The paragraph specifies a 3-month duration for a certain provision, ending within a year of the Act's enactment and not repeatable. It allows for deferral of separation dates if necessary for agency mission effectiveness, with a maximum extension of 1 year. Employment backfill prevention measures from a previous Act apply to this situation. Law 103-226; 5 U.S.C. 3101 note applies to vacancies created by employee separations due to early retirement. Eligibility is not limited to CSRS employees. Appropriations are authorized to cover the unfulfilled liability from benefits accruing within a 5-year period.
