    "content": "The \"Urban Homestead Act of 1995\" may be cited as the short title. Definitions are provided in the Act. The \"Urban Homestead Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as community development corporation and cost recovery basis for the purpose of promoting community development through housing opportunities for low-income families. The \"Urban Homestead Act of 1995\" defines key terms related to housing opportunities for low-income families, including terms like low-income families, multifamily housing project, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and severe physical problems in dwelling units. The \"Urban Homestead Act of 1995\" outlines criteria for housing units to be considered uninhabitable, such as malfunctioning heating systems, lack of electrical service, safety hazards in public areas, and severe maintenance issues. The \"Urban Homestead Act of 1995\" defines severe maintenance problems in housing units as water leaks, cracks in walls, paint peeling, and rodent infestation. A single family residence is a 1- to 4-family dwelling held by the Secretary, while a substandard multifamily housing project has at least 25% of units with severe physical problems. The term \"unit of general local government\" has the same meaning as in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The term \"unoccupied multifamily housing project\" is defined as a multifamily housing project that is certified by the unit of general local government as not inhabited, as per the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. SEC. 3. DISPOSITION OF UNOCCUPIED AND SUBSTANDARD PUBLIC HOUSING. Transfer of ownership of unoccupied or substandard multifamily housing projects or residential properties owned by the Secretary to the local government is mandated, subject to an agreement with the Secretary. Timing for the transfer must be adhered to as specified. Transfer of ownership of unoccupied or substandard multifamily housing projects or residential properties owned by the Secretary to the local government is mandated within a year of acquisition. Prior to transfer, any incurred indebtedness must be satisfied by the Secretary. The agreement requires a local government to dispose of housing projects or residential properties by either canceling the debt or reimbursing the government. Within 30 days of acquiring the property, the government must notify community development corporations in the state. During a 6-month period, community development corporations have the exclusive right to make offers to purchase a project or residence on a cost recovery basis. The local government cannot sell the property to anyone else during this time unless notified under the agreement. During a 6-month period, community development corporations have the exclusive right to make offers to purchase a project or residence on a cost recovery basis. The local government cannot sell the property to anyone else during this time unless notified under the agreement. Additionally, the unit of general local government must accept a bona fide offer from a community development corporation if it is deemed acceptable, but cannot sell to them on any other basis during this period. After a 6-month period, the local government must dispose of the property through negotiation, competitive bid, or other means as they see fit. The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 does not apply to property disposition under this Act. Tenant leases existing before this Act remain unaffected. The Secretary will establish necessary procedures within 6 months of enactment."
