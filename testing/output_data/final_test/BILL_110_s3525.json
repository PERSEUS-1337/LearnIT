    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Star-Spangled Banner Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act\". During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key visited the British fleet to secure the release of Dr. William Beanes. Key was held during the shelling of Fort McHenry but saw the American flag still flying proudly after a 25-hour bombardment. He was inspired to write a song commemorating the event, which later became the national anthem. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" to be played at military and naval occasions. In 1931, it became our National Anthem. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins in commemoration of the bicentennial of the Star-Spangled Banner. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the battle for Baltimore that inspired the \"Star-Spangled Banner\". Each coin will feature a value designation, the year \"2012\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with relevant commissions and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a designated Mint facility during the calendar year beginning on January 1, 2012. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted at a reasonable discount. All sales of coins issued under this Act include a $10 surcharge per coin, with the surcharges going to the Maryland War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission for bicentennial activities, educational outreach, and preservation efforts. The Comptroller General has the right to audit the Commission's expenditures. No surcharge can be added to any coin issued under this Act if it would exceed the annual limit of 2 commemorative coin programs as specified in title 31, United States Code. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide guidance on this limitation."
