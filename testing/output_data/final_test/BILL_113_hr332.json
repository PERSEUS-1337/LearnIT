    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act.\" It includes findings and purposes for the legislation. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) was enacted to prohibit lawsuits against gun industry entities for damages solely based on the criminal or unlawful use of their products. The intent was to prevent holding manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and importers liable for crimes committed using their firearms or ammunition. The PLCAA was enacted to protect gun industry entities from lawsuits solely based on criminal use of their products. However, it was not intended to shield manufacturers or sellers who fail to exercise reasonable care in product design and safety. Courts have misinterpreted the PLCAA, dismissing civil lawsuits for negligence and product defects. This special protection from liability for the firearm industry goes against congressional intent. The PLCAA was intended to protect the firearm industry from liability solely based on criminal use of their products. However, it should not shield manufacturers or sellers who are negligent in product design and safety. Courts should be able to impose liability on industry participants for negligent conduct or defective products causing injury in which unlawful activity was also a cause. Allowing victims of gun violence to pursue civil actions against the firearm industry for negligent behavior promotes justice and responsible business practices. This does not infringe on Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. The Act aims to provide civil remedies for those injured by firearms, allowing them to bring suits in State and Federal courts based on liability theories. Plaintiffs can introduce gun trace evidence as evidence in court. The Act allows victims of gun violence to pursue civil remedies against manufacturers, sellers, or trade associations for damages or relief resulting from alleged defects or negligence. Actions cannot be dismissed based on the criminal use of a qualified product. The definitions of key terms are provided, and the Act applies to actions brought before or after its enactment. SEC. 4. Gun trace information from the Firearms Trace System database can be accessed in civil proceedings, subject to legal process, admissible as evidence, and used in any State or Federal court."
