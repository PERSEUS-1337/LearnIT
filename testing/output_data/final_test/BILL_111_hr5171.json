The Congress finds that Haiti experienced a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake on January 12, 2010, resulting in 230,000 deaths, 300,000 injured, and 1.2 million displaced. The damage is estimated between $8 billion and $14 billion, making it the most destructive event in terms of the number of people killed relative to the country's population. The devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti in 2010 resulted in 230,000 deaths, 300,000 injured, and 1.2 million displaced, with damage estimated at $8-14 billion. The ongoing economic recession in the United States has left many qualified construction workers unemployed or underemployed, potentially available to assist in Haiti's rapid rebuilding efforts. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. PARTNERSHIP WITH AMERICA.\" is a concise summary of the partnership between Haiti and the United States for rebuilding efforts after the devastating earthquake in 2010. The Secretary of the Treasury, in collaboration with the Government of Haiti, will implement the \"Partnership With America\" program within 30 days of the Act's enactment. This program will involve US construction and reconstruction experts working on rebuilding Haiti's infrastructure, including roads, airports, energy facilities, schools, hospitals, and housing for earthquake victims. The Secretary, through the Infrastructure Finance Experts Corps, will estimate funding needs, transport US workers and equipment to Haiti, mentor Haitian workers, and rapidly rebuild infrastructure post-earthquake to boost the economy and living standards. The program aims to coordinate infrastructure projects in Haiti efficiently, employ US experts and workers, establish public-private partnerships, and create centers of excellence for rapid rebuilding. Establish centers of excellence for specialized training by US construction experts to Haitians on best practices and technologies, ensuring they supplement and mentor Haitian workers. Include controls for US contractors to subcontract work to local Haitian companies. The Partnership With America program aims to assist Haitian companies by providing clear performance metrics and incentives. The program will terminate after 36 months to ensure it helps rebuild Haiti without replacing Haitian jobs in the long term."
