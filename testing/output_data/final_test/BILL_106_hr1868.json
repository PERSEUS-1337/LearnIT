    "content": "The \"Rural Education Development Initiative for the 21st Century Act\" aims to provide increased learning opportunities for rural school students in the United States. Congress finds that there is a lack of federal education policy focusing on the specific needs of rural school districts, which face challenges in hiring and retaining qualified teachers, especially in science and mathematics. Rural schools face challenges such as shrinking tax bases, high transportation costs, and limited resources. Data shows significant achievement gaps in high-poverty schools compared to others, posing difficulties in meeting academic standards. The text chunk \"SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\" is a concise statement defining terms within a document or legislation. In this Act, terms like \"elementary school\", \"local educational agency\", \"secondary school\", and \"State educational agency\" are defined according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. An \"eligible local educational agency\" is one that serves a school-age population with 20 percent or more from families below the poverty line, located in a rural district, or with a school-age population of 800 or fewer. The curr_chunk defines terms like \"metropolitan statistical area\", \"poverty line\", \"rural locality\", \"school-age population\", and \"Secretary\". The curr_chunk defines a \"specially qualified agency\" as an eligible local educational agency in a State not participating in the program under this Act, eligible to apply directly to the Secretary for a grant. The curr_chunk authorizes a program. The curr_chunk allocates funds for grants to schools and State educational agencies under the program authorized in the prev_chunk. The curr_chunk outlines the process for direct awards to specially qualified agencies if a State educational agency does not participate in the program. Grant funds awarded to local educational agencies or schools under this Act shall be used for educational technology, professional development, technical assistance, teacher recruitment and retention, parental involvement activities, and academic enrichment programs. The grant funds awarded to local educational agencies or schools under this Act will be distributed by the state. The State educational agency will award grants to eligible local educational agencies or provide assistance to schools based on a competitive basis or a formula. In the first year of receiving a grant, the agency must allocate at least 90 percent of the funds to local educational agencies and no more than 9 percent to schools in non-eligible areas. In rural communities with a population of 2,500 or less, or a population density of less than 1,000 people per square mile, schools serving a school-age population where 20 percent are from families below the poverty line may use up to 1 percent for State activities. In succeeding years, the State educational agency must allocate at least 90 percent of grant funds to eligible local educational agencies and no more than 9.5 percent for administrative costs. The State may allocate grant funds as follows: not more than 9.5 percent for assistance to specific schools, and not more than 0.5 percent for State activities and administrative costs related to the program. Each State educational agency and specially qualified agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this Act, including specific measurable goals related to student academic achievement and drop-out rates. Additionally, reports are required to be submitted. Each State educational agency and specially qualified agency receiving a grant under this Act must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the method of awarding grants, fund usage by local educational agencies and schools, and progress towards meeting goals outlined in the application. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress detailing the methods used to award grants, fund usage by local educational agencies and schools, and progress towards meeting specific educational goals and objectives. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $300,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004."
