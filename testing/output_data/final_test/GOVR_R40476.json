    "content": "The nation's military installations have undergone multiple rounds of base realignments and closures (BRAC) since the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The BRAC process involves identifying excess military facilities and transferring ownership to non-federal entities. A round of base closures was authorized by Congress on December 28, 2001, requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit a list of recommended closures to congressional committees and an independent commission. The 2005 BRAC Commission analyzed 190 DOD recommendations, recommending 182 closures or realignments with an estimated $15 billion in savings over 20 years. The President reviews and submits the recommendations to Congress, who can disapprove through a joint resolution. If the President fails to submit the recommendations within the timeframe, the BRAC process is terminated. The 2005 BRAC Commission recommended closures and realignments saving $15 billion over 20 years. Congress accepted the recommendations, making them law on November 9, 2005. Amendments in 1999 and 2001 changed disposal authorities, leading to new regulations for property disposal in the 2005 round. Congress amended the law in 2009, requiring revised regulations for economic development conveyances. This report outlines transfer and disposal authorities for military installations closed in 2005. The Base Closure Act of 2005 recommended closures and realignments to save $15 billion over 20 years. Amendments to the Act altered property transfer and disposal processes, with the General Services Administration primarily handling federal property transfer. The Act allows DOD to delegate transfer and disposal authorities to military departments for BRAC installations, following FPASA and GSA regulations. DOD can also supersede GSA regulations with BRAC-specific regulations with approval. The Base Closure Act of 2005 recommended closures and realignments to save $15 billion over 20 years. Amendments to the Act altered property transfer and disposal processes, with the General Services Administration primarily handling federal property transfer. BRAC-specific regulations authorize various conveyance mechanisms, including public benefit transfers, economic development conveyances, negotiated sales, conservation conveyances, and public sales. States and communities play a substantial role in property redevelopment planning, influencing BRAC property transfer and disposal decisions. Local communities can significantly influence BRAC property transfer and disposal decisions at the federal level. LRAs are responsible for developing redevelopment plans for installations, which are submitted to DOD. DOD must conduct an environmental impact analysis under NEPA, but LRAs design comprehensive reuse plans for BRAC property. The redevelopment plan is submitted to DOD as part of the proposed federal action. The redevelopment plan submitted to DOD as part of the proposed federal action may influence disposal decisions, with local zoning authorities and state regulations also playing a role. DOD regulations outline the formation of LRAs with broad-based membership, and consultation with state governors and local government heads is required if an LRA is not recognized or fails to submit a plan timely. The DOD policy requires consultation with state governors and local government heads before disposing of property. The BRAC process aims to expedite property transfer for community reuse. The first step is notifying other DOD components and federal agencies when property becomes available. Interested parties must express their intent within thirty days and provide details of the intended use. The DOD policy requires consultation with state governors and local government heads before disposing of property. The BRAC process aims to expedite property transfer for community reuse. Interested parties must express their intent within thirty days of the notice of availability and submit an application for transfer of the property. The transferring DOD component reviews applications to determine if the transfer is appropriate based on various factors. The DOD policy requires consultation with state governors and local government heads before disposing of property. The BRAC process aims to expedite property transfer for community reuse. Interested parties must submit an application for transfer of the property, which will be reviewed based on factors such as validity, consistency with property use, impact on remaining portions, environmental responsibilities, fair market value, and government's best interest. If multiple acceptable applications are received, priority is given to national defense missions, homeland defense mission, and LRA's comments. The DOD policy requires consultation with state governors and local government heads before disposing of property. Interested parties must submit an application for transfer of the property, which will be reviewed based on factors such as validity, consistency with property use, impact on remaining portions, environmental responsibilities, fair market value, and government's best interest. If a federal-to-federal transfer is deemed appropriate, it may occur with or without compensation, but fair market value reimbursement is required unless waived or specified by law. Failure to provide reimbursement results in the property being declared surplus and disposed of according to laws. If no federal agencies pursue acquisition or if DOD denies a transfer application, the property is determined to be surplus. Prior to a final determination that the BRAC property is surplus, DOD must determine if the installation includes \"public domain lands.\" If the lands were originally withdrawn from the public domain for military use, the Department of the Interior may review the property to decide if it is suitable for return to the public domain. If DOD decides not to retain the property, it issues a Notice of Intent to Relinquish, and the Bureau of Land Management determines if the land should be returned to the DOI or disposed of under the Base Closure Act. The Base Closure Community Development and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 changed the process for BRAC properties closed after October 25, 1994. The Secretary of Defense is required to publish notice of available property and submit information to HUD and the LRA for that installation. The Base Closure Community Development and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 requires the Secretary of Defense to notify HUD and the LRA about available property. Interested parties, including representatives of the homeless, submit notices of interest to the LRA. The LRA considers these interests in preparing a redevelopment plan, which is then reviewed by HUD and the Secretary of Defense. HUD can negotiate changes and determine plan acceptability. Once approved, the plan is submitted to DOD, which must implement homeless assistance components. The Base Closure Community Development and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 requires DOD to give substantial deference to the redevelopment plan's homeless assistance recommendations. Public benefit transfers under FPASA allow for property conveyance at a discount for specified public purposes, with specific entities eligible for acquisition based on the intended public benefit use. According to FPASA, public benefit transfers allow for property conveyance at a discount for specific public purposes. The Department of Defense (DOD) must inform relevant agencies of available property for public benefit use and coordinate with interested parties for redevelopment plans. LRAs are encouraged to consider but not required to include interests in the plan. DOD conducts official screenings for public benefit transfers based on potential uses identified. The LRA is responsible for implementing legally binding terms for property transfers, ensuring compliance and future utilization. If violated, the property reverts to the LRA for management. DOD can transfer BRAC property via conservation conveyance if not used for federal or public benefit transfers. Eligibility for conservation conveyance requires suitability for conservation purposes and prior consideration for public benefit transfer. The DOD can transfer BRAC property for conservation purposes to a state or nonprofit entity with a reversionary clause. The Secretary of the Interior can release restrictions for fair market value. Disposal can be through public auction or negotiated sale as per FPASA guidelines. The FPASA guidelines allow for public advertising for bids under terms that promote competition. A negotiated sale is permissible in certain circumstances, such as when public interest or national security is at stake, fair market value is below $15,000, or a public auction has failed to produce acceptable bids. Additionally, disposal to a state, territory, or U.S. possession is allowed, and negotiated sale can be authorized by other laws. The Base Closure Act allows for Economic Development Conveyances (EDCs) where DOD can transfer BRAC property to a Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) for less than fair market value to support economic development. Amendments in 1999 and 2001 changed the requirements for EDCs, limiting the Secretary of Defense's discretion in authorizing reduced or no-cost conveyances. The Base Closure Act allows for Economic Development Conveyances (EDCs) where DOD can transfer BRAC property to a Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) for less than fair market value to support economic development. Amendments in 1999 and 2001 changed the requirements for EDCs, limiting the Secretary of Defense's discretion in authorizing reduced or no-cost conveyances. Under Section 2905(b), the Secretary of Defense must now seek fair market value for property transfers, with limited exceptions for transfers without consideration under specific terms. In 2009, Congress further amended the Base Closure Act regarding Economic Development Conveyances (EDCs), allowing property transfers for consideration at or below fair market value or without consideration. This change was made due to difficulties in financial markets and local economic conditions. The Secretary can accept various forms of consideration for property transfers, taking into account economic conditions. LRAs must use proceeds for economic redevelopment and can apply for an EDC after completing a redevelopment plan. The Secretary provides a preliminary determination within 30 days of receiving an application for negotiation. The LRA application for negotiation of terms and conditions must include descriptions of job generation contributions, economic impact of closure, and reasons for choosing an EDC over other disposal authorities. The transferring Secretary evaluates the application based on economic effects, interests of federal agencies, and benefits to the United States. Regulations address EDCs without consideration if the LRA agrees to the terms. The regulations for an EDC do not conflict with the amended law. Authorized uses for economic redevelopment include road construction, transportation facilities, sewer construction, public facilities, utility construction, building rehabilitation, historic preservation, pollution prevention, demolition, landscaping, and planning for development. If funds are not used for redevelopment, DOD is authorized to intervene. If the LRA does not use funds for economic redevelopment, DOD can recoup proceeds under the Base Closure Act. Federal law allows leasing of BRAC property to federal and non-federal lessees, including a \"leaseback\" arrangement where property is conveyed to an LRA and leased to a federal agency for up to fifty years. The Base Closure Act allows leasing of BRAC property for up to fifty years, with proceeds deposited into a specific account. Non-federal leases are authorized under 10 U.S.C. \u00a72667, with fair market value payments required unless public interest justifies a lower rate. The focus remains on final property disposition despite potential economic benefits of leasing. The Base Closure Act allows leasing of BRAC property for up to fifty years, with proceeds deposited into a specific account. Non-federal leases are authorized under 10 U.S.C. \u00a72667, with fair market value payments required unless public interest justifies a lower rate. Prior to leasing a BRAC property, DOD consults with the EPA to determine suitability. NEPA requires analysis of environmental impacts for proposed federal actions. Relief from full NEPA application for BRAC property leases is limited to environmental consequences of authorized activities. Leases of BRAC property are intended to be short-term measures for economic development, with terms up to five years. Leases to LRAs at below fair market value require proceeds to be used for protection and maintenance. The Base Closure Act and the FPASA govern the transfer and disposal process for 2005 round BRAC properties. If the property is not transferred to other DOD components or federal agencies, it is deemed surplus and may be disposed of. Compliance with these authorities involves analyzing suitability for homeless assistance or public benefit transfer. DOD considers various factors, consults with LRAs, and ultimately makes final determinations. Public auctions and negotiated sales are options for disposal. The disposal process for 2005 round BRAC properties is governed by the Base Closure Act and the FPASA. If the property is not transferred to other DOD components or federal agencies, it may be deemed surplus and disposed of through public auctions, negotiated sales, or EDCs under certain conditions."
