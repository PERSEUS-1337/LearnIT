    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Don't Let the Bed Bugs Bite Act of 2009\". Congress finds that on February 12, 2008, a hotel in Nashua, New Hampshire, had 16 rooms infested with bedbugs. Bedbugs, known as cimex lectularius, spread through ventilation systems in multi-unit establishments, leading to exponential infestations. Female bedbugs can lay up to 5 eggs per day and 500 in their lifetime. Bedbug populations in the US have increased by 500% in recent years. New York City saw a significant rise in bedbug violations from 2004 to 2005. A study from 2002 to 2006 found that 25% of hotel rooms needed bedbug treatment. Research indicates that a high percentage of hotels require bedbug treatment, with concerns about the potential for disease transmission. Public health implications and the spread of infectious diseases due to bedbugs are not adequately addressed in current research. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. BED BUG INSPECTION GRANT PROGRAM.\" is a condensed version of the information provided in the previous paragraph about the public health implications and spread of infectious diseases due to bedbugs. The Secretary of Commerce, with the Travel and Tourism Advisory Board, may grant funds to eligible States for inspections for bed bugs. States must have a program inspecting at least 20% of lodging facilities annually for bed bugs, with qualified inspectors. The Federal government will fund up to 80% of a program for inspecting lodging facilities for bed bugs. States can use the grant for inspections, training personnel, contracting with applicators, and educating lodging staff on prevention methods. To receive the grant, States must have a program inspecting at least 20% of lodging facilities annually for bed bugs. The Act requires eligible States to submit an application to the Secretary of Commerce to receive a grant for inspecting lodging facilities for bed bugs. A lodging facility is defined as a hotel, motel, or inn with more than 10 individual rooms. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2013 for these grants. SEC. 4 amends the United States Housing Act to include bed bug prevention in public housing agency plans. SEC. 5 amends the Public Health Service Act to include bed bug prevention in the block grant program. SEC. 6 requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate and report on bed bugs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will investigate the public health impact of bed bugs on lodging and housing, focusing on mental health effects, potential spread of infectious diseases, and contribution to conditions like asthma. They will report findings and recommendations to Congress by December 31, 2010. Additionally, the Secretary of Commerce will submit a report to Congress within 3 years of the first grant issued under this Act, assessing the effectiveness of the bed bug inspection grant program."
