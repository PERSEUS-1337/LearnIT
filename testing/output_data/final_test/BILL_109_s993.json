    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new excise tax on acquisitions of interests in insurance contracts held by certain exempt organizations. This tax is imposed under Subchapter F of Chapter 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A 100 percent tax is imposed on the acquisition costs of any interest in an applicable insurance contract by certain exempt organizations or other individuals if the interest does not meet specific criteria. The term 'applicable insurance contract' includes life insurance, annuity, or similar contracts. The term 'contract' refers to life insurance, annuity, or endowment contracts where both an exempt organization and another party hold an interest. Exceptions apply if all parties, except exempt organizations, have an insurable interest in the insured. The contract involves an exempt organization and other parties who have a sole interest as named beneficiaries or beneficiaries of a trust without consideration. The term 'acquisition costs' in relation to an insurance contract refers to the direct or indirect costs incurred in acquiring an interest in the contract, including fees, commissions, and charges. These costs are defined for trustees holding interests in contracts for the benefit of exempt organizations or specified individuals. The tax imposed by subsection (a) with respect to acquisition costs of any acquisition shall be imposed each time the costs are paid or incurred. An interest in the contract includes any right with respect to the contract, whether as an owner, beneficiary, or otherwise, including indirect interests in entities holding the contract. When exchanging applicable insurance contracts with no recognized gain or loss, any interest in the contracts involved is treated collectively. Increasing an interest in such a contract is considered a separate acquisition. Acquiring an interest before a contract is deemed applicable insurance results in a taxable acquisition. The acquisition of an interest in an applicable insurance contract is defined as when the contract becomes applicable. An applicable exempt organization is described as specific types of organizations. The tax imposed by this section is not considered an investment in the contract for tax purposes. The Secretary will create necessary regulations to implement this section. The regulations may exempt certain contracts from being treated as applicable insurance contracts based on specific factors, prevent multiple taxes on the same interest, and aim to prevent avoidance of the section's purposes. The regulations aim to prevent avoidance of the section's purposes by exempting certain contracts from being treated as applicable insurance contracts. A conforming amendment is made to the table of subchapters for chapter 42 of the Code. \"Reporting Requirements for insurance contracts held by exempt organizations are outlined in SEC. 6050U of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\" Reporting requirements for exempt organizations acquiring interests in applicable insurance contracts are outlined in subsection (a) of SEC. 6050U of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This includes making returns as described in subsection (c) for acquisitions and transfers of such interests that are taxable under section 4965. The Internal Revenue Code outlines reporting requirements for exempt organizations acquiring interests in applicable insurance contracts. Returns must be filed as specified by the Secretary based on the calendar year of acquisition or transfer. The return must be in the form prescribed by the Secretary. The Internal Revenue Code requires returns to be filed for exempt organizations acquiring interests in insurance contracts. The returns must include the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the organization, issuer of the contract, and any taxable parties involved. The Internal Revenue Code mandates that returns for exempt organizations acquiring interests in insurance contracts must include specific information such as names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers. Additionally, individuals required to make a return must provide written statements to those whose information is included in the return, containing necessary details and contact information.

Penalties for non-payment of tax under section 4965 are added to the table of sections in subpart B of part III of subchapter A of chapter 61. The amendments made by this section apply to insurance contracts issued after May 3, 2005. Existing contracts held by exempt organizations before this date are also subject to reporting requirements. Insurance contracts issued after May 3, 2005 must be reported to the Secretary of the Treasury within 1 year of the enactment of this Act. The report should be submitted in the prescribed form and manner, containing necessary information. The Secretary will then submit these reports, along with any legislative recommendations, to the relevant committees within 6 months of the filing deadline."
