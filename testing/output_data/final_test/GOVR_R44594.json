    "content": "The federal government in the United States uses benefit-cost analyses (BCAs) to compare benefits and costs of projects. There is ongoing debate about how to value future benefits and costs, which is influenced by the discount rate used to convert future benefits into present value. The Water Resources Development Act of 1974 mandated federal agencies to use a discount rate based on the average yield of long-term government securities for evaluating water resource projects. The discount rate for water planning in FY2016 was 3.125%. This report explores the role and significance of discount rates in economic evaluations of Corps projects, including the history, theoretical basis, and criticisms of the water planning discount rate. It also discusses how the discount rate impacts the economic evaluation of projects and project alternatives. The report discusses how different discount rates impact the economic evaluation of Corps projects, with two projects used as examples. It also delves into the history and technical issues of the water planning discount rate. Appendices provide additional information on deriving discount rates and the economic evaluation of water resource projects. The report explores the impact of discount rates on economic evaluations of Corps projects, with a focus on the water planning discount rate. Economists often debate the appropriate discount rate for projects with long-term implications, as it can affect the economic efficiency of different solutions and the justification for federal investment in water resources. Corps BCAs, including the discount rate, play a crucial role in shaping decisions that will impact federal water resource assets. The quality and reliability of Benefit-Cost Analyses (BCAs) influence decision-making for federal water resource projects. Congress faces high demand for Corps projects, exceeding recent funding levels. The executive branch's performance-based budgeting approach focuses on a limited set of projects, using a different discount rate than the Corps for project selection. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is a key metric for project inclusion in budget requests, calculated at a 7% discount rate. Projects with BCRs below 2.5 are often excluded, posing challenges for Congress and nonfederal sponsors. The use of a 7% discount rate aligns with OMB guidance for federal programs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recommends a 7% discount rate for federal programs, as outlined in Circular A-94. This rate has been in place since 1992 and is meant to reflect the pretax rate of return on capital in the private sector. Critics have raised concerns about the water planning discount rate, which has been consistently lower than the OMB federal program discount rate since the late 1990s. Critics argue that the water planning discount rate should be based on private capital returns like the OMB federal program discount rate. Economists criticize the Corps for applying a nominal discount rate to real values, suggesting a change to a real rate. Supporters advocate for a lower discount rate for Corps projects with longer lifetimes. Other stakeholders are concerned about the role of the water planning discount rate in Corps projects. The water planning discount rate's impact on Corps project development and concerns about funding for projects below the BCR threshold are key issues for stakeholders. Addressing funding challenges for congressionally authorized projects may require more than just adjusting discount rates. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages civil and military programs within the Department of Defense. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a Department of Defense agency, manages civil and military programs. Its civil works mission includes evaluating, planning, and implementing water projects in navigation, flood risk reduction, and aquatic environmental restoration. The Corps follows a standard process for project development, involving congressional study authorization, feasibility studies, construction authorization, and project construction if funds are appropriated. The Corps requires funds to construct projects, which are not automatically approved. Congressional study and construction authorizations are necessary, along with a nonfederal sponsor to share costs. Feasibility studies aim to recommend solutions to water resource problems, including alternative plans, engineering feasibility, BCAs, and environmental impact assessments under NEPA. The feasibility analysis determines if a project merits federal investment, especially for projects like flood damage reduction and navigation. The Chief of Engineers signs a recommendation known as the Chief's Report, which is submitted to congressional committees for authorization. The Chief of Engineers submits the Chief's Report to Congress for authorization, following federal policy guidelines established in the Flood Control Act of 1936. The evaluation focuses on whether a project's National Economic Development benefits exceed its costs, calculated using the water planning discount rate. The Corps evaluates projects based on National Economic Development benefits exceeding costs, including direct and indirect costs over 50 years. NED benefits involve increased output like recreation, while NED costs encompass construction and associated expenses. The water planning discount rate is applied to determine the project's value. The Corps uses the water planning discount rate to calculate the net present value of project alternatives by subtracting the present value of costs from the present value of benefits. If benefits do not exceed costs, congressional authorization is not recommended. BCAs rely on assumptions about impacts, environmental benefits, future economic conditions, and environmental parameters. The Corps' economic evaluations of project alternatives do not typically include the monetization of environmental benefits and costs. The debate over discount rates for federal water resource projects revolves around the balance between near-term and long-term considerations. Higher discount rates are often seen as more suitable for projects with shorter lifetimes, while lower discount rates may be more appropriate for investments with longer-term impacts, despite not being based on observed economic behavior in private markets. The relevance of Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) procedures and discount rates for federal water resource projects, including new construction, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of aging infrastructure, is crucial for federal investment decisions. Congressional authorization of Corps projects, such as those in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, highlights the importance of these procedures in current federal decision-making. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) authorized 22 construction projects totaling $18.53 billion, with the Chief of Engineers recommending an additional 22 projects costing $8.8 billion for congressional approval. The discount rate used in Benefit-Cost Analysis can impact project attractiveness and efficiency in solving water resources problems. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 authorized construction projects totaling $18.53 billion, with additional projects recommended for approval. Evaluating alternatives for coastal storm damage reduction projects involves considering structural solutions, buyouts of vulnerable properties, and nourished dunes and beaches, each with different cost and benefit distributions. The timing of benefits and costs for coastal storm damage reduction projects varies, affecting economic evaluations and BCRs. Discount rates significantly impact the calculation of net national economic development benefits. Projects with unevenly distributed benefits and costs are highly influenced by the discount rate used, especially those with high construction costs upfront and benefits spread over the project's lifetime. BCRs for such projects are higher at lower discount rates. Discount rates significantly impact the calculation of net national economic development benefits for projects with unevenly distributed benefits and costs. BCRs for projects like dams, levees, and floodwalls are higher at lower discount rates and lower at higher discount rates. In contrast, projects with costs and benefits evenly dispersed throughout their lifetimes are less affected by the discount rate applied. The impact of different discount rates on various project types is illustrated in the \"Impact of Discount Rate on Benefit-Cost Ratios.\" The Cedar River flood risk reduction project in Cedar Rapids, IA, uses levees and floodwalls to manage riverine flood risks. Costs are concentrated in the first five years, while benefits are spread over the 50-year design life. Another project, the Hereford Inlet to Cape May Inlet Coastal Storm Damage Reduction Project, uses engineered dunes and regular renourishment of sand. Both projects have costs and benefits distributed over 50 years. The discussion includes water planning discount rates and the OMB federal program discount rate of 7%. Figure 3 shows benefit and cost estimates for the Cedar River project. The Corps' benefit and cost estimates for the preferred alternative for the Cedar River, Cedar Rapids project include a 2.2-mile floodwall and a 0.8-mile earthen levee. The estimates show benefits and costs with different discount rates, highlighting the high construction costs in the first five years and annual benefits thereafter. Discounting at 4.125% reduces the present value of future project benefits. The discount rate used strongly influences the present value of future project benefits. At a 4.125% discount rate, the project would break even in year 26, with a cumulative net benefit of $32.24 million over 50 years. However, at a 7% discount rate, the project was not found to have a cumulative net benefit. The project costs exceeded benefits by $7.32 million at a 7% discount rate over 50 years. Increasing the discount rate from 4.125% to 7% changed the BCR from 1.2 to 0.69 in year 50. The Hereford Inlet to Cape May Inlet Coastal Storm Damage Reduction Project involves constructing a dune and berm with regular beach nourishment activities to reduce coastal storm damages. The discount rates impact the costs and benefits of beach nourishment activities for coastal storm damage reduction. At a 3.500% discount rate, the Hereford Inlet to Cape May project breaks even around year three, with a net benefit of $96.18 million. At a 7.0% discount rate, the net benefit decreases to $49.80 million. The discount rate significantly impacts the costs and benefits of coastal projects. Changing the discount rate from 3.5% to 7% resulted in a decrease in the net benefit of the Hereford Inlet to Cape May project from $96.18 million to $49.80 million. The BCR for the coastal project was less affected by the discount rate compared to the Cedar River, Cedar Rapids example due to the more even distribution of benefits and costs. Applying a single discount rate to all projects allows for easier comparison and ranking across authorized projects. The use of different discount rates for Corps projects makes it challenging to compare them for funding decisions. The executive branch applies a 7% discount rate to projects selected using a different rate during the planning process. This inconsistency affects the cost-benefit analysis and budgeting for authorized projects. The discount rate used in the planning process can impact the selection of water resource project alternatives. The executive branch applies a 7% discount rate to projects authorized with a different rate, potentially leading to different preferred alternatives. This inconsistency complicates cost-benefit analysis and budgeting for Corps projects. Since 1974, federal water projects have been evaluated using a discount rate formula based on the average interest rate on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds. The Green Book guidelines, initially voluntary, became mandatory within the executive branch with the publication of Circular A-47. The Bureau of the Budget, in Circular A-47, established guidelines for using the average rate of interest on Treasury securities to determine discount rates for evaluating federal water projects. The choice of securities depended on the project's economically useful life, with different criteria for projects over or under 15 years. In 1962, S.Doc. 97 replaced Circular A-47 and established a uniform discount rate for federal water projects, simplifying the process by using the average rate of interest on Treasury securities with terms to maturity of 15 years or more. The discount rate ranged from 2.625% in 1962 to 3.250% in 1968. In 1968, the Water Resources Council changed the discount rate formula from the coupon rate to the yield rate on long-term Treasury bonds. The council capped annual changes in the discount rate at 0.25% per year, leading to an increase from 4.625% in 1969 to 5.625% in 1974. In October 1973, new regulations known as Principles and Standards altered the discount rate formula for evaluating federal water resource projects. The discount rate formula was changed in 1968 by the Water Resources Council to use the yield rate on long-term Treasury bonds. The rate was capped at 0.25% per year, increasing from 4.625% in 1969 to 5.625% in 1974. In 1974, the discount rate formula reverted back to the one established in S.Doc. 97, decreasing the rate to 5.625% with a maximum yearly rate change of 0.25%. Since then, the discount rate has remained unchanged, based on the average yield on government securities with 15 years or more to maturity. The discount rate for federal water projects has fluctuated over the years, with rates increasing from 1975 to 1987 and then steadily decreasing after 1990. In 2016, the rate was 3.125%. The rates are evaluated based on the social rate of time preference (SRTP) approach, which reflects society's compensation for substituting future consumption for current consumption. Critics argue that SRTP rates only consider resources diverted from consumption and not from investment. The discount rate for federal water projects fluctuates based on the social rate of time preference (SRTP) approach. The calculation and use of the water planning discount rate have technical issues, such as using a nominal discount rate for estimating real benefits and costs. The Corps' valuation practices do not incorporate uncertainty associated with future benefits and costs. WRDA 1974 requires the agency to use a nominal discount rate, but Corps planning guidance calls for estimating benefits and costs in real dollars. The use of real estimates for benefits and costs with a nominal discount rate understates the present value. A real water planning discount rate is described in Appendix C, capped at 0.25% to reduce volatility. This cap no longer precisely reflects current borrowing costs, affecting the tie to long-term Treasury bonds. The discount rate generally changes by the maximum allowable percentage of 0.25%. The discount rate for water planning projects is capped at 0.25% to reduce volatility. This cap has influenced the rate's changes over time, affecting project evaluations and net benefits. The Corps is mandated to use this rate for planning projects, with no current proposals to change it. The executive branch has used a 7% discount rate since the mid-2000s for calculations. The executive branch has used a 7% discount rate since the mid-2000s to calculate construction project BCRs for budgeting purposes. The interest in the water planning discount rate is due to concerns over the uncertain construction prospects for congressionally authorized projects that do not meet the BCR threshold. Addressing funding challenges for these projects may require more than just adjusting discount rates. Supporters argue for a lower discount rate for Corps projects due to their longer lifetimes, while others debate technical issues and the basis of the water planning discount rate on Treasury rates. Economists disagree on the appropriate discount rate, considering factors like society's preference for consumption today, opportunity cost of capital, and risks. The discount rate is crucial in benefit-cost analyses for federal water resource projects, influencing decisions on future benefits and costs. Academic experts debate on the appropriate discount rate for evaluating long-lived public investments, which can impact the efficacy of funds spent on these projects. The debate over the appropriate discount rate for evaluating long-lived public investments has economic, political, and ethical components. Economists support discounting to account for the opportunity cost of capital or the rate of return needed to defer current consumption. Monetizing social returns and the limitations of private capital as a substitute for social or natural capital are challenges in evaluating projects. The appropriate discount rate for evaluating long-lived public investments has economic, political, and ethical components. Discount rates raise questions about trading present consumption for future generations. Some economists suggest varying discount rates for federal programs based on specific conditions. In a perfectly functioning market, discount rates can be calculated in four ways. In a perfectly functioning market, the discount rate calculated to reflect the Social Rate of Time Preference (SRTP) would be the same as the discount rate calculated to reflect the Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC). However, due to market imperfections like taxes and risk aversion, different discount rates are used, leading to disagreements. Economists have proposed four methods for calculating the social discount rate: pre-tax return on investment, after-tax savings, weighted-average, and shadow price of capital methods. These methods are depicted in Figure A-1, showing how they account for the cost of investment in terms of capital. The OMB recommends using a discount rate based on the opportunity cost of capital approach in Circular A-94 for federal programs. This approach reflects how federal investment diverts resources from private investment. The circular allows for flexibility in using other rates, such as Treasury's borrowing rates in certain situations. In 1992, OMB revised Circular A-94 and lowered the recommended federal program discount rate. In 1992, OMB revised Circular A-94, lowering the federal program discount rate from 10% to 7% to align with the average rate of return to private capital. This rate is recommended for most federal agencies to assess projects, except for water resource projects. Critics argue that this approach may not properly account for future generations' welfare, sparking a debate on its use. The OMB recommends using a 7% and 3% discount rate for federal regulations, with the 3% rate reflecting that regulatory impacts do not solely affect capital allocation. The 3% rate is based on the real rate of return on government debt over the past thirty years. The pretax return on investment method is used to calculate the discount rate, adjusting for inflation. Calculating a discount rate using the pretax rate of return on private investments is contentious due to the variety of private-sector interest rates and theoretical arguments against its accuracy. Some believe it generates an average rather than a marginal rate of return and may overestimate the discount rate by reflecting individual rather than societal risk premiums. This can make it challenging to achieve a benefit-cost ratio greater than one. The after-tax savings method suggests using a discount rate that reflects the compensation required by society to substitute future consumption for current consumption. Critics have concerns about using this method as it may generate an individual rather than a social rate of time preference. According to economists at the Federal Aviation Administration, observed interest rates may overestimate the discount rate for actions affecting future generations. Some argue that a riskless rate like the Treasury rate is not suitable for evaluating long-term projects. Tax finance should consider the excess burden of taxation, which is the welfare loss from taxes. The excess burden of taxation is the welfare loss from taxes, which should be considered in tax finance. The weighted-average method combines the pretax return on investment and after-tax savings techniques to determine the social discount rate. The shadow price of capital method is a fourth approach to discounting that combines aspects of the OCC and STRP methods. It reflects the social value of private capital by converting displaced and increased private investments into consumption equivalents. This method discounts consumption over time using the compensation required by society to substitute future consumption for current consumption. The shadow price of capital method is rarely used for federal projects due to stringent information requirements. It generates different discount rates based on project impacts on future consumption and investment. Decisions on water resource projects involve trade-offs between various uses and winners and losers. Free-flowing rivers support recreation, fisheries, and scenic beauty, while dams support hydropower, flood control, navigation, and water supply. Managing rivers for different purposes such as recreation, navigation, and water supply involves evaluating trade-offs between benefits. The Corps follows specific guidelines for economic and environmental evaluations of water projects to increase National Economic Development benefits. The Corps projects aim to increase National Economic Development benefits by ensuring a positive Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) or NED benefit. Different planning guidance may have varying objectives. The appendix discusses national economic development benefit and cost categories, evaluating NED benefits and costs, evolution of federal water planning guidance, and changes in water planning discount rates. Benefit-cost analysis (BCA) for federal water projects involves determining which categories of benefits and costs to include. The NED account includes increases and decreases in goods and services expressed in monetary units, but excludes benefits and costs not valued in monetary terms by the Corps. NED benefits are defined as increases in national economic value, output resulting from external economies, and associated values. The NED benefits of a project include increases in national economic value, output resulting from external economies, and associated values such as the use of unemployed or under-employed labor resources. These benefits encompass direct and indirect increases in production and employment, measured by the willingness of users to pay for each increment of output created by the project. The project's output may cover various categories of goods and services, including water supply, flood-water reduction, irrigation, erosion reduction, flood damage reduction, hydropower, transportation, recreation, and fishing. Additional direct benefits can result from the project's incidental increases in outputs or reductions in production costs. The NED account includes direct benefits like increased national economic value and production output. It does not consider the distribution of benefits or environmental benefits that are hard to quantify. NED costs consist of implementation outlays and direct project costs. The NED account includes direct benefits like increased national economic value and production output, while NED costs consist of implementation outlays and direct project costs. Implementation costs for a project include planning, design, construction, contingency, administrative services, habitat mitigation, relocation, salvage operations, and land, water, and mineral rights costs. Other direct costs involve resources required for a project but not necessarily monetary expenditures, such as implicit costs of displaced resources, uncompensated NED losses, and negative externalities. Uncompensated NED losses occur when a project reduces economic output without monetary expenditure, such as loss of recreation user days. Negative externalities are costs for affected third parties, like loss of commercial fishing. The NED account does not address qualitative equity concerns regarding project cost distribution. The NED account does not consider projects' costs paid by specific demographics. Evaluating benefits and costs involves expressing them in real prices, not nominal. Calculating real dollar values for benefits and costs varies in difficulty, with market prices used whenever possible. The valuation process for goods and services becomes more challenging as the good in question becomes further removed from a traded market. Economists, environmentalists, and fiscal conservatives have criticized this approach, but the Corps is working to improve its nonmarket valuation methodologies. The evolution of federal water planning guidance began with the 1950 Green Book, which outlined economic analysis practices for river basin projects. The Green Book outlines the objective of benefit-cost analysis for River Basin Projects, emphasizing the inclusion of both market and nonmarket benefits and costs. Circular A-47 made these procedures mandatory in 1952, making benefit-cost analysis the dominant component of project evaluation. Circular A-47 mandates that a project's estimated benefits must exceed its estimated costs, with a BCR of at least 1.0 required for approval. The focus is on monetized values, with nonmarket benefits and costs included only if estimated in dollars. Legislation in the 1950s aimed to broaden water project evaluation procedures, leading to the Kennedy Administration's actions in 1962 based on a Senate recommendation. The Kennedy Administration revised water project planning guidelines in response to a Senate recommendation, replacing the BCR test with broader objectives. S.Doc. 97 emphasized achieving the best use of water and land resources for economic development, preservation, and people's well-being. The Water Resources Council further revised these guidelines in 1968. The Water Resources Council (WRC) revised the guidelines in S.Doc. 97 in 1970, proposing new Principles and Standards (P&S) for evaluating water projects. The proposal focused on quantifying project benefits and costs in terms of national economic development, environment quality, regional development, and social factors. However, the final version of the P&S in 1973 took a narrower approach to selecting feasible water projects, focusing on a single national objective. The 1973 P&S focused on a single national economic development objective but was revised in 1974 under WRDA 1974 to include environmental matters on equal footing. The revised P&S in 1980 included four coequal accounts for water resources planning. In 1982, the P&S accounts for water resources planning were replaced by the Principles and Guidelines (P&G) which established four accounts: NED, RED, EQ, and OSE. The P&G prioritized the NED account as the only mandatory one for evaluating federal water projects. Under the Principles and Guidelines (P&G), the NED account is prioritized for evaluating federal water projects. The identification of a preferred alternative and recommendation to proceed with a project depends on NED benefits and costs, calculated using the water planning discount rate. In 2007, Congress instructed the Secretary of the Army to develop new planning guidance for the Corps, and in 2013, the Obama Administration released updated Principles and Requirements for Federal Investments in Water Resources. Investments in Water Resources were updated in December 2014 with broader social benefits defined in the Principles, Requirements, and Guidelines (PR&G). The PR&G now include environmental, economic, and social goals with equal weight, as well as monetary and nonmonetary effects. Congress has prevented the Corps from using the updated PR&G, so the 1983 P&G remain in effect. The evolution in planning guidance also led to changes in the discount rate used for water resources planning. The Corps currently discounts real dollars using a nominal discount rate, but there is a discrepancy with the 1983 Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines. One solution proposed is to adjust the water planning discount rate for inflation to transform it into a real discount rate. This would approximate what the Corps project discount rate would be if adjusted for inflation and not constrained to an annual change of 0.25%. The real project discount rate would have been lower than the water planning discount rate in 1986 if it were not capped."
