    "content": "The Earth's climate is changing, evidenced by various observations such as temperature changes, melting glaciers, shifting precipitation patterns, and modified growing seasons. Regional climates in the United States have also shifted. The main contributing factors to these changes are rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. The rise in greenhouse gas concentrations is mainly due to human activities, contributing to the majority of global temperature increase since the late 1970s. Other factors like air pollution, irrigation, and ozone depletion have localized effects on temperature and precipitation patterns. Volcanic eruptions and solar cycles can also influence climate in the short term. Climate changes have significant economic and ecological consequences, depending on the causes. Climate changes have significant economic and ecological consequences, with impacts on agricultural productivity, forest health, water supply, temperatures, and coastal erosion. The U.S. Congress has been involved in authorizing and funding programs to study and address climate change, with a shift towards more science programs after 1990. The choices made by Congress will influence the future consequences of climate change globally. The U.S. consented to ratify the UNFCCC to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This commitment, legally binding but not enforceable, guided federal actions like the first U.S. climate action plan in 1992. Since then, federal programs and legislative proposals have aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through various efforts. The Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that the Clean Air Act's definition of \"air pollutant\" includes any substance emitted into the air. EPA cannot consider policy in regulating GHG emissions and must act if it determines greenhouse gases contribute to climate change. EPA has regulated six GHGs due to their impact on human health and welfare. The Obama Administration and experts prefer new legislation over using the Clean Air Act to address greenhouse gas emissions. The 111th Congress debated bills for comprehensive climate change policy, including cap-and-trade regulations. The 112th Congress focuses on limiting EPA's authority to control GHGs and cutting funding for climate change programs. New federal programs for climate change adaptation have emerged in the 2000s. In the 2000s, federal agencies and some in Congress view projections of climate change impacts and preparation as part of the government's stewardship responsibilities for public resources and human health. However, some in Congress may not fully support funding for these programs due to budget constraints or concerns about strategies. Various programs influence U.S. contributions and vulnerabilities to climate change, such as regulations and incentives for agriculture, energy, and infrastructure. These programs affect emissions of greenhouse gases, technological opportunities, and vulnerabilities to climate-related changes. The report outlines conceptual approaches and policy tools for addressing climate change, as ongoing public concerns and international pressures push for U.S. collaboration in mitigation and adaptation efforts. Policy-makers have not converged on a common approach, with some questioning the need for governmental intervention. Four competing strategies for setting climate change policies are discussed. The U.S. government has primarily followed a strategy of research and wait-and-see in setting climate change policies, aiming to gain more certainty through scientific research before making effective policy decisions. This approach also involves investing in technology research to potentially reduce GHG abatement costs in the future. The U.S. government has invested billions in climate research and clean technologies over the past two decades, with only a small fraction allocated to direct mitigation policies. Some argue that research may widen uncertainties, while others warn that wrong actions taken in uncertainty may lead to unnecessary costs. Economic conditions in the future may make addressing climate change more affordable. Research has made significant scientific progress over the past three decades, but uncertainties in climate change predictions may not be significantly narrowed in the next decade or two. Future generations may find it more affordable to address climate change due to increasing incomes and improving technologies. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, future policies would need to make greater reductions to avoid specific risks. The lowering of technology costs may or may not offset the added costs of starting later for greater GHG reductions. Some propose a science-centric approach to identify policy goals based on physical or biological criteria. This approach assumes science can provide an objective standard for climate change risks. The science-based approach uses estimated relationships between GHG emissions, atmospheric concentrations, temperature changes, and climate change impacts to set equivalent targets. Current GHG levels are comparable to a certain level but are projected to rise unless emissions are reduced to net zero. Policy inducements aim to reduce emissions to net zero, with higher GHG concentrations leading to increased temperature projections. Recent policy debates focus on targets such as preventing global temperature increases above 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C, stabilizing atmospheric GHG concentrations at 350, 450, or 550 ppm, and setting maximum GHG emission levels. The international negotiating framework focuses on setting caps on GHG emissions to achieve the objective of avoiding \"dangerous\" climate change. The U.S. congressional debate on climate change strategy emphasizes percentage-reduction targets for GHG emissions and policy tools to use. The U.S. congressional debate on climate change strategy focuses on percentage-reduction targets for GHG emissions and policy tools to use, rather than debating science-based policy goals. Challenges in using primarily science to set climate change policy targets include differing confidence levels in scientific findings and the complexity of climate science dimensions beyond global average temperature. Some impacts of climate change may depend on precipitation changes rather than just temperature. Different experts have varying views on which climate changes are important for policy decisions, such as focusing on current events or considering long-term impacts like Antarctic melting. Decisions may also be influenced by how heavily individuals weigh impacts at home versus those occurring elsewhere. Policy-makers and stakeholders have different preferences for accepting risks, with scientific guidance available on critical thresholds or tipping points for adverse effects. The 2011 National Research Council report emphasizes that choosing targets involves values and policy considerations beyond strictly scientific factors. Scientists are studying potential critical thresholds in the climate system, which could have catastrophic effects on populations or ecosystems. CO2 emissions impact ocean acidification and may have more certain thresholds for policy-making than temperature effects. GHG emissions limits may depend on technological feasibility, with new technologies needed for long-term stabilization. Congressional proposals aim to promote new technology development and market. Some congressional proposals aim to promote new technology development and market penetration to address emissions. Emissions-denoted policy targets may be easier to achieve than concentrations or temperature targets, as a global effort is needed. Emission limits are seen as a practical way to allocate responsibilities and enforce regulations. Stakeholders may differ on whether policies should prioritize economic efficiency or scientific goals. To maximize economic growth, various economic approaches can define climate change policy, such as cost-benefit analysis. This approach aims to ensure that the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs, promoting efficiency in resource utilization. Formal assessment of costs and benefits is advocated for public policy decisions to select options where benefits exceed costs. This principle emphasizes the efficient use of private and public resources. President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12291 in 1981, requiring regulatory objectives to maximize net benefits to society. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) addresses efficiency but not other policy considerations like fairness, especially in climate change policy-making. Researchers have identified challenges in applying CBA to climate change decisions due to the involvement of diverse stakeholders with varying goals and constraints. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) may have unreliable estimates of costs and benefits, leading to inefficient decisions. Retrospective evaluations often show discrepancies between projected and actual outcomes. CBA assumes decisions are marginal and isolated from broader economic changes, which may not always hold true. Some analysts argue that human-induced climate change is a significant problem that could impact economies structurally and in terms of growth. Applying marginal analysis to non-marginal policy questions may lead to incorrect decisions. The choice of discount rates in Cost-benefit analysis for long-term effects can greatly influence outcomes, but there is disagreement among economists on the appropriate rates for climate change decisions. The controversy over discounting in Cost-benefit analysis for long-term effects remains unresolved despite decades of discourse. Climate change analysis values are uncertain and often assume people are risk-neutral, while empirical data suggest most are risk-averse. Differences in risk aversion among individuals can impact climate change policy choices. The controversy over discounting in Cost-benefit analysis for long-term effects remains unresolved despite decades of discourse. Critics argue that CBA does not support an appropriate decision rule, as it assumes a \"Kaldor-Hicks\" rule that may lead to inconsistent decisions. CBA typically does not assist in making trade-offs between gains and losses in social decision-making. CBA provides valuable information for public policy decisions, but it is not the only criterion. Economic analyses may be incomplete and biased due to unknown values and limitations. Despite challenges, CBA offers a comprehensive framework for decision-makers, although it may not yield a simple answer on optimal policies. An alternative approach is \"hedging\" or insurance through policy adoption. An alternative economic approach is \"hedging\" or insurance, by adopting policies to reduce risks of losses without certainty of those risks. This approach can be similar to buying homeowners' insurance even if the likelihood of losses is unknown. Policy-makers might enact low-cost measures or measures that serve other policy goals, known as \"no regrets\" measures. Hedging does not provide objective guidance on the \"right\" level or kinds of measures. \"Clean energy\" development may be a primary hedging strategy proposed by some Members of Congress. Economics offers cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate policy designs for achieving goals like limiting GHG emissions efficiently. Critics question the use of economics in policy recommendations and advocate for a more flexible approach. The traditional economic model based on greed and equilibrium is being replaced with purposeful behavior, enlightened self-interest, and sustainability. Contemporary economists acknowledge the limitations of full knowledge and rational behavior in optimizing the economy. Political scientist Charles Lindblom argues for incremental policy changes rather than drastic shifts. Charles Lindblom argues for incremental policy changes rather than drastic shifts, stating that complex problems cannot be fully analyzed. Decision-makers should aim for partial analysis and make agreed incremental policy changes with ad hoc adjustments as conditions evolve. An adaptive approach to climate change decision-making is recommended, involving setting an initial policy, monitoring progress, and making adjustments based on new knowledge and opportunities. Adaptive strategies for climate change involve making incremental policy changes and adjustments based on new knowledge and opportunities. Decision-making under deep uncertainty requires robust strategies that evolve over time in response to changes in the climate and economic systems. Adaptive-decision strategies can lead to effective climate policies that are flexible and responsive to evolving conditions. Climate policy as an adaptive process reconfigures the climate-change policy problem. Concerns include less certainty for investors and the need for radical technological and structural changes to abate climate change. \"Path dependence\" and incremental changes may hinder significant progress. Addressing climate change requires transformational change, not incrementalism. Success should be measured by the new potential for large-scale emissions reductions society has created. Transformational change alters power relationships and may be obstructed by a tendency to ignore information that goes against existing beliefs. Public and political interest in addressing climate change has fluctuated over the past three decades. Despite the lack of a comprehensive federal strategy, existing programs and measures, along with uncertainty about future science and policy, influence decision-making. The 112th Congress may consider eliminating, modifying, or enhancing climate change-related policies and programs. Various policy tools are already in use or could be implemented. A variety of policy tools, including regulatory and non-regulatory options, are available to address climate change concerns. These tools aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, distribute potential revenues from GHG programs, stimulate technological change, ease the economic transition to a lower GHG economy, encourage international actions, and promote adaptation to climate change. Many of these tools are considered complementary, and proponents argue that they can achieve results more effectively when used together. Most experts believe that the most economically efficient way to reduce GHG emissions is to put a price on emissions that reflects the costs to others. This can be done through traditional regulation or market mechanisms, such as setting emission performance standards or requiring specific technologies. Technology-forcing regulation has also been successful in setting future performance standards. Regulatory controls, including \"technology-forcing\" regulation, have been effective in setting future performance standards. Studies suggest that prioritizing cost-effectiveness and flexibility could reduce compliance costs. U.S. regulators face challenges in considering costs and have limited information on compliance costs for individual sources. Source-by-source regulation may not always achieve emission reduction targets at the lowest cost. Utilizing aspects of commodity markets can sometimes achieve similar emission reductions as source-by-source regulation. Utilizing market mechanisms in commodity markets can achieve emission reductions similar to source-by-source regulatory approaches at lower costs. Two main types of market mechanisms for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are GHG fees and cap-and-trade systems. GHG fees provide price certainty for sources but uncertainty in emission reductions, while cap-and-trade systems offer certainty in reductions but not in prices. Both mechanisms have the potential to generate significant revenues. Cap-and-trade systems can potentially generate significant revenues annually, separating who pays for emissions reductions from where they occur. Fees could be charged based on total emissions, incentivizing sources to reduce emissions until it is no longer cost-effective. This system allows for efficiency and equity objectives simultaneously, with variations such as charging fees only on emissions above designated rates by source types. However, emission fees do not offer flexibility in who takes action or where reductions occur, although there may be flexibility in when reductions are made. Many economists believe emission fees or taxes are the most efficient way to reduce emissions, but effectiveness may vary. Some experts suggest shifting existing taxes to pollution taxes to decrease demand for polluting products. Studies show positive or negative effects of replacing existing taxes with greenhouse gas taxes. Studies suggest that a tax shift could impact economic growth and employment, depending on its structure. Concerns include regressive nature of pollution taxes and potential reduction in revenue from carbon fees. Market mechanisms like cap-and-trade programs set emission caps and allocate allowances to individual sources. Allowances can be given away or sold to emit. In cap-and-trade programs, emission allowances can be allocated by giving them away or selling them. Entities can sell unneeded allowances, while those emitting more than their allocation must reduce emissions or buy additional allowances. This system creates a market where entities can trade allowances, incentivizing emission reductions. Cap-and-trade systems allow for flexibility through emission reduction credits or offsets, which can minimize costs by allowing reductions to occur domestically or internationally. International credits could help reduce compliance costs with U.S. GHG requirements. Banking and borrowing provisions enable entities to save unneeded allowances for future use or borrow against future allocations. In designing a cap-and-trade program, key decisions include how to allocate GHG reduction requirements and whether to set price limits on allowances. Policy makers must determine who is responsible for reducing emissions, which affects who pays for reductions. Emissions limits or performance standards may vary by sector or size, with some sources potentially excluded. In establishing control policy for GHG emissions, key decisions include setting limits on emissions sources and determining how emission allowances will be allocated. This may involve excluding certain sources based on sector or size, and requiring regulated sources to buy emissions permits. Allowances may be given away or sold to cover emissions, with one allowance equaling a permit to emit one ton of a pollutant in a cap-and-trade system. In a cap-and-trade system, allowances can be allocated through various methods such as giving them away, selling them, or auctioning them. These allowances are valuable as they can be sold, potentially transferring billions of dollars of wealth. The allocation of allowances is a crucial and controversial aspect of the GHG reduction debate, as it can impact the efficiency and fairness of the program. One way to minimize wealth transfer in a GHG control program is to sell allowances rather than give them away. Selling allowances, including auctions, can increase efficiency in reducing GHGs. GHG allowances under a cap-and-trade program become a market commodity with prices that can fluctuate based on various conditions. Some advocate for setting a ceiling on the maximum price for GHG allowances to prevent costs from escalating. This \"safety valve\" would limit costs but also reduce incentives for technological innovation and overall GHG reductions. Researchers suggest that price volatility can drive technology innovation, making emissions caps more favorable than emission fees. Stakeholders propose setting a price floor for allowances to stimulate technological advancement and ensure a minimum value for services. Taxing emissions or selling allowances could generate significant public revenues, raising questions about how to allocate these funds. A key policy issue related to taxes, sales, or auctions is deciding how to use the revenues generated. This can include offsetting other taxes, funding programs to reduce transition costs, addressing distributional concerns, or supporting programs unrelated to reducing GHG emissions. The use of revenues can impact the overall costs of GHG reductions. Public information programs can help prepare people for GHG control policies and gain their support. Providing information about climate change risks can induce voluntary action and promote anticipatory adaptation. Accurate information about risks can help investors make appropriate decisions. Product labeling and seals of approval are tools used to facilitate efficient markets. Private initiatives like the Ceres Investor Network on Climate Risks disseminate information on investment risks and opportunities related to climate change. Technical assistance programs, such as Climate Leaders and Energy Star, provide tools and training to help consumers and businesses make economical choices. These programs work best when targeted to address specific needs. Public information and education campaigns, along with risk-sharing policy tools like loan guarantees and tax incentives, can support the acceptability and effectiveness of programs aimed at achieving deep GHG emission reductions. However, achieving significant reductions would require extraordinary changes in energy usage. Emission reductions require significant changes in energy use and technology development. Public policies are crucial for incentivizing clean technology advancements. Different policy approaches like demand-pull, supply-push, and market improvement can drive technological innovation. Demand-Pull policies stimulate demand for new technologies through tools like \"Technology-forcing\" regulations or price incentives. These policies aim to create and shape options for meeting society's needs, but may not always induce transformative change due to uncertainty in long-term prices. Demand-Pull policies, such as technology mandates and clean energy quotas, create demand for specific technologies. The Clean Energy Standard (CES) is an example of a technology-forcing incentive proposed by the Obama Administration and enacted in Indiana. Tax incentives and consumer rebates can also reduce the price of certain technologies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended tax credits to individuals and businesses for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Federal policies provide subsidies for research and development of advanced energy technologies, including renewable, nuclear, and clean coal technologies. These subsidies can take the form of tax credits, grants, or contracts. The government provides subsidies in various forms for research and development of advanced energy technologies. This includes tax credits, grants, contracts, technology awards, and government procurement policies to drive technological development forward. Experts suggest a focused federal research approach similar to the \"Manhattan Project\" to facilitate breakthrough technologies. High-payoff projects could lead to technological breakthroughs in energy systems. Policy tools, such as incentives for universities to produce well-trained scientists and engineers in GHG mitigation fields, can promote technological advancement. Market facilitation instruments aim to improve the connection between technology suppliers and users, reducing transaction costs. Programs like the \"Energy Star\" initiative have been successful in enhancing this interface since the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Energy Star program, established in the late 1980s and early 1990s, has been successful in saving consumers nearly $18 billion in utility bills by 2010. Government-supported actions can improve the supply-demand interface in markets, speed up the deployment of new technologies, and make technology developers more aware of users' needs. Various measures, such as trade conferences, technology databases, and research publications, can enhance the information available on technologies and markets. The U.S. economy heavily relies on fossil fuels for electricity and transportation, optimizing infrastructure for cost efficiency. Transitioning to low-emission technologies may incur costs, but policy mechanisms can ease the shift by timing GHG reductions with equipment retirements and allowing trading of allowances. Investments in trading, banking, and borrowing of allowances can help sources manage reductions at least cost. Market facilitation tools and information campaigns aid in making optimal decisions. Infrastructure investment is crucial for deploying emerging technologies. Regulatory regimes need to be prepared for new technologies. Concerns about international competitiveness and trade impacts exist. Policy tools like border tax adjustments could be applied, but may face challenges under WTO rules. Potential challenges under WTO rules include border tax adjustments raising import prices from countries without comparable GHG controls, \"international reserve\" allowances for certain goods, negotiating with affected WTO Members to avoid import measures, and working multilaterally for equitable GHG controls internationally. The design of competitiveness-oriented policy tools must be cautious to avoid WTO challenges related to unfair trade practices. Collaboration among major countries is crucial for effective climate change policies, with some nations committing to reducing GHG emissions. The United States, China, and other large developing countries have offered GHG targets but are not obligated to reduce emissions. Russia's position beyond 2012 remains uncertain. Promoting global GHG controls is essential for addressing climate change. Russia's position on global GHG emission reductions post-2012 is uncertain. Various policy tools can be used, including leadership, strategic leverage, capacity building, financial assistance, and research contributions. Computer modeling shows that even if GHG emissions cease now, historical emissions will cause 1\u00b0C of warming by 2050. Interest has grown in understanding climate impacts and promoting effective adaptation. Policy tools to promote efficient adaptation to climate change include research to improve understanding of future climate conditions, public information dissemination, development of practical decision-making tools, financial incentives to reduce risks, and improved emergency planning. Improved emergency planning and acquisition of key assets are essential for reducing risks and responding to extreme weather events. Policy tools to encourage private and public sector adaptations are relatively undeveloped compared to work on GHG mitigation."
