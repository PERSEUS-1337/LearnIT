    "content": "Climate change responses at the national level in the United States have included monitoring power plant emissions, improving appliance efficiency, and promoting renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, which aimed for binding emissions reductions by developed countries. The Administration has since focused on U.S. climate change policies. In 2005, the Senate passed a resolution calling for mandatory, market-based programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy. Congressional proposals in the 110th Congress have focused on monitoring emissions and implementing market-oriented reduction programs. In the 110th Congress, Members have introduced 12 bills with market-based controls on greenhouse gas emissions, following a resolution for mandatory reduction programs without harming the economy. In the 110th Congress, 12 bills were introduced with market-based controls on greenhouse gas emissions. S. 2191, introduced by Senators Lieberman and Warner, aims to cap emissions from various sectors and reduce them to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020, and 63% below by 2050 through an allowance trading program. The bill S. 3036, introduced by Senator Boxer, is similar to S. 2191 but includes a budget amendment to make it revenue-neutral by allocating a percentage of auction revenues to offset budget deficits. S. 280, introduced by Senator Lieberman, would cap emissions of six greenhouse gases. Introduced on January 12, 2007, Senator Lieberman's bill aims to cap emissions of six greenhouse gases from key sectors in the U.S. This would be done through a phased approach, with emissions reductions based on 2004 levels. An allowance trading program would be used to facilitate cost-effective reductions, allowing for credits from various sources to comply with a portion of the reduction target. The bill introduced by Senator Sanders on January 16, 2007, aims to cap greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis starting in 2010. Emissions would be capped at 1990 levels by 2020 and reduced to 20% of 1990 levels by 2050. The bill includes provisions for a market-based allowance trading program, new emission standards for vehicles and power plants, renewable portfolio standards, and a low-carbon generation requirement. EPA has the discretion to implement cost-effective emission reduction strategies. S. 317, introduced by Senator Feinstein in 2007, would cap greenhouse gas emissions from electric generators over 25 megawatts. The emission cap would decline annually until 2020, with an allowance trading program that includes auctioning allowances. S. 485, introduced by Senator Kerry, would cap greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis starting in 2010. The bill introduced by Senator Bingaman in 2007 aims to cap the country's emissions at 1990 levels in 2020 and reduce them annually by 2.5% until 2031, then by 3.5% until 2050. It includes an allowance trading system, new emission standards for vehicles, energy efficiency standards, a renewable portfolio standard, increased biofuel mandates, and tax incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. The bill introduced by Senator Bingaman in 2007 aims to set emissions targets on most of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, starting in 2012 at 2006 levels and declining steadily until 2030 to 1990 levels. Compliance can be achieved through an allowance trading program or a Technology Accelerator Payment (TAP). The bill introduced in 2007 sets emissions targets for greenhouse gas emissions, with allowances allocated to various categories. A Technology Accelerator Payment (TAP) is set at $12 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, increasing annually. Countries without emission controls must submit special allowances for exports to the US. H.R. 620, introduced as a modified version of S. 280, has more stringent emission caps. H.R. 620 has more stringent emission caps compared to previous bills. Reductions from affected sectors would steadily decline until the cap is about one-fourth of facilities' 2004 levels. Credits from foreign sources, sequestration, and non-covered entities are limited to 15% of the reduction requirement. H.R. 1590, introduced in 2007, would cap greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis starting in 2010, with emissions capped at 1990 levels by 2020 and reduced by 5% annually until 2050 when levels would be capped at 80% below 1990 levels. The bill H.R. 4226, introduced in 2007, aims to cap emissions at 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. It includes an allowance trading system with auctioned allowances, new greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles, an energy efficiency performance standard, and a renewable portfolio standard. The bill sets emission limitations based on percentages of 2006 levels, with reductions from affected sectors steadily declining until the cap is one-fourth of facilities' 2006 levels by 2050. The bill H.R. 6186, introduced in 2008, proposes a program for importers to pay for GHGs emitted during production of goods imported from countries with no emission restrictions comparable to the US. It also establishes a Carbon Market Efficiency Board to oversee the allowance market and implement cost-relief measures. The bill aims to cap emissions at 930 million mtCO2e in 2050, with stringent reduction targets and auctioning of emission allowances. The bill H.R. 6316, introduced in 2008, aims to cap emissions from covered sources at 348 million mtCO2e in 2050, with strict reduction targets. It would require new coal-fired power plants to capture and sequester at least 85% of their CO2 emissions. The bill also directs the EPA to develop emission standards for non-covered entities and prevent emission growth. Auction revenues would be distributed to low- and middle-income households through tax credits and rebates. The bill introduced in 2008 aims to cap emissions from covered sources, with auction revenues distributed for consumer assistance. A Carbon Market Efficiency Board would oversee the allowance market, and countries not taking comparable action on emissions would need to submit special allowances for exports to the United States. The revised version of S. 2191 aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 19% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 63% below 2005 levels by 2050. Amendments include bringing all natural gas uses under the emissions cap, modifying eligibility requirements for incentive programs, and allocating allowances for tribal communities and international forest carbon activities. The revised version of S. 2191 aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 19% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 63% below 2005 levels by 2050. The bill also added new recipients of auction revenues, expanded the greenhouse gas reduction program coverage, and included a new low carbon fuel standard. The committee agreed to a new low carbon fuel standard that would freeze the carbon intensity of transportation fuel in 2011 and reduce it by 5% in 2015 and 10% in 2020. Other amendments included increasing incentives for states to promote energy efficiency and allowing states to use their allowance allocations to mitigate economic impacts. S. 2191 aims for a 71% reduction in emissions by 2050 and could reduce total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to 66% by 2050. The committee submitted an amendment to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for scoring in the bill, proposing to allocate auction revenues for deficit reduction. Senator Boxer introduced S. 3036 on May 20, 2008, combining S. 2191 with a revenue-neutral amendment. The Senate considered S. 3036 in June 2008, but a cloture motion failed, leading to the bill's withdrawal. The proposal included comparisons of key provisions in Senate and House greenhouse gas reduction bills and discussed different allocation schemes and regulatory approaches. Upstream and downstream allocation schemes assign emission caps and allowances at different points in the production process. Upstream schemes set caps at production points, reducing the number of facilities and companies involved. Downstream schemes assign allowances where emissions are emitted, covering natural gas-fired generators, industries, and residential users. Some proposals exempt certain sectors like residential use from cap-and-trade programs or use a hybrid allocation scheme. An allowance is a government authorization to emit 1 ton of pollutant, often referring to a metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. Credits represent pollutant reductions beyond legal requirements. Auctions are used in various ways in market-based pollution control schemes. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments uses an annual auction to ensure liquidity in the credit trading program. Private parties can participate, and proceeds are returned to entities. Auctions can also raise revenues for related programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Auctions can allocate allowances in GHG control programs, impacting costs depending on usage and revenue allocation. Banking allows participants in cap-and-trade programs to save unused allowances for future use, reducing compliance costs and providing flexibility. A bubble combines multiple sources of pollutants for emission compliance purposes. A cap-and-trade program aims to limit total emissions of pollutants below ecological capacity by allowing polluters to trade pollution allowances. The sulfur dioxide program under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments allocated most allowances to utilities for free based on statutory formulas. The federal government allocated free allowances to utilities based on historic fuel use and emissions, with some reserved for auctions. A carbon tax is a levy on natural gas, petroleum, and coal based on their carbon content. Unlike cap-and-trade, a carbon tax sets the price and lets participants determine emissions based on control costs versus the tax cost. Coverage refers to the economic sectors covered by greenhouse gas regulations. The curr_chunk discusses the concepts of coverage, emissions cap, generation performance standard, and grandfathering in the context of greenhouse gas reduction programs. Coverage refers to the breadth of economic sectors and entities included in the program. Emissions cap sets limits on pollutant release, either in absolute terms or rate-based. Generation performance standard allocates allowances based on electricity generation share. Grandfathering involves distributing allowances to affected entities. Grandfathering refers to the allocation of allowances based on historic emissions or exemptions from new regulatory requirements. It can also apply to entities exempted due to age or meeting earlier standards. Greenhouse gases recognized under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. A hybrid program allows emitters to comply with reduction requirements or pay a set price to the government. Leakage refers to decreases in greenhouse gas-related benefits outside the program. Leakage refers to reductions in greenhouse gas benefits outside defined project boundaries, such as emissions being reduced by moving industries to areas without controls. A \"no regrets\" policy establishes programs with concurrent greenhouse gas reductions at no extra cost. Offsets are emission credits achieved through activities unrelated to affected sources, like forestry and agriculture absorbing carbon dioxide. Revenue recycling in greenhouse gas reduction programs can impact the overall cost to the economy. Safety valves are mechanisms to prevent high compliance costs, while sequestration involves capturing and storing carbon dioxide. Sequestration is the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide to prevent its release into the atmosphere, which can be affected by a safety valve in emissions cap integrity."
