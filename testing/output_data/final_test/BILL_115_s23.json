The Act \"Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2017\" mandates the use of a standard identification system for biological implants in VA medical facilities, following the FDA's device identification system. The Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2017 requires the implementation of a tracking system for biological implants in VA medical facilities, following FDA regulations. The system must track implants from donor to implantation, be compatible with the identification system, and include inventory controls for recall notifications to patients. The Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2017 mandates a tracking system for biological implants in VA medical facilities, in line with FDA regulations. The system must track implants from donor to implantation, be compatible with the identification system, and include inventory controls for recall notifications to patients. The Secretary determines appropriate notification of risks and benefits, with provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or Public Health Service Act taking precedence in case of conflicts. The Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2017 requires a tracking system for biological implants in VA medical facilities, following FDA regulations. The system must track implants from donor to implantation, be compatible with the identification system, and include inventory controls for recall notifications to patients. Additionally, it specifies that devices regulated under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are subject to the Act's provisions. The Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2017 mandates the adoption of a standard identification system for biological implants in VA medical facilities. Implementation deadlines are set for different categories of implants, with compliance dates aligned with FDA regulations. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act mandates the implementation of a biological implant tracking system by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. If the system is not operational by the deadline, a written explanation must be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. The House of Representatives must provide monthly written explanations for the non-operational biological implant tracking system, detailing impediments, remediation steps, and target dates for solutions. The House of Representatives must provide monthly written explanations for the non-operational biological implant tracking system used in Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The House of Representatives must provide monthly written explanations for the non-operational biological implant tracking system used in Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The Secretary may procure biological implants of human origin only from vendors that meet specific conditions, including using a standard identification system and being registered with the FDA. The vendor must ensure that the tissue distribution intermediary or processor is FDA registered, provide donor eligibility records with each biological implant, cooperate with recalls, and notify the Secretary of any issues. The vendor must notify the Secretary of any adverse events or reactions reported to the FDA, retain procurement records for 10 years, and ensure biological implants are acquired from approved sources. The vendor must ensure that implants are acquired from accredited tissue processors or approved sources, and meet specific conditions for non-human origin implants. The vendor must cooperate with implant recalls and report adverse events to the FDA as required by regulations. The vendor must comply with FDA regulations, report adverse events, and retain records for 10 years. The Secretary procures biological implants under Federal Supply Schedules and accommodates vendor outreach efforts for education. The Secretary procures biological implants using competitive procedures if unavailable under Federal Supply Schedules. Penalties apply to procurement employees who violate procurement requirements for biological implants. The term 'distinct identifier' in this section refers to a unique code linking a biological implant to the donor and recipient, meeting specific regulatory requirements. The terms 'tissue distribution intermediary' and 'tissue processor' are defined as entities involved in acquiring, storing, and processing human tissue for distribution and use in biological implants. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the regulation. Section 8129 of title 38, United States Code, pertains to the procurement of biological implants. It specifies that the effective date of this section will be 180 days after the implementation of a tracking system required under another section. Additionally, there is a special rule for cryopreserved products allowing for the procurement of biological implants produced before the effective date without relabeling during a three-year period."
