    "content": "The \"Consumer Automobile Lease Advertising Improvement Act of 2000\" is the short title of the Act. Any reference to an amendment or repeal in the Act is considered to be made to a section of the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The Act includes findings and purpose statements. The Congress finds that consumers are increasingly leasing automobiles instead of buying them on credit, with leases now accounting for over one-third of new car transactions. However, current leasing practices lack transparency, making it difficult for consumers to compare lease offerings. Advertisements for automobile leases often confuse and mislead consumers by emphasizing attractive terms. With leases representing a significant portion of new car transactions, there is a growing need for clearer and more transparent information in lease advertising. Consumers are often misled by ads that highlight attractive terms while omitting important details, making it challenging to compare lease options effectively. It is crucial for automobile manufacturers, dealers, and leasing firms to provide easily understandable information to help consumers make informed decisions. The purpose of the amendments made by this Act is to provide consumers with more relevant and easily understood information regarding the terms and costs of lease offerings earlier in the leasing process to permit consumers to compare lease and purchase options and to comparison shop among competing lease opportunities. SEC. 3. APPLICABLE CONSUMER LEASES amended to increase the limit on contractual obligation to $50,000 and adjust annually based on Consumer Price Index. SEC. 4. GENERAL LEASE ADVERTISING. Amendments to Section 184(a) (15 U.S.C. 1667c) include renumbering paragraphs and adding requirements for identifying lease transactions in television advertisements.

The Board shall set forth a lease payment formula based on the total capitalized cost of the vehicle model advertised and a lease term of twenty-four months or as determined by the Board. The Board may determine a mileage allowance of 12,000 miles per year for a lease term in automobile lease advertisements.

Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) is amended to require automobile dealers engaging in advertising for consumer leases to provide clear and accurate information on incentives and promotions available for consumers. Automobile dealers must provide clear and accurate information on special interest rates, incentives, and lease terms offered to consumers for purchase and installment credit transactions. This includes offers from manufacturers, financial institutions, leasing companies, and dealers. Additionally, a written statement for each available lease vehicle model must be displayed prominently in the dealership. Automobile dealers must provide a written statement for each available lease vehicle model, including rebates, money factor, and vehicle residual value. This information must be clear and accurate, available to consumers upon request. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) is amended to include new requirements for clearly and conspicuously displaying lease terms in print and video advertisements to ensure they are easily noticeable and understandable to consumers. In advertisements, required disclosures must be easily noticeable, hearable, and comprehensible to consumers in various formats such as television, radio, internet webpages, CD-ROMs, and interactive computer services. The disclosures should be delivered in a way that is readily readable and separated from marketing information. In advertisements, required disclosures must be easily noticeable and comprehensible to consumers in various formats. No techniques should be used to obscure or detract from the communication of the disclosures. SEC. 8. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT. A new section, SEC. 187, is added to Chapter 5 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act for administrative enforcement. The Federal Trade Commission enforces compliance with section 184 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission has the authority to enforce these provisions on any person, regardless of their involvement in commerce. The Federal Reserve Board must issue regulations within 6 months of this Act to implement the amendments. They are also required to update and clarify lease disclosure requirements and definitions to prevent circumvention of the amendments and ensure compliance."
