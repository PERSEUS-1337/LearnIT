    "content": "In 2014, the Islamic State's armed offensive in Iraq and Syria prompted U.S. military involvement, including airstrikes in both countries. In 2015, additional deployments were ordered to Iraq, and special operations forces were sent to Syria for military operations. The intensified U.S. military engagement in Syria involves special operations forces conducting military operations, including advising regional partner armed forces and unilateral U.S. operations. Questions have been raised about the President's authority to use military force against the Islamic State, leading to efforts in Congress to consider a new authorization for the use of military force. President Obama has proposed a new authorization targeting the Islamic State, with increased U.S. military operations and deployments continuing in 2016. President Obama's notifications to Congress in 2014 indicated his authority to continue the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, citing existing authorizations for the use of military force. President Obama sought a new AUMF specifically targeting the Islamic State to update previous authorizations for military force. He called on Congress to enact this in his 2015 State of the Union address and transmitted a draft AUMF in February 2015. The Obama Administration considered the Islamic State as an \"associated force\" under the 2001 AUMF due to its ties with Al Qaeda. Some questioned this classification after Al Qaeda disavowed any remaining ties with the Islamic State in February 2014. The Islamic State in Iraq has ties with Al Qaeda and employs similar tactics. The 2002 AUMF authorized the use of US Armed Forces in Iraq until 2011 to defend against threats posed by Iraq. The 2002 AUMF no longer has force due to the restoration of full Iraqi sovereignty and the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. There are differing views on whether the 2002 AUMF is still necessary, with some arguing its broad language could still provide authority to defend against threats to Iraq. The IS threat in Iraq is seen as potentially reviving the relevance of the 2002 AUMF. The President's authority to use military force in Iraq, especially against the Islamic State, is debated in relation to the 2002 AUMF. The Constitution grants the President certain foreign affairs powers, but the extent of unilateral military force usage is questioned, considering Congress's war powers. Defending the U.S. against attacks is generally accepted, but using force for foreign policy or national security goals is controversial. In Iraq, the President's authority to use military force, particularly against the Islamic State, is debated. President Obama's notifications of airstrikes in Iraq cited national security interests, humanitarian assistance, and aiding Iraqi security forces. The strategy for degrading and destroying the Islamic State was not solely based on immediate protection of the United States. Article II alone might not provide sufficient authorization for military force against IS and Khorasan Group forces. The President's authority to use military force against IS and Khorasan Group forces in Iraq and Syria is based on the 2001 AUMF, as outlined in a report issued by President Obama in December 2016. The report justifies ongoing military actions, including airstrikes, training of Iraqi and Syrian forces, and special operations activities in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. The 2001 AUMF authorizes military action against nations, organizations, or persons involved in international terrorism against the United States, including Al Qaeda and associated forces like the Islamic State. The Islamic State's split from Al Qaeda does not affect the President's authority to use force against them. Congress has supported military action against the Islamic State by funding the campaign and providing authority to assist groups fighting them in Iraq and Syria. The Report argues that the President can use military force without congressional authorization under his powers in the Constitution, with limitations on actions that would constitute a \"war\" as defined in the Constitution. The Obama Administration claimed authority for actions against the Islamic State under the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, but debate exists. Some argue that military operations against the Islamic State exceed the President's Article II powers. Members of Congress express concerns about presidential overreach and the need for congressional authorization for continued military force against the Islamic State. During the 113th Congress, new authorization proposals were considered for the use of U.S. Armed Forces against the Islamic State. Senator Menendez's IS AUMF proposal, as amended and reported favorably out of committee, would have authorized military action against the Islamic State and associated forces, with limitations on ground combat operations and a sunset provision for previous authorizations. The 113th Congress considered new authorization proposals for military action against the Islamic State. Secretary Kerry supported enacting a new AUMF targeting the Islamic State with a three-year sunset provision. The Administration opposed limitations on ground combat forces and geographic restrictions to Iraq and Syria. No new IS authorization bill was enacted. During the 114th Congress, various proposals for a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against the Islamic State were introduced. President Obama's proposal from February 15, 2015, was among them. Representative Adam Schiff introduced the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against ISIL Resolution (H.J.Res. 27) on February 2, 2015. The President would have been authorized to use U.S. Armed Forces against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, limited to training indigenous forces. Ground forces in combat roles were excluded, with termination of new authority after three years. Representative Adam Kinzinger introduced the Authorization for Use of Military Force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (H.J.Res. 33) in February 2015, aiming to repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs. The proposal introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Jeff Flake (S. 1587) in June 2015 aimed to authorize the President to use military force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or associated persons or forces. It required the President to report on activities every three months and would have repealed the 2002 AUMF. The proposal introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Jeff Flake (S. 1587) in June 2015 aimed to authorize the President to use military force against the Islamic State and associated persons or forces. It defined the authorization's purpose as protecting U.S. citizens and providing military support to defeat the Islamic State, with limitations on the use of significant ground troops. The 2002 AUMF was repealed and replaced with a new authorization for US military action against the Islamic State. Various proposals were introduced in Congress to authorize the use of force against the Islamic State without significant ground troops. The proposal to repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs and replace them with a new authorization for the use of military force against Al Qaeda, ISIL, and the Afghan Taliban, along with associated groups, required the President to report to Congress when exercising this authority. The proposal aims to repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs and introduce a new authorization for the use of military force against Al Qaeda, ISIL, and the Afghan Taliban, requiring the President to report to Congress. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced S.J.Res. 29, similar to S.J.Res. 26, authorizing the President to use force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. S.J.Res. 29 was placed on the Senate legislative calendar on January 21, 2016, bypassing committee consideration. Representative Scott Perry introduced H.J.Res. 84 authorizing the use of military force against Islamist Extremism, including the Islamic State, but no further action was taken. Several proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to repeal existing authorizations for the use of military force. In the 114th Congress, proposals were made to repeal existing authorizations for the use of military force. Representative Barbara Lee introduced H.J.Res. 30 to repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs and place new requirements on the President regarding the campaign against the Islamic State. The proposal aimed to work through the United Nations, support regional efforts against the Islamic State, and provide foreign assistance only to vetted Iraqi and Syrian groups. Senator Ben Cardin and Representative Barbara Lee introduced bills to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). Cardin's bill (S. 526) aimed to develop a comprehensive strategy to degrade and dismantle ISIL, while Lee's bill (H.R. 1303) sought to repeal the AUMF within three years. Lee's bill highlighted concerns about the broad and open-ended use of military force under the 2001 AUMF. Representative Lee introduced a bill (H.R. 1304) to repeal the 2002 AUMF. In June 2015, she proposed amendments to a defense appropriations bill (H.R. 2685) to limit funds under the 2002 AUMF and 2001 AUMF. However, these amendments were not passed. Other representatives also proposed amendments to restrict military force use, but these also failed. James McGovern proposed an amendment in the FY2017 Defense Department appropriations bill to prohibit funds for combat operations in Iraq or Syria without a new IS-specific AUMF. Representative Lee also proposed an amendment to stop the use of funds for the 2001 AUMF after April 30, 2017, but both failed. Additionally, a concurrent resolution was introduced to remove U.S. Armed Forces deployed in Iraq and Syria after August 7, 2014, within 30 days of adoption. The resolution proposed a deadline extension for the withdrawal of Armed Forces if deemed unsafe by the President. It was introduced under Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution, rejecting reliance on the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs. H.Con.Res. 55 allowed for expedited consideration of military force disapproval without congressional authorization. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved a resolution disapproving the use of military force without congressional authorization. The resolution failed to pass by a vote of 139-288 after two hours of debate. Representative Adam Kinzinger introduced a new Authorization for Use of Military Force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The Authorization for Use of Military Force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (H.J.Res. 63) was proposed on February 3, 2017. It authorizes the President to use the Armed Forces of the United States as necessary against ISIL or associated persons or forces. The proposal requires the President to report on activities every three months and would repeal the 2002 AUMF. President Obama had previously provided Congress with a draft proposal for a new IS AUMF in 2015. The President's proposal for the Authorization for Use of Military Force against ISIL would authorize the use of U.S. Armed Forces deemed necessary against the Islamic State and associated persons or forces. It would not include authority for enduring offensive ground combat operations and would terminate three years after enactment, repealing the 2002 AUMF. The President's proposal for the Authorization for Use of Military Force against ISIL includes a provision repealing the 2002 AUMF upon enactment. The proposal raises concerns for Congress regarding limitations on ground combat operations and geographical scope. The proposal for the Authorization for Use of Military Force against ISIL lacks precision in defining \"associated persons or forces\" and does not provide a clear purpose or objective for the use of U.S. Armed Forces. It also does not include a provision for repealing or sunsetting the measure, raising concerns about the lack of direction for the President's actions and the absence of an endpoint or measurable goal for military operations. Additionally, the reporting requirement is limited to basic periodic \"actions taken\" reports. President Obama called for Congress to enact a new authorization for the use of force against the Islamic State, emphasizing the need for continued military action against terrorists. The reporting requirement for this authorization would be a basic periodic \"actions taken\" report, similar to existing reporting requirements for deployed U.S. Armed Forces. This proposal contrasts with past IS AUMF proposals that included more detailed information on targeted entities, operational reports, effectiveness, and budget impacts. President Obama urges Congress to vote on a new authorization for military force against ISIL, emphasizing the need for continued airstrikes. He stresses the importance of unity in the fight against terrorism. A new AUMF targeting the Islamic State and other groups could broaden or narrow the purpose of military force, limit geographic scope to Iraq and/or Syria, address the impact on the conflict in Syria, and include a prohibition on unauthorized military force. A new IS AUMF proposal may limit presidential authority for military force against the Islamic State in terms of scope and duration. President Obama emphasized the need for flexibility in the authorization to carry out long-term strategies. However, limitations in the IS AUMF could be challenging to change legislatively if there is a lack of agreement among Members of Congress. Some argue that recent authorizations for the use of military force can give the President too much flexibility, leading to long-term military operations not intended by Congress. An IS AUMF could specify the purpose and scope of military force, potentially limiting the President's authority. The 2001 and 2002 AUMFs have not been amended despite calls for changes. An IS AUMF could provide broad authority for long-term military operations to protect U.S. interests and allies, allowing the President flexibility in using necessary force. Congress may seek to impose limitations and conditions to shape the President's use of military force. An IS AUMF would name the Islamic State as the primary target for authorized U.S. military force, but issues arise in determining lawful targets and defining the universe of targets. It may be unclear if individuals are part of the Islamic State, allied groups, or non-aligned groups in the region. Congress may include language for future considerations. An IS AUMF could extend military force authority against successor entities of the Islamic State, including splinter groups or new alliances. The challenge lies in identifying lawful targets, particularly \"associated forces,\" to avoid the expansion of military force beyond intended targets. The 2001 AUMF has expanded military force to target entities designated as \"co-belligerent\" with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The Obama Administration asserts that the Islamic State can be targeted as a successor to Al Qaeda, potentially leading to military force against various groups associated with the Islamic State in countries beyond Iraq and Syria. Recent IS AUMF proposals aim to define \"associated forces\" more clearly to limit the number of lawfully targeted entities and involve congressional input in any expansion. The term \"associated forces\" in IS AUMF proposals aims to limit the number of lawfully targeted entities and involve congressional input. Some proposals, like President Obama's, define associated forces broadly as individuals and organizations fighting alongside ISIL. Members of Congress may want a more precise definition to ensure only forces directly engaging with IS are targeted. The IS AUMF proposal aims to target the Islamic State and other threats to US policies in Iraq and Syria. Congress must consider limitations on ground forces and geographic constraints. The President's proposal excludes enduring offensive ground combat operations, while previous proposals had specific carve-outs for special forces and training units. Congress must weigh these provisions when finalizing the IS AUMF. The finalized IS AUMF may face limitations on ground forces and geographic constraints, potentially hindering the President's ability to strike IS and associated forces in countries beyond Iraq and Syria. This could impact the prosecution of conflict against the Islamic State and other threats in the region. The President's proposal for the IS AUMF includes a three-year sunset provision and potential limitations on geographic expansion of military operations to countries beyond Iraq and Syria. Congress may wish to include restrictions to prevent such expansion under the 2001 AUMF's authority. The concern is about Congress placing time limitations on campaigns against terrorist groups like the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, and the Afghan Taliban. A sunset on authority to use military force could prevent perpetual use of force but leaving the 2001 AUMF in place without amendment may lead to confusion and contention over presidential authority to use military force. Some argue that automatic terminations of authority to use military force against the Islamic State could prompt Congress to review and amend previous AUMFs. Congress may require the President to report regularly on military operations to prevent unchecked expansion of the campaign. President Obama's proposal included general reporting requirements. President Obama's proposal for an IS AUMF would require reporting every six months on actions taken under the authorization, aligning with existing War Powers Resolution reporting requirements. Previous IS AUMF proposals had more detailed reporting requirements. Representative Schiff's draft IS AUMF sought to replace limiting provisions with specific congressional reporting requirements on targetable associated forces and operational scope. Members of Congress may want a clear strategy presented before authorizing military force, with periodic reporting on strategy effectiveness. The curr_chunk discusses new proposals for authorizations to use military force against the Islamic State during the 114th Congress, with a breakdown of the proposals by type of provision. It also compares these proposals with those from the 113th Congress. In the 114th Congress, new authorizations to use military force against the Islamic State were proposed, with a breakdown of the provisions compared to those from the 113th Congress."
