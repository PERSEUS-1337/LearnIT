The \"Organized Retail Crime Act of 2008\" finds that organized retail crime is a nationwide problem costing over $30 billion annually, leading to decreased availability of goods for consumers and posing health and safety hazards due to the unregulated redistribution of stolen products. The unregulated black-market sales of fraudulently obtained and stolen merchandise result in an estimated $1.6 billion annual loss in sales and income tax revenues to State and local governments. The illegal income from theft and resale of stolen retail goods benefits criminal activities like drug trafficking, gang activity, and terrorism. Organized retail crime rings often use fraudulent checks to obtain merchandise and create problems for the retail industry and national banking system. Organized retail crime rings are using counterfeit Universal Product Code labels to sell stolen goods online, evading regulations. The expansion of Internet marketplaces for stolen goods has led to a surge in organized crime activities. The Act aims to protect consumers, retailers, and governments from the $30 billion annual problem of organized retail crime by addressing e-fencing and facilitating legitimate online transactions.
