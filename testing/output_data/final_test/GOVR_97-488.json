    "content": "Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), a Section 401 certification from the state is required for any federal license or permit that may result in a discharge to US waters. This certification ensures compliance with water quality standards, including designated use of water bodies, pollutant limits, and protection of existing water uses. States have the power to deny permits by withholding certification or impose conditions on permits through certification limitations. Section 401 certification allows states to impose conditions on federal permits for various activities that could impact water quality, such as hydropower projects, dredge-and-fill activities, and industrial dischargers. State participation in Section 401 certification is optional, leading to varied implementation, but many states now see it as a crucial tool for water quality protection. States are increasingly using Section 401 to protect water quality, including aquatic habitat impacts. This has caused tensions with federal agencies and regulated entities over the extent of state authority. Some state courts have limited Section 401 use for addressing only chemical impacts. The use of Section 401 for hydropower projects is limited to addressing only chemical impacts, not physical or biological impacts. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Federal Power Act preempts state water use law for federally licensed hydropower facilities. The debate over Section 401 certification mainly involves states and hydropower interests. The debate over Section 401 certification centers on states' authority to impose conditions on federally permitted activities, particularly in the context of hydropower projects. States argue that a narrow interpretation of Section 401 would undermine their ability to protect water quality and beneficial uses, creating a double standard for different activities affecting the same values. They believe that states, with their comprehensive water management programs, are best positioned to determine how to protect these values. The States have primary responsibility for protecting water quality and quantity under the Clean Water Act and other laws. Hydropower interests prefer federal agencies like FERC to determine project conditions for water quality protection. The current limitation is that FERC ultimately decides on balancing resource interests in the licensing process. The expansive reading of Section 401 water quality certification allows some States to take control of all aspects of a project, placing authority in the hands of a State water quality agency. The Supreme Court has addressed this issue, allowing states to impose conditions on certification for projects like hydropower facilities. The Supreme Court ruling allows states to impose conditions on Section 401 certification for projects like hydropower facilities, ensuring compliance with state water quality standards. States can regulate project impacts beyond just the discharge, including requirements for minimum stream flow. Federal agencies must incorporate state-imposed conditions in licenses or permits, pleasing states and environmentalists seeking to uphold water quality standards. The Supreme Court ruling in 2006 affirmed that states can impose conditions on Section 401 certification for projects like hydropower facilities, ensuring compliance with state water quality standards. This decision pleased environmentalists and states seeking to address aquatic habitat alteration and biological diversity. However, development and hydropower interests expressed concerns about the potential difficulties and costs in licensing hydropower facilities. The utility industry also worried about state water quality agencies potentially biasing licensing policies by not adequately addressing power needs. Section 401 certification allows states to impose conditions on FERC licensing of hydropower facilities to protect water quality. A federal court ruling in 1996 confirmed that Section 401 applies to all federally permitted activities that may impact water quality, including nonpoint sources. The case involved the U.S. Forest Service seeking certification for cattle grazing to ensure compliance with water quality standards. The Forest Service argued that only discharges from point or nonpoint sources with conveyances are regulated under the Clean Water Act. The district court ruled that pollution from cattle grazing constitutes a discharge into navigable waters under the Clean Water Act, requiring state certification under Section 401 before issuing grazing permits. This decision gives states regulatory power over federal licenses affecting water quality, applying to both point and nonpoint source discharges. Nonpoint sources include rainfall and snowmelt runoff. The ruling on pollution from cattle grazing gives states regulatory power over federal licenses affecting water quality, including nonpoint source discharges like runoff from farmlands and city streets. States could face a significant workload in processing certifications for grazing permits and other activities like timber harvesting. Federal agencies disagreed on how to respond to the ruling, with EPA favoring letting the decision stand. The federal court of appeals reversed a district court ruling on cattle grazing pollution, stating that nonpoint source pollution is not covered by Section 401. The Supreme Court declined to review the case, giving states more regulatory power over federal licenses affecting water quality. Oregon responded by adopting rules for certification. After the federal court of appeals reversed a district court ruling on cattle grazing pollution, Oregon adopted rules for certification. Ranchers and farmers were pleased with the ruling, believing Section 401 did not apply to nonpoint source pollution. Environmentalists disagreed, arguing that Section 401 should include nonpoint source discharges. The district court's ruling was seen as supporting efforts to develop TMDL allocations for pollution-impaired water bodies. Lawsuits in many states have prompted the development of TMDLs to improve water quality standards. The 9th Circuit's 1998 ruling did not directly impact the TMDL process, but some saw it as removing an argument for addressing nonpoint sources in TMDL plans. Environmental advocates renewed legal challenges following the Supreme Court's 2006 ruling in the S.D. Warren case. Environmental advocates renewed legal challenge of grazing permits, arguing that the Court's ruling in the S.D. Warren case could also be applied to agricultural runoff. The federal court rejected the challenge, stating that the Clean Water Act only allows states to address point source discharges under Section 401. Congress has shown interest in proposals regarding Section 401 certification, but no legislation has been enacted to modify it. In the 103rd Congress, proposals were made to clarify Section 401 certification authority under the Clean Water Act. One provision in S. 2093 aimed to strengthen Section 401 by requiring state certification for federal licenses or permits to ensure compliance with water quality standards. Disputes over Section 401 arose after the Supreme Court's 1994 PUD No. 1 decision, leading to the introduction of legislation (S. 2566) to amend the Clean Water Act and overturn the decision. Senator Wallop expressed concerns that the Court's decision threatened state water law. Senator Wallop, sponsor of the bill, expressed concerns that the Court's decision threatened state water law and the integrity of the FERC hydropower licensing process. The 104th Congress addressed the issue in H.R. 961, a CWA reauthorization bill that would have made Section 401 inapplicable to hydropower projects if FERC found the state's certification inconsistent with the Federal Power Act. It also proposed a mechanism for FERC to resolve disputes with states over 401 certification for hydropower projects. In H.R. 961, FERC would have the authority to resolve disputes with states over certification of hydropower projects. Some Members wanted to exempt hydropower projects from Clean Water Act regulation, while others argued for state authority in regulating water quality concerns. No further action was taken on H.R. 961 during the 104th Congress. Legislative interest in Section 401 was also seen in recommendations on national energy policy in 2001. The National Energy Policy Development Group in 2001 recommended reforming the hydropower licensing process to meet energy needs. Legislation proposed in response aimed to increase flexibility for hydropower license applicants in complying with federal agency conditions, such as providing fish passageways around dams. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included a provision requiring federal agencies to consider alternative license conditions. In the 112th Congress, the House passed legislation (H.R. 2018) to modify Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, restricting EPA's oversight of states' implementation. The bill aimed to address concerns of EPA over-reaching in permitting and standard setting. The determination of a state regarding compliance with the Clean Water Act, including water quality standards, is addressed in H.R. 2018. EPA's role in state certification is questioned, with similar provisions in bills from previous Congresses. Current energy policy proposals may impact states' authority under CWA Section 401 for hydropower projects. The Energy Policy Modernization Act proposes to designate FERC as the lead agency for coordinating authorizations required for hydropower projects, streamlining the review process. Federal and state agencies would need to report annually on their activities affecting FERC proceedings, ensuring compliance with the Federal Power Act. The House passed H.R. 8, the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015, designating FERC as the lead agency for coordinating federal and state authorizations. Section 1203 of the bill requires agencies to comply with FERC deadlines. Some state agencies have raised concerns about the bill's impact on their authority. Washington state officials oppose H.R. 8, stating it would impact states' authority to issue water quality certifications and slow down environmental processes. The Administration also strongly opposes the bill, particularly due to concerns about hydropower provisions. The regulatory process could be affected by new exemptions from licensing, potentially undermining key environmental statutes like the Clean Water Act, NEPA, and the Endangered Species Act. Maryland officials raised concerns about bills like S. 1236, which could diminish states' authority in protecting water quality. House and Senate committee leaders believe that CWA authority would remain unaffected by the proposed bills."
