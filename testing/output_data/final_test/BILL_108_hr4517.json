    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Refinery Revitalization Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that increasing refinery capacity for gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel in the United States is in the national interest to meet the growing demand for refined petroleum products. By 2025, gasoline consumption is projected to rise significantly, exceeding current domestic production capacity. The increasing demand for refined petroleum products is leading to a rise in jet fuel consumption, projected to be 760,000 barrels per day higher by 2025. Refineries are operating at nearly full capacity, with the excess demand being met by imports. Refiners in the United States are facing environmental regulations and Clean Air Act requirements, with the number of operating refineries decreasing over the years. The refining capacity in the United States has decreased over the years, with foreign ownership controlling almost 25 percent of it. There has been no new refinery built since 1976, and most existing refineries are located on century-old sites. Meeting growing demand has been done by increasing efficiency and capacity of existing plants, but refining capacity is falling behind peak summer demand. The new Clean Air Act requirements will benefit the environment but require significant capital investment and additional permits. (6) Heavy industry and manufacturing jobs have closed or relocated due to barriers to investment, burdensome regulation, and high costs of operation. (7) More regulatory certainty for refinery owners is needed to stimulate investment in increased refinery capacity. (8) Streamlining required procedures for regulatory approvals at Federal, State, and local levels is essential for developing and operating increased refinery capacity safely, timely, and cost-effectively. The Secretary of Energy designates Refinery Revitalization Zones in areas with mass layoffs or idle refineries and high unemployment rates. Compliance with all environmental regulations is required in these zones. In Refinery Revitalization Zones, all refineries must use best available control technology to comply with environmental regulations at the federal, state, and local levels. This Act does not exempt any refinery from existing or future environmental regulations. Coordination and expedited review of the permitting process are also required. The Department of Energy will be the lead agency for coordinating Federal authorizations and environmental reviews for a refinery facility in a Refinery Revitalization Zone. They will work with Indian Tribes, State, and local agencies to ensure timely permit decisions. The Department of Energy has the authority to set deadlines for the review process. The Department of Energy, in coordination with various agencies, will establish deadlines for reviewing and making decisions on refinery facility permits. The Secretary of Energy will ensure that all permit decisions and environmental reviews are completed within 6 months of application submission. Additionally, there will be a preapplication mechanism for prospective applicants to confer with agencies within 60 days. The Department of Energy, as the lead agency, will determine and communicate the likelihood of approval and key concerns to prospective applicants within 60 days of their request. A single environmental review document will be prepared for all decisions on proposed projects, meeting criteria under Federal law. The Department of Energy will communicate approval likelihood and key concerns to applicants within 60 days. Appeals can be filed if a Federal authorization for a refinery facility in a Refinery Revitalization Zone is denied or not acted upon. The Secretary will make a decision within 60 days of the appeal, complying with applicable Federal laws. The Secretary of Energy will issue necessary regulations within 6 months of the Act's enactment. Memoranda of Understanding will be established with Federal agencies to ensure timely and coordinated review of Federal authorizations. Appeals of the Secretary's decision will go to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The head of each Federal agency in a Refinery Revitalization Zone must designate a senior official to ensure timely review of refinery facilities. Interested Indian Tribes and State and local agencies can enter Memoranda of Understanding. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Federal authorization\" in this Act refers to any authorization required under Federal law for a refinery facility within a Refinery Revitalization Zone. An \"idle refinery\" is defined as a refinery facility that has not been in operation since June 1, 2004. An \"idle refinery\" is a facility that has not been in operation after June 1, 2004. The term \"refinery facility\" refers to a facility designed to refine crude oil into various fuels through chemical or physical processes. The House of Representatives passed the document on June 16, 2004, as attested by Jeff Trandahl, the Clerk."
