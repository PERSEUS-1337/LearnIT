The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) in the U.S. Department of Commerce, historically funded under annual appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, is proposed to cease operations in FY2018 to reduce duplication and streamline operations. The FY2018 budget proposal includes ceasing operations of the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) to reduce duplication and streamline operations. Funding for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of the Census will continue, with the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs providing direct support to the Commerce Secretary. The Under Secretary for Economic Affairs is to have direct oversight over the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Census Bureau, which are two of the 13 principal federal statistical agencies. BEA's economic accounts provide valuable information on U.S. economic growth, regional development, and international economic relationships, including measures like GDP, personal income, and corporate profits. The Census Bureau conducts various surveys and collects data on sociodemographic, economic, and housing information. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces economic statistics and reports on U.S. economic growth, including GDP. The FY2018 budget request for BEA is $97.0 million, with proposed reductions in funding. The proposed budget includes termination of ESA and reductions in funding for BEA, focusing on measuring small businesses' impact on the economy and enhancing healthcare measures in GDP accounts. No new initiatives are proposed for BEA in FY2018. The Census Bureau's FY2018 budget request is $1,497.0 million, a $27.0 million increase from FY2017. The FY2018 budget request for the Census Bureau includes significant funding increases for the decennial census, with $246.0 million allocated to Current Surveys and Programs and $1,251.0 million allocated to Periodic Censuses and Programs. This represents a decrease in funding for Current Surveys and Programs compared to FY2017, while an increase is seen for Periodic Censuses and Programs. The FY2018 budget request for Current Economic Statistics is $171.9 million, $5.1 million less than FY2017. These statistics provide detailed data about the U.S. economy, including business and construction statistics that are important for economic policies and analysis. The Current Economic Statistics budget request for FY2018 is $171.9 million, $5.1 million less than FY2017. The statistics cover manufacturing, construction, and general economic data, serving as a critical benchmark for the U.S. economy. The budget proposal for Current Demographic Statistics in FY2018 is $74.1 million, which is 7.4% lower than the FY2017 funding level of $80.0 million. These statistics include collections and analyses of demographic data, such as household surveys. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a key household survey conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics for over 50 years. It provides labor force characteristics, unemployment rate, housing vacancy data, and various supplements on topics like child support and tobacco use. Other agencies sponsor additional supplements throughout the year. The Census Bureau's population and housing analyses include Current Population Reports based on CPS data, covering topics like income, poverty, and housing statistics. Intercensal demographic estimates provide population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity for the U.S., states, and counties. Population projections analyze data and trends to predict future population sizes. The Census Bureau's demographic surveys sample redesign improves sampling methods and data processing systems for major household surveys. Critical programs include the 2020 Decennial Census, American Community Survey, 2017 Economic Census, and 2017 Census of Governments. The bureau's new IT initiative, the Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing System (CEDCaP), will impact multiple data collections. The Administration requests $800.2 million for the 2020 Decennial Census in FY2018, a $32.9 million (4.3%) increase from the previous year. This funding is crucial for the census, which is required by the U.S. Constitution every 10 years for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives and distributing federal funds. The Census Bureau is working to lower the cost of the 2020 census compared to 2010. The 2010 census was the most expensive in U.S. history, costing around $13 billion. The bureau is focusing on cost-control innovations in four major areas, including conducting address canvassing for accurate addresses and map locations. The Census Bureau is proposing to update its address file and geographic system for the 2020 census using technology like aerial imagery. They plan to offer online response options and promote the use of the Internet for census participation. The Census Bureau plans to promote online response options for the 2020 census, including using the Internet as the primary mode of participation. They will provide information through various channels, such as community events and social media, and allow online submissions without a unique code. The bureau aims to reduce nonresponse follow-up by utilizing administrative records and third-party data sources. Automation will be used for operational tasks to streamline field operations. The Census Bureau plans to streamline field operations for the 2020 census by reducing staffing and infrastructure. They aim to establish fewer regional census centers, paper processing centers, and area census offices compared to the 2010 census. The number of enumerators will be cut in half. These changes are estimated to save over $5 billion, with a revised cost estimate of $15.6 billion for the 2020 census. Commerce Secretary Ross revised the 2020 census cost estimate to $15.6 billion, citing an earlier overestimation of savings and underestimation of technological implementation difficulties. He requested a $187 million adjustment for FY2018 to ensure crucial programs stay on track and improve financial oversight at the Census Bureau. Major census-related activities for FY2018 include the end-to-end 2020 census test covering over 700,000 housing units. The end-to-end 2020 census test covers over 700,000 housing units in Pierce County, Washington; Providence County, Rhode Island; and nine West Virginia counties. Operations will be limited to Providence County due to budget constraints. The site was chosen for its unique challenges like high housing vacancy rates, diverse sociodemographics, and non-traditional addressing styles. The budget justification warns that delayed or insufficient FY2018 appropriations could impact the Census Bureau's readiness for crucial testing before 2020. Failure to test and refine key components could lead to cost increases or data quality issues. The bureau aims to complete in-office canvassing of 70% of U.S. addresses by the end of FY2017 and the remaining 30% in FY2018, with in-field canvassing starting in FY2019. Development of the 2020 census communications and partnership program continues in FY2018, including a website and advertising campaign. In FY2017, preparations for the 2020 census began, including the development of a website, advertising campaign, partnership efforts, and Statistics in Schools program. FY2018 will see the opening of six regional census centers and the acquisition of area census offices. The census questions are to be delivered to Congress by April 1, 2018, covering topics like gender and age. The census topics, delivered on March 28, 2017, include gender, age, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household relationships, and housing ownership. Changes to these topics would impact the 2020 Census significantly. The American Community Survey replaced the decennial census long form in 2005 and 2006 to collect detailed socioeconomic and housing data. The American Community Survey (ACS) is conducted annually to gather data on social, demographic, housing, and economic topics from a sample of 3.5 million households. It provides essential information for rural areas and small population groups. The ACS is the primary data source for many topics and the FY2018 budget request for the ACS is $213.6 million, slightly lower than the previous year. The Census Bureau plans modifications to ACS data collection efforts. In FY2018, the Census Bureau plans to rely more on mail, internet, and CAPI for ACS data collection, reducing the use of CATI due to declining landline phone popularity. This change may impact data quality in small geographic areas. Operations for FY2018 will be reduced. The Census Bureau will reduce operations for FY2018, including training for field representatives and planned research on new ACS contents and methods. The economic census, dating back to the 19th century, is crucial for the nation's economic statistics programs and provides data for key measures like GDP. The economic census is essential for the nation's economic statistics programs, providing data for key measures like GDP. The Administration requests $100.6 million for economic census activities in FY2018, focusing on gathering data from over 29 million establishments and implementing revisions to the NAICS to better reflect the U.S. economy's structure. The Census Bureau is planning a 2017 Economic Census with \"100% Internet\" reporting to reduce respondent burden. They are also exploring 'Big Data' concepts for data collection. The census of governments, conducted since 1957, provides baseline data for Current Economic Statistics and accounts for nearly all of GDP. It is the principal source of information about state and local governments, which account for 12% of GDP and 15% of the civilian labor force. The census of governments, accounting for 12% of GDP and 15% of the labor force, covers topics such as government organization, employee pay, finances, and assets. The FY2018 budget for the census is $8.9 million, focusing on data collection and processing with an emphasis on Internet reporting and data-sharing agreements with governmental units. The Census Bureau plans to improve data-sharing agreements with states and release products from the 2017 census more timely. The Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing initiative aims to streamline data collection and processing services to reduce inefficiencies. The Administration requests $137.3 million for CEDCaP in FY2018, $22.1 million below the FY2017-enacted amount. The bureau plans to finalize certain capabilities in FY2018 to support the 2018 end-to-end census test and provide enterprise data collection capabilities for the 2017 Economic Census. Challenges in the development of CEDCaP have been identified, with GAO highlighting the need for attention to avoid past mistakes. The Bureau faced challenges in implementing key IT management practices, leading to the abandonment of handheld data collection devices for the 2020 census. Uncertainties surrounding CEDCaP contributed to the census being placed on the \"high-risk\" list. Commerce Secretary Ross acknowledged a 40% cost overrun in CEDCaP due to underestimating technological complexities. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $96.0 million for BEA in FY2018, $7.8 million less than FY2017. The House bill did not mention ESA. The House bill for FY2017 does not mention ESA, which the Administration has proposed to terminate. The bill includes a reorganization proposal to cease ESA operations and relocate the Commerce Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. H.R. 3267, incorporated into H.R. 3354, provides $1,507.0 million for the Census Bureau in FY2018, $37.0 million more than FY2017.

The funding for Periodic Censuses and Programs would be $1,251.0 million, with $2.6 million transferred to the Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General for Census Bureau oversight. The minority views express concern about inadequate funding for the Census Bureau and the risk of information technology failures due to reduced testing for the 2020 Census. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its FY2018 CJS appropriations bill, S. 1662, with recommended funding of $99.0 million for ESA, which is $8.3 million less than FY2017. The committee does not object to the proposed consolidation of ESA and BEA, but approval is pending a detailed reprogramming package. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the planned consolidation of ESA and BEA pending a detailed reprogramming package. The reprogramming should include information on the impacts of the consolidation, position changes, and oversight by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. S. 1662 recommends $1,521.0 million for the Census Bureau in FY2018, an increase from FY2017. The FY2018 committee-recommended amount for Current Surveys and Programs is $270.0 million, $24.0 million more than the FY2018 request. For Periodic Censuses and Programs, the committee recommends $1,251.0 million, matching the requested and House-passed amounts. The Commerce Department's OIG would receive $2.6 million for oversight and audits of periodic censuses. The Bureau is directed to reduce the cost of the 2020 Decennial Census below the 2010 Census level. The report mentions concerns about the funding level for Periodic Censuses and Programs not being adequate for the upcoming census, with a significant increase in cost estimates. Commerce Secretary Ross acknowledged a cost overrun and requested an additional $187 million for the census in FY2018. Final FY2018 appropriations legislation was delayed due to short-term continuing resolutions. H.R. 601, Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018, and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017, provided funding for federal agencies at FY2017 levels with a reduction through December 8, 2017. The Census Bureau was allowed to use funds for the 2020 Decennial Census Program. H.J.Res. 123 extended the provisions of the previous act through December 22, 2017. The Appropriations Act, 2018 extended provisions through various bills such as H.R. 1370, H.R. 195, and H.R. 1892, with deadlines ranging from December 22, 2017, to February 8, 2018. The Appropriations Act, 2018 extended provisions through various bills with deadlines ranging from December 22, 2017, to February 8, 2018. The new extension includes an additional $182.0 million for the 2020 census."
