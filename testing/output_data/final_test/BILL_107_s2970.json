    "content": "The Act titled \"Promoting Care for the Frail Elderly Act of 2002\" aims to promote care for the frail elderly. The Secretary will revise the risk adjustment methodology for Medicare+Choice organizations offering specialized programs for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries to consider cost variations. Methods considered include hybrid payment systems, new diagnostic markers, and structural components to reduce risks. The Secretary will implement revisions to the risk adjustment methodology for Medicare+Choice organizations, including structural components to reduce payment lag and account for specific risk factors, adjustments for beneficiaries with comorbidities, testing concurrent risk adjustment methodologies, and utilizing data from specialized programs for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries. The implementation deadline is January 1, 2006. Interim continuation of blended rate for specialized programs for frail elderly and at-risk Medicare beneficiaries residing in institutions under Medicare+Choice plans until revised risk adjustment methodology is implemented. Interim continuation of payment methodologies for demonstration programs. Payment methodologies for Medicare demonstration programs for specialized programs for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries will continue under the terms of the demonstration authority in effect during 2002. This includes the risk adjustment factors and formula used for payment. The terms and conditions will apply to each specialized program offered by a Medicare+Choice organization until the Secretary implements the revised risk adjustment methodology required under subsection (a). The Secretary will establish a 5-year demonstration program for specialized Medicare+Choice plans serving frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries, focusing on payment and clinical models to improve outcomes. Medicare+Choice organizations meeting specific requirements can participate in the program. The specialized program for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries under Medicare+Choice plans must exclusively serve, or have a disproportionate number of, beneficiaries entitled to benefits under a State plan under title XIX. Clinical capacity should meet the needs of these beneficiaries, including initiatives for prevention or delay of health issues. Initiatives for preventing chronic disease and disabilities, high-risk screening for identifying factors increasing care costs, staff with special training in chronic and geriatric care, integration of care across settings, and clinical protocols for high-risk conditions. Clinical protocols for specific high-cost conditions will be evaluated as part of the demonstration program. Medicare+Choice organizations participating in the program must collect data in the required format to monitor service quality, outcomes, and costs, including functional and diagnostic information. Quality assurance measures are also required for participating organizations. The organization in the demonstration program must meet quality standards and track indicators specified by the Secretary. Payment for participating Medicare+Choice organizations will not be less than what would have been paid for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries in specialized programs. The Secretary will establish a payment model based on the CMS-HCC 61 significant condition model for Medicare+Choice organizations participating in the demonstration program. Payment will be made under the standard CMS-HCC 61-condition model for nonfrail members and a special frailty-adjusted payment for frail or at-risk beneficiaries. The Secretary will establish a payment model based on the CMS-HCC 61 significant condition model for Medicare+Choice organizations participating in the demonstration program. Payment will be made under the standard CMS-HCC 61-condition model for nonfrail members and a special frailty-adjusted payment for frail or at-risk beneficiaries. Medicare+Choice organizations participating in the program can receive additional compensation for providing benefits exceeding those required under parts A and B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The Secretary will establish a frailty adjuster as an add-on payment to address underpayment issues, and reinsurance will be provided. The Secretary will provide reinsurance above a specified threshold and financial incentives for Medicare+Choice organizations participating in the demonstration program. The Secretary may waive requirements of titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act as necessary. $25,000,000 may be appropriated for the demonstration program. The Secretary will adjust Medicare+Choice payment rates to ensure budget neutrality. The MedPAC will conduct a study to develop frailty indicators for Medicare+Choice payments. The study will assess the feasibility of adding a frailty adjustment to the Medicare+Choice risk adjustment methodology to ensure appropriate payment levels for plans serving frail or at-risk beneficiaries with higher healthcare costs. It will identify indicators of frailty, medical complexity, and risk factors that result in increased costs for specific groups within the Medicare population. The study aims to add a frailty adjustment to Medicare+Choice risk adjustment to ensure proper payment for plans serving frail beneficiaries with higher healthcare costs. Frailty indicators may include specific diagnoses, multiple chronic conditions, functional impairments, or a hierarchy of functional loss. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission will submit a report to Congress and the Secretary on a study regarding frailty adjustment in Medicare+Choice risk adjustment. The study includes recommendations for legislation or administrative action. Definitions include activities of daily living such as eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, dressing, and continence. The term \"disproportionate\" in relation to Medicare+Choice plans means a higher percentage of frail or at-risk beneficiaries than the national average. A \"frail or at-risk beneficiary\" is an individual unable to perform certain activities of daily living for at least 90 days due to a loss of functional capacity. The term \"disproportionate\" in relation to Medicare+Choice plans refers to a higher percentage of frail or at-risk beneficiaries than the national average. A \"frail or at-risk beneficiary\" is someone who requires substantial supervision due to severe cognitive impairment, has multiple medically complex chronic conditions, is at risk of hospitalization or functional decline within 12 months, and has a severity of condition that makes them frail or disabled. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Specialized programs for frail elderly or at-risk beneficiaries include demonstrations approved by the Secretary for testing the integration of acute and expanded care services under prepaid financing, which encompass prescription drugs, care coordination, and home-based services. Specialized provider-based programs approved by the Secretary focus on improving care quality for nursing home residents and testing methods for integrating Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dually eligible individuals. The Secretary approves specialized programs to enhance care quality for nursing home residents and integrate Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dually eligible individuals. Other demonstrations or programs for similar purposes may also be approved."
