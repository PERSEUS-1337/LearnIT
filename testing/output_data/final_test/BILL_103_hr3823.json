    "content": "The \"Welfare Fairness Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that the current variation in benefit levels for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) from State to State discourages families from remaining in their home communities, which complicates decisions on where to live. This disparity in benefits also results in taxpayers in some States paying more while others pay well below the poverty level. Uniform AFDC benefits should be determined federally to address disparities in the system for both taxpayers and AFDC recipients, as poverty does not recognize State boundaries. Establishment of the \"Commission on Welfare Fairness\" to address disparities in the AFDC system and ensure uniform benefits nationally. The Commission on Welfare Fairness, within 1 year of formation, must establish a uniform standard of need for recipients of aid to families with dependent children, adjust it annually for cost of living differences among states, and offset incentives for interstate migration.
