    "content": "Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, abuse, or danger to public health. Protection for IC whistleblowers is crucial due to the sensitive nature of classified information involved. Whistleblowing can save money, promote ethics, and prompt corrective actions. Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) only apply to lawful disclosures that adhere to reporting procedures for classified information. They do not cover leaking to the media or foreign governments, nor do they protect against personnel or security clearance decisions if the agency can prove they would have taken the same action without the disclosure. Procedures for protected disclosures are defined by Congress and the Executive Branch to ensure security of classified information. The Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblower protections address the security of classified information and provide processes for whistleblowers to make complaints. There are concerns about transparency in the IC's internal processes and the adequacy of protections for IC contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 was the first legislation specific to the IC but offered limited protections. Protections have evolved to address perceived gaps leaving whistleblowers vulnerable to reprisal. The Intelligence Community whistleblower protections have evolved over time to address vulnerabilities and provide specific protections for whistleblowers, including provisions in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19, and the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. Additionally, 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 provides whistleblower protections for members of the Armed Forces in the IC, with implementing guidance found in DOD Directive 7050.06. Congress also passed P.L. 115-118 in January 2018, amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) was amended by P.L. 115-118 to address gaps in protections for IC contractors. It allows whistleblowers in the IC to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency. The ICWPA does not mention members of the Armed Forces in IC elements. The ICWPA defines formal processes for submitting complaints to ensure protection of classified information. It requires the IG to report credible complaints to the CIA Director or head of the establishment, who must then report to congressional intelligence committees. If the IG fails to report accurately, employees or contractors can directly submit complaints to Congress after following certain procedures. The ICWPA outlines procedures for reporting complaints to protect classified information. However, it lacks specific provisions for safeguarding whistleblowers from retaliation. The IAA for FY2010 introduced whistleblower protections under the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, allowing lawful disclosures to the IGIC. The Intelligence Community is authorized to receive and investigate complaints or information concerning violations of laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health and safety. The Inspector General must protect the identity of whistleblowers unless unavoidable during the investigation or disclosed to the Department of Justice. No reprisals are allowed for whistleblowers. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community is authorized to investigate complaints or information regarding violations of laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. Whistleblowers are protected from reprisals, and this protection extends to contractors as well as federal employees. The Inspector General can investigate complaints of violations, mismanagement, and abuse. Whistleblowers, including CIA employees, are protected from reprisals for lawful disclosures. PPD-19 provides protections for IC whistleblowers with access to classified information. PPD-19 allows employees to report violations or misconduct to various officials without fear of reprisal, including actions that could impact their access to classified information. It also requires IC elements to have a process for employees to challenge personnel actions believed to be retaliatory. PPD-19 allows employees to seek a review of personnel actions believed to be in reprisal for lawful disclosures, ensuring security of classified information. The IC element Inspector General determines if reprisal occurred and recommends corrective action. Agency heads must consider IG findings but are not required to accept recommendations. IC agencies must certify a review process for employees to appeal actions affecting access to classified information without retaliation for disclosures. PPD-19 allows whistleblowers to request an external review by an IG panel chaired by the IGIC if agency review process is exhausted. The panel's decision must be considered by the agency, but corrective action is not mandatory. IGIC reports annually to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations. Executive Branch provides training on whistleblower protections for employees with classified information access. Title VI of FY2014 IAA codified PPD-19 provisions, offering statutory protections for IC whistleblowers. The FY2014 IAA provided statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against personnel or security clearance actions in reprisal for protected disclosures. Section 601 of Title VI safeguarded whistleblowers from retaliation for lawful disclosures to specified entities, but did not mention protections for contractors. A lawful disclosure is defined as a violation of Federal law, rule, or regulation. Section 602 of Title VI protects government employee whistleblowers from retaliatory revocation of security clearance for making lawful disclosures. It also requires the development of appeal policies and procedures for such cases, allowing whistleblowers to retain their employment status pending the outcome of the appeal. The provision, first signed in 2014 and updated in April 2016, does not permit judicial review or a private right of action and does not mention protections for contractors. ICD-120, Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection, signed in 2014 and updated in April 2016, provides protections for IC employees making protected disclosures. It includes provisions for reprisal protection, appeals for security clearance decisions, and maintaining employment status during pending decisions. The provision covers whistleblowers, excluding members of the Armed Forces but including contractors. The provision in ICD-120 offers protections for IC employees making protected disclosures, including reprisal protection and appeals for security clearance decisions. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections for members of the Armed Forces against retaliation for protected communications, allowing communication with Congress, Inspector General, and DOD organizations. The provision in ICD-120 offers protections for IC employees making protected disclosures, including reprisal protection and appeals for security clearance decisions. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections for members of the Armed Forces against retaliation for protected communications, allowing communication with Congress, Inspector General, and DOD organizations. Specifies prohibited personnel actions in reprisal for a member of the Armed Forces making a protected communication; Enables the DOD to take action to mitigate hardship for an Armed Forces member following a preliminary finding concerning an alleged reprisal for a protected communication; Requires the inspector general conducting an investigation into a protected communication to provide periodic updates to Congress, the whistleblower, the Secretary of Defense and the relevant Service; and Requires the DOD Inspector General to prescribe uniform standards for investigations of allegations. The DOD Inspector General is tasked with setting standards for investigations of prohibited personnel actions and training for Inspectors General staff. Existing whistleblower protection laws in the intelligence community cover contractors inconsistently. Efforts have been made in Congress to address this gap, including the passage of P.L. 115-118 in January 2018 to provide protections for IC contractors. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 in October 2017 to address the perceived gaps in coverage. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 on October 24, 2017, to provide protections for IC employees from retaliation for making protected disclosures. It included provisions for a complaint process. Additionally, she introduced S. 794 on March 18, 2015, to extend protections to contractor employees on contracts with IC elements who make whistleblower complaints. The whistleblower complaint protection for IC contractors was amended by P.L. 115-118 on January 19, 2018. Section 110 of the amendment provides clear protections for IC contractors to make lawful disclosures to specified authorities, similar to protections for IC employees under previous legislation. Section 110 of the amendment provides clear protections for IC contractors to make lawful complaints against any retaliatory personnel action, extending to violations of Federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. These protections also apply to contractors of the FBI, including those in the Intelligence Branch. Section 110 of the amendment provides protections for IC contractors who make lawful whistleblower disclosures against retaliatory actions, including revocation of security clearances. House Amendment 894 redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC, enhancing their ability to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse. The measure redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC to address underfunded capability for responsive follow-up on whistleblower complaints."
