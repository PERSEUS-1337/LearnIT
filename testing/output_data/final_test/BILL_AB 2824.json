    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 15151.5 of the Elections Code requires counties with the technical capacity to post detailed election results on their website, including the total number of ballots cast, votes for each candidate and measure at each precinct, and votes in various districts for statewide offices and ballot propositions. The Elections Code mandates that counties with the technical ability must post detailed election results online, including precinct data for different types of ballots. Counties must provide this information in downloadable spreadsheet and EML formats, with flexibility for counties lacking technical capacity. Following the semifinal official canvass, a county elections official must post election information daily until the first Friday after election day, then weekly until results are certified. If information hasn't changed, a statement can be posted instead. Counties lacking technical ability must comply with Section 19216.5. Section 15372 of the Elections Code is amended. Section 15372 of the Elections Code is amended to require the elections official to submit a certified statement of election results to the governing body within 30 days of the election. The elections official must post certified election results on their website in a downloadable spreadsheet format for at least 22 months after the election. This requirement applies to officials with computer systems capable of producing such results without modification. After December 31, 2017, the Secretary of State must certify voting systems capable of generating election information in downloadable spreadsheet and EML formats, and enabling data transfer to an external digital medium. County elections officials must comply with Section 15151.5 by modifying their voting systems by the same deadline. The Commission on State Mandates will propose a modification to the Secretary of State by December 31, 2017. If the act incurs state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made according to the Government Code."
