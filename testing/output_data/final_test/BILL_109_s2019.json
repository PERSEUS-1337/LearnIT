    "content": "The Act titled \"Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005\" includes findings related to methamphetamine. Congress finds that methamphetamine use and production is rapidly increasing in the United States. Residues from methamphetamine production create environmental issues in closed labs. Standard measures for remediation are lacking, and initial cleanup focuses on immediate health threats. Residences where methamphetamine is made often have widespread contamination. The lack of knowledge on effective cleanup methods for methamphetamine labs, limited data on contaminants, absence of uniform cleanup standards, and the need for research on sampling and analysis procedures are key challenges. Many states are struggling to establish guidelines and programs for addressing the increasing number of closed methamphetamine labs each year. SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES. The Assistant Administrator for Research and Development of the EPA, in consultation with NIST, will establish voluntary guidelines for remediating former methamphetamine labs within a year of this Act. Considerations include federal, state, and local laws, as well as the different types and locations of these labs. The Assistant Administrator for Research and Development of the EPA, in consultation with NIST, will establish voluntary guidelines for remediating former methamphetamine labs. The guidelines are designed to assist State and local governments in implementing legislation and policies based on state-of-the-art knowledge and research. The Assistant Administrator will work with relevant agencies to promote the adoption of these guidelines and periodically update them. The Assistant Administrator, in consultation with States and other parties, will periodically update voluntary guidelines to incorporate new research findings and knowledge. The research program is outlined in Section 4. The Assistant Administrator will establish a research program to support the development and revision of voluntary guidelines for methamphetamine laboratory-related chemicals. The research will identify chemicals of concern, assess exposure levels, address biological effects, evaluate cleanup techniques, and support other research priorities. The Assistant Administrator will establish a research program to develop voluntary guidelines for methamphetamine laboratory-related chemicals in consultation with States and interested parties. SEC. 5. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CONFERENCE. The Assistant Administrator shall convene a conference every third year involving State agencies, individuals, and organizations to discuss environmental and biological impacts of former methamphetamine laboratories. The conference serves as a forum for sharing guidelines and research findings, as well as addressing the needs and experiences of non-Federal participants. The Assistant Administrator convenes a conference every third year to discuss environmental and biological impacts of former methamphetamine laboratories. A report summarizing conference proceedings, recommendations, and concerns raised by non-Federal participants is submitted to Congress within 90 days. The report is made widely available to the public. SEC. 6. RESIDUAL EFFECTS STUDY. The Assistant Administrator will arrange for a study by the National Academy of Sciences on the residual effects of methamphetamine laboratories, focusing on research gaps and recommendations for a research program. The study will address impacts on residents and first responders, with a report due to Congress within 90 days of completion. The Assistant Administrator will submit a report to Congress detailing how the study on the residual effects of methamphetamine laboratories will be used to carry out specific activities. SEC. 7. METHAMPHETAMINE DETECTION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Director of National Institute of Standards and Technology, in consultation with the Assistant Administrator, shall support a research program to develop new methamphetamine detection technologies, with emphasis on field test kits and site detection, and appropriate standard reference materials and validation procedures for methamphetamine detection testing. SEC. 8. SAVINGS CLAUSE. Nothing in this Act modifies or otherwise affects the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $3,000,000 authorized for Environmental Protection Agency and $1,500,000 for National Institute of Standards and Technology for fiscal years 2006-2009."
