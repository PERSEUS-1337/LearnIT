    "content": "During the Great Depression, accurate data on unemployment was lacking until the federal government initiated a monthly survey in March 1940. Pub. Law No. 409 in 1937 required the President to conduct a census of unemployment, with Unemployment Report Cards distributed to households. The 1940 census was the first to include questions on the labor force, defining it as employed or actively seeking work. During the Great Depression, data on unemployment was limited until the federal government started a monthly survey in March 1940. The 1930 census used a different concept of \"gainful worker,\" and the 1940 census had different occupational classification systems. The U.S. Census Bureau adjusted 1930 census data to align with the 1940 census for consistency. The Appendix discusses the evolution of labor force data over time, supplementing the Depression-era data in the report. During the Great Depression, there were two downturns in the business cycle. The first recession lasted from August 1929 to March 1933, followed by a slow recovery until May 1937 when the economy peaked. A 13-month decline followed until June 1938, with full employment recovery not happening until World War II. The percentage of employed working-age population dropped significantly between 1930 and 1940, mainly affecting men. Despite the gender impact, men still dominated employment during the 1930s. The number of men employed fell by 898,000 over the decade, while women employed rose by almost 1.3 million, increasing women's share of employed persons to one-fourth by 1940. The Great Depression had a differential employment effect by age group, with a substantial decrease in teenage employment likely due to last-hired/first-fired practices and the Fair Labor Standards Act raising the age limit for employment in manufacturing industries. This led to fewer job opportunities for young persons, prompting some teenagers to stay in school voluntarily after age 14. During the 1930s, older workers faced challenges in finding new jobs due to age discrimination. Employers could refuse to hire them, citing younger workers as more adaptable and skilled. Some firms even had maximum age limits for hiring, as low as 45 years. Technological developments also impacted job loss differently across gender and age groups. Increased mechanization and the advent of the assembly line led to a shift in job opportunities, favoring women and younger men over older men. Skilled occupations decreased from 12.9% to 11.7% between 1930 and 1940, with older men being displaced the most. Women mostly worked in semiskilled occupations, while the demand for unskilled workers also decreased, affecting men more than women. During the Great Depression, unskilled black men were particularly affected by the shift in job demand towards machinery, as their occupations accounted for a significant portion of their employment. In contrast, unskilled women, who were primarily servants, were less impacted as their jobs were not easily replaceable by machinery. Women also benefited from increased demand in white-collar occupations, especially in clerical roles, which became the largest employment category for women. Men, especially older men, faced displacement due to the shift from agrarian to industrial economy. During the Great Depression, black men were disproportionately affected by the shift from agrarian to industrial economy. Employment dropped significantly, with construction and manufacturing workers being the hardest hit. Manufacturing accounted for the majority of job losses in the goods-producing sector. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in the goods-producing sector, particularly in manufacturing. In 1933, motor vehicle and equipment firms saw a 45.5% decrease in factory jobs compared to 1929. The 1937-1938 downturn resulted in almost 2 million job losses, with over three-fourths in mining, construction, and manufacturing industries. The service-producing sector also experienced a decline in employment by 3.3 million jobs or 18.2%. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in the goods-producing sector, particularly in manufacturing. Employment in the service-producing sector declined by 3.3 million jobs or 18.2% during the 1929-1933 downturn. Agricultural employment also fell due to droughts, dust storms, and technological innovations displacing farm families. Farm employment decreased steadily from 1929 to 1933, with 56% of workers employed part-time in 1932. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in the goods-producing sector, particularly in manufacturing. In March 1932, 56% of workers were employed part-time, with manufacturing industries having 63% part-time workers. Part-time employment was involuntary due to low operating rates. Only 26% of firms operated on full-time schedules. Both Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations pursued part-time employment as a strategy to address reduced demand for goods and services. President Roosevelt successfully reemployed many by cutting hours further. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in the goods-producing sector, particularly in manufacturing. President Roosevelt successfully reemployed many by cutting hours further and establishing minimum wages. The unemployment rate rose from 3.2% in 1929 to 24.9% in 1933, with over 12.8 million individuals lacking jobs. The unemployment rate declined to 14.3% in 1937 before the second downturn began. The Great Depression ended in June 1938, with an average unemployment rate of 19.0% for the year. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in manufacturing. President Roosevelt reemployed many by cutting hours and setting minimum wages. Unemployment rose from 3.2% in 1929 to 24.9% in 1933, with over 12.8 million jobless. The rate dropped to 14.3% in 1937 before rising again. In 1938, the Depression ended with an average unemployment rate of 19.0% for the year. The number of unemployed persons increased by almost 3 million between 1937 and 1938. Women saw a greater increase in unemployment than men between 1930 and 1940. Despite rising unemployment rates for women, their rate remained lower than men's in 1940. This could be due to women leaving the labor force upon losing their jobs, while men continued to search for work. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in manufacturing. President Roosevelt reemployed many by cutting hours and setting minimum wages. Unemployment rose from 3.2% in 1929 to 24.9% in 1933, with over 12.8 million jobless. The rate dropped to 14.3% in 1937 before rising again. In 1938, the Depression ended with an average unemployment rate of 19.0% for the year. Women's lower unemployment rate in 1940 might have been associated with \"less unemployment in clerical and service occupations\" and younger workers faced the greatest increase in unemployment. The number of unemployed 14 to 24 year olds rose by 251% between 1930 and 1940. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in manufacturing. President Roosevelt reemployed many by cutting hours and setting minimum wages. Unemployment rose from 3.2% in 1929 to 24.9% in 1933, with over 12.8 million jobless. The rate dropped to 14.3% in 1937 before rising again. In 1938, the Depression ended with an average unemployment rate of 19.0% for the year. Among workers age 25 and above, persons between 45 and 64 years old suffered the largest increase in unemployment. In Michigan in 1935, 16.8% of employable persons age 45 to 49 and 19.5% of those age 50 to 54 were unemployed in contrast with 23.0% of employables age 55 to 59 and 27.3% of those age 60 to 64. Similarly, in Massachusetts in 1934, between 22.0% and 23.3% of employables age 45 to 54 were jobless compared to between 26.0% and 30.0% of those age 55 to 64. The Census Bureau noted that the comparatively low unemployment rates of workers age 65 and older cannot be interpreted to mean that.

The Census Bureau noted that comparatively low unemployment rates of workers age 65 and older cannot be interpreted to mean that employment opportunities were most favorable for aged persons. Data on minority workers was limited, but it appears that black workers made up a disproportionate share of unemployed persons. In January 1934, blacks comprised just 1.2% of all employables in Massachusetts, but 33.2% of employable blacks did not have jobs. In contrast, many fewer employable whites were unemployed (19.0%) despite their accounting for virtually all employables in the state (98.8%). Similarly, based on a 19-city survey conducted in 1931, black women were a larger proportion of all unemployed women in each city than they were of all gainful women workers in each city. The converse was true among white women. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in manufacturing. Unemployment rose significantly, with over 12.8 million jobless by 1933. The impact of the Depression was greater on older men, especially black men, who faced disadvantages in the labor market due to age and race. Lower skilled workers were more affected than higher skilled workers, with semiskilled workers and nonfarm laborers experiencing higher unemployment rates. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in manufacturing, with a majority of unemployed persons in 1937 coming from the manufacturing, services, and construction industries. Specifically, former employees of manufacturers, iron and steel producers, textile industries, clothing industries, and service-related firms made up a significant portion of the jobless population. Additionally, long spells of unemployment were common during the 1930s. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in manufacturing, services, and construction industries. In Massachusetts in January 1934, 62% of unemployed men had been without jobs for a year or longer. Women fared slightly better with 54% unemployed for a year or longer. In November 1937, 31% of the 4.7 million unemployed persons had been jobless for more than one year. Even in 1940, one-third of unemployed workers had not held a job in a year or more. During the Great Depression, job losses were concentrated in various industries. In 1940, the Middle Atlantic region reported the highest rate of unemployment, with Pennsylvania and New York having the highest jobless rates in the nation. The South Atlantic region had the lowest unemployment rate, with South Carolina and Mississippi reporting the lowest rates. The number of workers laid off from manufacturing industries was significant. During the Great Depression, job losses were widespread across different industries and regions. Layoffs were significant in manufacturing industries such as shoe, textile, steel, clothing, and auto. Farming also contributed to unemployment in various regions. Approximately one in four workers in the nation was unemployed at the peak of the depression, with many experiencing long periods of joblessness and reduced earnings. Men, especially older and black workers, were among the most affected. During the Great Depression, older and black men were significantly affected by job losses, especially in industries like manufacturing and farming. Lower skilled workers faced greater disadvantages in the labor market, with states reliant on agriculture and manufacturing reporting high unemployment rates. The analysis compares the Great Depression with the eleventh post-World War II recession, using seasonally adjusted monthly data from December 2007 to 2009. The eleventh post-World War II recession is compared to the Great Depression in terms of its impact on workers. The similarities between the two economic downturns are also shared with other recessions in between. The Great Depression had a much worse effect on workers compared to the latest and intervening recessions, due to higher unemployment rates and the lack of government safety net programs. During economic downturns, workers in the goods-producing sector, particularly men in blue-collar occupations, are disproportionately affected by layoffs. Industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing see higher job losses. Men are more impacted than women during recessions, with the goods-producing sector accounting for a significant portion of job losses. During economic downturns, workers in the goods-producing sector, especially in blue-collar occupations, are heavily impacted by layoffs. Industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing experience higher job losses, with men being more affected than women. The goods-producing sector accounted for a significant portion of job losses during the Great Depression and the 2008 recession. During economic downturns, workers in blue-collar occupations (e.g. operators, assemblers) in the goods-producing sector are at a higher risk of displacement. Men are more affected than women, with a greater concentration in industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing. This trend was evident during the Great Depression, where men dominated job roles in these industries. In 2008, men still held the majority of jobs in the goods-producing sector. Men continue to dominate job roles in the goods-producing sector, with high percentages of employment in mining, construction, and manufacturing. Despite a slight increase in women's presence in these industries, men experienced a significant decline in employment during the recession, while women faced less job loss. This trend of worse impact on male employment during economic downturns is not new, as seen in previous recessions. According to a 1993 analysis, men lost significantly more jobs than women in recessions between 1969 and 1991 due to the heavy male presence in goods-producing industries. During recessions, the job market heavily impacts men as they lose the majority of jobs, while industries with more women like services and government remain stable. Unemployment rates for men have been higher than for women in recent recessions, with men experiencing higher rates at the end of the 1981-1982, 1990-1991, and 2001 recessions. During recent recessions, men have consistently experienced higher unemployment rates compared to women. This trend can be attributed to faster employment growth in female-dominated industries, narrowing the unemployment differential between genders. Lower-skilled workers are also more vulnerable to unemployment than higher-skilled workers. During economic downturns, lower-skilled workers are more likely to face unemployment compared to higher-skilled workers. This trend has been consistent over time, with professionals and managers experiencing lower unemployment rates than craft workers and laborers. In 2008, the unemployment rate for management and professional occupations was much lower than for natural resources, construction, and production occupations. This pattern of higher-skilled workers weathering economic downturns better than lower-skilled workers has been observed historically as well. Between 1930 and 1940, employment increased for professionals and nonfarm proprietors, managers, and officials. In contrast, craft workers and nonfarm laborers saw a decrease in employment during the Depression period. Additionally, between 2007 and 2008, employment of high-skilled workers in management, professional, and related occupations increased, while employment in construction, extraction, and production occupations decreased. Older workers face challenges in reemployment, with a higher proportion of younger workers experiencing frequent but short periods of unemployment. In 1940, unemployment duration was longer for older workers, with those aged 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 experiencing 12.2 weeks and 11.8 weeks of unemployment, respectively. Workers aged 45 and older also made up a higher percentage of long-term unemployed individuals. Age discrimination may contribute to reemployment issues for older workers, with some facing challenges due to being perceived as overqualified, overpriced, and technologically challenged. Involuntary part-time employment also tends to increase during economic downturns, similar to trends seen during the 1930s. During the current recession, the number of persons working part-time for economic reasons almost doubled, from 4,548,000 to 8,928,000. The unemployment rate rose almost doubled between December 2007 and May 2009. In contrast to the Great Depression, where one in four workers was unemployed, fewer than one in eleven workers are unemployed today. During the Great Depression, employment fell by 24.3% on nonfarm payrolls, compared to 4.3% in the current recession. To match the impact of the 1929-1933 decline, 27.6 million more workers would have needed to be laid off. In the goods-producing sector, 7.2 million jobs would have to be cut to equal the decline. Construction companies would have had to shed 2.2 million more jobs, and manufacturers would have had to cut more positions as well. The comparison between the Great Depression and the current recession shows that the latter is less severe. Unemployment rates in 1931 were much higher than in 2009, with 24.7 million workers unemployed compared to 1.8 million displaced. The nonfarm payroll employment decreased by 4.3% in the current recession, much lower than the 24.3% decline during the Great Depression. The current recession is less severe than the Great Depression, with a 4.3% decrease in nonfarm payroll employment compared to a 24.3% decline. To match the job loss impact of the Depression, 14.7 million more workers would have had to be let go. In the goods-producing sector, 5.0 million workers would need to be laid off to equal the impact of the 1929-1931 decline. Construction and manufacturing industries would have to shed more workers to match the Depression's impact. The current recession, while less severe than the Great Depression, has had a significant impact on different geographic regions. States in the East North Central region, heavily dependent on goods production, experienced high unemployment rates in May 2009. In contrast, the Middle Atlantic and New England regions, with more diversified employment away from manufacturing industries, fared comparatively better during the current recession. The current recession has led to a diversification of employment away from manufacturing industries in various states. During the Great Depression, many agricultural states suffered greatly, while in the current recession, states dependent on construction and real estate services experienced high unemployment rates. During the recession, states like California, Nevada, and Oregon had high unemployment rates due to their reliance on industries like high-tech. The impact of unemployment has changed over time, with more families having both spouses employed, reducing the financial impact of joblessness. The financial impact of joblessness today is less severe compared to the Great Depression, as more families have both spouses employed. During the Great Depression, earnings and hours worked dropped significantly, while in the current recession, the decrease in earnings and hours worked is less drastic. During the Great Depression, public assistance was mainly provided by private charities and local governments. State governments began offering relief in 1931 due to the increasing needs of unemployed workers. The Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932 led to 33 more states providing public assistance, the only major federal measure during the Hoover Administration to aid the jobless. The Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932 was a major federal measure passed during the Hoover Administration to aid the jobless. President Hoover signed it reluctantly, viewing traditional relief sources as more appropriate. The act provided federal money to states as loans to be repaid with interest or deductions from future federal aid. This repayment feature was later cancelled in 1938. It wasn't until the Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1933 during the Roosevelt Administration that the federal government committed its own resources for assisting the unemployed. The Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1933 provided assistance to the unemployed through matching grants and discretionary funds, emphasizing work relief programs over direct public relief. The Social Security Act of 1935 established permanent benefit transfer programs, ensuring that those unemployed during the recession had access to aid without delay. The Social Security Act of 1935 established benefit transfer programs for the unemployed, ensuring access to aid without delay. The unemployment compensation program has expanded over the years to cover almost all wage and salary workers, providing benefits for a longer period during the current recession. During the current recession, unemployment compensation (UC) benefits have been extended compared to the Depression era. Most states now offer 26 weeks of regular UC benefits, with additional extended benefits available in high-unemployment states. The 110th and 111th Congresses also passed temporary programs to provide benefits for workers who exhausted their regular benefits. Another recent change in the law involves reducing the waiting period before benefits can be collected. The waiting period before collecting unemployment benefits has been reduced. Currently, 25 states have no waiting period, while the rest have a one-week requirement. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 authorized a work-sharing program, allowing employers to reduce hours instead of laying off employees. This program provides partial benefits to workers with reduced schedules. No similar program existed during the Great Depression. During the Great Depression, the Social Security Act was not yet in place, leaving jobless workers without benefits. Some individuals did not meet the eligibility criteria due to long-term unemployment. Federal programs like aid for farmers and the unemployed were in their early stages, with food stamps emerging in the late 1930s to address distribution issues. During the Great Depression, federal programs like aid for farmers and the unemployed were in early stages. Food stamps emerged in the late 1930s to address distribution issues. The Census Bureau transitioned from the gainful worker to labor force concept between the 1930 and 1940 censuses. The definition and measurement of employment and unemployment have evolved over the decades. The Census Bureau transitioned from the gainful worker to labor force concept between the 1930 and 1940 censuses, changing the criteria for counting individuals as gainful workers. This shift included new workers, raised the age criteria, and specified a specific time period for labor market activity. It also led to discrepancies in how certain individuals were classified in the census counts. The 1930 census saw changes in counting gainful workers and measuring unemployment, resulting in a decrease of 1.2 million gainful workers. Gainful workers were asked about their work status and reasons for idleness, leading to classification into different categories based on their job status. The 1940 census introduced a new definition of the labor force, classifying individuals as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. The Census Bureau adjusted the definition of unemployment from the 1930 census to align with the 1940 census, estimating the number of individuals who would have been classified as unemployed under the new definition. The Bureau estimated the number of unemployed workers in 1930 based on the 1940 census definition, with 213,000 new workers and 2,238,000 experienced workers seeking jobs. Surveys during the Depression provided data on unemployment, but were limited in scope and not conducted regularly. Comparisons between the Great Depression and today are made using different data sources. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the official source of timely labor force data, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics releasing monthly estimates based on CPS data. The Census Bureau took over responsibility for the monthly unemployment report from the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1942. The Bureau of Labor Statistics assumed responsibility for analyzing and releasing labor force data from CPS in the late 1950s."
