    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail Act of 2001\". El Camino Real de los Tejas served as a vital route between Mexico City and Tejas. Rivalries among European colonial powers played out in the region. American Indian nations' futures were influenced by these events. The Old San Antonio Road and El Camino Real de los Tejas played crucial roles in facilitating cultural interactions, exploration, conquest, colonization, and migration in the borderland region from 1689 to 1850. The routes carried Spanish, Mexican, and American influences, contributing to the formation of the Republic of Texas and its annexation to the United States. The portions of El Camino Real de los Tejas in the United States extended from the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and Laredo, Texas, covering almost 2,600 miles. The route generally went northeast through San Antonio, Bastrop, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine in Texas to Natchitoches, Louisiana, totaling a distance of 550 miles. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION. Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act is amended to designate the El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail, a 2,580-mile route from Texas to Louisiana. The El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail, a 2,580-mile route from Texas to Louisiana, shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary may coordinate with US and Mexican organizations for exchanging trail information and research. The organization focuses on trail preservation, educational programs, technical assistance, and establishing an international historic trail with complementary programs in each nation. SEC. 4. PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION. Designation of El Camino Real de los Tejas under this Act does not confer additional authority to apply Federal laws on non-Federal lands along the trail. Laws requiring consideration of a national historic trail by public entities will still apply. The trail on non-Federal lands will only be established when landowners voluntarily request certification of their sites. The United States can acquire privately-owned property for the trail with the owner's consent, but cannot condemn or appropriate property. The United States can acquire privately-owned property for El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail with the owner's consent. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 10, 2001."
