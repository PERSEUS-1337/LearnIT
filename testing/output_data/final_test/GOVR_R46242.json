    "content": "This report highlights current major trade issues for U.S. agriculture in the second session of the 116th Congress. It covers U.S. agricultural trade importance, Trump Administration's 2020 trade policy, 2019 trade policy actions, new trade negotiations, and WTO agricultural issues. The report discusses ongoing trade policy concerns for U.S. agriculture, including non-tariff measures, trade barriers, and disputes involving specialty crops, livestock, and dairy issues. U.S. agricultural exports have been a bright spot in the U.S. balance of trade, with exports exceeding imports every year since 1960. However, the value of farm exports has remained below the record level of $152 billion reached in FY2014, with a decline to $136 billion in FY2019. In FY2014, lower market prices for bulk commodities like soybeans and corn were initially seen. U.S. agricultural exports were impacted by retaliatory tariffs from China and other countries in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration. In FY2019, agricultural imports were $131 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $5 billion, lower than previous years. Agricultural exports are crucial for farmers and the U.S. economy, accounting for a significant portion of total U.S. exports in recent years. In 2017, U.S. agricultural exports generated 1,161,000 full-time civilian jobs, accounting for 20% of total farm production value. High value products (HVPs) made up 68% of agricultural exports in FY2019. All states export agricultural commodities, with a minority of states responsible for the majority of farm export sales. In 2018, the 10 leading agricultural exporting states accounted for 58% of total U.S. agricultural exports. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized major agricultural export promotion programs through FY2023, including provisions for export credit guarantee programs and international market development programs. The bill also allows funding for U.S. agricultural export promotion programs in Cuba. The Trump Administration's Cooperator Program focuses on reducing U.S. trade deficits, renegotiating trade agreements, imposing tariffs on imports, and responding to unfair trade practices. The Administration's agenda for the 116th Congress includes implementing a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was enacted on January 29, 2020, replacing NAFTA. The \"Stage One\" trade agreement with Japan was signed on October 7, 2019, focusing on market access improvements for U.S. agricultural exports. The agreement took effect on January 1, 2020, without requiring congressional approval. The Administration aims to negotiate a broader trade agreement with Japan that may need congressional approval. President Trump signed a \"Phase One\" executive agreement with China on trade and investment issues, including agriculture, on January 15, 2020. This agreement, which took effect on February 14, 2020, did not require congressional approval as it consisted mainly of commitments by China. The Administration plans to negotiate a second phase of the agreement with China, which may require consultation with Congress and eventual approval. Additionally, the U.S. Trade Representative has indicated that the U.S. may pursue new trade agreements with the European Union, India, Kenya, the United Kingdom, and other countries. The negotiations with Kenya and the UK are expected to be comprehensive. The U.S. plans comprehensive trade negotiations with Kenya and the UK, addressing various trade issues. USTR is interested in WTO reform, with an opportunity at the upcoming Ministerial Conference in June 2020. Some Members of Congress prioritize WTO reform for 2020. Retaliatory tariffs on U.S. food and agricultural products have been imposed by Canada, China, EU, India, Mexico, and Turkey since early 2018. This is to facilitate the ratification of USMCA. The United States removed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico to facilitate ratification of USMCA. Retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports were also removed by these countries. This led to a decline in U.S. agricultural exports in 2019 due to lower global demand and downward pressure on prices. The US experienced a 16% decrease in net farm income in 2018 due to declining prices and export sales, leading to trade aid payments to the farm sector. Tariffs were imposed on Chinese imports under Section 232 and Section 301 of trade acts, prompting retaliatory tariffs from China on certain US agricultural products. China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, leading to a 53% decline in exports to China from $19.5 billion in 2017 to $9.2 billion in 2018. The tariffs affected key products like soybeans, distillers' grains, and sorghum, with soybean exports dropping to $3 billion in 2018 from $12 billion. In 2018, U.S. agricultural exports to China declined in value to $3 billion from $12 billion in 2017. The value of sorghum and distillers dry grain exports also decreased by about 40% and 30% respectively. Negotiations between the U.S. and China led to a \"Phase One\" trade agreement in January 2020, where China agreed to import $32 billion worth of additional U.S. agricultural products over two years, including oilseeds, meat, cereals, cotton, and seafood. China may grant tariff exemptions on U.S. imports for agricultural products and improve TRQ administration for wheat, corn, and rice. They also agreed to enhance transparency in domestic agricultural support and implement science-based food safety regulations. Additionally, China will finalize phytosanitary protocols for various U.S. agricultural products. China agreed to improve access for U.S. beef and pork products, including eliminating age restrictions on cattle, traceability requirements, and establishing maximum residue levels for hormones. They also agreed to broaden the list of eligible pork products for importation. China agreed to broaden the list of eligible pork products for importation, conduct a risk assessment for the veterinary drug ractopamine, adopt import regulations consistent with international standards for poultry, approve 26 aquatic species for importation from the U.S., and streamline procedures for registering U.S. seafood facilities. Additionally, China agreed to implement the USDA Public Health Information System to provide export health certificates in advance of shipment arrival. The U.S.-China Phase One agreement includes commitments to provide regulatory certainty for various U.S. exports, such as dairy products, infant formula, rice, and feed additives. It aims to improve opportunities for U.S. exporters, but may not create significant new market demand. The agreement may lead to a reorganization of trading patterns between China and its import suppliers, with limited market price effects expected due to the coronavirus outbreak impacting China's economic growth. The Phase One agreement between the United States and China aims to provide regulatory certainty for U.S. exports like dairy products, infant formula, rice, and feed additives. The outbreak of the coronavirus is expected to slow China's economic growth and disrupt global supply chains, affecting Chinese import demand for agricultural products. This could result in U.S. agricultural exports to China falling short of the $32 billion target over a two-year period. China has flexibility to meet its purchase commitment based on market prices and conditions, with certain retaliatory tariffs reduced and one-year tariff exclusions granted for agricultural products. China has halved retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products but tariffs imposed in 2018 remain. Both countries plan to engage in further trade negotiations in 2020. The Trump Administration aimed to renegotiate NAFTA and imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico. Threats of tariffs on imported passenger vehicles were also made. In response to steel and aluminum tariffs, Mexico imposed tariffs on U.S. sausage, pork products, cheeses, apples, potatoes, and whiskies. Canada retaliated with tariffs on dairy, poultry, beef, coffee, chocolate, and whiskies. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was announced in 2018 and enacted in 2020. Mexico has ratified the agreement, while Canada is in the process of deliberating it. The USMCA agreement, once ratified by all three countries, will enter into force after certification by the United States. The agricultural provisions include maintaining zero tariffs on all food and agricultural products from NAFTA, with exceptions for certain dairy and poultry products. Canada will increase market access for U.S. dairy products through TRQs, while replacing poultry TRQs under NAFTA with new ones. This is expected to increase imports of U.S. eggs and turkey meat, but reduce duty-free imports of U.S. chicken meat into Canada. The USMCA agreement includes provisions for duty-free imports of certain U.S. poultry products into Canada, with tariffs exceeding 200% for products above set quotas. The agreement also allows for additional access to Canadian dairy products, sugar, peanuts, and peanut products from the United States. Canada will treat U.S. wheat varieties similarly to Canadian wheat if they are registered as similar. Efforts are being made to expedite the registration process for U.S. wheat varieties in Canada. The agreement also addresses the distribution of spirits, wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages among the three countries. The USMCA agreement establishes listing requirements and cost markups for products, transparency in sanitary and phytosanitary measures, procedural safeguards for geographical indications, and protection for common cheese names in Mexico. The USMCA agreement includes provisions to protect certain spirits as distinctive products and ensure confidentiality of proprietary formula information. It also establishes a Working Group for Cooperation on Agricultural Biotechnology. The United States removed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico, and USMCA requires ratification by Canada to enter into force. The USJTA is a trade agreement between the US and Japan that includes limited tariff reductions and quota expansions for improved market access. It also involves reciprocal tariff reductions on industrial goods. Japan previously negotiated similar provisions with the US in the TPP agreement, which the US did not ratify. The USJTA aims to provide the same level of market access to US products as it does to TPP-11 countries. Japan agreed to eliminate or reduce tariffs for certain U.S. agricultural exports and provide preferential quotas for other products. Tariffs on meat products like beef and pork will be reduced or eliminated, with some products already having tariffs eliminated upon entry into force. Tariffs on other products like cheeses, processed pork, poultry, and wine will be phased out in stages. Japan also agreed to provide country-specific quotas for all U.S. products covered in the USJTA. Japan agreed to provide country-specific quotas (CSQ) for all products negotiated under TPP, except for rice. Products include wheat, malt, whey, processed cheese, glucose, fructose, corn starch, potato starch, and inulin. Japan will reduce mark-ups on U.S. products imported under quotas and restrict additional tariffs on U.S. beef, pork, whey, oranges, and race horses under USJTA. The United States negotiated market access under TRQs for various products under TPP, but no corresponding access is included in USJTA. The US agreed to reduce tariffs on certain products and provide Japan with the opportunity to export more beef. The Administration took a staged approach to negotiations with Japan to improve market access for U.S. agricultural products. The US negotiated market access under TRQs for various products under TPP, but no corresponding access is included in USJTA. The USJTA is more limited than a traditional free trade agreement, allowing it to take effect without Congress approval. Issues like sanitary measures, agricultural biotechnology, and geographical indications are expected to be covered in future negotiations with Japan. The US may face limitations challenging trade barriers under the USJTA due to the absence of a formal dispute settlement mechanism. The EU retaliated to US steel and aluminum tariffs by imposing tariffs on various US imports. The US imposed additional tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of imports on October 18, 2019. On October 18, 2019, the United States imposed additional tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of U.S. imports from the EU due to non-compliance with a WTO ruling on aircraft subsidies. The tariffs are set at 10% on large civil aircraft and 25% on agricultural and other products, affecting 561 agricultural tariff lines including cheeses, biscuits, pork products, fish products, fruit products, olives, whiskies, liquors, and wine. The UK, which left the EU in January 2020, is also included in the affected countries with 56 tariff lines subject to additional 25% tariffs. In October 2018, USTR notified Congress of plans for trade negotiations with the EU following a U.S.-EU Joint Statement to reduce tariffs and trade barriers. Previous U.S.-EU negotiations for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership stalled in 2016 due to regulatory differences on food safety and product naming schemes. The U.S. and EU are major trade partners. The EU27 is a leading export market for U.S. agricultural exports, accounting for about 8% of all U.S. exports in 2019. U.S. exports of agricultural products to the EU27 totaled $12.4 billion, while imports from the EU27 totaled $29.7 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of approximately $17.3 billion. Leading U.S. agricultural exports to the EU27 include corn, soybeans, tree nuts, distilled spirits, fish products, wine, beer, planting seeds, tobacco products, and processed foods. In January 2019, USTR announced its negotiating objectives for the agricultural portion of a U.S.-EU trade agreement. The objectives include greater market access, changes to EU administration of tariff-rate quotas, and harmonizing regulatory processes and standards to facilitate trade. Key U.S. objectives also include addressing geographical indications and establishing specific commitments for trade regarding agricultural biotechnologies. The U.S. aims to include agriculture in U.S.-EU trade negotiations, but the EU's mandate excludes agricultural products. U.S. Congress members oppose this exclusion. Trade tensions have risen, with the EU imposing tariffs on certain U.S. food and beverage products in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. The targeted U.S. agricultural exports to the EU were valued at approximately $1.2 billion in 2018. In October 2019, the United States imposed additional tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of certain U.S. imports from the EU, including food products, escalating U.S.-EU trade tensions. The U.S. agricultural exports to the EU targeted by these tariffs were valued at approximately $1.2 billion in 2018, accounting for about 9% of total U.S. agricultural exports to the EU28. Non-tariff issues related to differences in laws and regulations, particularly involving SPS and technical barriers to trade, could hinder U.S.-EU agricultural talks. The outlook for new U.S.-EU trade talks is uncertain due to ongoing trade tensions. Disagreement exists over whether food and agriculture will be included in the negotiations, with the U.S. aiming to address the trade deficit in agricultural products with the EU. Talks may focus on SPS and regulatory barriers to agricultural trade, but specifics on non-tariff barriers are still unclear. Some press reports indicate that USDA officials have highlighted specific SPS issues important to the U.S. side in potential U.S.-EU trade talks, including EU restrictions on hormones in meat production, pathogen reduction treatments for poultry, and biotechnology. The U.S. continues to push for concessions from the EU, with formal discussions expected in spring 2020. In October 2018, USTR notified Congress of plans for trade negotiations with the EU following a U.S.-EU Joint Statement in July 2018. Previous U.S.-EU negotiations under the Obama Administration stalled in 2016 due to regulatory differences. The U.S. and EU aim to reduce tariffs, address unfair trading practices, and increase exports. The EU27 is a significant export market for U.S. agricultural products, accounting for about 8% of all U.S. exports in 2019. The U.S. had a trade deficit of approximately $17.3 billion with the EU27 in agricultural and related products, with leading exports including corn, soybeans, tree nuts, distilled spirits, fish products, wine, beer, planting seeds, and tobacco products. The U.S. had a trade deficit of approximately $17.3 billion with the EU27 in agricultural and related products, with leading exports including corn, soybeans, tree nuts, distilled spirits, fish products, wine, beer, planting seeds, and tobacco products. USTR announced negotiating objectives for a U.S.-EU trade agreement, focusing on greater market access, changes to tariff-rate quotas, regulatory harmonization, and addressing geographical indications. The U.S. aims to address geographical indications and protect generic terms in biotechnologies in U.S.-EU trade negotiations. While U.S. agricultural interests support including agriculture in the negotiations, the EU's mandate focuses on eliminating tariffs for industrial goods only, excluding agricultural products. Some Members of Congress oppose the EU's decision. The negotiations follow U.S.-EU trade frictions, including retaliatory tariffs imposed by the EU on certain U.S. food and beverage products in response to U.S. Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The targeted U.S. agricultural exports to the EU28 are valued at approximately $1.2 billion. In 2018, U.S. agricultural exports to the EU28, including the UK, were approximately $1.2 billion, accounting for 9% of total exports. In October 2019, the U.S. imposed additional tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of certain imports from the EU, including food products, authorized by the WTO. Trade tensions between the U.S. and EU have been escalating, with non-tariff issues related to SPS and technical barriers to trade posing challenges in negotiations. The outlook for new U.S.-EU trade talks is uncertain due to ongoing trade tensions. Disagreement persists over whether food and agriculture will be included in the negotiations, with the U.S. aiming to address its trade deficit in agricultural products with the EU. Talks may involve SPS and regulatory barriers to agricultural trade, but specifics are still unclear. Some press reports suggest that USDA officials have mentioned addressing selected SPS barriers and GIs in U.S.-EU trade talks. Key SPS issues for the U.S. include EU restrictions on hormones in meat production, pathogen reduction treatments for poultry, and biotechnology. However, EU officials have downplayed the inclusion of certain non-tariff barriers like biotechnology permits and pesticide regulations in the talks. The U.S. is pushing for more concessions from the EU, with formal discussions expected in spring 2020. The Secretary of Agriculture initiated two trade assistance programs in response to foreign trade retaliation targeting U.S. agricultural products. The aid packages aimed to provide short-term assistance to farmers for the loss of international markets, totaling up to $28 billion over two years. The trade aid packages included a Market Facilitation Program (MFP) for direct payments to affected producers, a Food Purchase and Distribution Program (FPDP) to offset lost export sales, and an Agricultural Trade Promotion (ATP) program. The aid totaled $24.5 billion over two years, with $8.6 billion spent in 2018 and $14.2 billion in 2019. Concerns have been raised about the aid's compliance with WTO rules and U.S. commitments on domestic support. The trade aid packages, including the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), raised questions about future compensatory measures and the distribution of payments across the U.S. agricultural sector. India's rapid economic growth and increasing demand for higher-value food products are expected to drive consumption among its large population. Indian consumers are among the world's largest producers and consumers of various agricultural commodities. USDA projects India to be a major importer of dairy products, vegetable oils, pulses, tree nuts, and fruit, while also being a significant exporter of rice, cotton, and buffalo meat. U.S. agricultural exports to India have fluctuated in recent years, reaching $1.8 billion in 2019, with key exports including tree nuts, cotton, and fresh fruit. U.S. dairy exports to India have seen significant growth, increasing by almost 300% from $16 million. In 2019, U.S. dairy exports to India grew by almost 300% to $60 million. The United States imported agricultural products worth $2.6 billion from India, including spices, rice, essential oils, tea, processed fruit and vegetables, and vegetable oils. Trade tensions led to additional tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from India by the U.S., with India retaliating with tariffs on U.S. chickpeas, almonds, walnuts, apples, and lentils. India's high tariffs and non-tariff barriers hinder U.S. agricultural exports. Restrictions on various products like flowers, raisins, and alcoholic beverages exist. Import quotas on pulses limit U.S. exports to India. Restrictions on wheat, barley, livestock genetic material, and dairy products also impede trade. In 2015, India revised health certificate requirements for pork imports, leading to U.S. efforts to export pork to India. USTR criticizes India's lack of transparency in customs regulations and slow approval process for genetically engineered products. India heavily subsidizes domestic production through food stockholding and agricultural sector support. The U.S. has raised concerns at the WTO about India under-reporting price supports for rice, wheat, cotton, and sugarcane. In 2019, the United States revoked India's eligibility for preferential tariff treatment under the U.S. GSP due to trade barriers. U.S. imports of agricultural products from India decreased by 1% from $2.7 billion in 2018 to $2.6 billion in 2019. The USTR aims to negotiate an agreement in 2020 for greater access to the Indian market for U.S. agricultural products. Additionally, the Trump Administration plans to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement with Kenya. Kenya, as part of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), hosts international agricultural research centers focusing on innovations like agricultural biotechnology. With a population of over 47 million and a projected GDP growth rate of 4% through 2031, Kenya has the potential to increase imports of food and agricultural products, with top imports being wheat, palm oil, sugar, corn, and rice. Kenya's top exports to the United States include wheat, vegetable oils, pulses, coarse grains, and prepared food products. The country benefits from duty-free access to the U.S. market for 6,400 products under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. In 2019, the U.S. imported agricultural products worth $126 million from Kenya, including macadamia nuts, cashew nuts, coffee, tea, roses, and vegetable oils. Kenya's MFN tariffs for various products are relatively high, with concerns raised about a ban on genetically modified imports. In February 2020, Kenya adopted a phytosanitary protocol allowing wheat growers in Washington State, Oregon, and Idaho access to Kenya's wheat market, potentially increasing U.S. wheat exports. USTR plans to notify Congress of intent to start negotiations with Kenya following consultations as required by the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015. Subsequently, USTR will publish notices in the Federal Register requesting public comment on the trade negotiations with Kenya. The USTR plans to notify Congress of trade negotiations with Kenya and publish objectives at least 30 days before negotiations begin. Some Members of Congress support a free trade agreement with Kenya. The UK left the EU in January 2020 but remains in the EU customs union. U.S.-UK trade is currently governed by agreements between the U.S. and the EU, but the UK intends to withdraw from the EU customs union on December 31, 2020. U.S.-UK trade will then be under WTO rules unless a separate agreement is reached. The UK entered the WTO as an EU member and does not have its own schedule of commitments. U.S.-UK trade may continue to be governed by the EU WTO schedule. Some Members of Congress prioritize a U.S.-UK trade agreement due to uncertainty over quota and subsidy commitments post-Brexit. The UK accounts for 1.3% of total U.S. agricultural exports, with major exports including wine, beer, tree nuts, soybeans, and live animals. The U.S. aims to expand meat exports to the UK, facing trade barriers such as restrictions on hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed poultry. The UK has restrictions on hormone-treated beef, chlorine-washed poultry, and bio-engineered food products. There are mixed signals on allowing imports of genetically engineered U.S. agricultural products. USTR aims to reduce tariffs, eliminate non-tariff barriers, improve TRQ administration, and promote regulatory compatibility for U.S. agricultural trade with the UK. The Trump Administration notified Congress of proposed trade agreement negotiations with the UK on October 16, 2018. Any resulting agreement would likely be subject to ratification by Congress. The World Trade Organization administers rules and agreements among its 164 members to eliminate trade barriers and resolve disputes. The WTO resolves trade disputes through its committee structures and Dispute Settlement Body. The US played a key role in establishing the WTO in 1995. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) aims to reform national agricultural policies, including support, subsidies, and import controls. Developing countries have special rights under the AoA. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) granted developing and least-developed countries special rights in implementing policy commitments, including longer periods to reduce subsidies and improve market access. The Peace Clause provided temporary protection for market-distorting domestic support and export subsidy measures until it expired in January 2004. The AoA was a first step in global market liberalization in the agricultural sector. The impending expiration of the Peace Clause and Article 20's directive led to the launch of the Doha Round of negotiations in 2001. However, the Doha Round failed to reach consensus on reducing tariffs and agricultural subsidies, leading to an impasse since 2009. The WTO's effectiveness in trade liberalization and dispute resolution has been questioned, especially in addressing newer issues like digital trade and services regulations. The Appellate Body is non-functional due to the US blocking nominations. The United States' decision to block WTO nominations has rendered the Body non-functional, lacking a quorum for dispute resolution. USTR prioritizes WTO reform in 2020, supported by some members of Congress. Negotiations in June 2020 may focus on sustainable agricultural production rules and a proposal by the Cairns Group to reduce global agricultural trade distortions by 2030. The US is committed to limiting trade-distorting domestic support spending under the AoA. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) sets rules for countries to determine trade-distorting policies and report costs using the \"Aggregate Measure of Support\" (AMS). Programs can qualify as \"green box\" or \"blue box\" exemptions from spending limits if they meet specific criteria. Since the establishment of the WTO, the United States has generally met its WTO amber box spending commitment. However, in some years, U.S. compliance has relied on de minimis exemptions to exclude certain spending from the amber box limit. U.S. outlays on potentially market-distorting farm programs have been increasing since 2010. No WTO member has challenged these exemptions to date. Since 2010, U.S. farm program spending has been increasing, with outlays averaging $14.6 billion per year from 2011 to 2016. However, recent policy changes, including the 2018 farm bill and trade aid programs in response to trade retaliation, have raised uncertainty about U.S. compliance with WTO rules on domestic support spending. Estimated AMS spending was higher in 2017-2019, reaching $16.5 billion in 2017. The USDA program data shows estimated outlays of $16.5 billion in 2017, with $10.1 billion classified as de minimis exemptions. The addition of MFP \"trade aid\" payments in 2018 and 2019 would push total AMS outlays above the U.S. amber box spending limit. The U.S. compliance with WTO rules on domestic support spending remains uncertain, as past practice may guide the likely notification of spending. The FPDP and ATP programs for 2018 and 2019 are expected to have been implemented similarly. The USDA's FPDP and ATP programs for 2018 and 2019 are expected to have been implemented similarly. Outlays under food purchase and distribution programs are green box compliant, not affecting the U.S.'s ability to meet WTO commitments. MFP payments for 2018 and 2019 may be classified differently based on how payments are made to individual producers. The USDA's MFP payments for 2018 and 2019 were based on farm production and historical data, with 2019 payments tied to planted acres. These payments may be classified differently and could impact U.S. program spending limits. The most recent studies suggest that U.S. program spending may exceed the $19.1 billion limit if commodity prices are depressed. The United States has been involved in numerous WTO dispute cases related to agriculture, with many cases decided in favor of the U.S. In September 2016, the USTR filed a dispute case at the WTO over China's agricultural support policies. The USTR filed a dispute case at the WTO over China's domestic agricultural support policies, alleging they exceeded WTO limits for rice and wheat from 2012 to 2015. China's price support for domestic production incentivized farmers to increase production, displacing imports from the US. In February 2019, the WTO dispute settlement panel found China not in compliance with its WTO commitments. The WTO dispute settlement panel found China not in compliance with its commitments regarding wheat, rice, and corn support policies. Under the U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement, China agreed to respect its WTO obligations and make its domestic support programs transparent. USTR filed another WTO dispute case against China for mismanagement of TRQs for grains. The WTO dispute settlement panel ruled in favor of the United States, stating that China's administration of its TRQs for wheat, rice, and corn was inconsistent with its WTO obligations. China agreed to conform with the WTO panel ruling in the U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement. In May 2018, the United States challenged India at the WTO for inaccurately reporting its market price support for rice and wheat. Subsequently, the US also disputed India's domestic support for cotton, while Australia, Brazil, and Guatemala challenged India's sugar support levels. In February 2019, the US accused India of underreporting market price support for various pulses and lentils. India's market price support for pulses like pigeon peas, black matpe, mung beans, and lentils has exceeded allowable levels of trade-distorting domestic support under WTO commitments. The US has challenged India's support for rice, wheat, cotton, and pulses at WTO meetings. USTR may continue challenging India's domestic support for agriculture at future meetings or through the dispute settlement mechanism. This issue could also arise during U.S.-India trade negotiations. The U.S. may shift towards using domestic trade laws over the WTO in trade negotiations. This could lead to trading partners imposing anti-dumping and countervailing duties instead of using the WTO's dispute settlement process. This shift could have unintended consequences as countries respond to increasing U.S. farm support outlays. The Peace Clause protected WTO members from action against domestic subsidies until it expired in 2004. This led to challenges for U.S. imports, with some countries initiating multiple investigations. Large trade aid payments to the U.S. farm sector have raised concerns about unfair advantages. When facing AD or CVD investigations, the U.S. government and industries can provide evidence to show subsidies were permissible under WTO rules. The United States can challenge AD or CVD rulings under free trade agreements like NAFTA or USMCA. Another option is to bring a claim via the WTO dispute settlement process for violations of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement or the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. However, the WTO Appellate Body lacks judges to issue rulings due to the U.S. blocking appointments. Peru imposes countervailing duties on U.S. ethanol imports, while Colombia imposed preliminary duties on U.S. ethanol in May 2019. In 2018, Peru initiated an investigation into U.S. corn, and China launched an investigation into U.S. sorghum. Trading partners have expanded the scope of U.S. programs considered \"actionable\" for punitive duties, including direct payments to farmers, subsidies for biodiesel and ethanol, and export credit guarantees. In 2019, a European Parliament report suggested potential U.S. actions. The European Parliament report in 2019 raised concerns about the U.S. Environmental Quality Incentives Program being seen as an unfair subsidy to the U.S. farm sector. The United States may face challenges in disputing duties on agricultural products without trade agreements with dispute resolution provisions. SPS measures are regulations to protect human, animal, or plant health from pests, diseases, and contaminants in food. The curr_chunk discusses technical barriers to trade (TBTs) in agriculture, including SPS measures, health and quality standards, testing requirements, and packaging regulations. These measures are addressed in multilateral trade agreements and aim to ensure food safety and public health protection. Countries are encouraged to follow international standards and avoid creating unjustified trade barriers. The curr_chunk discusses U.S. trade concerns related to SPS and TBT issues, including restrictions on agricultural biotechnology, EU prohibitions on hormones in meat production, and disputes over pathogen reduction treatments for poultry. Bilateral and regional FTAs address these matters, reaffirming rights and obligations under WTO agreements and establishing committees for consultation. In the early 2010s, efforts were made to go beyond WTO rules in trade negotiations with the EU and Asia-Pacific countries, introducing \"WTO-Plus\" rules to address SPS concerns and non-tariff trade barriers. This included enhancing regulatory cooperation and addressing specific market access concerns. Efforts in trade negotiations with the EU and Asia-Pacific countries in the early 2010s aimed to go beyond WTO rules by introducing \"WTO-Plus\" rules to address SPS concerns and non-tariff trade barriers, including regulatory cooperation and market access issues. In 2020, statements by USDA and EU officials indicated that SPS barriers and regulatory cooperation could be part of the U.S.-EU Trade Agreement negotiations, with long-standing disputes such as the EU's ban on hormones in meat production potentially being addressed. Non-tariff barriers remain a key focus in U.S. trade agenda discussions. In recent trade agreements like USMCA and the U.S.-China Phase One deal, there have been policy changes regarding SPS and TBT measures that exceed WTO rules and previous U.S. trade agreements. USMCA, for example, emphasizes transparency and encourages harmonization of SPS measures, incorporating enhanced TPP disciplines. Industry representatives believe USMCA sets deadlines for import-related issues. The USMCA and U.S.-China Phase One trade agreements include provisions on import checks, cooperation on agriculture-related measures, and addressing agricultural biotechnology. These agreements go beyond previous trade deals by setting deadlines for import issues and implementing specific protocols. Additionally, U.S. federal agencies regularly address trade concerns related to SPS and TBT measures outside of FTA negotiations. The United States maintains interagency processes to address foreign government standards-related measures that may hinder trade. The USTR-led Trade Policy Staff Committee coordinates these activities with representatives from federal agencies like USDA, DOC, and the State Department. An interagency group chaired by USTR reviews SPS and TBT measures weekly, working with international counterparts on trade concerns. USTR tracks SPS and TBT issues in annual reports, while USDA's Animal... The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) oversees regulatory programs for animal and plant health, quarantine, and pest control. They also manage SPS certification requirements for agricultural goods. Specific SPS and TBT issues may be included in U.S.-EU trade agreement negotiations, such as EU concerns about phytosanitary certificates for U.S. imports of apples and pears. The USDA oversees regulatory programs for animal and plant health, quarantine, and pest control, including SPS certification requirements for agricultural goods. U.S. concerns about EU restrictions on agricultural chemicals, biotechnology, and import requirements for live cattle and animal byproducts. Agricultural biotechnology involves developing plants and animals through genetic techniques for desired characteristics like herbicide tolerance and pest resistance. U.S. producers have adopted genetically engineered varieties of soybean, corn, cotton, and sugar beet. The adoption of genetically engineered crops, particularly in the United States, has been significant since the mid-1990s. While countries like Argentina, Brazil, and India also cultivate GE crops, the EU has strict regulations and public opposition, making it challenging to cultivate and sell GE foods and crops in the region. In the EU, opposition to genetically engineered crops has influenced restrictions in less developed countries. African nations have mostly limited GE crop cultivation to field trials and containment. The U.S. will not regulate plants created through genomic editing if they do not involve plant pests. In contrast, the European Court of Justice considers organisms obtained through mutagenesis as GMOs, subject to regulation under the GMO Directive. The Court views new mutagenic techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 as posing similar risks. China's reluctance to approve GE crops or imports frustrates U.S. agricultural interests. Despite Chinese laws banning their cultivation, U.S.-developed GE varieties are grown in China. In 2016, China agreed to improve its biotechnology approval process and in 2019 approved five new GE traits in imported crops. Changes to regulations on GMO safety assessment, import approval, and labeling were made without notifying the WTO or stakeholders. The U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement aims to establish predictability in trade relations. In the U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement, China agreed to establish a predictable regulatory regime for evaluating agricultural biotechnology. The USMCA includes provisions to improve transparency in approving biotech products. Trade negotiations also address labeling and the presence of unapproved GE products in imports. Congress enacted legislation in 2016 to govern mandatory regulations. In 2016, Congress enacted P.L. 114-216 to govern the mandatory labeling of bioengineered foods. The USDA established the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard for disclosure to consumers. Implementation of the labeling standard began on January 1, 2020, with compliance becoming mandatory on January 1, 2022. The standard does not require labeling for refined products derived from bioengineered crops if modified genetic material is not detectable. Importers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the regulation. The USDA's National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard does not require labeling for refined products derived from bioengineered crops if modified genetic material is not detectable. The new regulation is not expected to disrupt foreign trade and aims to establish a common framework for GE approvals and adoption in U.S. trade negotiations. The USMCA and Phase One trade agreement with China include provisions to improve transparency in approving and bringing to market products of agricultural biotechnology. The Phase One trade agreement with China has led to China agreeing to establish a predictable regulatory regime for evaluating agricultural biotechnology. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, such as wines and agricultural products. GIs can provide commercial value and protection from infringement, but may also hinder trade by protecting common or generic names in one market. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect products like Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and Champagne, ensuring quality and preventing misleading the public. The WTO Agreement on TRIPS obligates countries to recognize and protect GIs as intellectual property, with the US and EU committed to providing a minimum standard of protection for GIs. The United States and EU have differing views on Geographical Indications (GIs), with the US considering some EU GIs as generic terms. This leads to complications in trade, as certain products are protected as GIs in one region but not in another. Laws and regulations governing GIs vary between the US and EU, with over 3,300 product names registered and protected in the EU. Additionally, some EU GIs have been trademarked in non-EU countries. The EU has trademarked some GIs in non-EU countries like Canada and Japan, which could limit U.S. sales in those markets. The EU is also negotiating trade agreements with other U.S. trading partners like Mexico, Australia, and China to protect more GIs. Members of Congress, especially those in the dairy industry, are concerned about the misuse of EU GI protections for market and trade advantages. Some U.S. industry groups are pushing for GI protections for American agricultural products, such as potatoes, maple syrup, and wine. The American Origin Products Association aims to create a list of qualified U.S. distinctive product names. Concerns about GIs may resurface in U.S.-EU trade talks, as seen in the USMCA and U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement. The USMCA and U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement address Geographical Indications (GIs) in ways that could complicate future U.S.-EU discussions. USMCA includes transparency language for GI applications and approvals, along with guidelines for determining customary use terms. The U.S.-China agreement requires China to not undermine market access for U.S. exports and allows the U.S. to raise disagreements regarding GIs. These provisions may clash with potential EU-Mexico and EU-Canada trade agreements. The EU and the United States have a long-standing trade dispute over the EU's ban on hormone-treated meat, leading to retaliatory tariffs imposed by the US in 1999. Despite ongoing WTO proceedings, disagreements persist on legal and procedural issues. In January 2009, USTR announced changes to EU products subject to increased tariffs, leading to an \"escalation\" of the dispute. In May 2009, the US and EU signed a memorandum to resolve the dispute, with the US suspending retaliatory tariffs. The EU agreed to expand market access for US beef raised without hormones as part of its HQB TRQ. The HQB quota is set at 45,000 MT. The EU's HQB quota for hormone-free beef is set at 45,000 MT annually with a 20% tariff. U.S. beef producers have been limited in benefiting from the quota as it is open to other beef-exporting nations. USTR proposed reinstating retaliatory tariffs in 2016 due to the lack of expansion in the U.S.-specific allocation of the HQB import quota. In 2018, the EU agreed to review its HQB quota allocation. The EU agreed to renegotiate its HQB quota with the US in late 2018. Retaliatory tariffs were imposed by the US, but an agreement was reached in June 2019. The US will be allocated 35,000 MT of the 45,000 HQB quota over seven years, starting in 2020. Other exporting countries can access the remaining quota each year. The EU imposes bans on meat produced with hormones and growth promotants, allowing only hormone-free beef imports under the HQB quota. The issue is part of the U.S.-EU trade negotiations, with the U.S. escalating disputes over poultry imports in the past. The EU prohibits the importation of U.S. poultry treated with certain pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs), despite their approval by the USDA and deemed safe by both U.S. and European food safety authorities. The U.S. has requested WTO consultations with the EU on this issue, as the EU argues that their own production and processing rules are more effective in reducing contamination than PRTs. EU consumer groups believe PRTs compensate for poor hygiene in the supply chain. The EU prohibits the importation of U.S. poultry treated with certain pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs), despite their approval by the USDA and deemed safe by both U.S. and European food safety authorities. In 2013, USDA submitted an application for the approval of peroxyacetic acid as a PRT for poultry, but the EU withdrew its proposal in 2015 due to insufficient evidence of its efficacy. The EU lifted its ban on lactic acid for beef PRTs in 2013, and in 2017, the National Pork Producers Council applied for the approval of organic lactic and acetic acid for use on pork carcasses and cuts. The EU and the US have not reached an agreement on the approval of certain pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs) for beef, pork, and poultry. The US considers PRTs crucial for meat safety, while the EU only allows water for decontamination unless approved. EU raised concerns about the efficacy of lactic and acetic acid compared to water treatment. The U.S. and EU are in disagreement over the approval of ractopamine in meat products, which could impact trade negotiations. Despite being approved by the FDA and Codex, many countries ban ractopamine in meat production. This issue has led to restrictions on U.S. meat exports to some major markets. The U.S. faces challenges in exporting meat products containing ractopamine due to restrictions by the EU, China, Taiwan, and Thailand. To overcome these barriers, U.S. meat exports must be raised without ractopamine and certified through USDA's Never Fed Beta Agonists Program. This incurs additional certification and testing costs, impacting competitiveness. USDA and USTR are working to encourage trading partners to accept international standards on ractopamine use. The United States is working with experts to assess ractopamine based on Codex standards. A working group will discuss next steps based on the risk assessment. Increased pork exports to China in 2019 were due to African Swine Fever. An agreement on ractopamine residue limits could boost U.S. pork shipments. The U.S. has shifted from being a net exporter to a net importer of fruits and vegetables. Trade imbalance is influenced by various factors. The trade imbalance in fruit and vegetable exports from the United States, totaling $15.6 billion, is influenced by factors such as open import policies, competition from low-cost producers, non-tariff barriers, exchange rate fluctuations, and structural changes in the food industry. Despite efforts to address these issues through FTAs, unresolved concerns remain, including import competition for seasonal produce. Mexico is the largest foreign supplier of U.S. imports of vegetables and fruits. Production of Mexican fruits and vegetables has increased due to investments in greenhouse facilities and technological innovations. Mexican growers benefit from lower labor costs and subsidies in the specialty crop sector. The specialty crop sector in Mexico benefits from government programs aimed at increasing infrastructure capacity. The Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association claims that Mexico's produce industry receives subsidies, leading to below-market pricing. U.S. growers have trade concerns about imported tomatoes, peppers, and berries. The Trump Administration proposed new rules for seasonal and perishable products in NAFTA renegotiations. The proposal aims to establish a separate domestic industry provision for perishable and seasonal products in AD and CVD proceedings, making it easier for regional producers to initiate injury cases and prove injury, resulting in duties on imported products. This could protect U.S. seasonal produce growers by facilitating trade remedy cases. The USITC has struggled with cases involving perishable agricultural products, as current trade laws are not suited for seasonal products. Support for seasonal produce protections in U.S. trade laws is mixed. Support for seasonal produce protections in U.S. trade laws is mixed, with some Members of Congress in favor and others opposed due to concerns about potential negative impacts on the industry. The Agricultural Technical Advisory Committee for Trade in Fruits and Vegetables (F&V ATAC) supported excluding seasonal provisions in the NAFTA renegotiation. Changes to USMCA in October 2018 did not address seasonal produce trade. Efforts to include such provisions were unsuccessful. Bills were introduced in Congress to address this issue, but USMCA does not include changes to U.S. trade remedy laws for seasonal produce trade. In January 2020, USTR announced plans to investigate Mexico's produce industry and engage USITC and DOC to monitor imports. Some in Congress raised concerns about negative impacts on U.S. growers. Legislation in the 116th Congress (S. 564) would establish a task force to identify subsidies and dumping practices. The U.S.-Mexico Tomato Suspension Agreement suspends the U.S. AD investigation into Mexican fresh tomatoes sold at less than fair value. Suspension agreements have been in place since 1996, with new agreements in 2002, 2008, and 2013. The 2013 agreement requires signatories to sell tomatoes at or above a specified reference price. The 2013 U.S.-Mexico Tomato Suspension Agreement requires signatories to sell fresh tomatoes at or above specified reference prices to counter the injurious effects of exports to the United States. Different floor prices are set for Mexican tomatoes in summer and winter, covering all types of fresh or chilled tomatoes except those for processing. In early 2018, the Department of Commerce (DOC) began consultations with Mexican tomato growers to revise the agreement due to potential dumping concerns, with weighted-average dumping margins calculated at up to 188% in late 2018. In November 2018, the Florida Tomato Exchange requested the United States to withdraw from the suspension agreement due to pricing issues with Mexico. They claimed the agreement failed to prevent Mexico from undercutting U.S. growers, resulting in significant losses for the Florida tomato industry. Despite support from some Members of Congress, other groups opposed the withdrawal, citing Mexico's wider variety of tomatoes as appealing to consumers. The Department of Commerce initially announced its intention to withdraw from the agreement in February 2019. In February 2019, the Department of Commerce announced its intention to withdraw from the agreement with Mexico regarding fresh tomatoes due to pricing issues. The United States terminated the 2013 agreement in May 2019, imposing tariffs on Mexican tomatoes. Mexican tomato growers filed a suit against the tariffs, claiming it would cost the industry over $350 million annually. USITC resumed its investigation, finding that U.S. growers are threatened by imports. Discussions for a possible revised agreement took place between May and September 2019. On September 19, 2019, the Department of Commerce (DOC) signed a new suspension agreement with Mexico's tomato growers and exporters, suspending their respective investigations. The agreement includes increased minimum prices for specialty and organic tomatoes, as well as new inspection requirements to prevent low-quality tomatoes from entering the United States. Concerns have arisen about a virus in Mexican tomatoes potentially harming U.S.-grown tomatoes and peppers, leading to increased inspections causing border delays and complaints from Mexican officials. In 2019, the United States returned 43 tomato shipments at the U.S.-Mexico border, which was deemed \"unjustified.\" In Canada, provincial governments have the authority to import and distribute alcohol. British Columbia implemented policies giving BC wine exclusive access to retail channels, while Quebec streamlined approval for Quebec wines, allowing small producers to bypass the provincial liquor board. In Canada, provincial governments have authority over alcohol imports and distribution. British Columbia has policies favoring BC wine in retail, while Quebec allows small wine producers to bypass regulations. The U.S. initiated trade action against Canada over BC wine measures, claiming they unfairly exclude American wine from grocery stores. Canada is a significant export market for California wine, with $448 million in sales in 2018. The US has raised concerns about Canada's BC wine measures, stating they unfairly exclude American wine from grocery store shelves. The USMCA includes a side letter addressing these concerns, with Canada agreeing to modify certain measures by November 1, 2019. However, potential market barriers to US wine in Quebec and Ontario remain unresolved. Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and the EU have joined the consultation on this issue at the WTO. In 2019, U.S. livestock and poultry exports totaled $24.1 billion, with imports at $14.2 billion. Recent trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan will boost exports to these markets, accounting for 65% of total U.S. exports. The U.S.-Japan agreement reduces tariffs on beef and pork products, benefiting American livestock producers. The U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement aims to expand market access for meat products regulated by the USDA, with exports expected to reach 17% of domestic production in 2020. Foreign countries occasionally impose bans on U.S. meat exports due to animal disease outbreaks, causing disruptions for producers and exporters. For instance, bans were placed on U.S. beef exports in 2003 following the discovery of mad cow disease. The discovery of BSE in 2003 and HPAI outbreaks in 2014-2015 led to export bans on U.S. poultry products by over 30 countries. OIE established trade protocols for disease outbreaks in exporting countries, recommending against total export bans for BSE or HPAI. The U.S. was deemed at \"negligible risk\" for BSE by OIE in 2013, and USDA implemented measures for HPAI surveillance. The USDA has implemented increased flock biosecurity measures to contain and eradicate outbreaks of HPAI. Some foreign markets imposed total bans on U.S. beef exports after the 2003 BSE incident, while others imposed specific conditions like age restrictions. Similarly, during the HPAI outbreak, some markets banned poultry exports entirely, while others only banned exports from affected regions, following OIE regionalization protocols. China lifted the ban on U.S. beef in 2017 but continued to restrict imports to cattle under 30 months of age. However, under the U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement, China agreed to eliminate the cattle age restriction, recognize the U.S. traceability system, adopt MRLs for certain hormones, and follow Codex guidelines. In 2019, U.S. beef exports to China totaled 10,507 MT valued at $85.3 million. China also lifted its ban on U.S. poultry meat imports in November 2019, allowing exports from approved plants. The U.S. and China agreed to accept regionalization during poultry disease outbreaks and follow OIE guidelines. Analysts predict U.S. poultry exports to China could reach $1 billion, surpassing the previous record of $750 million in 2008. China's hog industry was severely impacted by African Swine Fever in 2019. In 2019, U.S. pork exports to China more than doubled to $1.3 billion due to African Swine Fever impacting China's hog industry. Under the U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement, China is increasing the number of U.S. pork products eligible for import. Currently, 33 countries can export meat and poultry to the U.S., with APHIS conducting risk assessments for foreign animal diseases. FSIS ensures foreign meat inspection systems are equivalent to U.S. standards for sanitation and public health. In August 2013, FSIS confirmed China's poultry processing inspection system as equivalent to the U.S. system, allowing China to export cooked poultry meat sourced from the U.S. or eligible countries. FSIS recommended moving forward with verifying equivalency for China's poultry slaughter inspection system in March 2016. In August 2017, FSIS confirmed China's poultry processing system remained equivalent. In November 2019, FSIS determined China's poultry slaughter system as equivalent, allowing China to export fully cooked poultry meat to the United States. China is not permitted to export raw poultry products due to animal disease risks. The process began in 2005 when China requested USDA to evaluate its poultry inspection system, which was halted in FY2006 by Congress. The possibility of importing poultry meat from China has raised concerns among food safety advocates and some Members of Congress. The import of poultry meat from China has raised concerns due to lax food safety enforcement. Legislation prohibits USDA from purchasing Chinese poultry products for feeding programs. The U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement addresses food safety concerns regarding imported poultry meat from China. The U.S. evaluates regional avian influenza status in China for poultry meat imports under the Phase One trade agreement. APHIS assesses regions for AI-free status, allowing export if equivalency standards are met. Imports of animals or products are restricted from countries with infectious diseases like foot-and-mouth disease in Brazil and Argentina. In 2013, APHIS proposed a rule to allow fresh beef imports from Brazil. In 2014, a separate rule was proposed for Patagonia and northern Argentina. In 2015, final rules were released for fresh beef imports from these regions. USDA risk assessments deemed it safe to import fresh beef from Brazil and Argentina without jeopardizing the US's FMD-free status. Some industry stakeholders oppose this due to concerns about the countries' FMD status. The USDA approved fresh beef imports from Brazil and Argentina despite concerns about Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD). FMD was eradicated in the US in 1929, and reintroduction could be economically devastating. Brazil's beef inspection system was deemed equivalent to the US's in 2015. Brazil began shipping fresh beef to the US in 2016, but imports were suspended in 2017 due to inspection issues. The United States lifted the suspension on imports of raw, intact beef from Brazil on February 21, 2020. FSIS released an on-site audit report addressing corrective actions taken by Brazil. Raw beef imports from Brazil will undergo re-inspection at U.S. points of entry by FSIS. In September 2019, FSIS conducted an on-site audit of Argentina's meat inspection system and planned further audits to ensure corrective actions were implemented. Japan is a major market for U.S. beef and pork exports, with exports totaling $2 billion and $1.5 billion respectively in 2019. Competition from TPP-11 member nations like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Mexico, who have preferential tariff treatment with Japan, has impacted U.S. exports. U.S. beef faced a higher tariff rate of 38.5% compared to TPP-11 members' 26.6% in 2019. The USJTA has aligned the tariff on U.S. beef with the TPP-11 agreement. Under the USJTA, Japan's tariffs on U.S. beef and pork are aligned with TPP-11 rates, gradually decreasing until reaching 9% for beef and 1.9% for pork in year 9. U.S. beef and pork exports are not subject to Japan's WTO safeguards but have U.S.-specific safeguards. Japan will terminate the beef safeguard measure if it does not trigger for four consecutive years. The USJTA aligns Japan's tariffs on U.S. beef and pork with TPP-11 rates, gradually decreasing until reaching 9% for beef and 1.9% for pork in year 9. Japan will terminate the beef safeguard measure if it does not trigger for four consecutive years after year 14 of the agreement. The U.S. pork safeguard will trigger if imports exceed 112% of the largest volume in the previous three years and will terminate after year 10. US meat exports to Japan are expected to increase under the agreement. The USJTA also benefits dairy producers by lowering tariffs and expanding TRQs. Under the U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement, China will streamline regulations to boost U.S. dairy and infant formula trade. Canada's dairy sector restricts imports with high tariffs, hindering U.S. dairy exports. U.S. milk producers have found success exporting ultra-filtered milk to Canada for use in dairy products like cheese and yogurt. Canada's revised cheese standards reduced U.S. milk product exports to Canadian food manufacturers. The surplus of skim milk led to the adoption of Class 7 milk pricing, making Canadian skim milk products cheaper. This resulted in increased global exports of skim milk powder from Canada, causing U.S. producers to lose exports of high-protein UF milk to Canadian processors. Under USMCA, Canada agreed to eliminate the Class 7 pricing regime, which had led to a decline in U.S. UF milk exports to Canadian cheese and yogurt processors. The value of U.S. UF milk exports to Canada dropped from nearly $107 million in 2015 to $32 million in 2018. Canada's exports of SMP more than tripled in 2017 to $133 million after the Class 7 regime was implemented. Under the USMCA agreement, Canada would expand TRQs for U.S. dairy products, granting duty-free access to nearly 17,000 MT in the first year, 100,000 MT in the sixth year, and 109,000 MT in year 19. The agreement also includes establishing TRQs for imports of Canadian dairy products by the United States. The USJTA agreement aims to improve the competitive position of U.S. dairy producers in Japan by reducing and eventually eliminating tariffs over 15 years. Japan also established a specific TRQ for U.S. whey products, increasing from 5,400 MT to 9,000 MT in year 10. The US-Japan Trade Agreement (USJTA) aims to eliminate tariffs on over-quota exports in five years and phase out tariffs on other dairy products gradually. \"Stage One\" of the agreement became effective on January 1, 2020. However, the lack of provisions on non-tariff measures like Geographical Indications (GIs) could hinder U.S. cheese exports to Japan. Additional negotiations for a more comprehensive agreement are expected in 2020. In 2019, China was the third-largest market for U.S. dairy exports, but retaliatory tariffs led to a 25% decrease in trade compared to 2018. Under the U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement, China is to streamline regulatory processes for U.S. dairy exports, accept dairy products from FDA-approved facilities, and acknowledge the safety standards of the U.S. dairy regulatory system. Technical discussions between China's General Administration of Customs and the FDA will address FDA guidance on dairy products and melamine in Chinese milk imports. China will also simplify the import approval process for infant formula. The U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement entered into force on February 14, 2020. In December 2014, the Department of Commerce signed suspension agreements with Mexico to prevent the imposition of countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties on Mexican sugar imports to the U.S. This was due to government determinations of subsidies and unfair pricing. The agreements limit Mexico's sugar exports to the U.S. based on domestic needs, establish minimum reference prices, and restrict the share of Mexican sugar entering the U.S. After the suspension agreements with Mexico, concerns were raised in the U.S. sugar market about the agreements not fully addressing the issues caused by Mexican sugar subsidization and dumping. Criticisms included inadequate sugar share for cane refiners dependent on Mexican imports and Mexican exporters not always following import limits and reference prices. In 2016, the American Sugar Coalition urged the Department of Commerce to withdraw from the agreements. In response to concerns about the U.S. sugar market, the Department of Commerce considered withdrawing from agreements with Mexico due to issues with sugar subsidization and dumping. The agreements were criticized for not fully addressing the problems, leading to calls for renegotiation. In 2017, amendments were made to the agreements, increasing the price of imported Mexican raw sugar. In 2017, the price of imported Mexican raw sugar was increased from $0.2225 per pound to $0.23 per pound, and imported refined sugar from $0.26 per pound to $0.28 per pound. The maximum share of refined sugar imports was limited to 30%, with raw sugar imports constituting at least 70% of the total. Any raw sugar imports that are packaged would be counted toward the refined sugar allotment. In October 2019, the U.S. Court of International Trade voided the 2017 suspension agreements due to recordkeeping issues during negotiations. CSC Sugar LLC sued over changes in the sugar purity definition in the agreement, leading to a ruling that reinstated the 2014 provisions. A new agreement in 2020 limited Mexican sugar imports to 1,004,726 short tons with refined sugar capped at 30%. CSC Sugar LLC filed another lawsuit to block the new agreements between the US and Mexico."
