The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a new section on pediatric labeling of drugs and biological products. A person submitting an application for a new drug or biological product must include assessments containing data to evaluate safety and effectiveness. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a new section on pediatric labeling of drugs and biological products. Applicants must provide data on the effectiveness and safety of the drug for pediatric subpopulations. The Secretary may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from studies in adults, with the option to defer submission of assessments until after approval if the drug is ready for adult use before pediatric studies are complete. The Secretary may grant a full waiver of submitting assessments if necessary studies are impossible. The applicant must provide a certified description of planned studies and evidence of due diligence in conducting them. The Secretary may grant a full waiver of submitting assessments if necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical, or if there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups. Additionally, a partial waiver can be granted if the drug does not provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients and is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients. The Secretary may grant a partial waiver of submitting assessments for a specific pediatric age group if necessary studies are impossible, there is evidence of ineffectiveness or safety concerns, the drug lacks therapeutic benefit over existing therapies, and is unlikely to be used in that age group. The Secretary may grant a waiver if studies for a specific pediatric age group are impossible, the drug is ineffective or unsafe, lacks therapeutic benefit over existing therapies, and is unlikely to be used in that age group. If a waiver is granted, the information must be included in the drug labeling. The Secretary may require the submission of assessments for drugs used in pediatric patients if inadequate labeling poses risks, or if there are concerns about the drug. The Secretary may require assessments for drugs in pediatric patients if inadequate labeling poses risks or if there are concerns about the drug. A full waiver can be granted if necessary studies are impossible or if there is strong evidence suggesting therapeutic benefits over existing therapies for pediatric patients. The Secretary may grant a partial waiver for submitting assessments on a specific pediatric age group if necessary studies are impossible, there is strong evidence of ineffectiveness or safety concerns, or if the drug lacks meaningful therapeutic benefits. The Secretary may grant a full or partial waiver for pediatric age group assessments if the drug does not offer significant therapeutic benefits, is unlikely to be used by many pediatric patients, or if there are no significant risks due to inadequate labeling. If a drug is deemed ineffective or unsafe for pediatric use, a waiver can be granted, and this information must be included in the drug's labeling. No assessment is required for a drug with an approved application unless the Secretary requests pediatric studies. If a drug is considered unsafe or ineffective for pediatric use, a waiver can be granted, and this must be noted in the drug's labeling. If the recipient does not agree to a written request or the Secretary does not receive a response, certain conditions apply under section 505A(d) or section 409I of the Public Health Service Act. If a person delays the submission of assessments for a drug or biological product, the Secretary may consider the product unsafe or ineffective for pediatric use. This does not affect the Secretary's authority under section 505A(d)(4) or section 409I of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary may consider a product misbranded and subject to action under sections 302 and 304 if assessments are delayed. This delay cannot be used as a basis for withdrawing approval for a drug or revoking a license for a biological product. The Secretary is required to meet with the sponsor during the investigational new drug process to discuss pediatric study plans and any requests for waivers or deferrals. Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include assessments required under section 505B. Section 505A(h) is also amended to specify Pediatric Study Requirements. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include pediatric studies in drug license applications. Manufacturers are required to assess the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and biological products in pediatric populations. The amendment made by subsection (a) requires manufacturers to assess the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and biological products in pediatric patients. Section 505B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not affect the Secretary of Health and Human Services' existing authority to require pediatric assessments. Technical correction made to Section 505A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by amending subsections (b)(2) and (c)(2) to replace \"505(j)(4)(B)\" with \"505(j)(5)(B)\"."
