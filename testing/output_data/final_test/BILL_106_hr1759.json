The Congress finds that the Hanford Reach area of the Columbia River is vital for fall Chinook salmon, wildlife habitat, waterfowl sanctuary, and recreational opportunities. Activities along the Hanford Reach are prohibited to protect the environment. Proper management of the surrounding lands is necessary to preserve resources and access. The Vernita Bar Agreement has enhanced salmon habitat along the Hanford Reach, preserving its unique values. Efforts are being made to better integrate management laws and regulations for more efficient use of resources and improved habitat and recreation management. Federal financial resources are also being considered. A cooperative partnership among Federal, State, and local entities is sought to manage habitat and wildlife, maintain recreational opportunities, and protect resources in the Hanford Reach area. This partnership aims to ensure long-term protection of plant, fish, wildlife, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources through public input and responsible management. The formation of a commission is recommended by Congress to manage the Hanford Reach area, ensuring protection of the river as wild, scenic, and accessible. The commission will consist of Federal, State, and local members with equal decision-making authority.
