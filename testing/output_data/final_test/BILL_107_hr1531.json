    "content": "The \"Cell Phone Service Disclosure Act of 2001\" aims to address consumer complaints about wireless telephone service quality by monitoring and compiling complaints at a federal level. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to establish a complaint system for subscribers of commercial mobile services to report issues with quality or performance, including connection, reception, and billing practices. This system includes a toll-free number for reporting complaints. The FCC and designated agencies must use '#FCC' as the number for reporting complaints about commercial mobile services. The Commission will keep records of complaints, and providers must include a statement in each subscriber's bill. The FCC requires complaints about commercial mobile services to be reported using '#FCC'. Providers must include information on how to file a complaint in each subscriber's bill. The Commission will publicize the complaint system availability and report complaints to Congress every 6 months. The FCC mandates reporting of complaints for commercial mobile services, including details on types of complaints like dead spots, dropped calls, network issues, and billing problems, for each provider in metropolitan areas and other designated regions. Reports are submitted to Congress every 6 months. The Commission must publicly release each report submitted to Congress through a website. The amendment made by section 3 will take effect after a 6-month period from the enactment of the Act. The Commission will issue necessary regulations to implement the amendment by section 3 before the effective date."
