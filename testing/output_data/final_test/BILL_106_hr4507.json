    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transit Rail Access Improvement and Needs Act for the 21st Century.\" It includes findings related to transit rail access. The Congress recognizes the importance of modern fixed guideway transportation for metropolitan areas, the need for development and expansion of transportation systems, and the value of utilizing existing railroad infrastructure for minimal environmental disruption. Voluntary negotiations between transportation authorities and rail carriers have not been sufficient for developing efficient fixed guideway transportation systems. SEC. 3. RAIL TRANSIT ACCESS. Amends Part E of subtitle V of title 49, United States Code, by adding a new chapter titled \"CHAPTER 285--RAIL TRANSIT ACCESS.\" Chapter 285 of Title 49, United States Code, titled \"Rail Transit Access,\" defines key terms such as the Surface Transportation Board, fixed guideway transportation, mass transportation authority, and rail carrier. The curr_chunk defines terms related to rail transportation, including rail carrier, segregated fixed guideway facility, and trackage. It also discusses the shared use of rail carrier trackage by mass transportation authorities. The Board can order a rail carrier to make trackage available for fixed guideway transportation if agreement cannot be reached, with compensation based on the carrier's incremental cost. Service quality must be considered when determining compensation. The Board considers service quality when determining compensation for using trackage. It can prescribe terms for train operations, speeds, and maintenance levels. If a rail carrier and mass transportation authority disagree on terms, they can seek Board intervention. The Board can order a rail carrier to allow additional trains to operate under reasonable terms. A mass transportation authority can request increased maintenance on trackage, and the Board can order the rail carrier to provide it if deemed reasonable. The Board can order a rail carrier to allow accelerated speeds for trains operated by a mass transportation authority. The Board will determine the safety and feasibility of accelerated speeds and required improvements. Maximum allowable speeds will be set by the Board on reasonable terms. Emergency fixed guideway transportation provided by a mass transportation authority has preference over freight transportation on rail lines, junctions, or crossings unless the Board orders otherwise. If a rail carrier is affected, they can apply to the Board for relief. The Board will make a final determination within 120 days. The mass transportation authority can apply to the Board for an order to acquire a railroad right-of-way for a fixed guideway facility if negotiations with a rail carrier fail. The Board must order the conveyance if it does not significantly affect rail freight traffic, the authority covers relocation costs, and the purpose is for fixed guideway transportation. The mass transportation authority can seek Board approval to acquire a railroad right-of-way for a fixed guideway facility if negotiations with a rail carrier are unsuccessful. The conveyance ordered by the Board must meet the fixed guideway transportation purpose and be subject to just compensation and other terms prescribed by the Board. Operations or conveyances under this order are not subject to Board review or approval under subtitle IV of this title. Rail transportation providers retain the right to enter into contracts allocating financial responsibility for claims. The Board shall utilize principles, standards, and precedents from proceedings involving the National Railroad Passenger Corporation in proceedings under sections 28502 and 28503. Conforming amendments include limitations on rail passenger transportation liability and additions to the table of chapters in title 49, United States Code. The Board will use principles, standards, and precedents from National Railroad Passenger Corporation proceedings in sections 28502 and 28503. This includes amendments on rail transit access and liability limitations."
