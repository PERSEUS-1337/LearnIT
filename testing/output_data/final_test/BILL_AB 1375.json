    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1205 of the Penal Code in California is amended. Section 1205 of the Penal Code in California is amended to include provisions for imprisonment until fines are satisfied, with credit given for each day in custody. The defendant may be directed to pay a fine within a limited time or in installments, with the possibility of imprisonment in case of default, as per a misdemeanor judgment. As a condition of probation, the defendant must pay fines to the court clerk or judge, with payments made while in custody going to the holding officer. Any default in payment will result in immediate arrest and a show cause order for imprisonment until the fine is fully satisfied. If the fine or installment is not paid immediately, the court will commit the defendant to custody until the payment is made in full. (c) This section applies to violations of state codes or statutes punishable by fine or imprisonment. \n(d) The clerk of the court can transfer accounts to another department or agency for collection. The defendant must pay a fee for processing installment accounts to the court or collecting agency, determined by administrative costs. The fee for accounts not paid in installments should not exceed a proportional basis to any fine imposed. If the total days in custody exceed the term of imprisonment, the entire term is considered served. Days credited to the defendant are first applied to the imprisonment term, then to any fines imposed. For the purposes of this section, credit for custody is only given for proceedings related to the same conduct as the conviction. The term of imprisonment includes any period of imprisonment imposed as a condition of probation or ordered by a court, prior to discharge. The court determines dates of admission and release from custody, credits days in the abstract of judgment. Agencies must apply credit between sentencing and delivery. Time in specified facilities qualifies as mandatory jail time. Notwithstanding other sentencing provisions, this section does not authorize."
