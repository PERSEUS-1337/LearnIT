The Center conducts a research program on deployment-related health issues, making grants based on Requests for Applications. Research follows core principles including scientific peer-review, dissemination of results, and collaboration. The Center's core functions include research coordination, synthesis of research for policy recommendations, review of veterans' health, use of national data resources, and communication of research results. The Governing Board for the Center must submit an annual report to Congress detailing the Center's activities and proposed budget for the next fiscal year. Funds for the Center will be provided through a discrete appropriation, with separate allocations for core functions and Center-initiated research. Deployment-related health issues are defined in Section 106.

This also includes conditions from pre-deployment inoculations for protection. Establishment of Centers for Research on Post-Deployment Illnesses in Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs will establish National Centers for Military Post-Deployment Illness Research to conduct research, education, and clinical activities related to health conditions associated with military deployment missions. These centers will collaborate with Department facilities and focus on studying post-deployment illnesses. The Department of Veterans Affairs will establish National Centers for Military Post-Deployment Illness Research to conduct research, education, and clinical activities related to health conditions associated with military deployment missions. The Secretary will designate up to 25 centers for research, education, and innovative clinical activities in various geographic regions. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs will establish up to 25 National Centers for Military Post-Deployment Illness Research in different regions of the United States. The Secretary's authority to establish these centers is contingent upon the availability of funds. Health-care facilities must meet high scientific and clinical standards to be designated as a center location, including having an arrangement with an accredited medical school for education and training in post-deployment health issues. The establishment of National Centers for Military Post-Deployment Illness Research by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs includes criteria such as education and training in post-deployment illnesses, involvement of nursing or allied health personnel, attracting scientists for research, and a policymaking advisory committee for guidance. The Under Secretary establishes a panel of experts to assess proposals for new post-deployment illness research centers. Panel members serve as consultants for up to six months and provide their views on the scientific and clinical merit of each proposal to the Under Secretary. The Under Secretary establishes a panel of experts to assess proposals for new post-deployment illness research centers. The panel evaluates the scientific and clinical merit of each proposal and is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Funding for the centers is authorized to be appropriated as necessary, with priority given to activities of clinical and scientific investigation. The Under Secretary establishes a panel of experts to assess proposals for new post-deployment illness research centers. Funding from the account is awarded to projects for research in post-deployment illnesses.
