They can be securities, currencies, or commodities, and must adhere to applicable laws and regulations. Unlike traditional assets recorded by central intermediaries, ownership and exchanges of digital assets are recorded on a decentralized digital ledger. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a role in regulating digital assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities offers, sales, and investment activities involving digital assets. Not all digital assets are securities; a security involves investment in a common enterprise with profit expectations from others' efforts. Market intermediaries in digital asset investment may also be subject to securities regulation. Bitcoin is not considered a security due to its lack of a central third-party common enterprise. Securities regulations apply to intermediaries engaged in security-based digital asset transactions or using digital assets to facilitate securities transactions. The report focuses on digital assets subject to securities regulation, discussing objectives, SEC initiatives addressing regulatory challenges, and policy issues for consideration in areas like initial coin offerings and digital asset trading. Securities regulation applies to all securities and intermediaries, digital or traditional. The SEC was established by Congress to regulate capital markets and securities after the 1929 stock market crash. The regulatory framework aims to promote disclosure, fair dealing, and prevent fraud. The SEC's mission is to protect investors, maintain market efficiency, and facilitate capital formation. The Securities Act of 1933 is a key law for securities regulation, known as the \"truth in securities\" law. The Securities Act of 1933, known as the \"truth in securities\" law, requires disclosures to help investors make informed decisions about purchasing securities. The SEC does not provide investment recommendations but focuses on ensuring transparency in the market. The regulatory philosophy is based on the idea that sunlight is the best disinfectant. Securities regulators have adapted to new technologies in the past, such as the revolution in securities trading platforms in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Securities trading platforms underwent a significant revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, transitioning from manual settlements to electronic platforms. Congress amended the Securities Exchange Act to establish a national market system, aiming to promote efficient, competitive, fair, and orderly markets. Despite the rapid evolution of digital assets as a capital market innovation, the SEC has not actively introduced new digital-asset-specific rules, citing the uncertainty of how these assets will evolve and the potential inefficiency of highly prescriptive regulations. The SEC's regulatory framework for traditional and digital securities includes various acts from the 1930s and 1940s. They have also established the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub) to engage in fintech and address regulatory issues related to digital assets. Enforcement actions have been taken against securities token issuers. The SEC has taken enforcement actions against securities token issuers and digital asset traders. They established a Cyber Unit to monitor and enforce illicit cyber-based transactions. The SEC issued a no-action letter to TurnKey Jet, stating its tokens are not securities, sparking industry discussions. They also solicited public input on digital asset custody challenges in March 2019. The SEC is seeking public input on digital asset custody challenges to understand industry issues and assess investor-protection risks. They also review new digital asset products for approval, such as Bitcoin ETF proposals, which have been consistently rejected. The growing presence of digital assets in capital markets raises policy questions about regulatory oversight, achieving a level playing field, and protecting investors while fostering innovation. Understanding innovative trends and timing policy actions are crucial for effective digital asset regulation. In the context of digital asset regulation, policy actions are crucial. Society often underestimates the long-term effects of technological changes. The balance between social pressure for change and policy responses is delicate. Key examples of digital asset developments and use cases are discussed, focusing on securities regulation issues. Regulatory oversight and investor protection are significant concerns, as digital asset issuers and investors navigate complex regulatory landscapes. The classification of digital assets as securities subject to SEC regulation is often unclear. The SEC, CFTC, IRS, state regulators, and FinCEN apply different regulatory approaches to digital assets. Investor protection is a concern due to scams and fraud in the digital asset market. The digital asset market faces high levels of scams and business failures, with a significant percentage of ICOs being scams or failing for operational reasons. Many digital asset companies offering securities do not comply with SEC regulations, potentially impacting investors' understanding of risks. The volatility of digital assets can lead to significant gains or losses, which may not be well understood by all investors. Additionally, digital assets operate outside the traditional financial system, lacking common transaction protections like those offered by banks. Businesses raise funding through securities offerings like stocks, bonds, and digital assets, including ICOs where projects sell digital tokens for fiat currency or cryptocurrency. ICOs are compared to IPOs as methods of acquiring funding, with the main difference being that ICO investors receive digital assets instead of equity stakes. These tokens are new digital currencies created and sold by companies to the public. Security tokens or tokens are new digital currencies created and sold by companies to the public. Purchasers can use them for goods/services or hold them as investments. Industry practitioners are using the term security token offerings (STOs) to describe ICOs, reflecting the acceptance that many ICOs are subject to securities laws. ICOs can be listed on national exchanges or issued as private offerings. ICOs can be conducted as public offerings or private securities offerings, with different operational and regulatory conditions depending on the type of offering chosen. While ICOs have utilized private exemptions like Regulation D and Regulation Crowdfunding, no ICOs have been issued as public offerings as of year-end 2019. Regulatory oversight and investor protection concerns also apply to ICOs, with about 300 platforms offering digital asset trading as \"exchanges\" as of December 2019. Digital asset trading platforms that qualify as securities must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or obtain exemption. Many platforms are registered as money-transmission services instead, which are subject to state regulations. This raises concerns about investor protection and insufficient regulation for digital asset trading activities. The SEC issued a statement in 2018 warning that online platforms for buying and selling digital assets could be unlawful. Some digital asset trading platforms face issues with fraud and manipulation. There are debates about applying SEC regulation to these platforms, with concerns about stifling financial innovation. While some platforms trading digital assets behave similarly to national securities exchanges, differences exist, such as blockchain-enabled platforms operating without a central database. Regulatory oversight for digital assets should balance with fostering financial innovation, according to domestic and international securities regulators. Regulatory oversight for digital asset trading platforms should balance with fostering financial innovation. Differences between digital asset exchanges and SEC regulated national securities exchanges may include transparency, fairness, and efficiency. Policymakers historically focus on addressing risk concerns while adapting regulatory frameworks to evolving technology. Many digital asset exchanges are suspected of inflating trading volumes to attract more participants, raising concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. Studies have shown that a significant portion of Bitcoin's trading volume is fake or non-economic, highlighting the potential damage of market manipulation in the digital asset space. A single market manipulator may have fueled half of Bitcoin's 2017 price surge. The largest digital asset exchange, Bitfinex, and stablecoin Tether allegedly manipulated Bitcoin's price surge in 2017, facing a $1.4 trillion damages claim. Despite denying the accusations, they are under investigation by regulators, prompting calls for more investor protection in digital asset trading. The effectiveness of SEC regulation in preventing market manipulation in digital asset trading remains uncertain. The SEC took its first enforcement action against an unregistered digital asset exchange in 2018, stating that the platform failed to register despite operating like a national securities exchange. Some major exchanges have developed a system to rate digital assets based on their likelihood of being classified as securities. Investors are at risk due to lack of oversight in digital asset trading. Some digital asset exchanges are trying to avoid being classified as securities by self-regulating and seeking exemptions from the SEC to operate as alternative trading systems. This is part of a growing discussion in the industry about self-regulation and regulatory oversight. Some digital asset exchanges, like Coinbase and Gemini, have obtained state-level regulatory licenses to meet compliance requirements. Custodians provide safekeeping of financial assets without legal ownership. The SEC's custody rules require custodians to protect client assets from loss or misappropriation. Custodians, like BNY Mellon and J.P. Morgan, hold around $114 trillion of global assets. Digital-asset custody faces unique challenges under these rules designed for traditional assets. Digital assets lack physical existence or records like traditional assets. Safeguarding private keys is common practice in the digital asset industry. Defining possession or control of digital assets for regulatory purposes is a challenge. Regulators are evaluating if custody requirements should be adjusted. Regulators are evaluating custody requirements for digital assets due to their unique operational characteristics. The SEC and FINRA issued a joint statement outlining considerations for digital asset securities custody, acknowledging the challenges and soliciting input from market participants. Some industry practitioners are exploring the possibility of incorporating digital assets into ETF structures. Retail investors currently cannot directly purchase digital assets from SEC-regulated national securities exchanges, but there are proposals to allow them to buy or sell digital assets on regulated exchanges through ETFs. Some industry practitioners are considering incorporating digital assets into ETF structures, allowing retail investors to buy or sell digital assets through ETFs on regulated exchanges. Bitcoin ETFs, although Bitcoin itself is not a security, would be securities products subject to securities regulation. Despite numerous proposals, the SEC has not approved a Bitcoin ETF as of the end of 2019. The SEC has not approved a Bitcoin ETF as of the end of 2019 due to concerns about market manipulation, valuation, pricing, custody, and liquidity. The agency stated that proposals did not meet standards governing national securities exchanges. Bitcoin ETFs have supporters who argue they provide a familiar and convenient way for investors to participate in digital asset trading. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce believes certain Bitcoin ETF proposals meet statutory requirements and their disapproval may hinder innovation. Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by linking it to other assets. Stablecoins like Facebook's Libra proposal have sparked policy concerns and discussions on global stablecoins. The components of a stablecoin arrangement are complex, involving entities issuing stablecoins, managing linked assets, transferring coins, market participants, and governance structures. The governance structure and policy concerns surrounding stablecoins, including market integrity, investor protection, financial stability, monetary policy, payments, and illicit activity prevention, have attracted regulatory attention. Facebook's Libra stablecoin proposal raised questions about its classification as an ETF and regulatory oversight. Regulatory authorities, including securities regulators, central banks, payment system regulators, and financial crime enforcement entities, are involved in monitoring stablecoins. Libra's proposed operational structure is being compared to ETFs, with questions arising about its classification as an ETF and regulatory oversight. If deemed an ETF, SEC approval would be required for launch. The SEC is evaluating whether Libra's structure qualifies it as an ETF. The Financial Services committee discussed stablecoin-related securities proposals at an October 2019 House Committee on Financial Services hearing. The Managed Stablecoins are Securities Act of 2019 (H.R. 5197) aims to subject stablecoins to securities regulation by creating a new category of securities called \"managed stablecoins.\" This bill defines managed stablecoins as digital assets whose value is tied to a pool of assets managed by individuals. The bill aims to classify managed stablecoins as securities, subjecting them to securities regulation. Another proposal restricts public company executives from owning managed stablecoins. Additionally, the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act would prevent large tech firms from offering financial services or issuing digital assets."
