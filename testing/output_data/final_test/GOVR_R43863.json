    "content": "The report focuses on federal spending for low-income populations, excluding social insurance programs like Social Security and Medicare. It aims to provide information on programs targeting low-income individuals and communities, extending the analysis through FY2013. The report examines federal programs that provide benefits and services to low-income individuals, funded through general revenues. These programs target limited income individuals through eligibility criteria or funding allocation formulas, aiming to alleviate the effects of low income by offering cash or noncash benefits to meet basic needs. Federal programs aim to alleviate the effects of low income by providing cash or noncash benefits to help meet basic needs like food, housing, and health care. They also address root causes of economic disadvantage through education, training, and other services to improve employability and earnings capacity. Some programs target assistance to communities with high concentrations of low-income people to compensate for their low tax capacities and help finance benefits and services. These programs are diverse in purpose, design, and target population, established at different times and in response to various policy challenges. Generalizing about these programs or drawing conclusions should be done with caution. The report discusses various social welfare programs, including public assistance and income-tested programs that provide cash or in-kind benefits to low-income individuals. The categories of programs are diverse, such as health care for poor children and nursing home services. Some programs target assistance to specific communities without applying income tests to individual participants. The health category includes primary care for poor children and nursing home care for the elderly and disabled. Cash aid includes traditional welfare, pensions for needy veterans, and tax credits for households with earnings. Food assistance includes SNAP and subsidized meals for low-income schoolchildren and the elderly. The programs serve a diverse range of individuals, including elderly, disabled, children, families, single adults, veterans, homeless people, refugees, and students. The report highlights that people with disabilities are the largest beneficiaries of low-income programs, followed by families with working adults and the elderly. Programs serve a diverse population with limited income, not just those below the federal poverty guidelines. The report discusses federal spending trends for low-income programs from FY2008 to FY2013, covering categories like health care, cash aid, and food assistance. It analyzes spending trends for the 10 largest programs, which accounted for 82% of low-income spending in FY2013. Key features of these programs are summarized in the report. Federal spending for low-income programs totaled $561 billion in FY2008 and increased in FY2013. The report analyzes spending by population groups served, including the elderly, disabled, families with children, and childless adults. Appendices provide additional information on program methodology and overview tables. Federal spending for low-income programs increased from $561 billion in FY2008 to $708 billion in FY2009 due to the Great Recession. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 played a significant role in this increase. By FY2011, spending peaked at $764 billion before dropping in FY2012 and rising again in FY2013. Despite a decrease from FY2010 levels, spending remained significantly higher than in FY2008. In FY2013, federal spending on low-income programs was dominated by Medicaid, accounting for 83% of health care spending and 39% of total low-income spending. Medicaid aims to provide medical care for low-income parents, dependent children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. Medicaid serves individuals with disabilities and low-income individuals, with the ACA expanding eligibility. It covers primary and acute medical services, long-term care, and includes programs like CHIP for low-income children. Other programs assist low-income seniors, veterans, and individuals with disabilities with prescription drugs and medical care. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Service provide primary care and specialized services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Consolidated Health Centers offer healthcare to low-income populations in underserved areas, while the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program supports individuals with HIV/AIDS who lack insurance. Other programs focus on preventive care for women, infants, and children. Three main programs account for the majority of cash aid spending for low-income individuals. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provides a minimum income for aged, blind, or disabled individuals with very low income. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) subsidizes the wages of low-income workers with children, while the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) is a refundable credit for families with low tax liability. The nonrefundable Child Tax Credit and part of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) provide cash aid to needy families. TANF aims to assist families in various ways, including job preparation and preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies. TANF spending is divided into cash aid, social services, and employment and training categories. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the second-largest low-income program, focusing on alleviating hunger and promoting healthy eating. Other food assistance programs subsidize meals for low-income schoolchildren and those in child care settings. Food assistance programs include providing meals for children in out-of-school settings and low-income elderly and disabled adults. Another program offers fresh fruit and vegetable snacks in elementary schools with high numbers of low-income students. The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides supplemental food and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding women and their infants and young children. Additionally, congregate and home-delivered meals are provided for the elderly to reduce hunger and promote well-being. The Federal Pell Grant Program is a significant education program for individuals with limited incomes, accounting for a large portion of federal education spending. It helps subsidize higher education costs for needy students, along with other programs like Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and Federal Work-Study. Federal TRIO Programs provide grants to institutions to support disadvantaged students. The GEAR-UP program and College Access Challenge Grants aim to support disadvantaged students in pursuing higher education. Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provides grants to ensure all children have access to quality education. The Bureau of Indian Education and other programs aim to improve education for various groups, including migrant workers' children and those in rural districts. Adult Basic Education focuses on literacy for adults, while 21st Century Community Learning Centers offer academic support outside of school hours. The federal government provides housing assistance for low-income individuals through programs like Section 8 vouchers and project-based rental assistance. The goal is to offer decent, safe, and affordable housing options. Public Housing also offers affordable rental units to low-income tenants. The federal government provides housing assistance through programs like Section 8 vouchers and project-based rental assistance to offer affordable housing options. Additional programs aim to expand supportive housing for low-income elderly, disabled households, and individuals living with AIDS, as well as meet the needs of homeless individuals and families. Block grants like HOME and CDBG target communities with high poverty rates to help low-income homeowners, homebuyers, and renters, and to support economic development activities. The federal government provides housing assistance through programs like Section 8 vouchers and project-based rental assistance for affordable housing. Block grants support economic development activities, housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands, and rural housing needs through loans, rental subsidies, and grants for water and waste disposal facilities. The Public Works and Economic Development program offers grants to distressed communities for infrastructure revitalization and job growth. Social services cater to low-income and vulnerable populations with a variety of support activities. The majority of social services spending is focused on children, youth, and their families, with TANF being the largest single activity. States have flexibility in spending TANF grants, with most funds used for noncash aid and various social services. Head Start is the second-largest program in this category, aiming to promote school readiness. Head Start and other programs provide a range of services for low-income children and families, including educational, health, nutritional, and social support. Child Care and Development Fund subsidizes child care costs for parents, while Child Support Enforcement assists with obtaining child support. Foster Care grants provide temporary homes for children in need, Adoption Assistance helps with special needs adoptions, and the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program supports former foster children in transitioning to adulthood. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program supports various outcomes for families. The Social Services Block Grant is the largest program offering flexible services for self-sufficiency. Other programs target specific populations like the elderly and American Indians. Various human services for American Indians include the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) to reduce poverty, Emergency Food and Shelter Grants for homeless individuals, and the Legal Services Corporation for equal access to justice. Programs for disadvantaged youth, such as the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and Job Corps, aim to improve education and skills for eligible youth. Job Corps focuses on disadvantaged youth for employability. Other programs include work-related services for needy families, SNAP recipients, refugees, and older Americans. LIHEAP assists low-income households with heating and cooling expenses. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps low-income households with heating and cooling expenses, while the Weatherization Assistance Program improves energy efficiency in homes. Health care is the largest category of low-income spending, followed by cash aid and food assistance. Education, housing, social services, employment, and energy assistance make up smaller portions of total low-income spending. Total low-income spending in FY2013 was dominated by health care, with cash aid and food assistance also showing significant increases. Education spending peaked in FY2011 and declined in subsequent years, while smaller categories like housing, social services, employment, and energy assistance saw varying patterns in spending over the period. In FY2013, low-income spending peaked in health care, cash aid, and food assistance. Education spending declined after FY2011, while housing, social services, employment, and energy assistance had varying patterns. Mandatory spending accounted for 82% of total low-income spending in FY2013, a slight increase from FY2008. Congress defines eligibility and payment rules for mandatory programs, while discretionary program spending is determined through annual appropriations. In FY2013, low-income spending peaked in health care, cash aid, and food assistance, with mandatory spending accounting for 82% of total low-income spending. Congress determines eligibility and payment rules for mandatory programs, with 90% of mandatory spending in FY2013 through open-ended programs. The pattern of mandatory versus discretionary spending varies by major category of benefits and services. In FY2013, low-income spending was primarily through open-ended entitlement programs, with social services spending being a mix of mandatory and discretionary. The top four programs accounted for 65% of total low-income spending, with Medicaid being the largest program at 39% in FY2013. The dominance of these large programs has increased since FY2008. In FY2013, the largest program was Medicaid at 39%, followed by SNAP at 11%. The top 10 programs remained the same, with some shifting in rank order. Seven of the top 10 programs are entitlements, with spending levels determined by eligibility rather than congressional appropriations. The top 10 low-income assistance programs include TANF, which provides fixed annual amounts to states. These programs target benefits based on financial need and specific populations like the aged, disabled, or families with children. Federal spending in FY2011 for these programs is divided among different population groups. In FY2011, federal spending under the top 10 low-income assistance programs was divided among different population groups. The disabled received the most federal dollars, totaling $208 billion, with $136 billion allocated for health care assistance alone. In FY2011, federal spending under the top 10 low-income assistance programs was divided among different population groups. Families with children received $171 billion in federal dollars, with $77 billion in cash assistance from refundable tax credits. The aged received $96 billion in low-income aid, while childless adults received the least aid from the top 10 programs. Pell Grants provided student aid. In FY2011, Pell Grants provided student aid totaling $41.5 billion, while grants for education and TANF services amounted to $23 billion. Federal spending for the top 10 low-income assistance programs was allocated among different population groups, with Pell Grants available only for college students. The CRS reports in Appendix B provide information on federal low-income policy, programs, and spending. CRS Report R41625 discusses federal low-income policy history, eligibility criteria, resource targeting mechanisms, and types of federal grants. CRS Report R41823 covers trends in low-income assistance programs. CRS Report R41823 analyzes spending trends for the 10 largest low-income programs from FY1962-FY2013, with projections through FY2024. CRS Report R43731 provides a history of key federal policies to address poverty and highlights current proposals. CRS Report RL33069 presents detailed statistics on poverty incidence among demographic groups and compares poverty measures. The curr_chunk discusses the selection criteria for low-income programs included in a report on poverty measurement in the United States. Programs were chosen based on their eligibility criteria related to low income, resource allocation methods, and prioritization of services for low-income populations. Some programs without explicit low-income provisions were included if their target population is disproportionately poor or indicates a presumption of low income participants. The curr_chunk discusses federal student loan programs and other programs that serve low-income populations, such as the Indian Health Service and Pell Grants. These programs prioritize services for low-income individuals and provide assistance based on need-analysis systems. Unlike Pell Grants, student loan programs do not have an absolute income ceiling for eligibility, resulting in assistance for students from relatively well-off families. The report includes the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) as it benefits lower-income families, unlike the regular Child Tax Credit (CTC) which phases out at higher income levels. The ACTC is refundable and serves predominantly lower-income families, with 90% of returns claiming it having an AGI below $40,000 in tax year 2012. The report includes programs with direct spending, excluding tax provisions except for the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the refundable ACTC. One program was dropped from the current version due to low-income targeting provisions and funding below the threshold. Programs are categorized into broad categories like health, cash aid, food assistance, or education, with some having multiple purposes or activities. The report categorizes programs based on actual expenditures, with some programs easily disaggregated into specific categories while others are assigned to a single category. Social services category is not well-defined, leading to potential differences in program categorization. For example, Head Start could be considered an education program due to its focus on school readiness, but it offers a wide range of activities that can be collectively characterized. The report categorizes programs based on actual expenditures, with some easily disaggregated while others are assigned to a single category. Social services include Foster Care, Adoption Assistance, and Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting, not solely cash assistance. New obligations incurred in the fiscal year were chosen as the spending measure for the report. The report uses obligations as a measure of spending, which allows federal agencies to incur obligations through actions like contracts and personnel. Outlays represent the actual payment of these obligations. The data source for obligations is the U.S. Budget Appendix for the second fiscal year. The report uses obligations as a measure of spending, allowing federal agencies to incur obligations through actions like contracts and personnel. Obligations were not available for some programs, so appropriations were used instead for specific programs like Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees and Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection. The Budget Appendix also does not show obligations solely for the low-income veterans' medical care program. The report uses obligations as a measure of spending, allowing federal agencies to incur obligations through actions like contracts and personnel. Obligations were not available for some programs, so appropriations were used instead for specific programs like Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees and Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection. The Budget Appendix also does not show obligations solely for the low-income veterans' medical care program. The report uses aggregate reimbursements for the low-income subsidy for the calendar year, available from the annual report of the Medicare trustees. TANF obligations provided in the Budget Appendix were disaggregated into categories of cash aid, social services, and employment and training based on states' reporting to the Department of Health and Human Services. Loan subsidy budget authority was used for the Section 502 single-family rural housing loan program in combination with other programs in the Rural Housing Insurance Fund Account. The report now uses budget authority as a measure for the Section 502 program, instead of loan subsidy outlays. Obligations from the Budget Appendix are used for the ACTC in FY2009-FY2013, with data from the IRS Statistics of Income for tax year 2007 used for a more accurate picture of the ACTC in FY2008. The 2011 version of the report used ACTC obligations from the Budget Appendix, which included an unspecified amount for a one-time $300 per child tax rebate in FY2008. The report excludes smaller programs and includes Spending Threshold Programs with obligations of at least $100 million from FY2008 to FY2013 for a more accurate analysis. Spending totals cited in the report only include programs that met the threshold in each specific year. Comparison with previous CRS reports from 1979 to 2006 is also mentioned. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) issued a series of reports on Cash and Noncash Benefits for Persons with Limited Income, with the last edition in 2006 by [author name scrubbed]. In 2011, CRS published a new report, Federal Benefits and Services for People with Low Income, as a replacement. The current report is an update to the 2011 version, using different methodologies to select and categorize programs and measure spending. It cannot be considered an update of the Cash and Noncash series due to the inclusion of new programs like the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D and Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The older series of reports included various programs such as student loans, Head Start, Foster Care, Adoption Assistance, and Homeless Assistance Grants, with different spending measures and state-local spending estimates. However, the new series focuses on obligations and excludes certain programs and historical spending data. An analysis of long-term spending trends for 10 major needs-tested programs is available in CRS Report R41823, Low-Income Assistance Programs: Trends in Federal Spending. Estimates for federal spending in FY2011 under the 10 largest low-income programs by population groups are based on a specific methodology and available data, using administrative data for making allocations among population groups. In FY2011, Medicaid spending was allocated based on administrative data and Census Bureau's CPS data. Elderly were defined as age 65 for Medicaid and age 60 for SNAP. 23% of Medicaid expenditures went to the elderly and 43% to disabled recipients. In FY2011, Medicaid spending was allocated based on administrative data and Census Bureau's CPS data. Medicaid administrative data alone were insufficient for allocating spending to nonelderly and nondisabled beneficiaries, so an analysis of March 2011 CPS data was used to determine the allocation of federal spending among those population groups. The CPS provided demographic and economic characteristics of the population, which were used to identify Medicaid beneficiaries in families with children and childless adults. In FY2011, Medicaid spending was allocated based on administrative data and Census Bureau's CPS data. Medicaid administrative data alone were insufficient for allocating spending to nonelderly and nondisabled beneficiaries, so an analysis of March 2011 CPS data was used to determine the allocation of federal spending among those population groups. Total Medicaid \"market values\" were computed for each population category, which determined each category's share of total Medicaid market values for the nonelderly, nondisabled population. These shares were then applied to the remaining 34% of Medicaid spending to determine federal Medicaid spending allocated to families with children and childless adults. The allocation of federal SNAP spending is based on an analysis of FY2011 SNAP Quality Control Data files, providing information on the demographic and economic characteristics of SNAP participants and households. The demographic and economic characteristics of SNAP participants and households are categorized into six groups. These include households with aged members, disabled members, children with earnings, children without earnings, childless adults or couples with earnings, and childless adults or couples without earnings. If a household fits into multiple categories, it is placed in the first applicable category. The allocation of federal SSI spending for the elderly and disabled is based on administrative data. The allocation of federal SSI spending for the elderly and disabled is based on administrative data collected by the Social Security Administration. EITC spending reflects obligations for the refundable portion of the tax credit, based on tax year 2010 data. Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy is allocated between the elderly and disabled. The allocation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug Low-Income Subsidy between the elderly and disabled is estimated to be 55% for the elderly and 45% for the disabled. Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers spending is allocated among different population groups based on administrative data collected by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Section 8 administrative data categorize households based on earnings and presence of children, elderly, or disabled members. Disability information is limited compared to SNAP data. Rent subsidies are allocated based on each population's share of total subsidies. TANF spending is divided into cash assistance, social services, and employment and training categories. The analysis focused on TANF spending, which includes cash assistance, social services, and employment and training. TANF families were classified into three groups based on demographic data: Disabled, Families with children with earnings, and Families with children without earnings. Data is collected monthly but represents a yearly average. The analysis focused on TANF spending, including cash assistance, social services, and employment and training. TANF families were categorized into three groups: Disabled, Families with children with earnings, and Families with children without earnings. TANF benefit amounts were totaled for families without earnings, and federal cash assistance spending was allocated among different population categories based on their share of total benefits. Detailed program tables in Appendix C provide specific information about programs included in the report. Table C-2 in the report identifies the general target population and income eligibility concepts for each program, along with the federal administering agency. It outlines how federal resources are allocated based on need, without specifying the exact criteria or factors used. For more detailed information, readers are directed to the fact sheets in Appendix D. Table C-3 displays the type of federal assistance provided and the immediate recipients of the assistance, indicating whether programs allow participation by U.S. territories or residents. Grants may be distributed further to other units of government or organizations beyond the immediate grantee. The curr_chunk discusses the fact sheets providing brief information about each program included in the report's analysis. It mentions that the fact sheets vary in scope and level of detail, and that the number of programs included may not be meaningful. Information provided for each program includes the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number(s) and statutory details. The curr_chunk provides key details for each program, including CFDA numbers, administering agencies, program purposes, eligibility criteria, federal assistance details, allocation formulas, obligations in FY2013, budget classifications, and program participation. Data was sourced from statutes, regulations, agency websites, and budget documents, with programs organized by category and CFDA number order. The curr_chunk provides a list of programs with CFDA numbers, participation data, and program descriptions. It notes that data may vary in time periods and units of measurement, and should not be totaled or compared. The information is based on FY2013, with references to subsequent changes and discontinued programs. For complete details, readers are directed to legal citations, federal agencies, or CRS reports. The curr_chunk provides a list of programs and page numbers for easier reference to individual program fact sheets. It includes information on Health Care Medical Care for Veterans without Service-Connected Disability, which offers a standardized medical benefits package to eligible veterans. The VA health care system provides a range of services including medical care, long-term care, and emergency care for eligible veterans based on veteran status, service-connected disabilities, and other factors. Priority Group 5 veterans with no service-connected conditions and low income may enroll in the VA health care system. Services are provided directly by the VA in VA facilities or through contracts. No matching or related requirements are needed for federal assistance. New obligations for FY2013 are estimated at $12,546 million. In FY2013, $12,546 million in estimated obligations were allocated for Priority Group 5 veteran patients receiving care from the VA. The Family Planning program falls under the authority of Title X of the Public Health Service Act. The Family Planning program, under Title X of the Public Health Service Act, aims to provide education, counseling, and medical services to help individuals freely determine the number and spacing of their children. Services include a broad range of family planning methods, infertility services, and services for adolescents. Eligibility is based on income, with free services for those below the federal poverty guidelines and sliding fee scale for those with incomes between 100% and 250% of the guidelines. The Title X Family Planning program prioritizes individuals from low-income families and those unable to afford family planning services. It provides competitive grants to public and nonprofit agencies, including agencies in territories. There are no matching requirements, but projects cannot be fully supported by Title X funds. The program had new obligations of $278 million in FY2013. In 2012, 4.764 million users were served by Title X-funded sites. The Consolidated Health Centers program provides health care services to medically underserved groups. It is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Consolidated Health Centers program offers primary and additional health care services to medically underserved populations through various health centers. Eligibility is based on income levels, with grant funds covering costs for those below the federal poverty guidelines and sliding fee scales for those between 100% and 200% of the guidelines. The Consolidated Health Centers program provides primary and additional health care services to medically underserved populations based on income levels. Grants cover costs for those below the federal poverty guidelines, with sliding fee scales for those between 100% and 200% of the guidelines. Competitive grants are given to public and private nonprofit entities, with no discounts for incomes above 200% of poverty. Grantees are expected to collect fees from third-party payors and may receive funding from various sources. New obligations for FY2013 were $2,882 million, serving 2.1 million patients in FY2012. In FY2012, 2.1 million patients were served through the Consolidated Health Centers program. Various grants and demonstrations were funded, including Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration and Medicaid Integrity Program. The program mentioned includes Money Follows the Person (MFP) and Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) to rebalance long-term services, prevent fraud in Medicaid, and increase enrollment of children. Administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Outreach and Enrollment Grants aim to increase participation of eligible children in Medicaid or CHIP. Prevention of Chronic Disease provides incentives for healthy lifestyle programs. EHS reimburses states for emergency care for unauthorized aliens. Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration reimburses mental health services for Medicaid-eligible individuals. MFP offers home and community-based long-term care services. The curr_chunk discusses Medicaid beneficiaries, unauthorized aliens, and certain parolees and Mexican citizens eligible for various services such as home and community-based long-term care, emergency psychiatric assistance, and outreach and enrollment. Federal assistance is provided through competitive grants to states for these programs. Outreach and Enrollment, Prevention of Chronic Disease, EHS, and Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration programs receive competitive grants or direct reimbursements. Allocation formula for EHS is based on undocumented alien population. New obligations for FY2013 total $534 million. The budget for various programs includes $34 million for Outreach and Enrollment, $23 million for Prevention of Chronic Disease, $16 million for EHS, and $14 million for Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration. Participation data shows transitions out of institutional settings for MFP, participants in Prevention of Chronic Disease and EHS programs, and participants in Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration. No data available for MIP. The program Transitional Cash and Medical Services to Refugees provides cash payments and medical benefits to eligible individuals to assist in their resettlement and achieve economic self-sufficiency. Administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, the program aims to support refugees in need. The program Transitional Cash and Medical Services to Refugees provides cash payments and medical benefits to eligible individuals, including adult refugees, asylees, and trafficking victims. Federal assistance is provided through formula grants to states and discretionary grants to state-alternative programs and voluntary agencies, with no matching requirements for formula grants. Territories like American Samoa, Guam, and Puerto Rico can also participate in the program. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides cash payments and medical benefits to eligible individuals, with no matching requirements for formula grants. Federal obligations for FY2013 were $401 million, and the program is classified as discretionary. The program is authorized by Title XXI of the Social Security Act and administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage to uninsured, low-income children through Medicaid expansion or separate CHIP programs. States must offer mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services, or enroll children in Alternative Benefit Plans with essential health benefits. CHIP Medicaid expansion programs must include the same \"essential health benefits\" as plans available through the ACA exchanges. All children in these programs are entitled to EPSDT coverage, which eliminates state-defined limits on benefits. States must follow Medicaid's cost-sharing rules, exempting children from fees. States may offer one of three benefit options, including the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan or FEHBP coverage. The Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) offers health coverage to state employees, including options for benchmark-equivalent or Secretary-approved coverage. States with separate CHIP programs may vary cost-sharing requirements based on family income, with a limit of 5% of total income for annual aggregate cost-sharing. Premium assistance for health insurance may also be provided under certain conditions. States may provide premium assistance for health insurance through private arrangements for Medicaid children and their parents. They can seek CMS approval to waive benefit rules for demonstration projects under Section 1115 authority. Target populations for CHIP are children under 19 without insurance and not eligible for regular Medicaid. States can set income limits up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines or 50% above pre-CHIP Medicaid levels. Pregnant women meeting income thresholds can also be covered. The ACA requires states to maintain CHIP child eligibility standards through September 30, 2019, using modified adjusted gross income rules. States must transition CHIP children ages 6 through 18 with income less than 133% of federal poverty guidelines to Medicaid. Federal assistance is provided through formula grants to states, including territories. The national appropriation amount sets the annual ceiling on federal funds available for CHIP. The law sets annual ceiling on federal funds for CHIP, with allotment amounts based on states' past CHIP spending. State expenditures are matched at an \"enhanced\" federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP) lowering state's share by 30%. E-FMAP rate subject to ceiling of 85% and floor of 65%. ACA increases E-FMAP rate by 23 percentage points for most CHIP expenditures from FY2016 to FY2019. The E-FMAP rate for CHIP expenditures will increase to a range of 88% through 100%. In FY2013, new obligations totaled $9,357 million. Participation data for FY2013 shows 8,130,793 children and 219,473 adults enrolled. Relevant CRS reports include information on the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The Voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit\u2014Low-Income Subsidy program provides comprehensive prescription drug benefits to low-income seniors and people with disabilities. Eligible individuals have incomes below 150% of the federal poverty guidelines and receive subsidized prescription drug coverage with reduced premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The Low-Income Subsidy program provides prescription drug coverage to individuals with incomes below 135% of the federal poverty guidelines. Eligible recipients include those also eligible for Medicaid, Medicare Savings Program, and Supplemental Security Income. Payments are made to participating drug plans for premiums, deductibles, and coverage gap expenses. In 2013, $22.4 billion was allocated for reimbursements, benefiting 11.5 million beneficiaries. The Medicaid program provides medical assistance to low-income families and individuals who cannot afford necessary medical care. It offers traditional benefits and alternative benefit plans, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. Medicaid programs offer traditional benefits and alternative benefit plans, with states having the option to customize benefit packages for specific enrollee groups using waiver authority. Mandatory services include hospital care, physician services, pregnancy-related care, and more, while optional services like prescription drugs vary by state. Optional services provided for most eligibility groups in many states include prescription drugs, physician-directed clinic services, inpatient psychiatric care for the elderly and individuals under age 21, nursing facility services for individuals under age 21, physical therapy, and prosthetic devices. States can offer alternative benefit plans (ABPs) to specified groups, which must cover at least the 10 essential health benefits required by the ACA. Most Medicaid children under age 21 are entitled to EPSDT services, including well-child visits and immunizations. Beginning January 1, 2014, states that implement the ACA Medicaid expansion must provide Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) to newly eligible enrollees, with exceptions for special-needs subgroups. Individual eligibility criteria include financial and nonfinancial requirements, with more than 50 potentially eligible population groups defined by federal law. Some groups are mandatory, while others are optional, with income eligibility standards tied to specified percentages of the federal poverty guidelines. Medicaid mandatory coverage groups include pregnant women and children under age 6 with family incomes at or below 133% of poverty. Medicaid mandatory coverage groups include pregnant women, children under age 6, children ages 6-18, certain parents and children in working families, individuals qualifying for Medicare Part A, and families who qualify via rules applicable to the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Optional groups have income eligibility standards tied to specified percentages of the federal poverty guidelines. The ACA required states to expand Medicaid eligibility to include most nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty guidelines. The Supreme Court decision in Business v. Sebelius made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional, allowing states to choose whether to expand. The ACA also introduced a new income counting rule based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) for most non-aged eligibility groups. Federal assistance includes partial reimbursement to states with no spending cap, and territories can participate. Medicaid payments to states are based on eligible expenditures and the federal medical assistance payment (FMAP) formula.
