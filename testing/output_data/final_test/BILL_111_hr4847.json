    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System Act\". Congress acknowledges the presence of 169 hazardous volcanoes in the US and its territories, with eruptions since 1980 causing loss of life and property damage. The danger of ash eruptions to high-flying jet aircraft, as seen in incidents like the 1989 eruption of Redoubt Volcano causing engine failure in a Boeing 747, is a significant concern. International and domestic flights over certain regions are at risk of engine failure due to volcanic activity. (6) Mudflows from ice-clad Cascade volcanoes in Washington, Oregon, and California pose a serious hazard to cities and transportation in the Pacific Northwest; (7) Lava flows, toxic gas emissions, and explosions impact Hawaii, potentially causing catastrophic property damage; (8) Seismic unrest in Mammoth Lakes, California, and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho requires careful monitoring; (9) Geophysical monitoring networks and satellite data allow for warnings before eruptions, aiding in preparation and minimizing damage. The Alaska Volcano Observatory, operated by the United States Geological Survey and its partners, demonstrates the efficacy of monitoring explosive eruptions. Other observatories in Washington and Hawaii also play a crucial role in monitoring volcanic activity. A survey of volcanoes in the United States has revealed a monitoring gap, leaving the country vulnerable to preventable damage from large volcanic eruptions. This includes observatories in Hawaii, Yellowstone National Park, and California. The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System, established under section 4(a)(1), is defined in this Act by the Secretary of the Interior through the Director of the United States Geological Survey. The Secretary will establish the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System within the US Geological Survey to monitor and protect citizens from volcanic activity. The System aims to modernize and unify volcano monitoring systems in the US to monitor all volcanoes at a level matching the threat they pose. The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System will upgrade existing networks on monitored volcanoes and install new networks on unmonitored ones. It includes a national volcano watch office, a data center, and an external grants program. Modernization activities involve applying emerging technologies like seismometers and satellite interferometry to measure gas. The Secretary must submit a 5-year management plan to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment for the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System. The plan should include cost estimates, milestones, performance goals, and recommendations for partnerships to leverage resources. The Secretary will establish an advisory committee and may enter into cooperative agreements with universities and State agencies as volcano observatory partners for the System. Coordination with relevant Federal agencies, including the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, is required. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress detailing the activities conducted under this Act, involving the Federal Aviation Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Federal Emergency Management Administration. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to carry out the Act is set at $15,000,000 annually from fiscal year 2010 onwards."
