Congress finds that before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, New Orleans had a significant number of families and elderly individuals living alone. Studies have emphasized the importance of reopening child care facilities for economic recovery and worker productivity. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the city lost 80% of licensed child care centers and 75% of available slots. In the three coastal counties in Mississippi, between 62% to 94% of licensed child care slots were lost. In Jackson County, 25% of licensed centers were damaged beyond repair, representing 11% of the county's capacity. Rebuilding the child care infrastructure is crucial for economic recovery and worker productivity. The child care infrastructure aims to help child care programs in disaster areas reopen quickly and safely by prioritizing licensed early childhood facilities. Additionally, it focuses on recruiting, training, and retaining child-care professionals. The Emergency Child Care Lending Pilot Program is established. Loans authorized for small, nonprofit child care businesses under specific conditions: approved by SBA Administrator, meet eligibility requirements, personal guarantee required, clear collateral title needed. Loans for small, nonprofit child care businesses must meet specific conditions, including having a clear collateral title, providing evidence of future cash flow, and a track record of serving in disaster areas. Additionally, only a limited percentage of loans guaranteed in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 can be awarded under this program. Nonprofit child care organizations eligible for loans must meet specific criteria, including being tax-exempt, providing child care services, having limited net worth and income, and being licensed as a child care provider. No loans can be made under this program after December 30, 2007. No loans can be made under this program after December 30, 2007. The Administrator must submit reports every 3 months until September 30, 2008, detailing the implementation of the loan program, including dates, rules issuance, and loan statistics. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report by March 31, 2008, to the Senate and House Committees on Small Business regarding the loan program's assistance. The report will evaluate the program's implementation timeliness, effectiveness, and ease during the first 2 years. The report will include an assessment of the loan program's effectiveness, participation of certified development companies, lenders, and small businesses, marketing strategies, number of child care businesses applying for and receiving loans, and the total amount loaned to these businesses. The Administrator will collect information on loans made to businesses, average loan amount and term, currency rate, delinquencies, defaults, losses, children served with subsidized assistance, and children who are minority or low-income under the program. The Administrator will issue final rules within 60 days to implement the loan program authorized by this Act."
