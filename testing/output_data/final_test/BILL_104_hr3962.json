Congressional Findings state that travel and tourism are crucial for reducing the US trade deficit, the Korean travel market lacks long-term planning capabilities, visa processing delays persist despite efforts to increase staff at the US Embassy in Seoul, and further funding for staff additions is unlikely in the current fiscal environment. The United States faces visa processing delays despite efforts to increase staff at the US Embassy in Seoul. Many nations do not require visas for Koreans, giving them a competitive advantage in tourism. Guam has seen a significant increase in Korean visitors after eliminating visa requirements. Adding Korea to the list of favored nations exempt from US visa regulations would take years. The Republic of Korea has exempted US tourists from visa requirements as a goodwill gesture. However, growth in Korean travel to the US has not kept pace with other destinations due to cumbersome visa processing procedures. To address this issue, a pilot program will be established within six months. A pilot program will be established within six months to waive certain visa requirements for nationals of the Republic of Korea seeking entry as tourists to the United States. The Republic of Korea is encouraged to provide machine-readable passports to its citizens. The pilot program waives visa requirements for Korean tourists visiting the US for up to 15 days. The alien must complete immigration forms and arrive on a carrier with an agreement for transport out of the US if found inadmissible. The alien must also be determined not to pose a safety threat to the US. The pilot program waives visa requirements for Korean tourists visiting the US for up to 15 days. The alien must comply with previous admission conditions and possess a round-trip ticket. An alien must waive rights to review or appeal an immigration officer's determination or contest deportation, except for asylum applications. The pilot program allows Korean tourists to visit the US visa-free for up to 15 days, with certain conditions. The program may be terminated if the overstay rate exceeds that of valid visa holders, leading to an increase in overstays. Special bond and notification requirements apply to tour operators. Nationals of the Republic of Korea can enter the US visa-free for up to 15 days if accompanied by an approved tour operator who has posted a $200,000 bond and provided necessary information to the Secretary of State. The tour operator must provide information to the Secretary of State before the group's departure to ensure travelers do not pose a threat. The operator must exclude anyone denied permission to travel to the US and provide documentation of each member's return to Korea. Bonds may be forfeited if requirements are not met. Bonds posted by tour operators may be forfeited or authorization revoked if they fail to disclose information, comply with notification requirements, ensure visitors return home, or commit a felony. The Secretary of State may terminate the participation of tour agents in the program if the overstay rate of nationals of the Republic of Korea is deemed excessive. Group tours are defined as travelers who use group-purchased hotel or airfare packages arranged by approved tour agents in Korea. The \"overstay rate\" is the proportion of aliens remaining in the US after their visas expire compared to the total number of aliens entering. The \"pilot program period\" refers to the three-year period following the establishment of the program."
