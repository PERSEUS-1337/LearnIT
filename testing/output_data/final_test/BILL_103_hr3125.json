    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Felon Identification and Police Safety Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that state laws requiring waiting periods for firearm purchases have endangered law-abiding Americans, citing examples of individuals unable to protect themselves due to delays in obtaining firearms permits. Residents of Los Angeles faced a 15-day waiting period during the 1991 riots before being able to legally purchase a firearm for protection. This delay left them vulnerable as the police admitted they could not adequately protect the people. The story of a woman who illegally bought a handgun on the street and used it to defend herself against a man who had previously robbed, assaulted, and raped her highlights the importance of self-defense options. The potential consequences of instant background checks leading to a gun owner registration system were also raised, as seen in the Virginia State instant check system. The Virginia transaction log does not include firearm purchaser names, but potential exists regardless of legal prohibitions. Laws with waiting periods before firearm purchases have not prevented crime rates from increasing above national average. Police are not legally responsible for protecting individual citizens, as courts have ruled they only have obligation to protect the public in general. The court ruled that municipalities providing police services have a duty to the public at large, not individual community members. Former Florida Attorney General noted a low response rate to calls for help. Department of Justice found a high number of violent crimes not responded to promptly in 1989. Currently, there are 150,000 police officers protecting a population of over 250 million Americans. SEC. 3. SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFYING FELONS AND PERSONS ADJUDICATED MENTALLY INCOMPETENT. The laws and procedures of a State require a records check before issuing driver's licenses and identification documents, using magnetic strips to identify prohibited persons. The licensee's status as a prohibited or nonprohibited person can only be determined using a read-only electronic device with no storage or communication capabilities. The device signals with a green light for non-prohibited persons and a red light for prohibited persons when reading a magnetic strip. If a person is convicted of a felony or adjudicated as mentally incompetent, their driver's license will be seized and voided by the State court. The person can request a new license after this process. The status of being a prohibited person is determined by a read-only electronic device that shows a green light for non-prohibited persons and a red light for prohibited persons. The State transportation agency will issue a new license with a magnetic strip identifying a prohibited person. Convicted felons in the State will be fined to cover expenses of criminal records checks. The State transportation agency will impose a surcharge on prohibited persons applying for a driver's license to cover expenses of criminal records checks. The State is required to maintain a computerized list of all prohibited persons based on convictions or adjudications. The Attorney General of the United States is tasked with creating a national, computerized list of prohibited persons and incorporating State criminal history records into the Federal system. They must also develop systems to link State lists with the national list and provide access to responsible State agencies. The Attorney General of the United States must provide access to the national list of prohibited persons to responsible State agencies upon request. Procedures for correcting erroneous records include requesting information from the Attorney General, who must comply within 5 days, allowing individuals to submit additional information for review within the same timeframe. The Attorney General must investigate and correct any erroneous Federal records within 5 days of receiving information. Erroneously identified individuals can seek damages and other relief through legal action in a United States district court. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"license,\" \"prohibited person,\" and \"State transportation agency.\" The term \"license\" refers to a permit to operate a motor vehicle or an identification document issued by a State transportation agency. A \"prohibited person\" is someone convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding 1 year or adjudicated mentally incompetent. The term \"State transportation agency\" is also defined. The State transportation agency is defined as the agency responsible for issuing licenses, permits, or identification documents. Justice Assistance Funds may be reduced by 25% for states without certain laws and procedures in effect after 2 years. After a 2-year period, if any State implements a waiting period or a system for identifying felons or mentally incompetent individuals not in line with specified laws, the Bureau of Justice Assistance will decrease the annual allocation by 25% under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Licensed firearms dealers must check the magnetic strip on a person's driver's license when purchasing a handgun. Licensed dealers are prohibited from selling handguns to unlicensed individuals unless they use an electronic device to check identification. They must also notify law enforcement within 72 hours if a prohibited person tries to buy a handgun. The term 'handgun' is defined as a firearm designed to be held and fired with one hand. An 'identification document' refers to a license or permit for operating a motor vehicle or any document solely for identification purposes. A 'transportation agency' is responsible for issuing identification documents. These definitions are subject to state laws complying with the Felon Identification and Police Safety Act of 1993. Penalties under Section 924(a) of the title are amended accordingly. The amendments made by this section apply to conduct engaged in after the 2-year period that begins with the date of the enactment of this Act. Any licensed dealer who violates section 922(s) shall be imprisoned not more than 1 year, fined not more than $1,000, or both."
