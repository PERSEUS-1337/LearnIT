    "content": "The Wilderness Act gives Congress the authority to designate federal lands as wilderness areas, based on the Property Clause of the Constitution. These areas are managed by federal land agencies like the Forest Service, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management. Wilderness designations can be controversial due to restrictions on land use. The Wilderness Act prohibits commercial activities, motorized access, roads, structures, and facilities in designated wilderness areas, as stated in Section 4(c). The Wilderness Act prohibits most commercial resource exploitation and motorized entry in designated wilderness areas, with exceptions for certain activities like fire control, mineral prospecting, water projects, livestock grazing, and commercial recreation. Existing private rights established prior to wilderness designation remain in effect, not altering property rights but requiring a specific property right. The phrase \"subject to valid existing rights\" ensures no violation of property rights. Ownership within a wilderness area confers existing rights, with some uses like timber harvesting and grazing not considered rights. Mining and mineral leasing laws allow for rights to mineral resources. The implementation of wilderness laws has been ongoing since 1983, with many subsequent laws withdrawing designated areas from availability. Wilderness designations are permanent unless revised by law, and lands do not have to be untouched by humans to be eligible. Specific statutes may terminate nonconforming uses or direct agencies to remove them within a specified time frame. The Wilderness Act allows for continued motorized access in designated wilderness areas for management requirements, emergencies, and infrastructure maintenance. Some statutes permit existing infrastructure to remain and occasional motorized access for operation and replacement. New infrastructure developments have also been allowed in certain wilderness areas. Some statutes provide general exemptions for specific needs in designated wilderness areas, such as maintaining grazing facilities or fish and wildlife management. Special access provisions for military needs, law enforcement, border security, tribal, cultural, and local needs are also included in various wilderness statutes. Proponents of adding new areas to the National Wilderness Preservation System seek designations to preserve undeveloped areas and prevent development activities. The main benefit of a wilderness designation is to maintain clean water, wildlife habitats, scenic views, nonmotorized recreation opportunities, research baselines, and pristine places. Opponents of wilderness designations aim to retain development options for federal lands. The potential economic opportunities from extracting resources in federal lands are a key consideration for wilderness designations. While some activities like grazing and recreation are allowed, others like timber harvesting may be prohibited, leading to opportunity costs. Assessing the quality and quantity of unavailable resources, especially minerals, can be challenging, making the opportunity costs less certain. The potential benefits and opportunity costs of wilderness designation are difficult to quantify and value, leading to decisions not solely based on economic analysis. Congress considers various issues when drafting wilderness bills, including pros and cons of designation and management provisions for wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act specifies criteria for designating wilderness areas, with no minimum size requirement. Wilderness areas vary in size, from the smallest Pelican Island Wilderness in Florida to the largest Mollie Beattie Wilderness in Alaska. Legislation can designate single or multiple areas, addressing specific regions or all potential wilderness areas in a state. Legislation designates wilderness areas, with bills addressing specific regions or all potential wilderness areas in a state. Bills reference maps for each area and direct agencies to file a map with Congress after enactment. Numerous bills are introduced in each Congress, with some being enacted, such as the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. In the 114th Congress, more than 30 bills were introduced to designate new or add to existing wilderness areas, and one was enacted: P.L. 114-46, which designated three new wilderness areas in Idaho. In the 115th Congress, over 20 bills had been introduced to expand the National Wilderness System. As of the report date, over 20 bills have been introduced to expand the National Wilderness Preservation System. These bills propose designating multiple wilderness areas across different states, with management in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting certain human impacts. Some bills may accommodate existing nonconforming uses or conditions. The Wilderness Act allows for certain activities to maintain the natural condition of the areas. The Wilderness Act allows for the management of wilderness areas to control fires, insects, diseases, livestock grazing, and water infrastructure. Wilderness areas are withdrawn from public land laws and mining laws, with \"reasonable access\" required for nonfederal lands. State jurisdiction over fish, wildlife, and water rights remains unaffected. While the Act emphasizes recreational use, it does not specifically mention hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting. However, these activities are generally allowed in wilderness areas, subject to federal land management provisions. Legislation introduced in the 115th Congress would alter management of wilderness areas for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting activities. For example, S. 733, the Sportsmen's Act, and H.R. 3668, the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, both include provisions that would specify that wilderness areas managed by the FS and BLM would be open to recreational fishing, hunting, and recreational shooting, unless a land management agency had acted. The legislation introduced in the 115th Congress aims to allow recreational activities like fishing, hunting, and shooting in wilderness areas managed by the FS and BLM. H.R. 3668 and S. 733 specify that agencies can temporarily or permanently close areas, with closures needing to be supported by evidence. S. 733 also requires public notice and comment periods before closures and prohibits permits for shooting ranges in designated wilderness areas. Many are concerned about wilderness areas near the Mexican border being used for illegal activities due to restrictions on motorized access. The Wilderness Act allows for motorized access in emergencies and for administrative needs, but it is unclear what constitutes \"administrative needs\" in the context of border security. Specific enabling statutes for border wilderness areas may provide more clarity on access restrictions. The Arizona Desert Wilderness Act of 1990 and the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 contain explicit language authorizing access for border security reasons in certain wilderness areas near the Mexican border. This allows for continued border operations within designated wilderness lands, in accordance with applicable interagency agreements. The Desert Protection Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-433) and the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1999 provide guidance on border security in designated wilderness areas near the Mexican border, allowing for law enforcement operations with motorized vehicles and aircraft. The southern boundary of the wilderness must be at least 100 feet from the border, and border operations can continue consistent with the Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act allows for drug interdiction and border operations near the US-Mexico border, as long as they comply with the Act and are subject to appropriate conditions. Concerns about access limitations to wilderness areas have been raised, but a 2010 report found that delays in border security operations did not impact overall security. In Border Patrol stations, most agents-in-charge reported that land management laws did not affect overall security. Terrain remoteness and ruggedness were cited as major obstacles to operational control. Some agents faced delays due to restrictions but did not request additional resources or had their requests denied. In August 2017, the Trump administration waived laws, including the Wilderness Act, to expedite border operations. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to reduce restrictions of the Wilderness Act and other federal statutes on border security activities in California. Bills like H.R. 3593 and H.R. 3548 aim to permit U.S. Customs and Border Protection to perform necessary security measures, including building infrastructure in designated wilderness areas. The America's Trust Act aims to amend IIRAIRA to allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection activities on federal lands without restrictions from the Wilderness Act. Congress has directed the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to evaluate the wilderness potential of their lands, with different requirements for assessing and managing wilderness characteristics. The Wilderness Act directed the Forest Service to evaluate the wilderness potential of National Forest System lands by 1974. The FS conducted reviews in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in some areas recommended for wilderness designation. Congress designated some areas as wilderness, while others remain pending. Some believe wilderness study areas and inventoried roadless areas are not managed properly, limiting development opportunities. The Forest Service evaluates wilderness potential of National Forest System lands every 15 years. Management of inventoried roadless areas has been controversial, with differing policies proposed by past administrations. The Clinton Nationwide Roadless Rule restricts certain activities in these areas. BLM identified suitable wilderness study areas from roadless areas and presented recommendations to Presidents Bush and Clinton. Despite enacted statutes, many wilderness recommendations for BLM lands are still pending before Congress. Section 603(c) of FLPMA directs the agency to manage these lands until Congress decides otherwise. BLM must protect Wilderness Study Areas until Congress releases them from responsibility. FLPMA directs BLM to inventory resources and prioritize critical environmental areas. Unlike the FS, BLM is not required to revise plans on a set schedule but must do so \"when appropriate.\" The FS is required to include wilderness reviews in the planning process, while FLPMA is silent on wilderness in BLM planning guidance. BLM is not mandated to conduct regular reviews of its lands and resources, and assessments of wilderness potential are not required. Legislation has been proposed in previous Congresses to release certain BLM WSAs from nonimpairment requirements. The 114th Congress considered legislation to terminate the Clinton and Bush Forest Service roadless area rules and release specific WSAs. Legislation was also introduced to add acres to the wilderness system and designate additional wilderness areas. See Table A-2 for 114th Congress legislation on releasing BLM WSAs."
