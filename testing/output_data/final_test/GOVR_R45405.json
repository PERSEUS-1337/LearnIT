    "content": "President Trump signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act into law on October 24, 2018, to address the rising opioid overdose deaths in the United States. The bill was approved by the House 393-8 and cleared the Senate by 98-1. Opioid-related deaths have tripled since 2002, with 42,249 deaths in 2016. The Act is a comprehensive measure to combat the opioid epidemic. The SUPPORT Act is a comprehensive measure to address the opioid epidemic in the United States. It includes provisions for tighter oversight of opioid production and distribution, additional reporting and safeguards to address fraud, and limits on coverage of prescription opioids while expanding access to addiction treatment services. The bill also authorizes programs for consumer education on opioid use and training for providers to treat individuals with opioid use disorders. The SUPPORT Act aims to combat the opioid epidemic by implementing various measures. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would increase the deficit by $1,001 million over 5 years but reduce it by $52 million over 10 years. The Act excludes budgetary effects from PAYGO scorecards, preventing sequestration. It builds on previous legislation like CARA and the Cures Act. The SUPPORT Act, building on previous legislation like CARA and the Cures Act, consists of eight titles addressing various aspects of the opioid crisis, including Medicaid and Medicare provisions, FDA regulations, offsets, and public health provisions. Title III of the SUPPORT Act focuses on FDA and Controlled Substance Provisions, including regulations for medical product development, special packaging for opioids, and DEA regulations for controlled substances like medication-assisted treatment and disposal requirements at hospice programs. Title III of the SUPPORT Act focuses on FDA and Controlled Substance Provisions, including regulations for medical product development, special packaging for opioids, and DEA regulations for controlled substances like medication-assisted treatment and disposal requirements at hospice programs. Section 4004 of Title IV amends reporting requirements for agreements between drug manufacturers. The report provides background context and includes an Appendix with deadlines and reporting requirements. This report reflects the SUPPORT Act at enactment in October 2018 and does not track implementation or funding. FDA is responsible for ensuring prescription drug safety under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ensures the safety and effectiveness of prescription and nonprescription drugs in the US. They regulate the drug life-cycle from development to market approval. Before a drug can be marketed, it must be approved by the FDA through a new drug application process. The FDA reviews the application to determine if the drug is safe, effective, and its benefits outweigh the risks. The FDA evaluates the safety, effectiveness, labeling, and manufacturing quality of drugs to ensure their identity, strength, and purity. Flexibility is exercised in evidence requirements, with expedited programs for drugs addressing unmet needs or serious conditions. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act established breakthrough therapy designation for expedited review of drugs treating serious or life-threatening diseases. The 21st Century Cures Act modified FDA regulatory pathways for drug and device development, incorporating patient experience data and real-world evidence. Section 3001(a) requires the HHS Secretary to address challenges in developing non-addictive medical products for pain or addiction, including risk assessment for controlled substances in new drugs or devices. The 21st Century Cures Act modified FDA pathways for drug and device development, incorporating patient experience data and real-world evidence. It addresses challenges in developing non-addictive medical products for pain or addiction, including risk assessment for controlled substances. The Act defines opioid-sparing as reducing, replacing, or avoiding opioids for pain treatment. The HHS Secretary must issue guidance within one year on developing nonaddictive medical products for pain or addiction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines in 2016 for prescribing opioids for chronic pain to improve communication between providers and patients, enhance pain treatment safety, and reduce risks of long-term opioid use. FDA Commissioner is required by Section 3002 of the 21st Century Cures Act to develop evidence-based opioid analgesic prescribing guidelines for acute pain treatment in areas where such guidelines do not exist, consulting stakeholders and collaborating with CDC Director and other federal agencies. The FDA Commissioner is mandated to develop evidence-based opioid analgesic prescribing guidelines for acute pain treatment, consulting stakeholders and collaborating with other federal agencies. The guidelines must be periodically updated and accompanied by a statement clarifying their purpose. FDA has various tools for enforcing the FFDCA, including warning and untitled letters. The FDA has various administrative tools for enforcing the FFDCA, including warning and untitled letters, import alerts, recalls, debarments, and civil monetary penalties. FDA can require a recall of certain products but not drug products, which can only be voluntarily recalled. Mandatory recalls are initiated through an administrative order, with an opportunity for an informal hearing. FFDCA Section 801(a) specifies conditions for refusing admission of articles in the United States. Section 3012 of the FFDCA allows the HHS Secretary to issue an order requiring immediate cessation of distribution of a controlled substance if it poses serious health risks. The person subject to the order can request an informal hearing to challenge the evidence supporting the order. The HHS Secretary can vacate, continue, or amend the order based on the available grounds. Section 3012 of the FFDCA allows the HHS Secretary to issue an order requiring immediate cessation of distribution of a controlled substance if it poses serious health risks. The order may also include a recall of the substance if necessary. The person subject to the order must comply by ceasing distribution or recalling the substance. The HHS Secretary can require notice to be provided to relevant parties. The order can only be issued by the HHS Secretary or designated officials. Section 3012 of the FFDCA allows the HHS Secretary to issue an order requiring immediate cessation of distribution of a controlled substance if it poses serious health risks. It also includes amendments to FFDCA Section 301 and 801(a) regarding prohibited acts and refusal of admission for controlled substances. Section 3013 adds a new subsection allowing the HHS Secretary to issue an order determining that all drugs being offered for import by an entity are adulterated or misbranded if they are subject to debarment for importing controlled substances. Most drugs subject to FDA's administrative destruction authority come through international mail to prevent entry of unapproved substances. FDA investigators at International Mail Facilities (IMFs), in coordination with Customs and Border Protection (CBP), monitor international mail importations of FDA-regulated products. Less than 0.06% of packages presumed to contain drug products shipped through IMFs are inspected by FDA. In FY2017, 86% of the packages reviewed contained illegal, illicit, unapproved, counterfeit, and potentially dangerous drugs. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $94 million for FDA to expand efforts related to processing opioids. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 115-141) allocated $94 million for FDA to enhance inspection capacity at International Mail Facilities (IMFs) for processing opioids and other imported articles. This includes increasing staffing, obtaining necessary equipment, and upgrading infrastructure and laboratory facilities. The Act also mandates coordination between the HHS Secretary, FDA Commissioner, and DHS Secretary to improve customs and border protection activities at IMFs, focusing on detecting illegal controlled substances and drug imports. Additionally, the HHS Secretary, in collaboration with the DHS Secretary and Postmaster General, is required to provide facility upgrades and improved inspection capabilities at FDA-operated import facilities. The FDA works with CBP to monitor mail importations of FDA-regulated products, including dietary supplements, drugs, and medical devices. Mail entering from abroad is sent to CBP for examination, and CBP refers FDA-regulated products to FDA for review. If a package is found to contain a controlled substance, CBP will seize it. The HHS Secretary, in consultation with the DHS Secretary and Postmaster General, is required to report to Congress on the implementation of this section. The HHS Secretary, in consultation with CBP, must develop a list of controlled substances for referral when offered for import through international mail. CBP will seize illegal substances identified in the mail, and additional packages resembling the seized package may also be transferred to CBP. A report on the implementation of this agreement must be submitted to Congress within nine months of enactment. The HHS Secretary, in consultation with CBP, must develop a list of controlled substances for referral when offered for import through international mail. CBP will seize illegal substances identified in the mail. A report on the implementation of this agreement must be submitted to Congress. FFDCA Section 301(cc) prohibits importation of food by a debarred person. Section 306(b) allows debarment for importing adulterated food. Section 3022(b)(1) prohibits importation of drugs by a debarred person. Section 3022(b)(2) allows debarment for importing drugs. The importation of unapproved new drugs into the United States is prohibited under FFDCA Section 801(a). The HHS Secretary must provide samples of imported food, drugs, devices, tobacco products, and cosmetics to the Treasury Secretary upon request. Registered foreign establishments engaged in manufacturing drugs, devices, or tobacco products must be listed. The FFDCA prohibits the importation of unapproved new drugs into the United States. Registered foreign establishments involved in drug, device, or tobacco product manufacturing must be listed. Section 3022 of the FFDCA expands the circumstances under which an article must be refused admission, including if it is a drug being imported in violation of certain provisions. If an article is found to be a counterfeit drug, its admission must be refused. A new subsection allows an article to be treated as solely for importation purposes. The FFDCA prohibits the importation of unapproved new drugs into the United States. A new subsection allows an article to be treated as solely for importation purposes if it presents a significant public health concern and contains an active ingredient similar to an approved drug or biologic. HHS Secretary can require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for certain drugs under specified conditions. The Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) ensures that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks by imposing restrictions on sale and distribution, such as Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU). ETASU may require specific training for healthcare providers or certification for pharmacies. It must not overly restrict patient access, especially for those with serious conditions or difficulty accessing healthcare. If the brand-name drug is under REMS, the generic product must also comply. In December 2017, FDA held a workshop to address abuse of prescription opioids. Section 3032(a) allows the HHS Secretary to require certain packaging or safe disposal methods for drugs with serious overdose or abuse risks under REMS. Section 3032 of the FDA amendments allows the HHS Secretary to mandate safe packaging or disposal methods for drugs with overdose or abuse risks under REMS. It also includes provisions for patients with functional limitations and requires generic drugs to adhere to the same packaging requirements as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD). The Government Accountability Office is tasked with reporting on packaging and disposal technologies within a year of enactment. The FDA amendments allow the HHS Secretary to mandate safe packaging or disposal methods for drugs with overdose or abuse risks under REMS. Adverse drug experiences are defined for REMS purposes, including events like overdose, abuse, and withdrawal. FDA notes limited data on long-term opioid efficacy and the need for more research on safety and efficacy. HHS is required to report to Congress on packaging and disposal technologies within a year of enactment. The HHS Secretary can require safety-related labeling changes for opioids post-approval. Responsible parties must submit proposed changes within 30 days or explain why they believe no change is necessary. The law outlines the review process for labeling disagreements. Section 3041(a) amends the definition of adverse drug experience to allow FDA to mandate postmarket studies on certain drugs. Section 3041(b) amends FFDCA Section 505(o)(4) to allow the HHS Secretary to require labeling changes based on new effectiveness information for certain drugs like opioids. It also streamlines the process for submitting new information. Section 3041(c) mandates the HHS Secretary to issue guidance within a year on when FDA can require postmarket studies to assess drug effectiveness and safety labeling changes for controlled substances used for pain management. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates the use of controlled substances for medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes, and prevents their illegal diversion. It sets requirements for dispensing controlled substances, including provisions for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorders and controlled substances disposal. Substances are categorized into five schedules based on medical use, abuse potential, and safety. The Controlled Substances Act categorizes substances into five schedules based on medical use, abuse potential, and safety. Schedule I substances have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, while schedules II-V have recognized medical uses. Those who handle controlled substances must register with the Attorney General, with exceptions for certain practitioners. Practitioners dispensing controlled substances for maintenance or detoxification treatment may need a separate DEA registration or a waiver known as a \"DATA waiver.\" The \"DATA waiver\" allows qualified practitioners to treat patients with buprenorphine, a schedule III controlled substance. Initially limited to 30 patients, practitioners can increase to 100 after a year and 275 after two years. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants were temporarily granted the authority to obtain DATA waivers until October 1, 2021. The DEA implemented changes in January 2018 for practitioners to obtain a DATA waiver, allowing them to treat patients with buprenorphine. Qualified physicians must meet specific requirements, including holding additional credentials or providing medication-assisted treatment in a qualified practice setting. They can treat 100 patients with certain conditions met, and up to 275 patients with additional qualifications. Section 3201 of the CSA allows qualified practitioners to treat up to 275 patients under certain conditions, with nurse practitioners and physician assistants having permanent authority for controlled substances treatment. The definition of \"qualifying other practitioner\" is expanded to include additional healthcare professionals, with a time limit set for obtaining DATA waivers until October 1, 2023. A report assessing care provided by qualifying physicians treating over 100 patients is required to be submitted to Congress within two years of enactment. Section 3202 of the CSA expands conditions for physicians to qualify for a DATA waiver, requiring graduation from an accredited U.S. medical school and training in managing opioid-dependent patients. The Secretary must also consider ways to ensure appropriate training for practitioners. Section 3202(b) of the CSA requires the Secretary to ensure an adequate number of pediatric specialists can obtain a DATA waiver for treating youth with substance use disorders. Section 3203 establishes a grant program for medical schools and hospitals to develop curricula meeting CSA requirements, with an appropriation of $4 million annually from FY2019 to FY2023. Issues have arisen with pharmacists dispensing controlled substances only to the ultimate user, affecting patients and physicians in cases requiring in-office administration. Buprenorphine, a schedule III controlled substance for opioid use disorder treatment, may need in-office administration. Section 3204 of the CSA allows pharmacies to deliver controlled substances to practitioners for injection or implantation in patients for maintenance or detoxification treatment. The physician must administer the substance within 14 days of receiving it, with the possibility of the Attorney General reducing this timeframe for public health reasons. Additionally, a GAO study on access and diversion of controlled substances is required. The GAO is required to study and report to Congress on access to controlled substances administered by injection or implantation. Pharmacists must be vigilant against forged prescriptions, as they can be legally responsible for dispensing them. Controlled substances can only be prescribed for legitimate medical purposes, and pharmacists share responsibility with prescribing practitioners. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, is required to develop materials for pharmacists, health care providers, and patients on circumstances under which a pharmacist can decline to fill a prescription for a controlled substance. This includes instructions on how to decline filling a prescription and information on federal requirements. In 2010, the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act was signed into law to help patients dispose of unwanted controlled substances. The DEA issued a final rule in 2014 expanding the entities to which patients can transfer controlled substances for disposal. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 allows for the disposal of unused medications by hospice patients' households. A qualified hospice program employee can dispose of controlled substances after the patient's death, expiration of the medication, or a change in the patient's care plan if they are a physician with a DEA registration. This amendment aims to prevent diversion and misuse of medications left in the home after hospice care. Section 3222 of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act allows for the disposal of controlled substances in hospice programs after a patient's death. The Attorney General can provide guidance to hospice programs for compliance, and states can impose additional regulations. Section 3223 requires a study on federal requirements for managing and disposing of controlled substances in the home. The Ryan Haight Act of 2008 regulates online sales of controlled substances, requiring a valid prescription from an in-person medical evaluation. It allows for telemedicine practitioners to be exempt from this requirement and permits the Attorney General to issue special registrations for telemedicine. Regulations specify the circumstances for obtaining a special registration. The Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 amended the Controlled Substances Act to treat controlled substance analogues as Schedule I substances. The Act requires the Attorney General to promulgate regulations within one year to specify limited circumstances for obtaining a special registration for telemedicine. A controlled substance analogue is a substance with a chemical structure similar to a controlled substance in schedule I or II, or has similar effects on the central nervous system. Synthetic cathinones, marketed as \"bath salts\" or \"plant food,\" are often labeled as not for human consumption. The labeling of synthetic substances like \"bath salts\" as \"not intended for human consumption\" aims to avoid prosecution under the Analogue Enforcement Act. Prosecuting individuals for violations is challenging due to proving the intended use despite labeling. The DEA faces difficulties as substances can be chemically manipulated to produce similar effects to controlled substances without being chemically similar. This poses ongoing challenges for law enforcement and prosecution. The DEA faces challenges in prosecuting cases involving potential analogue substances due to the need for additional investigation to determine intended human consumption, expert testimony to establish chemical similarity, and the subjective threshold for similarity. Establishing a substance as an analogue in one case does not apply to others. Section 3241 amends the Analogue Enforcement Act by adding factors to consider in determining if a substance is an analogue intended for human consumption, including marketing, pricing, diversion, and knowledge of intended use. The Disposal Act authorized the Attorney General to issue regulations for the disposal of prescription-controlled substances to prevent misuse and abuse. The Disposal Act authorized the Attorney General to issue regulations for the disposal of prescription-controlled substances to prevent misuse and abuse. The regulations provide three secure collection and disposal options: take-back events organized by law enforcement agencies, mail-back programs for unwanted controlled substances, and installation of secure collection sites by authorized collectors. The Disposal Act allows law enforcement agencies or authorized collectors to set up secure collection receptacles at their DEA-registered location for users to deposit controlled substances. Collectors must destroy the substances using specific methods to make them non-retrievable. A GAO report from October 2017 found that only 3% of eligible entities have become registered collectors, possibly due to associated costs. The \"Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act of 2018\" authorizes collectors to set up secure collection receptacles for controlled substances. The Act defines terms like \"Attorney General\" and \"authorized collector\" and grants the Attorney General authority to provide grants to states to increase participation rates of eligible collectors. The \"Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act of 2018\" authorizes collectors to set up secure collection receptacles for controlled substances. States applying for grants must designate a single agency, describe a plan to increase collector participation, and explain how collectors will be selected. Grant funds can only be used for disposal activities. The Attorney General will award grants to five states, with at least three in the lowest quartile of participation rates. Section 3257 authorizes collectors to set up secure collection receptacles for controlled substances, with the Attorney General determining the duration of grants. Section 3259 makes the grant program available for the first 5 fiscal years after enactment. Section 3258 requires states to submit reports listing grant recipients and activities supported, along with performance measures. Section 3260 authorizes appropriations to the Attorney General for implementing the program. Manufacturers and distributors of Schedule I and II drugs must report to the DEA through the ARCOS system, which monitors the flow of controlled substances. Narcotics in Schedules III and IV are also included. The DEA uses ARCOS data to strengthen criminal cases, and over 1,100 distributors report to ARCOS annually. The purpose of Chapter 7 is to provide oversight. Section 3272 of Chapter 7 aims to provide drug manufacturers and distributors with anonymized information through ARCOS to identify and stop suspicious orders of opioids. It emphasizes the responsibility of registrants to maintain effective controls against diversion. Section 3273 amends the CSA by requiring the Attorney General to provide data on controlled substance distribution to registered manufacturers and distributors quarterly through ARCOS. Section 3273 of Chapter 7 mandates the Attorney General to provide detailed distribution data on controlled substances to manufacturers and distributors through ARCOS every six months. This information includes amounts, outliers, and trends to help identify diversion and noncompliance issues. Section 3273 of Chapter 7 requires manufacturers and distributors of opioids to review the latest information provided by the Attorney General through ARCOS. Failure to comply may result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress within one year of the enactment of the act, detailing the use of data in ARCOS to identify and prevent suspicious activity related to opioids. The CSA includes a production quota system for Schedule I and II controlled substances and listed chemicals. The DEA establishes aggregate production quotas (APQ) for Schedule I and II controlled substances to meet medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs in the US. Individual production quotas are assigned to manufacturers to prevent exceeding the APQ. Registrants can apply for quota increases if necessary. DEA Administrator considers various factors when determining APQ. The DEA considers various factors when determining aggregate production quotas (APQ) for Schedule I and II controlled substances, including disposal trends, total inventories, projected demand, and other relevant factors. Registrants must not manufacture controlled substances in excess of their individual quota assigned by the DEA. Section 3282 of the CSA amends DEA considerations for opioid quotas, allowing the Attorney General to establish production quotas to prevent overproduction, shortages, or diversion of controlled substances like fentanyl and oxycodone. The quotas are based on estimates of diversion within the United States, determined in consultation with the HHS Secretary. The Attorney General, in consultation with the HHS Secretary, considers reliable information on overdose rates, abuse, and public health impact of controlled substances in the US. Quota reductions are made based on estimated diversion of controlled substances. Increases in quotas require justification of public health benefits outweighing consequences. The Attorney General, in consultation with the HHS Secretary, considers reliable information on overdose rates, abuse, and public health impact of controlled substances in the US. Quota reductions are made based on estimated diversion of controlled substances. Increases in quotas require justification of public health benefits outweighing consequences. The quota clearly outweighs the consequences of having an increased volume of the covered controlled substance available for sale and potential diversion in the United States. The Attorney General must submit anonymized counts of manufacturers issued individual manufacturing quotas and report on how quotas for covered controlled substances will be fixed and adjusted considering changes in accepted medical use. The DEA works with the HHS Secretary to estimate and monitor suspicious orders of controlled substances to prevent diversion for illegal purposes like drug abuse and trafficking. Suspicious orders are defined as those deviating from normal patterns in size, frequency, or quantity. The CSA imposes penalties for DEA registrants who fail to report suspicious orders related to drug diversion activities. It introduces a new section requiring registrants to have a system in place to detect and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA. The CSA requires DEA registrants to report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA. A centralized database will store these reports, and registrants who submit a report to this database are considered compliant. The Attorney General must share information on suspicious orders with designated entities in each state. Additionally, the Attorney General must report to Congress on the actions taken in response to these reports. The Attorney General is required to report actions taken in response to suspicious orders of controlled substances to Congress. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 created an abbreviated pathway for generic drugs. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 established an abbreviated pathway for generic drugs, allowing generic drug companies to rely on the FDA's determination of the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) for safety and efficacy. Generic drug applicants must submit certifications regarding patents listed in the Orange Book for the RLD, including statements on patent expiration or validity. The first generic company to file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with a paragraph IV certification may receive 180 days of exclusivity. Since the enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act, practices like pay-for-delay settlements have emerged, disrupting the balance between innovation and competition in the pharmaceutical industry. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required drug companies to file such agreements with the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 mandates that brand and generic drug companies must file agreements related to the manufacture, marketing, or sale of reference listed drugs (RLDs) with the FTC and DOJ. This includes agreements concerning the 180-day exclusivity period for generic drugs. Additionally, agreements not covered by the Act must also be filed if they are contingent upon or related to the aforementioned agreements. The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act expanded reporting requirements for agreements between biosimilar product applicants and brand companies, as well as agreements between two biosimilar product applicants. Section 4004 further expanded reporting requirements to include agreements between generic drug applicants and biosimilar product applicants, as well as other agreements entered within 30 days of the aforementioned agreements. This section also includes technical changes to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The provision is estimated to decrease direct spending outlays by $41 million from FY2019 through FY2028. The provision in the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act is estimated to decrease direct spending outlays by $41 million from FY2019 through FY2028. The table below lists relevant provisions requiring reports, guidance, or actions in order of section number."
