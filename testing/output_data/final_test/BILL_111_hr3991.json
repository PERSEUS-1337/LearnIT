    "content": "The \"Emergency Influenza Containment Act\" ensures American workers can stay home when sick without financial harm. It requires paid sick leave for contagious diseases. An employer must provide paid sick leave to an employee who is directed to leave work due to symptoms of a contagious illness or close contact with an infected individual, for up to 5 workdays per year. Compliance is met when the employee follows the employer's instructions. Employees are entitled to paid sick leave for up to 5 days per year if directed to leave work due to symptoms of a contagious illness. The leave duration is calculated based on the employee's regular rate of pay and scheduled work hours. Guidelines will be provided by the Secretary of Labor to assist employers in calculating the paid sick leave amount. Employees can receive paid sick leave under this Act for up to 5 days per year if they show symptoms of a contagious illness. Employers may require reasonable notice for continued leave, and can terminate it if the employee no longer shows symptoms or poses a contagion threat. Employers must display a notice outlining the requirements of the Act in visible areas at the workplace. It is illegal for employers to retaliate against employees who follow the Act's directives or file complaints related to it. Enforcement measures are in place to ensure compliance. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT. Employers failing to pay sick leave will be penalized under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Willful violation of termination rules will result in penalties under the same Act. SEC. 7.
