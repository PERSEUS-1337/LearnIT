    "content": "Adversarial examples in machine learning have raised concerns about trustworthiness due to small input perturbations causing system failures. A new information-theoretic model explains adversarial attacks as exploiting feature redundancies in ML algorithms, proving their necessity for adversarial examples to exist. This model addresses key questions in the field and is supported by empirical measurements. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are versatile and successful in various applications but are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can deceive well-trained models. Empirical measurements show that adversarial examples introduce enough redundancy to disrupt machine learners' decision-making. Recommendations are provided to enhance the robustness of machine learners against such attacks. Adversarial examples can deceive well-trained models with high success rates. They can be generated for different types of data and ML models, and are transferable between models. These examples can also exist in the physical world, raising security concerns. Defensive methods have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. Defensive methods have been proposed to counter adversarial attacks, but all defense and detection methods are still vulnerable. Adversarial examples remain a challenge, leading to an arms race between attacks and defenses. A theoretical model is proposed in this paper to understand and mitigate adversarial perturbations in ML experiments. The design process of ML experiments focuses on mitigating the effect of adversarial attacks. Adversarial examples are illustrated using a simple perceptron network learning the Boolean equal operator and then generalized into a universal classification model based on Shannon's theory of communication. The paper explains how adversarial examples relate to the thermodynamics of computation and proves a necessary condition for their existence. Contributions include a model for adversarial examples, a proof that redundant features make ML models vulnerable to attacks, experiments showing the relationship between data redundancy and adversarial examples, and recommendations to mitigate adversarial attacks in the ML process. The curr_chunk discusses the generation of adversarial examples in machine learning by adding perturbations to benign samples to cause misclassification. Previous research has focused on understanding the properties of adversarial examples and developing defense algorithms. While some studies have explored the linearity of deep neural networks and data manifold to understand these perturbations, no actionable recommendations have been made to improve the robustness of machine learners against adversarial attacks. The curr_chunk discusses different approaches to generating adversarial examples in machine learning, including the fast gradient sign method and optimization algorithms. Attacks can be classified as targeted or untargeted, depending on the adversary's objective. Targeted attacks aim to modify inputs to be classified as a specific class, while untargeted attacks aim to cause misclassification. Adversarial attacks in machine learning aim to cause misclassification of perturbed inputs. These attacks can be categorized as white-box or black-box, depending on the adversary's knowledge of the classifier. Adversarial examples are not limited to ML and can be compared to acoustic noise masking in our hearing system. This effect is utilized in various applications like MP3 audio compression and privacy protection. In machine learning, adversarial attacks aim to cause misclassification of perturbed inputs, similar to optical illusions and defense mechanisms in other domains. A small amount of noise can dramatically affect the separation capability of a network, as shown in FIG1. The text introduces a perceptron network model implementing the Boolean equal function (\"NXOR\") to derive mathematical understanding. The input x3 is redundant in the Boolean equal function (\"NXOR\") between x1 and x2, as x3 does not influence the result. Adding x3 doubles the input space, making it unfeasible to train all possible input triples. A practical ML scenario involves training a network like in FIG0 to model x1 == x2 without a third input. The input x3 is redundant in the Boolean equal function between x1 and x2. Training weights w1 and w2 to suppress x3 by exploring all combinations results in 100% accuracy when w1 = w2 = 0. The network performs better when it pays less attention to x3, with setting one of the weights to 0 improving the result. The importance of suppressing noise in a network is highlighted by the higher potential change leading to higher potential impacts. Neurons with redundant inputs should have high thresholds or weights close to 0. In a large network, suppressing redundant bits of an image with low weights prevents an exponential explosion of patterns. The machine learner matches unknown noisy patterns to known patterns, erasing noise bits to map to known outputs. Energy is needed to reset noisy bits added by the channel. The machine learner erases noisy bits to match unknown patterns to known outputs, requiring energy to reset noisy bits added by the channel. This generalization capability allows the model to eliminate irrelevant bits, making it vulnerable to black box adversarial attacks by adding enough irrelevant input to overflow the system. In black box adversarial attacks, adding irrelevant input can overflow the system. Adversarial patterns are harder to learn as they require erasing more bits. Small perturbations can have significant effects, even with just one bit of difference. Training with noisy examples can impact machine learning models. Training with noisy examples can make machine learners more robust by reducing redundancies. However, specific whitebox attacks, such as perceptron threshold overflow, will always be possible due to the unfeasibility of training against the entire input space. Surrogate machine learners may learn to erase the same bits as the original ML attack, leading to transferability-based attacks. Feature redundancy is shown to be a necessary condition for adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are instances where a small perturbation causes a machine learning model to misclassify an input. This contradicts the generalization assumption of the model. Even though a single counter example does not render the model useless, it challenges its reliability. The existence of adversarial examples challenges the reliability of machine learning models by showing that the feature representation contains redundancy. More robust models are expected to generate more succinct features for decision making, as demonstrated in empirical results. The empirical results in Section 4.2 justify the theoretical model for adversarial examples. The experiments aim to determine if adversarial examples are more complex and require more parameters in a neural network. The model suggests that adversarial examples have higher complexity due to an increase in irrelevant bits. The complexity increase in neural networks towards a target function is shown by the difficulty in memorizing adversarial examples compared to benign ones. More model capacity is needed for training adversarial examples, quantitatively measured by the minimal parameters required to memorize all training data in MLP models. The error is set to evaluate the training success by randomly setting some values to zero and marking them untrainable. We explore the minimal number of parameters using binary search to reduce computation complexity. Benign examples require fewer weights to memorize on different datasets with various attack methods, while adversarial examples require larger capacity. Adversarial examples have more complexity and require higher model capacity for fitting and prediction. In order to detect adversarial attacks, machine-learning independent measures of entropy are needed. Four metrics for entropy measurement were utilized on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing higher unpredictability with increasing values. Compression estimation revealed that optimal quantification ratios exist for DNNs, with appropriate perceptual compression not being harmful. Reproduced experiments confirmed the results, indicating that benign images have lower complexity in all four metrics. The text discusses the design of four metrics for text entropy estimation and the impact of adversarial attacks on text complexity and entropy. Adversarial texts introduce more redundant bits, leading to higher complexity and entropy. This suggests the potential for reducing adversarial attacks through entropy measurement for both images and text data types. The text investigates the relation between feature redundancy and ML model robustness by measuring the entropy of extracted features. Different models with varying levels of robustness are designed and tested using All-CNNs network. The entropy of feature maps is estimated using perceptual compression and MLE/JVHW estimators. The study explores the impact of adversarial examples on model robustness by adjusting ratios during re-training. Feature maps are compressed and entropy is measured using MLE and JVHW estimators. Results show lower redundancy in feature maps as model robustness increases, indicating adversarial examples act as a regularizer. Adversarial examples in machine learning exploit feature redundancy, causing models to make arbitrary mistakes. Redundancy can affect multiple models trained on the same data, leading to transferability-based attacks. The assumption of using every pixel as input for image classification introduces redundant information, impacting model performance. The highest priority recommendation is to reduce redundancies in machine learning models. Before deep learning, manually-crafted features were used to reduce redundancies, but this practice has been abandoned with the introduction of deep learning. Automatic techniques, such as lossy compression, can help reduce redundancy and mitigate adversarial attacks. In the context of reducing redundancies in machine learning models, it is recommended to use training procedures that involve increasing quantization of input data while maintaining accuracy. This approach helps identify the point where the most noise and least content is lost, making the model less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Surrogate methods like different compression techniques can be used to estimate input complexity and detect adversarial examples. However, achieving 100% accuracy in training every possible input contradicts the concept of generalization. The text discusses the concept of generalization in machine learning and the contradiction of achieving 100% accuracy in training. A theorem is presented, proving the existence of adversarial examples by constructing a sufficient statistic with lower entropy. The probability densities of adversarial and benign examples are compared, showing how adversarial features can be enforced to mimic benign examples. The text discusses constructing a sufficient statistic with lower entropy to show the existence of adversarial examples. It compares the probability densities of adversarial and benign examples, demonstrating how adversarial features can mimic benign examples. The study tested datasets with different signal-to-noise ratios by adding Gaussian noise to real pixels, leading to DNNs failing due to redundancy. Even a small amount of random noise can significantly reduce testing accuracy, indicating that noise can deceive ML models."
