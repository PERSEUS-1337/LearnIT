    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Tuberculosis (TB) Now Act\". Congress acknowledges that tuberculosis is a major global health concern, causing millions of deaths annually. The disease is prevalent among young women and individuals with HIV/AIDS. Inadequate treatment has led to its spread across borders, with a significant number of cases in the United States attributed to foreign-born individuals. Efforts to control tuberculosis in developing countries are crucial for its elimination in the US. The global spread of tuberculosis poses a threat to Americans due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains. Up to 50 million individuals may be infected with MDR-TB, with treatment costs skyrocketing to $250,000 per patient in the US. MDR-TB kills over half of infected individuals in industrialized nations and is a virtual death sentence in developing countries without access to treatment. The World Health Organization recommends directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) as the best curative method for tuberculosis, including low-cost diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and ensuring patients complete their medication. SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND CONTROL. Assistance for tuberculosis prevention, treatment, and control is being enhanced by expanding the use of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) and addressing multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in countries with high tuberculosis rates. Efforts are focused on achieving a cure rate of at least 95 percent by utilizing DOTS or other internationally accepted tuberculosis control strategies. In enhancing tuberculosis prevention and treatment, funding requirements are amended to allocate at least 75 percent for diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis using DOTS strategy or other internationally accepted control strategies. This includes support for the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility of WHO's Stop TB Partnership. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include a requirement for the President to report on programs, projects, and activities related to foreign assistance annually. This report should detail progress made towards achieving specified goals. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to increase funding for fiscal year 2002 to $200,000,000, up from $60,000,000 in fiscal year 2001."
