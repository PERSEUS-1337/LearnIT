    "content": "The sense of Congress is that clear funding priorities should be established in case the US Government reaches the debt limit or a funding gap. Top priorities include paying debt, salaries of Armed Forces members, national security priorities, and Social Security benefits. Non-essential government funding should be limited if the debt limit is reached. In the event of reaching the debt limit, the US Government will prioritize paying debt held by the public and providing pay and allowances to members of the Armed Forces. The President can allocate funds for national security priorities, Social Security benefits, and other obligations in a specified order of priority. Additionally, there are limitations on certain obligations for departments, agencies, and international organizations. Certain departments and agencies, such as the Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Health & Human Services, have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be allocated to satisfy obligations. The limit is set at 20 percent of the amount that would have been available if the statutory limit had not been reached. The Office of Personnel Management, the United States Agency for International Development, and an independent establishment defined under section 104 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 3. Emergency appropriation of funds for defense and national security during a funding gap. During a funding gap, the Secretary of the Treasury will provide necessary funds for pay and allowances to military members and vital national security priorities. A funding gap is defined as any period after an obligation is incurred by the Government of the United States. The term \"funding gap\" refers to any period after the beginning of a fiscal year where appropriations for obligations have not been enacted. SEC. 4. REPORT ON PRIORITIZATION. The President must submit a plan to Congress within 30 days of this Act's enactment, detailing how government operations will continue if the US Government's debt reaches the statutory limit. Additionally, the President must prioritize obligations other than those listed in section 2 in such a scenario, and provide a plan for government operations during a funding gap. The plan must detail government operations during a funding gap, including determining essential Federal employees."
