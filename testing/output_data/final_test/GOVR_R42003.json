    "content": "Prior to 1993, homosexuality was banned in the military under DOD regulations. Bill Clinton promised to \"lift the ban\" during his campaign. Congress passed P.L. 103-160, codified in 10 U.S. Code Section 654, which outlined grounds for discharge related to homosexuality. The Clinton Administration implemented the \"Don't ask, Don't tell\" policy in response to P.L. 103-160, which prohibited questioning military members about their sexuality. President Obama expressed his desire to repeal the law during his State of the Union speech in 2010. A Comprehensive Review Working Group was formed to study the impacts of repealing Section 654 of Title 10 of the United States Code. The Comprehensive Review Working Group (CRWG) report, issued on November 30, 2010, led to the repeal of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. Legislation (H.R. 2965) was signed into law by President Obama as P.L. 111-321 on December 20, 2010, setting the process in motion for the repeal of Section 654, Title 10 United States Code. Repeal would take effect 60 days after certification by the President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The repeal of Section 654, Title 10 USC, led to the end of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. The certification for the repeal occurred on July 22, 2011, and the policy was officially repealed on September 20, 2011, following a plan developed by the Repeal Implementation Team. The Department of Defense implemented a three-tiered approach to repealing DADT, focusing on training and education for senior leadership, troops, and civilian defense employees. Questions arise regarding Congress's role in oversight, state National Guardsmen, benefits for gay service members, and the federal statute on recognition. The report will examine equal treatment issues for service members and their partners/dependents, the impact on the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the potential reinstatement of administrative regulations. Congress has the authority to regulate the Armed Forces, while the President is responsible for implementing laws, including the repeal of Section 654 prohibiting open homosexuality. Repeal of Section 654 allows for the possibility of future regulations restricting gay individuals from openly serving in the military. Some argue that Congress should enact statutory language to prevent such restrictions, while others believe legal challenges would deter a return to a gay ban. Advocates for repealing Section 654 suggest that Congress could prevent state governors from establishing rules for state National Guard members. Concerns include potential challenges to a governor's authority. Congress may respond by holding hearings and proposing legislative changes affected by the repeal. The House Armed Services Committee included proposed language in its 2012 National Defense version. The House Armed Services Committee proposed language in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1540) regarding the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law. The proposed section required top military officials to certify that the repeal would not harm combat units. However, this language was not included in the final version of the Act. The Defense Authorization Act did not include language regarding the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law. Representative Joe Wilson planned to hold hearings on the repeal, stating it was 'irresponsible' to repeal the ban without proper hearings. Representative Duncan Hunter introduced a bill to expand the list of officials needed to certify the repeal, including other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Supporters of H.R. 337 criticized the reliance on only three military leaders' certification for the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Opponents viewed adding language requiring consent from the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff as a \"poison pill.\" The bill was referred to the Committee on Armed Services without further action. Representative Buck McKeon is seeking written assessments on the policy change's impact on recruiting, retention, and readiness to potentially block the scheduled repeal on Sept. 20. With the repeal of Section 654, Congress can still oversee the effects of the repeal on military cohesion, disciplinary issues, and regulatory changes. Military personnel and their dependents are eligible for various benefits and privileges, with some benefits based on marriage. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) defines marriage as between one man and one woman, impacting benefits for same-sex couples. DOD benefits like SGLI require a designated recipient, with the spouse being the default beneficiary if not specified. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) limits benefits for same-sex couples, affecting eligibility for military benefits such as health care, travel, survivor benefits, and housing. Same-sex spouses are not recognized as eligible beneficiaries under federal law, leading to disparities in benefits compared to heterosexual couples. Questions arise regarding adoption and eligibility for DOD Dependent Schools for children of military same-sex couples. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) limits benefits for same-sex couples in the military, creating disparities in benefits compared to heterosexual couples. Same-sex marriages are not recognized for assignments or command-sponsored considerations. In case of death, the adopted child would receive the Death Gratuity unless the spouse is designated as the beneficiary. Efforts to repeal DOMA have been ongoing, with recent actions from the executive and legislative branches. In February 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder deemed DOMA unconstitutional and allowed Members of Congress to defend it. House and Senate introduced language supporting DOMA, with Speaker John Boehner appointing Paul Clement to represent the House. In February 2012, Holder wrote to Boehner stating the Justice Department's agreement with plaintiffs in a lawsuit that DOMA was unconstitutional. Navy Chaplains allowed same-sex marriages in Navy Chapels, facing criticism from some Members of Congress. The House Armed Services Committee proposed language in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act affirming the Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. This would also establish regulations for marriage ceremonies on military installations involving DOD personnel. Marriages on DOD installations or involving DOD personnel must adhere to the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman. The House Appropriations Committee included language in a proposed bill stating that no funds may be used for activities against this definition. The Senate versions of the bills did not have similar language. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 includes language protecting military chaplains from adverse personnel actions based on their conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs. Chaplains cannot be compelled to perform same-sex marriages if it goes against their beliefs. The issue of chaplains performing same-sex marriages at military facilities without adverse actions is raised, especially if such unions are not recognized under DOMA. The CRWG recommended against segregated housing for gay and lesbian service members. The CRWG recommended against segregated housing for gay and lesbian service members, suggesting that the Department of Defense prohibit berthing or billeting assignments based on sexual orientation. Commanders can still make individualized decisions in the interest of maintaining morale and discipline. The CRWG was concerned about stigmatizing gays and lesbians with separate facilities, citing the \"separate, but equal\" treatment of blacks. Privacy and cohabitation issues were also considered. Privacy and cohabitation issues persist in the military, with concerns about same-sex couples receiving special assignments while opposite-sex couples face restrictions. Congressional treatment of sodomy has evolved over time, with laws prohibiting such acts and the creation of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) prohibits sodomy, defined as unnatural carnal copulation with another person or animal. The CRWG recommended repealing Article 125 in line with the Lawrence v. Texas decision, which struck down a state law banning consensual homosexual sodomy. Other forms of sodomy, like forcible acts or those involving minors, can be prosecuted under different articles. The UCMJ prohibits sodomy, including unnatural carnal copulation. Acts involving minors or deemed \"service discrediting\" can be prosecuted under Articles 120 or 134. The General Article covers disorders and neglects affecting good order and discipline. Legislative provisions in the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act aim to repeal sodomy under Article 125 and expand Article 120 to include rape and assault against any person. The Senate Armed Services Committee report proposed changes to Article 120 of the UCMJ, aiming to include three sections for different types of sexual offenses. The repeal of Art. 125 would have eliminated the prosecution of consensual sodomy, returning prosecution to pre-1920s standards. However, Art. 125 remains in effect, and prosecutions for \"consensual\" sodomy have not been reported. The repeal of Section 654 has led to advocacy for further changes in military policy, with complaints of discrimination against transgender individuals. The Transgender American Veterans Association president notes that despite the repeal of the ban on gay service members, transgender individuals still face discrimination in the military. The military's policy on gays has raised concerns about the acceptance of transgender individuals. Individuals with mental disorders that interfere with military duties are not allowed to serve, including those with \"sexual and gender identity disorders.\" Homosexuality was removed from the DSM as a mental disorder in 1973, a decision that was controversial. There are ongoing discussions about the status of transgender individuals in the military. Following the enactment of P.L. 111-321, changes regarding transgender individuals by the APA could impact military policies. Some college activists have used \"transgender discrimination\" to block military recruiters on campus, but this has not significantly affected military-academia relations. Reporting requirements for schools denying ROTC or recruiter access were repealed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. The repeal of Section 654 of Title 10, United States Code may lead to additional issues for Congress, the Department of Defense, and the courts to consider beyond the waiting period following the enactment of P.L. 111-321."
