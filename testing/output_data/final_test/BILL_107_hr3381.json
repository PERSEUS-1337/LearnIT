Tax exempt treatment of certain bonds issued in connection with delinquent real property taxes. Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a special rule for delinquent tax bonds, stating that such bonds issued primarily for collecting delinquent real property taxes for school districts below post-secondary level are not treated as arbitrage bonds. The bond proceeds must be transferred to governmental units within 30 days of issuance, not exceeding the amount of delinquent real property taxes certified by the units. The maturity date of the bond must not be later. The bond's maturity date must not exceed 3 months after issuance, and any delinquent real property taxes received by governmental units must be used within 3 months for bond payments. Refunding bonds issued to refund a bond meeting certain requirements must have a maturity date not later than 26 months after the original bond issuance. Coordination with hedge bond rules includes an exception for delinquent tax bonds. The term 'hedge bond' excludes bonds meeting section 148(i)(2) requirements. Coordination with pooled financial bond rules includes applying section 148(i) to such bonds. Coordination with private activity bond rules involves adding section 148(i) applicability. The amendments made by this section apply to bonds issued after the enactment date. Refunding bonds must meet specific requirements to be treated as issued on the date of the refunded bond."
