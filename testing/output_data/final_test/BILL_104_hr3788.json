The Act defines key terms such as fundraising organization, National Park Foundation, park, and Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary may enter into a memorandum of agreement with an entity to act as an authorized fundraising organization for the park. The fundraising organization will issue taxable bonds in exchange for the park surcharge collected. They must adhere to professional standards, undergo audits, and the United States is not liable for the bonds except in specific circumstances. The faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of bonds and interest accruing on them. The fundraising organization must enter into a memorandum of agreement detailing the bond issue, maturity not exceeding 20 years, per capita amount for bond repayment and administration costs, project funding, responsibilities of the Secretary and organization, and procedures for agreement modifications. Additionally, a park surcharge is mentioned. SEC. 5. PARK SURCHARGE. The Secretary of the Interior may authorize a surcharge of up to $2 per individual on top of the entrance fee collected for national parks. The surcharge will be used to cover bond issue costs, administration expenses, and maintain a reserve. Any excess funds will be given to the National Park Foundation for the benefit of all national park units. SEC. 6. USE OF BOND PROCEEDS. Bond proceeds under this Act can be used for projects related to facility design, construction, operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement in the park. The projects must comply with laws governing the National Park System, park-specific laws, and the park's general management plan. Interest earned on bond proceeds can be used for reserve requirements and administrative expenses by the fundraising organization. The bond proceeds can be used for park projects, and any interest not used for projects will go to the National Park Foundation for the benefit of all park units. Administrative expenses related to bond management will be covered by the proceeds. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Treasury, will issue regulations to carry out this Act."
