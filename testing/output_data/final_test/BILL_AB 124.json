    "title": "AB 124",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 12439 of the Government Code is repealed, abolishing any state position vacant for six consecutive monthly pay periods starting July 1, 2002. The Director of Finance can authorize reestablishment under certain conditions, such as a hiring freeze or unsuccessful attempts to fill the position within six months. The position has been designated as a management position for collective bargaining and held vacant pending the appointment of the director during a transition between Governors. The position is classified as hard-to-fill, and late budget enactment delays filling it. The Controller can reestablish a position if certain conditions are met, such as providing 24-hour care or meeting licensing requirements. The position is being held vacant for various reasons related to leaves of absence and mandatory rights of return. Elimination of the position would result in a greater loss of state revenues than savings. The position funded by Section 221 of the Food and Agricultural Code responds to unforeseen agricultural circumstances. Departments must keep records for audit purposes. Exceptions to abolishment include positions exempt from civil service and those authorized for the California State University. No money from the Budget Act can be used to pay the salary of abolished state positions. The Controller provides reports on abolished state positions annually to the Department of Finance and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. Departments are prohibited from manipulating personnel transactions to avoid compliance. Each department must address its adherence to these regulations in their reports. The term \"department\" includes various state government entities with the authority to appoint civil service positions. Section 22775 of the Government Code defines \"family member\" as an employee's spouse, domestic partner, and children, excluding former spouses or partners. Section 22781 explains \"prefunding\" as periodic payments to fund postemployment health benefits. Section 22843.1 is added to the Government Code. Section 22843.1 of the Government Code requires state employee or annuitant offices to verify family member eligibility for health benefit plans periodically. Documentation must be maintained in official files, with different verification frequencies for spouses, domestic partners, children, and stepchildren. Employees, annuitants, and family members eligible for Medicare may enroll in a Medicare health benefit plan. Those enrolled in a prescription drug plan under Part D of Medicare cannot be enrolled in a board-approved health benefit plan, unless the latter includes prescription drug coverage. Employees and family members excluded from Medicare health benefit plan enrollment by federal law or regulation are not subject to this section. No further exemptions will be granted after July 1, 2015. The board must notify relevant parties of proposed benefit and premium adjustments before approval. The board must report annually to the Legislature and the Director of Finance on the success or failure of each health benefit plan, including costs, member satisfaction, quality of care, and accessibility to preferred providers for rural members. The health benefits program overview includes descriptions of health plans, benefits, out-of-pocket expenses, geographic coverage, enrollment and expenditure data, and premium changes from the prior year with reasons provided. The curr_chunk provides a detailed overview of benefit design, changes, risk discussion, medical trend changes, premium reconciliation, and member health data in the health benefits program. The curr_chunk discusses member health data, federal subsidies impact, cost of benefits, plan quality performance, and member satisfaction in the health benefits program. The curr_chunk provides details on quality measurements, risk assessment, reserve levels, administrative expenditures, and funding sources related to the board's health plan contracts. The curr_chunk discusses funding sources, investment strategies, performance of the Public Employees\u2019 Contingency Reserve Fund and the Public Employees\u2019 Health Care Fund, changes in strategic direction, and policy initiatives. Additionally, it amends Section 22940 of the Government Code to establish the Annuitants\u2019 Health Care Coverage Fund in the State Treasury. The Annuitants\u2019 Health Care Coverage Fund is continuously appropriated for prefunding health care coverage for annuitants, with the board having control over administration and investments. Moneys from investment income in designated state subaccounts cannot be used for benefits until certain conditions are met. The designated state subaccount must reach 100 percent funded ratio for paying benefits to state annuitants and dependents. A separate account within the fund identifies prefunding contributions for specific state entities. Alternative funding strategies can be agreed upon in writing. The act is related to the Budget Bill and will take effect immediately. The Legislature intends to make statutory changes related to the Budget Act of 2015."
