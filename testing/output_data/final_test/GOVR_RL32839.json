    "content": "Border security is crucial for protecting Americans from terrorists. Securing the 7,500 miles of land border with Canada and Mexico, as well as patrolling 95,000 miles of shoreline and 361 ports, is a complex task due to the high volume of people and vehicles passing through. With 422 primary airports and 124 commercial service airports, along with 110,000 miles of highway, the challenge of providing adequate border security is evident. The report discusses the vast infrastructure supporting the US economy, including highways, rail tracks, and bridges. It presents graphical presentations to identify vulnerabilities in border security and proposes an integrated approach. This is the first in a series of reports aiming to analyze complex border security issues and suggest alternative policies. The report discusses selected programs and policies in place for border security, including efforts to interdict terrorists and their weapons at the U.S. border. It also explores possible new directions and policy options for higher levels of border security. Border security efforts extend beyond the border itself to include targeting and pre-inspection of people and cargo in originating ports worldwide, cross-border activities between ports of entry, and inland interception of goods and individuals. This report focuses on border security measures and does not delve into domestic intelligence or law enforcement efforts against terrorists within the country. The report focuses on border security measures and does not cover domestic intelligence or law enforcement efforts against terrorists within the country. It employs policy frameworks to understand and analyze activities related to border security, aiming to provide structure, generate hypotheses, and prioritize actions. The homeland security effort involves a series of concentric circles or screens, starting with preventive efforts outside the country and moving towards more localized measures. Enhanced intelligence is crucial to identify terrorist groups and individuals to lower the danger to the country and its people. The importance of enhanced intelligence in learning about terrorist groups, their motives, planned actions, and weapons is crucial for preventing attacks. Diplomacy and cooperation with other countries can further enhance efforts to contain the danger abroad before attacks on U.S. soil. This initial stage is vital for the success of preventing attacks and denying terrorists access to weapons of mass destruction. Failure to focus on this stage could overwhelm border screening efforts with dangerous travelers and materials. The second stage of border security efforts focuses on intercepting dangerous travelers and materials at the border. Approximately 61% of the DHS budget and over 85% of manpower are dedicated to this goal, with key actors being the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Border Patrol (BP), and the Coast Guard (CG). This interception phase is crucial in protecting the nation's infrastructure and nearly 300 million people living in a free society. The reminder to policy analysts is that border security efforts extend beyond the border, utilizing domestic intelligence and law enforcement capabilities to prevent attacks on vulnerable populations and infrastructure. These capabilities include the FBI, ICE, CBP, ATF, and localized Joint Terrorist Tracking Task Forces. Hardening targets is challenging due to the large number of potential targets and the opportunistic nature of terrorists. The government can implement targeted measures to protect critical sites like nuclear power and chemical plants, as well as develop sensors and warning devices for the population against chemical or biological weapons. Citizens can be educated on protective actions. In case of an attack, efforts should focus on minimizing damage, aiding the injured, and rebuilding society effectively. This phase is crucial as other forms of protection may not be perfect. The response phase receives increased policy attention for various scenarios, including terrorist attacks and natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. While funding is prioritized for border security and military operations related to terrorism, the preparedness and response stage of protection is essential due to inherent vulnerability. Investors should diversify protection measures to build overlapping layers of security. The report focuses on border security in this context. Border security has evolved into \"good border management,\" with contributions from various disciplines like political science, geography, sociology, and economics. Prior to 9/11, trends like geopolitical shifts and economic integration challenged traditional notions of borders defined by nation-states. The challenges of increasing economic integration and border town integration are leading towards a world where borders are becoming more permeable. After 9/11, the importance of border security in the United States has been reevaluated, with good border management being a key part of national security strategy. The key to successful border management is accurately identifying high-risk passengers and cargo while facilitating legitimate cross-border traffic. Border enforcement agents engage in an identification and verification process to prevent the entry of dangerous goods and people without hindering the flow of goods and individuals. The complexity of current entry processing procedures for both people and cargo has sparked debates on the best approach. The current entry processing procedures for people and cargo are complex, involving multiple steps that can be vulnerable to interference or interception. Identifying the first step in the process is challenging, whether it's when goods leave the factory or when individuals apply for passports or visas. The 'last' step is the inspection at the port of entry, raising questions about what constitutes an inspection. One of the key questions for policy makers is defining what constitutes an inspection, which may involve physical actions like fingerprinting or x-rays. The terms 'inspection' and 'screening' are often used interchangeably, with inspection involving examination of goods or people, while screening applies filters to information or characteristics for entry. The Security and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port Act (P.L. 109-347) defines terms like examination, inspection, scan, screening, and search for maritime container inspections. There is a debate on the level of inspection for U.S.-bound containers, with some calling for increased inspection levels or even 100% inspection. The level of inspection will continue to be a significant part of the border security debate. Good border management is crucial for security. After 9/11, the US borders were closed, causing significant economic losses. Delays at border crossings impacted industries like the auto industry. DaimlerChrysler and Ford announced plant closures due to economic impacts of border management complexities. The need for redefined understanding of borders for effective policy making is highlighted. The current environment for securing U.S. borders is complex, as noted by Admiral James Loy. Viewing the border as a flexible concept where it begins at the start of a U.S.-bound journey allows for a wider approach to border control. The path that goods or people travel to enter the United States is divided into zones: source zone (country of origin), departure zone (foreign port of entry/exit), transit zone, arrival or approach zone (domestic port of entry), and destination zone (interior of the destination country). These conceptualizations aim to guide effective border management policies by considering the various stages of the U.S.-bound journey. The path of goods or people entering the United States is divided into zones: source zone (country of origin), departure zone (foreign port of entry/exit), transit zone, arrival zone (domestic port of entry), and destination zone (interior of the destination country). This journey can involve traveling through other countries before reaching the U.S., but direct travel is also possible without passing through transit zones. The OECD offers another perspective on border visualization. The OECD's conceptualization focuses on the shipment of vessel-borne containers and identifies three principal flows in the international movement of goods: logistics chain, custody transfer, and information/document movement. To secure cargo shipments from terrorists or criminals, a wide range of potential targets including people, places, conveyances, and information must be secured. Internationally shipped cargoes travel through various conveyances, infrastructures, places, and involve multiple documents to complete the journey. Cargo travels through multiple documents and locations on its journey from the source zone to the distribution zone, involving various modes of transportation and potential stops for consolidation before reaching the port of exit. Cargo travels through various modes of transportation and stops for consolidation before reaching the port of exit. It is then transferred to an ocean-going vessel for transit to the final port of entry in the destination country. The cargo may be warehoused, de-consolidated, or re-consolidated for distribution. Multiple actors are involved in the logistics chain, with maritime containers posing the most complexity. Air cargo shipments can move through various modes of transportation, including consolidation at airports and transit through different airports before reaching the final destination. Land-border shipments can travel from source to destination zone in hours or minutes, thanks to the highly integrated 'just-in-time' (JIT) system. The advent of highly integrated 'just-in-time' (JIT) shipping is prominent in the automotive industry, with seats for General Motors (GM) cars arriving at the GM plant in Detroit less than an hour after being assembled and sent across the border. Truck transport along the southern border involves 'drayage' where short-haul trucks ferry cargo back and forth, adding an extra transfer phase to the process. Rail shipments crossing the border follow a similar flow as truck shipments. For shipments crossing the border by rail, the flow is similar to truck shipments. Cargo shipments start with a buyer and an originating shipper, often the manufacturer. Intermediaries like buying agents and freight forwarders assist in transporting cargo from factory to port. Various actors such as customs brokers, carriers, and consolidators can provide individual services needed for the shipment process. Upon arrival at the port of exit, cargo shipments go through customs control and are handed over to the port operator, then to the maritime carrier for transport. In the destination country, the process is reversed with the cargo passing through various entities before reaching the buyer. There are two sets of actors involved: those handling paperwork and those in physical custody of the cargo. The movement of people from source zone to destination zone involves obtaining necessary documents such as visas for foreign nationals traveling to the United States. Admissibility reviews are conducted by State before issuing visas. Prior to obtaining a visa, aliens undergo admissibility reviews by State Department consular officers abroad. Upon receiving a visa, aliens must undergo an inspection at a U.S. port of entry to ensure eligibility for entry under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Goods entering the U.S. also require accompanying documents, with some imports needing up to 40 separate documents for the journey from origin to destination. Each shipment from the source zone to the destination requires documentation, including commercial and customs entry documents. Importers must file entry documentation with CBP for each importation, regardless of duty payment. To expedite clearance, importers often file documents electronically and pay bonds before the merchandise arrives at the port of entry. Entry documents include proper bills of lading. The merchandise arrives at the port of entry with entry documents such as bills of lading, entry forms, and invoices. Customs collects information for security purposes from manifests, including details about the shipper, importer, and nature of the merchandise. CBP uses this data to target and screen high-risk shipments for security and commercial entry purposes. Inspectors examine goods for admissibility and security concerns before releasing them into commerce. Visitors requiring a visa follow a specific path illustrated in Figure 5. Figure 5 illustrates the path for visitors needing a visa to enter the country, starting from the U.S. Embassy abroad, through various checkpoints, and finally to the destination. The OECD highlighted risks associated with ocean-borne cargo shipping, including risks related to the cargo, vessels, people involved, and financial aspects. These risk factors are applicable to other modes of transportation as well. Cargo shipments pose a risk of smuggling weapons or contraband. The risk factors associated with cargo shipping include the potential smuggling of weapons, contraband, or people, such as terrorists or immigrants. These risks apply to various modes of transportation, not just vessel-borne containers. Vessels themselves can be targets for attacks or used as weapons. Border management policies can enhance security without causing delays. Border processes aim to expedite legitimate traffic while impeding illegitimate flows of people and contraband. Smuggling involves various commodities and can be interconnected with terrorist networks, posing a significant concern for federal law enforcement. The same groups involved in smuggling activities today may engage in different illicit activities tomorrow. The concern is that criminal groups involved in smuggling activities may become more sophisticated and flexible, potentially working with terrorists in the future. These groups could establish transportation networks to smuggle goods or people into the country, bypassing legitimate processes and ports. Criminals and terrorists can manipulate legitimate cargo to smuggle contraband, creating illegal flows of cargo with different patterns than discussed in the report. The report provides graphical representations to understand the flow of goods and people across the border, including legal and illegal crossings. Border security is complex, and the frameworks in the report help policymakers grasp legitimate flows. Criminals and terrorists can exploit legitimate cargo to smuggle contraband and bypass official ports, necessitating a deeper understanding of the flow of goods and people into the United States. The report is the first in a series of three addressing border security, discussing current policies and programs to improve security. These policies include pushing the border outwards, hardening the border with technology and more agents, making the border more accessible for trade and travel, strengthening it with intelligence, and engaging other actors in enforcement efforts. The effectiveness of border security policies relies on engaging various actors in enforcement efforts, including foreign governments, private sector, and other U.S. government agencies. Policies must consider unique transportation modes and may focus on specific zones or employ a layered approach. The maritime transit zone presents a distinct challenge. The transit zone in the maritime environment poses a unique challenge for cargo security as there is no single governing body responsible for regulating it. Organizations like the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are working towards harmonizing customs procedures and increasing maritime security, but their standards must be adopted by individual governments to have real authority. The third report in the series offers new directions and policy options for border and transportation security."
