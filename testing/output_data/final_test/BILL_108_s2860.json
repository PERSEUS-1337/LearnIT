    "content": "The Act titled \"Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of 2004\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that since the publication of America Burning in 1974, advances in fire prevention through sprinkler systems have not been fully implemented. In 2001, fire departments responded to 1,700,000 fires, resulting in 3,745 deaths and 21,000 injuries. Additionally, 99 firefighters were killed, excluding the events of September 11th, and fire caused $8.9 billion in property damage. Sprinklers reduce property damage by 43 to 70 percent in various types of buildings. Fire departments respond to fires every 18 seconds in the United States, with a fire breaking out in a structure every 60 seconds and in a residential structure every 80 seconds. The Station Nightclub in Rhode Island burned down, killing 99 people due to the lack of an automated sprinkler system. In contrast, the Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis, equipped with a sprinkler system, prevented injuries during a fire caused by pyrotechnics. The National Fire Protection Association notes that properly installed sprinkler systems have not resulted in more than 2 deaths in public assembly, educational, institutional, or residential buildings. The financial cost of upgrading fire counter measures in buildings built prior to fire safety codes is prohibitive for most property owners. Many State and local governments lack requirements for new structures to contain automatic sprinkler systems. There is a disincentive for building safety improvements due to a low rate of return on investment. The Nation needs incentives for the voluntary installation and retrofitting of buildings with automated sprinkler systems. The installation and retrofitting of buildings with automated sprinkler systems can save lives and reduce property damage. SEC. 3. Classification of automatic fire sprinkler systems under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include any automatic fire sprinkler system placed in service after a certain date in a building structure that was placed in service before that date. Additionally, an alternative system is added to the table in the Code. The definition of an automated fire sprinkler system is amended under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include systems classified in specific NFPA publications. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the enactment of this Act."
