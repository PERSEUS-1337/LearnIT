The focus of foreign aid policy shifted after the 9/11 attacks, with global development becoming a crucial aspect of national security strategy. The Trump Administration recognizes the importance of aid in achieving foreign policy goals and supporting national interests. This report provides information on the U.S. foreign aid program, including its objectives, costs, organization, and evolution over time. Data presented are current and reliable, sourced from USAID and annual appropriations acts. The report will be updated as new data is obtained. U.S. foreign aid is defined under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 as any item provided by the United States Government to a foreign country or international organization. Assistance is encompassed in foreign operations appropriations and international food aid title of the agriculture appropriations in the U.S. federal budget. In the U.S. federal budget, traditional foreign aid accounts are now under the 150 (international affairs) budget function. By the 1990s, it was evident that U.S. foreign aid extended beyond foreign operations and international food aid appropriations. Various U.S. departments and agencies initiated their own assistance programs, such as the Department of Defense's Nunn-Lugar effort to secure and eliminate nuclear threats. The Department of Defense's Nunn-Lugar effort provided aid to secure and eliminate nuclear weapons, with growing participation in health and humanitarian efforts. DOD-funded programs in Iraq and Afghanistan focused on training foreign forces and development, but recent declines have reduced nontraditional aid funding. In FY2011, nontraditional aid funding was $17.3 billion, representing 35% of total aid obligations. By FY2017, it decreased to $9.7 billion, accounting for 19% of total aid. The executive branch and Congress have improved data collection for a fuller picture of assistance programs, but discrepancies exist between traditional and nontraditional aid data. Foreign assistance serves various objectives and is analyzed broadly in this report. Throughout the past 70 years, there have been three key rationales for foreign assistance, with National Security being the predominant theme. Initially focused on preventing communist influence and securing U.S. base rights during the Cold War, the focus shifted post-Cold War to regional issues like Middle East peace initiatives and democracy transitions. This shift led to a decrease in foreign aid budgets in the 1990s. Foreign aid budgets decreased in the 1990s without a clear security rationale. However, after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, foreign assistance was increasingly seen as a tool in U.S. counterterrorism strategy, leading to more aid to partner states and funding for reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq. Global development has been emphasized in U.S. national security strategy under both Bush and Obama Administrations. Foreign assistance is also justified for promoting U.S. exports and improving the global economic environment, as well as addressing humanitarian concerns such as crisis response and poverty reduction. The objectives of foreign aid include promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, improving governance, expanding access to education and healthcare, protecting the environment, promoting stability in conflictive regions, and addressing human rights issues, among others. Providing assistance for humanitarian reasons is widely supported by the American public and policymakers, with the expectation that meeting these aid objectives will help achieve national security goals and create a positive global economic environment for American products. Foreign aid supports various objectives such as promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, improving governance, and addressing human rights issues. Different types of aid, including multilateral and bilateral assistance, military aid, and development programs, serve similar U.S. political objectives in different regions. Individual assistance projects can also serve multiple purposes, such as a health project that feeds orphan children while addressing HIV/AIDS. Foreign aid programs aimed at alleviating the effects of HIV/AIDS by feeding orphan children can also support grassroots democracy and civil society through indigenous NGOs. Microcredit programs for small business development help local economies and enable entrepreneurs to provide for their families. Water and sanitation improvements not only mitigate health threats but also stimulate economic growth by saving time and increasing school attendance, among other benefits. The State Department's framework for foreign aid focuses on five strategic objectives, including Peace and Security, Investing in People, and Governing Justly. The State Department's framework for foreign aid focuses on five strategic objectives: Peace and Security, Investing in People, Governing Justly and Democratically, Economic Growth, and Humanitarian Assistance. The Department of State and USAID develop their foreign operations budget request within this framework annually, allowing for an objective and program-oriented viewpoint. Reporting on aid levels categorized by objective and sector is ongoing, with USAID's Explorer website providing a comprehensive picture from all parts of the U.S. government. In FY2017, U.S. government departments and agencies obligated about $16.2 billion in bilateral development assistance, accounting for 33% of total foreign aid. This methodology categorizes foreign aid accounts in the U.S. budget based on activities they support, including military, bilateral development, multilateral development, humanitarian assistance, political/strategic, and nonmilitary security activities. These aid accounts provided a total of $49.9 billion in obligated assistance. In FY2017, the U.S. government allocated $16.2 billion in bilateral development assistance, accounting for 33% of total foreign aid. This aid is primarily managed by USAID and supports long-term projects in various areas to promote economic growth and social stability in developing countries. Other accounts also contribute to development efforts through institutions like the Peace Corps, Millennium Challenge Corporation, and National Endowment for Democracy. The State Department's programs aim to promote economic growth and prosperity through various initiatives. Agriculture programs focus on reducing poverty, hunger, and promoting sustainable practices. Private sector development programs support business associations and microfinance services. Natural resource management programs focus on conserving biodiversity and addressing climate change. Programs for governing justly and democratically include promoting rule of law, human rights, and good governance. Investing in people programs support education and government capacity building. Bilateral development assistance focuses on education, social services, water, sanitation, and healthcare, with a major emphasis on global health programs. Funding is directed towards HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, maternal and child health, family planning, and strengthening government health systems. Additionally, emergency food aid is provided in crisis situations through the Food for Peace program. The Food for Peace (FFP) Title II international food aid program, funded under Agriculture appropriations, provides nonemergency food commodities for development purposes. It also supports the \"farmer-to-farmer\" program and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. Additionally, U.S. foreign assistance combines with other donor nations to finance multilateral development projects. The U.S. government contributes $2.1 billion for development activities managed by international organizations and financial institutions, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) like the World Bank. The U.S. share of donor contributions to MDB concessional and nonconcessional loan windows varies widely. For FY2017, humanitarian assistance programs received $8.9 billion, 18% of total assistance, focusing on immediate relief in emergencies caused by natural disasters, conflicts, and failed states. The largest portion of humanitarian assistance is managed through the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account by USAID, providing relief to victims of disasters like the Ebola epidemic and crises in Syria, South Sudan, Yemen, and Venezuela. Additional assistance goes to programs for refugees and internally displaced persons, supported by the State Department and Department of Defense. The Department of Defense provides disaster relief through the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Assistance (OHDACA) account. The bulk of FFP Title II Agriculture appropriations are used by USAID to purchase U.S. agricultural commodities for emergency needs. Some accounts promote special U.S. political and strategic interests through programs funded by the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) account aims to promote stability through various activities, including direct budget support to foreign governments and sovereign loan guarantees. In FY2017, USAID and the State Department obligated $4.8 billion through this account, with a focus on countries important to the U.S. global counterterrorism strategy. Funding for the Middle East Peace Process has decreased over the years, with only 25% going to Israel, Egypt, the West Bank, and Jordan in FY2017. The Assistance to Eastern Europe and Central Asia (AEECA) account was established in FY2009 to meet strategic political interests after the Soviet empire's demise. Programs like SEED and FREEDOM Support Act aimed to help Central Europe and former Soviet Union states achieve democratic systems and free market economies. Funding decreased as countries graduated from U.S. assistance, leading to the discontinuation of the AEECA account in FY2013 appropriations. In FY2013, Congress discontinued the AEECA account due to decreased funding as countries graduated from U.S. assistance. However, increasing requests for countries threatened by Russia led to its re-emergence in FY2017 appropriations. DOD-funded nontraditional aid programs in Afghanistan supported development efforts, with programs like the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund winding down as U.S. military presence declined. Various U.S. government agencies support programs addressing global threats like terrorism, narcotics, crime, and weapons proliferation, amounting to $2.9 billion in FY2017. In FY2017, three U.S. agencies provided funding and assistance to counter the proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons, amounting to $2.9 billion. The programs aim to secure weapons and prevent their spread to rogue nations or terrorist groups. The Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR) account, managed by the State Department, supports civilian anti-terrorism efforts and humanitarian demining programs. The State Department, DOD, and USAID provide funding for counternarcotics programs, with a focus on countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Peru, and Colombia. Military assistance accounts for 29% of total U.S. foreign aid in FY2017, supporting U.S. allies with equipment and training. The DOD administers three programs with corresponding appropriations accounts for foreign military financing, military education and training, and peacekeeping funds. These programs support countries like Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and Iraq, as well as training and equipping security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. The DOD administers programs for foreign military financing, education, and peacekeeping funds for countries like Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Assistance reaches aid recipients through various programs and agencies, with USAID implementing many programs funded by different departments. USAID has been implementing a significant portion of U.S. bilateral economic development and humanitarian assistance for 50 years. It manages various accounts and programs jointly with the State Department to support development activities aligned with U.S. political and strategic goals. USAID implements a large percentage of funding for programs such as ESF, AEECA, Democracy Fund, and Global HIV/AIDS, as well as all Food for Peace Act Title II food assistance. The agency obligated around $20.55 billion for foreign assistance programs. In FY2017, USAID allocated $20.55 billion for foreign assistance programs, with 67% of its 9,747 staff working overseas. DOD implements military assistance programs in conjunction with the State Department's guidance, primarily through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. DOD also conducts state-building activities funded by defense appropriations legislation, including development assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan through the Commander's Emergency Response Program. In FY2017, the Department of Defense implemented $14.50 billion in foreign assistance programs, primarily through the Commander's Emergency Response Program in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of State manages a wide range of assistance programs, including security and refugee-related assistance. The State Department is responsible for implementing various foreign assistance accounts, including INCLE, NADR, MRA, ERMA, IO&P, OGAC, Economic Support Fund, AEECA, and Democracy Fund. While State sets policy and direction, USAID largely implements programs for these accounts. The State Department oversees various foreign assistance programs, including FMF, IMET, PKO, and PCCF, implemented by the Department of Defense. Police training programs are usually managed by the INL Office, with some exceptions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The State Department also houses the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources, responsible for coordinating foreign assistance programs. The Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources coordinates U.S. foreign assistance programs, establishes program structures and indicators, and reports data on State Department and USAID aid programs. The State Department implemented $7.66 billion in foreign assistance funding in FY2017. The Department of Health and Human Services implements global health programs, including HIV prevention and treatment through PEPFAR. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is involved in global disease control activities. In FY2017, HHS institutions implemented $2.66 billion in foreign assistance activities, including rapid outbreak response, global research, surveillance, and training. The Department of the Treasury administers U.S. contributions to the World Bank and other multilateral development institutions, managing funds distribution and dealing with foreign debt reduction issues. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) manages a program offering financial advisors to countries implementing economic reforms and combating terrorist finance. The MCC concentrates U.S. resources in low-income countries committed to reforms, with recipient countries formulating and implementing U.S.-funded project plans known as compacts emphasizing infrastructure construction. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. government corporation with a small staff of about 300. In FY2017, the MCC obligated $1.01 billion. Other government agencies involved in foreign aid programs include the Peace Corps, which supports volunteers in various projects, the Trade and Development Agency (TDA) financing trade missions, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) providing political risk insurance and financing for projects in developing countries. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) finances projects in developing countries through loans and guarantees. The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 authorized the consolidation of OPIC and USAID's Development Credit Authority into a new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC). OPIC receipts exceeded appropriations in FY2017, resulting in a net gain to the Treasury. The Inter-American Foundation and the African Development Foundation finance small-scale enterprise and grassroots self-help activities. The U.S. provides development aid in the form of grants to assist poor countries, aiming to avoid increasing their debt burden. The aid includes project-based assistance, core contributions to international organizations, technical assistance, and direct budget support. Some countries receive cash grants to support their balance-of-payments situation. Assistance provided through cash transfers supports a government's balance-of-payments situation, enabling it to purchase more U.S. goods, service debt, or allocate domestic revenues for development. Cash transfers are given as rewards for supporting counterterrorism operations, for political and strategic backing, and in exchange for political and economic reforms. Aid can come in the form of food commodities, weapons systems, or equipment like generators and computers, with military assistance including training in weapon use. Development assistance includes providing equipment and commodities integrated with other forms of aid to achieve specific objectives in social or economic sectors. Examples include providing textbooks in Afghanistan and Iraq to reform the educational sector, offering computers to microcredit institutions, and supplying antiretroviral drugs for individuals with HIV/AIDS. Construction of economic infrastructure like roads and power facilities decreased after the 1970s due to high costs, with exceptions in large assistance programs like Egypt in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1980s and 1990s, the United States provided large assistance programs for Egypt, constructing urban water and sanitation systems. Aid programs in Iraq and Afghanistan supported building schools, health clinics, roads, power plants, and irrigation systems. Economic infrastructure is now supported in developing countries through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, with recipient countries designing their own programs. Knowledge and skills transfer is a significant part of most assistance programs, including training for military forces through the International Military Education and Training Program. Tens of thousands of citizens in aid recipient countries receive technical or degree training under USAID programs. Peace Corps volunteers often serve as teachers. Aid programs offer training to law enforcement personnel. Experts from various agencies provide advice to government and private organizations. Specialists are placed in host government ministries to recommend policy reforms. USAID supports private sector businesses and civic organizations. In Russia, USAID funded the development of local think tanks for policy options. Development of locally staffed political and economic think tanks is supported by organizations like USAID, the Inter-American Foundation, and the African Development Foundation through small grants. These grants aim to foster economic and social development, encourage civic engagement, and address specific community needs. For example, grants have been used to support organizations helping resettled migrants and youth programs for gang prevention in Central America. The President has the authority to determine the terms and conditions of most forms of assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The financial condition of a country is crucial for receiving loans or grants. Most foreign aid has been in grant form in the past two decades, with loans representing less than 1% of total aid appropriations by FY2001. This shift away from loans was due to the debt problems of developing countries. The Trump Administration in the FY2019 budget request encouraged this trend. In FY2019, the Trump Administration proposed using loans instead of grants for military assistance, but Congress did not support this. USAID manages programs with loan guarantees, such as the Development Credit Authority (DCA) loan guarantee. The DCA is set to be transferred to the new IDFC in 2019 to enhance U.S. development finance capacity. The Israeli Loan Guarantee Program ensures repayment of loans made by commercial entities. The United States has a Loan Guarantee Program to support immigrants settling in Israel and for economic recovery. USAID has provided loan guarantees for Ukraine and Jordan to improve financing terms. Between 1946 and 2016, the US loaned $112.7 billion in foreign aid, with $9.18 billion in outstanding loans as of FY2016. Section 620q of the Foreign Assistance Act prohibits new assistance to countries in default. The United States has forgiven debts owed by foreign governments and supported initiatives like the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. This includes participation from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in comprehensive debt relief efforts. The United States has forgiven debts owed by foreign governments for strategic reasons, such as Poland's transition from communism, Egypt's peace efforts, and Jordan's peace accord with Israel. The US also forgave Iraqi debt and negotiated a reduction in debt to creditor nations. Development and humanitarian assistance activities are mainly carried out by private sector entities. In FY2017, the United States provided bilateral foreign assistance through private sector entities like personal service contractors, consulting firms, universities, and international organizations. USAID and the State Department oversee aid programs, allocate funds, select implementers, and monitor project implementation for effectiveness and financial accountability. Public-private partnerships are promoted for situations where business interests align with development objectives. In FY2017, the United States provided bilateral foreign assistance to over 150 countries, with aid concentrated heavily in certain countries reflecting U.S. foreign policy priorities. The top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance for FY1997, FY2007, and FY2017 showed similarities and differences, with a consistent focus on strategic interests in the Middle East. Key countries in the U.S. counterterrorism strategy, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, were among the top recipients in FY2017. In FY2017, the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance included 7 sub-Saharan African countries, with a focus on addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. South Sudan received support as a newly independent country. Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries, as well as Latin American countries, were prominent recipients in FY1997 but not in FY2017. The Middle East/North Africa region has historically received the largest share of U.S. foreign assistance, with Israel and Egypt being top recipients. The MENA region historically received the largest share of U.S. foreign assistance, with Israel and Egypt as top recipients. However, the share of aid to South and Central Asia and African nations has increased significantly in recent years, largely due to efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and HIV/AIDS initiatives. Meanwhile, aid to Europe/Eurasia has decreased. In recent years, aid to South and Central Asia and African nations has increased significantly, while aid to Europe/Eurasia has declined. East Asia/Pacific has remained at a low level, and Latin America's share has fluctuated based on U.S. strategic interests. Various methods are used to measure federal spending on foreign assistance. Foreign aid resources have gradually decreased since the late 1940s and early 1950s, with occasional increases due to major foreign policy initiatives. The lowest point in U.S. foreign aid spending since World War II was in 1997. In the mid-1980s, U.S. foreign aid spending hit a low point in 1997 at just above $20 billion (in 2017 dollars). Foreign assistance has gradually decreased to between 0.2% and 0.4% of GDP in the past three decades. Despite fluctuations, foreign aid has averaged around 3% of discretionary budget authority and just over 1% of total budget authority since 1977. Foreign assistance reached 2.5% in 1979 but has stayed below 1.5% since 1987. In 2017, it accounted for 4.1% of discretionary budget authority and 1.2% of total budget authority. Foreign aid funding has been linked to U.S. counterterrorism strategy post-9/11, with increases driven by global health initiatives, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and counter-narcotics activities. Aid levels dipped in FY2013 due to the Budget Control Act of 2011 and drawdown of military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, but have since risen again for efforts in Syria, counter-ISIL activities, and humanitarian aid. The Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) designation has facilitated growth in foreign aid funding despite Budget Control Act limitations. The Obama Administration extended OCO to cover State Department and USAID costs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress expanded OCO to include funding for additional accounts and countries in subsequent fiscal years. Since the Budget Control Act of 2011, certain foreign assistance accounts have been appropriated with the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) designation to prevent war-related funding from crowding out core international affairs activities within the budget allocation. This approach is similar to the use of supplemental international affairs appropriations after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Since FY2012, OCO designation has been used for foreign operations, leading to a decline in supplemental appropriations for foreign aid. The Trump Administration did not request OCO funding for international affairs in FY2019 and FY2020 budgets but did for the Department of Defense. Congress used OCO for DOD and State/USAID accounts in FY2019, but a smaller portion compared to FY2018. It is uncertain if this marks a downward trend in OCO use for foreign aid. Congress historically aimed to boost domestic benefits by requiring U.S. goods and services for most foreign aid. The conditioning of aid on the procurement of goods and services from the donor-country, known as \"tied aid,\" has become increasingly disfavored in the international community. Studies show that tying aid increases costs by 15%-30%, reducing aid effectiveness. The U.S. committed to reducing tied aid in 2005, but in 2016, 32% of U.S. bilateral development assistance was tied aid, the highest among major donors. The perception of policymakers is that maintaining public and political support for foreign aid programs requires ensuring direct economic benefit to the United States. Approximately 67% of U.S. foreign assistance funds in FY2017 were obligated to U.S.-based entities, with a significant amount remaining in the United States through domestic procurement or the use of U.S. implementers. The portion of funds that stay in the U.S. varies by program and is challenging to accurately identify. USAID implements most of its funding through contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with implementing partners, many of which are based in the U.S. and employ U.S. citizens. Procurement reform efforts by USAID aim to increase implementation by host country entities to enhance country ownership and sustainability of aid programs. While most food assistance was traditionally purchased in the U.S., a small portion can now be bought locally or regionally for urgent needs. Calls for greater flexibility in the food aid program have been made by successive Administrations and Members of Congress. Several Members of Congress have proposed greater flexibility in the food aid program, potentially increasing aid efficiency but reducing funds flowing to U.S. farmers and shippers. Proposals have been largely unsuccessful. Foreign Military Financing is used exclusively to procure U.S. military equipment and training. The Millennium Challenge Corporation bases its procurement regulations on the World Bank, with no preference given to donor country suppliers. Multilateral development aid is financed with borrowed funds rather than direct government contributions. U.S. firms were awarded roughly 15% of compact contracts between FY2011 and FY2017. Many argue that foreign aid brings indirect financial benefits to the United States, such as developing future markets for American products. Establishing strong economic and trade ties in the developing world using foreign assistance is seen as key to U.S. economic growth and job creation. The United States has been a leading donor of economic aid since World War II, with $34.12 billion disbursed in Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2017, accounting for 24% of total net ODA disbursements. Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and France followed as top donors in 2017. In recent years, Turkey has emerged as a significant ODA donor, particularly providing aid for Syrian refugees. The United States, while leading in dollar amounts of aid, ranks low in aid as a percentage of GNI. In 2017, the U.S. ranked at the bottom among major donors at 0.18% of GNI, below countries like Portugal and Spain. The United Arab Emirates topped the list of top donors at 1.03% of GNI. China has significantly increased its ODA commitments, with reported ODA still relatively small compared to major donor countries. Policymakers are concerned about Chinese investments in developing countries that do not meet the ODA definition, particularly through the \"Belt and Road\" initiative. China has provided limited official information on the initiative, raising questions about project details, countries involved, financing terms, and success metrics. Several congressional committees oversee U.S. foreign assistance programs, with primary jurisdiction held by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Responsibilities include authorizing legislation, conducting oversight, and managing various aid programs such as development assistance, military aid, and contributions to multilateral development banks. Nontraditional aid programs funded by the Department of Defense also fall under congressional jurisdiction. The House Energy and Commerce and Senate HELP committees may have jurisdiction over some global health assistance programs, while the SFOPS Subcommittees traditionally handle most foreign aid appropriations. However, certain military and global health activities have been appropriated through other subcommittees in recent years. The most significant permanent foreign aid authorization laws include the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export Control Act, the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, and the Bretton Woods Agreement Act. Congress usually debates omnibus foreign aid legislation every two years amending these authorization measures. Congress has not enacted a comprehensive foreign assistance authorization measure since 1985, with foreign aid bills often stalling due to controversial issues or time constraints. In contrast, DOD assistance is authorized annually in National Defense Authorization legislation. Instead of a broad State Department/USAID authorization bill, Congress has authorized major foreign assistance initiatives in stand-alone legislation or within appropriation bills. Notable examples include the SEED Act of 1989 and the FREEDOM Support Act of 1992. The SFOPS spending bill includes key foreign aid authorization acts such as the FREEDOM Support Act of 1992, the Global Food Security Act of 2016, and the BUILD Act. Appropriation measures within the SFOPS bill have become more significant for Congress in shaping U.S. foreign aid policy due to the lack of regular enactment of foreign aid authorization bills. The SFOPS appropriations include new policy initiatives and spending levels for foreign assistance accounts, shaping U.S. foreign aid policy without the need for separate authorizing legislation."
