    "content": "The \"Biogas Production Incentive Act of 2009\" may be cited as the Act. It introduces a credit for the production of biogas from certain renewable feedstocks under section 45R of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Biogas Production Incentive Act of 2009 establishes a tax credit for producing biogas from renewable feedstocks. The credit amount is based on the quantity of biogas produced and sold or used by the taxpayer during a 10-year period. The Biogas Production Incentive Act of 2009 defines biogas as a gas derived from qualified energy feedstock containing at least 50% methane. Qualified energy feedstock includes manure of agricultural livestock and organic by-products from renewable biomass. The Biogas Production Incentive Act of 2009 defines biogas as gas derived from renewable biomass, organic by-products, and solid wood waste materials. The Biogas Production Incentive Act of 2009 defines biogas as gas derived from renewable biomass, organic by-products, and solid wood waste materials, including landscape tree trimmings, landfill waste, sewage waste treatment materials, and other organic materials. Renewable biomass refers to materials from pre-commercial thinning or invasive species from National Forest System land and public lands that are removed to reduce disease or insect infestation and restore ecosystem health. The curr_chunk discusses the harvesting of organic matter in accordance with applicable laws and land management plans. It emphasizes the requirements for old-growth maintenance, restoration, and management direction. The curr_chunk outlines the types of organic matter that can be harvested from non-Federal land or land held in trust by the United States, including renewable plant material and waste material such as crop residue and animal waste. The curr_chunk defines agricultural livestock and qualified facilities that use anaerobic digesters to convert energy feedstock into biogas. The facilities must be owned by the taxpayer, located in the US, and operational before January 1, 2017. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for biogas output from qualified facilities, including marketing through pipelines or offsetting fuel consumption. Special rules apply for facilities with multiple owners in terms of production allocation. The allocation of facility output among owners is based on their ownership interests in gross sales. Related persons are treated as a single employer. Special rules apply for corporations in affiliated groups. Estates and trusts follow pass-thru rules. Coordination with fuel production credit is also considered. The tax credit for biogas production is reduced if the taxpayer also receives credit under another section. Government-owned facilities can qualify for the credit if leased or operated by the taxpayer. A special rule applies for public-private partnerships owning a facility. Public-private partnerships can transfer their allocation of the biogas production tax credit to non-public entities, subject to certain limitations. Qualified public entities, such as government entities or cooperative organizations, can make these transfers. Verification of the allocation transfer is required. Non-public entities receiving an allocation under a transfer must verify it as prescribed by the Secretary. The $4.27 amount in subsection (b)(1) is adjusted for inflation annually, rounded to the nearest 0.1 cent. The inflation adjustment factor is determined and published by the Secretary each year. The inflation adjustment factor for tax credits is calculated based on the GDP implicit price deflator, as defined by the Department of Commerce. This factor is used to adjust the $4.27 amount annually for inflation. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to biogas production credits and coordination with credits for electricity production from renewable resources. It includes changes to definitions and qualifications for tax credits.
