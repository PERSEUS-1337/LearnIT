    "content": "The 111th Congress showed interest in supporting federal R&D activities but failed to pass regular appropriations bills. Continuing resolutions were used to fund agencies until the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 was enacted by the 112th Congress on April 15, 2011. The Department of Defense received FY2011 appropriations, while other agencies were funded at their FY2010 levels unless specified otherwise. The U.S. government supports scientific and engineering research for national defense, health, safety, environment, and energy security, aiming to advance knowledge, develop workforce, and enhance innovation and competitiveness. Federal R&D efforts have led to breakthroughs in technologies like jet aircraft, the Internet, communications satellites, and disease defenses. President Obama requested $147.696 billion for R&D in FY2011, with a focus on increasing funding for physical sciences and engineering. This included a 6.6% increase in funding for key research agencies like the Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Science Foundation. Obama aimed to raise national investment in R&D to over 3% of the U.S. gross domestic product. President Obama aimed to increase national investment in R&D to over 3% of the U.S. GDP, requiring a substantial increase in public and private funding. In 2007, total U.S. R&D expenditures were $397.629 billion, approximately 2.75% of GDP. Achieving the 3% goal would have required an 8.96% real increase in national R&D funding. Advocates, including Obama's science advisor, raised concerns about the potential harm of insufficient funding. President Obama's science advisor, John Holdren, has raised concerns about the negative impact of a \"boom-bust\" approach to federal R&D funding. The biomedical research community faced challenges after the NIH budget doubled in FY2003, leading to rapid growth in infrastructure and faculty hiring. However, the agency's budget declined each year from FY2004 to FY2009, causing interruptions in research and decreased funding for grant proposals. The biomedical research community has faced challenges due to declining NIH grant proposals funded, decreased student interest in graduate studies, and reduced employment prospects for researchers with advanced degrees. Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by factors such as the Obama Administration's budget request and the inclusion of funding in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Federal R&D funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) was spent in FY2009 and FY2010, with remaining funds to be used in subsequent years. Comparisons of FY2009 and FY2010 R&D funding do not include funding from P.L. 111-5. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) figures may differ from agency budget analyses. Federal R&D funding can be analyzed from various perspectives, with data on R&D by agency for FY2009, FY2010, ARRA, and FY2011 provided by OMB. President Obama's FY2011 budget request includes six agencies. In FY2011, President Obama's budget request allocated 94.8% of federal R&D funding to six agencies: Department of Defense (DOD) - 52.5%, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) - 21.8%, NASA - 7.4%, DOE - 7.6%, NSF - 3.8%, and USDA - 1.7%. The report analyzes R&D budget requests for these agencies and others like DOC, DHS, DOI, DOT, and EPA, which received over 98% of FY2010 federal R&D funding. Obama aimed to double federal investment in key science areas. President Obama aimed to double federal investment in key science agencies over a decade, including DOE's Office of Science, NSF, and DOC's NIST laboratories. This continued the American Competitiveness Initiative started by President Bush. Congress authorized significant R&D increases for these agencies under the America COMPETES Act. The largest R&D increases in the FY2011 budget request were for NASA, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, and NIH. In President Obama's FY2011 budget request, there were significant increases in R&D funding for key science agencies, including NASA, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, and NIH. The budget proposed a $956 million increase for NIH, $526 million for the Department of Energy, and $479 million for the National Science Foundation. Additionally, the budget included allocations for basic research, applied research, development, and facilities and equipment. The federal government is the largest supporter of basic research, funding 57% of U.S. basic research in 2008. Industry funded only 17.7% of basic research in the same year. In contrast, industry is the primary funder of applied research in the United States, accounting for 60.8% in 2008, while the federal government accounted for 32.4%. The Department of Health and Human Services, mainly the National Institutes of Health (NIH), accounts for over half of all federal funding for basic research. In FY2010, HHS is the largest funder of applied research, receiving nearly half of all federally funded applied research. Industry provides 84.1% of development funding, with the federal government contributing 14.9%. DOD is the primary federal agency funder of development, accounting for 88.5% of total federal development funding in FY2010. President Obama aimed to double funding for basic research over 10 years at NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science in FY2010. In 2007, Congress established authorization levels for FY2008-FY2010 in the America COMPETES Act to double funding for research at certain agencies. However, enacted funding levels were below authorized levels, leading to the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. President Obama extended the doubling target to 11 years in FY2011, but enacted funding fell short, resulting in a projected 15-year doubling timeline. The America COMPETES Act originally aimed to double funding for research agencies, but funding fell short in subsequent years. President Obama extended the doubling target to 11 years in FY2011, but it is uncertain if the administration still supports this goal. Despite this, strong investments were promised in key research and development agencies. President Obama proposed $13.255 billion in funding for NSF, DOE's Office of Science, and NIST's core research and facilities for FY2011. In FY2011, President Obama proposed $13.255 billion in funding for NSF, DOE's Office of Science, and NIST's core research and facilities, an increase of $824 million (6.6%) above the FY2010 estimated funding level. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided funding for the ACI agencies totaling approximately $5.202 billion. The House-passed version of H.R. 4899 did not include funding for R&D. The Senate passed a version with funding for various agencies, including R&D. The House later passed an amended version rescinding funds for R&D accounts at multiple departments. The Senate failed to pass the amended bill, which was then sent back to the House. Ultimately, the House passed the Senate's original version of the bill on July 27, 2010. President Obama signed the bill (P.L. 111-212) into law on July 29, 2010, which included funding for three multiagency R&D initiatives. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) funding for FY2011 was requested at $1.776 billion, slightly below the FY2010 level. Decreases in funding for DOD, NSF, and NIST were offset by increases for DOE and HHS, resulting in a total request of $4.281 billion for FY2011. President Obama requested $4.281 billion in FY2011 funding for the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program, with increases for NSF, HHS, DOE, and DOC. He also proposed $2.561 billion for the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) in FY2010, with significant funding increases for NASA, DOC, NSF, and USDA. No regular appropriations bill had been enacted by the end of the 111th Congress. As of the end of the 111th Congress, no regular appropriations bill had been enacted. Two of the 12 regular appropriations bills had passed the House, but none had passed the Senate. The 111th and 112th Congress passed continuing resolutions to fund government operations until the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 was enacted on April 15, 2011. Division A of the act provides FY2011 appropriations for the Department of Defense, while Division B provides full-year continuing funding for other agencies at their FY2010 levels. The report provides an analysis of research and development funding in federal departments and agencies. Congress supports research in the Department of Defense primarily through its Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation appropriation. The majority of DOD's R&D funding is allocated in Title IV of the defense appropriation bill. RDT&E funds are appropriated in various parts of the defense appropriation bill, including the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. These funds support research in areas like cancer and medical conditions, as well as activities to destroy lethal chemical agents and munitions. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund also includes RDT&E monies. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF) contains RDT&E monies, tracked by the office administering the fund. Congress typically funds these programs in Title VI of the defense appropriations bill. RDT&E funds are also requested separately for Global War on Terror (GWOT) or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) activities. The Obama Administration includes GWOT/OCO funds in the regular budget, but may request additional OCO funds if needed. These funds often include money for various transfer funds such as the Iraqi Freedom Fund, Iraqi Security Forces Fund, and others. Congress typically makes a single appropriation into each fund and authorizes transfers to other accounts. The Obama Administration requested $76.131 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E in FY2011, which was $4.5 billion less than FY2010. Congress provided $74.957 billion for RDT&E in the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, $1.174 billion below the request and $5.698 billion below FY2010 levels. In FY2011, Congress provided $74.957 billion for RDT&E in the Department of Defense, which was $1.174 billion below the Obama Administration's request and $5.698 billion below FY2010 levels. Reductions were made in various departments' Systems Development and Demonstration activities, including program adjustments in the Army's manned ground vehicle program and terminations of other programs. Additionally, Congress allocated $1.176 billion for RDT&E through the Defense Health Program and $393 million through the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. RDT&E funding in the Department of Defense is allocated to different agencies and budget activities. Budget activities 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 focus on research, while activities 6.4 and 6.5 develop specific weapon systems. Budget activity 6.7 supports system improvements, and 6.6 provides management support. The Department of Defense allocates RDT&E funding to various agencies and budget activities. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support, including for test and evaluation facilities. Congress is interested in S&T funding for developing new technologies and maintaining military superiority. DOD aims to stabilize baseline S&T funding at 3% of overall funding, with a FY2011 request of $11.819 billion, 14% less than FY2010. The Department of Defense aims to stabilize baseline S&T funding at 3% of the overall budget, with a FY2011 request of $11.982 billion. Basic research received $163 million more than requested in the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. DOD's basic research budget is mainly spent at universities, representing a significant contribution in areas like electrical engineering and material science. The FY2011 request for basic research was $166 million less than what was available in FY2010. The FY2011 request for RDT&E is $166 million less than FY2010 funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee added $274 million for supplemental RDT&E, with adjustments to funding for different military branches. The House concurred with the Senate's action on RDT&E. The House concurred with the Senate's action on RDT&E funding for the Department of Homeland Security in FY2011, which saw a decrease to $1.122 billion. This included allocations for the Directorate of Science and Technology, Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and U.S. Coast Guard RDT&E. The primary DHS R&D organization, the S&T Directorate, received $767 million in funding. The Administration requested $1.018 billion for the S&T Directorate for FY2011, a 2% increase from FY2010. The request included $109 million for radiological and nuclear countermeasures R&D. Funding for other activities was proposed to be reduced by 9%, including a $39 million reduction for the Infrastructure and Geophysical Division. No funds were requested for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), but DHS planned to reprogram prior-year funds for construction. The final appropriation was $767 million, with $828 million in new funds and a rescission of $60 million. The final appropriation for the S&T Directorate for FY2011 was $828 million in new funds with a rescission of $60 million. Congress did not specify how the funds should be allocated. The construction of NBAF will require significant increases in funding over the next few years, with estimated costs totaling $615 million in May 2009. Additional costs for site-specific infrastructure and utility upgrades are expected to be contributed by Kansas State University. Decommissioning PIADC is estimated to cost $190 million. Decommissioning PIADC is expected to cost $190 million, with completion delayed by one year due to the extended process of selling Plum Island. Congress authorized DHS to use Plum Island sale receipts to offset NBAF construction and PIADC decommissioning costs. Congress has shown interest in DHS policies for testing and evaluation of large acquisition projects. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue regulations for testing and evaluation activities. Congressional oversight may focus on funding for Test and Evaluation and Standards within the S&T Directorate. The Homeland Security Institute was replaced by the S&T Directorate under its authority to establish R&D centers. The S&T Directorate has replaced HSI with HSSAI and established HSSEDI to fund R&D centers. Both institutes are funded by S&T programs and other agencies. DHS expects rapid growth in FY2010 and FY2011 with projected obligations of $187 million in FY2011. DNDO is responsible for combating nuclear threats within DHS. Under the Administration's FY2011 budget, DNDO's research role was to be transferred to the S&T Directorate with a total budget request of $306 million, a 20% decrease from FY2010. The final appropriation provided $331 million for DNDO, including $53 million for human-portable radiation detection systems. Congress did not specify how the funds should be allocated to programs below the account level. Congressional attention has focused on DNDO's testing and analysis for Advanced Spectroscopic Portals (ASPs). DHS decided not to use ASPs for primary screening but will continue developing them for secondary screening. The FY2011 appropriation continued the certification requirement for ASP procurement. The global nuclear detection architecture overseen by DNDO remains a congressional interest. The FY2011 budget justification proposed a reduction in funding for Systems Development to focus on developing a wider range of solutions for vulnerabilities in the global nuclear detection architecture. Congress should consider the implications of these changes in priorities and how they may impact other agencies involved in the architecture. DNDO's mission, established by Congress in the SAFE Port Act, includes enhancing nuclear detection capabilities. The primary federal entity is tasked with developing and supporting a domestic system for detecting nuclear and radiological devices. Congress may need to review the proposed transfer of DNDO's research activities to the S&T Directorate and consider the acquisition portion of DNDO's mission. Funding for Systems Acquisition was reduced in FY2010, shifting the responsibility for funding radiation detection equipment to end users. In contrast, the FY2011 request included increased funding for DNDO's procurement of human-portable radiation detectors. In FY2011, there was increased funding for DNDO's procurement of human-portable radiation detectors for various agencies. President Obama's budget requested $31.8 billion for NIH, a $1 billion increase from FY2010. The Department of Defense received $30.6 billion in FY2011, $317 million less than FY2010. Funding for NIH primarily comes from annual appropriations bills. Funding for NIH primarily comes from annual appropriations bills, with additional amounts for specific programs like diabetes research and the National Library of Medicine. Congress also transfers a portion of NIH's budget to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria each year. The NIH receives funding primarily from annual appropriations bills, with additional amounts for specific programs. A portion of the budget is transferred to the Global Fund. The NIH organization includes the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers focusing on various research areas. Each institute manages its own research programs in coordination with the Office of the Director. NIH receives funding from Congress for 24 of the 27 ICs, OD, and a Buildings and Facilities account. For FY2011, NIH targeted resources towards areas of exceptional scientific opportunity, including genomics and high throughput technologies like DNA sequencing and computational biology. Work on The Cancer Genome Atlas and genome sequencing of autism spectrum disorder cases was planned. In FY2011, NIH requested a $22 million increase for nanotechnology research, emphasizing translational medicine and rare disease therapeutics. The CTSA program funding would increase to $500 million to support collaborative research. Cancer researchers planned 30 new drug trials and doubling the number of novel compounds in clinical trials by 2016. In FY2011, NIH requested increased funding for various research areas including nanotechnology, rare disease therapeutics, cancer drug trials, and HIV/AIDS research. The Science to Enable Health Reform initiative aimed to support projects improving treatment quality and cost-effectiveness. NIH also focused on fields like comparative effectiveness research, personalized medicine, and social and behavioral research through initiatives like OppNet. The FY2011 budget proposed increased funding for various research areas, including nanotechnology, rare disease therapeutics, cancer drug trials, and HIV/AIDS research. It also emphasized global health initiatives, partnering with organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Fogarty International Center's budget was set to increase by 4.3%, but in the enacted appropriation, it received $69 million. In FY2011, Fogarty received $69 million to support biomedical research. The budget also included a 6.0% increase in stipends for trainees under the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards program. Additionally, NIH allocated $12 million in ARRA funds to DOE for the construction of the National Synchrotron Light Source-II, with plans to provide an additional $33 million in FY2011. In FY2011, NIH allocated $17.1 billion for competitive, peer-reviewed research project grants (RPGs), representing about 53% of its budget. This funding would support approximately 37,000 awards, including 9,052 competing RPG awards. The average cost of competing RPGs was increased to about $443,000 per award. In FY2011, NIH allocated $17.1 billion for competitive, peer-reviewed research project grants (RPGs), with about 37,000 awards, including 9,052 competing RPG awards at an average cost of $443,000 per award. Other funding mechanisms included increased support for research centers, grants in the Other Research category, training positions, R&D contracts, and the NIH intramural research program. In FY2011, NIH allocated $17.1 billion for competitive, peer-reviewed research project grants (RPGs), with about 37,000 awards. The request included a proposed increase of $73 million for research management and support. No new funding was requested for extramural research facilities construction and renovation. The final FY2011 funding levels provided through P.L. 112-10 included $2.994 billion for research centers, $1.813 billion for other research grants, support for 16,802 training positions, $3.391 billion for R&D contracts, $3.287 billion for the intramural research program, and $1.519 billion for research management and support. The request for the Office of the Director (OD) in FY2011 was $1.220 billion, an increase of $43 million (3.7%) over FY2010. Funding included $194 million for the National Children's Study, $100 million for research on medical countermeasures, and $196 million for program coordination offices. The final appropriation provided $1.167 billion for OD, including $191 million for the National Children's Study and support for the NIH Common Fund. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research, funded at $543 million for FY2011, supports high-risk/high-impact research in emerging areas of science. Some Roadmap programs will transition to ICs for continued support. The Common Fund also supported initiatives with ARRA money. The FY2011 budget proposed to increase the set-aside for federal health programs to 2.9%, but it was retained at 2.5%. NIH is the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds, with DOE requesting $12.797 billion for R&D programs in FY2011. The FY2011 budget requested increased funding for activities in science, national security, and energy. The DOE Office of Science received a 4.4% increase in funding, falling short of the goal to double funding set by the Bush Administration. The enacted FY2011 appropriation was $11.590 billion. The FY2011 budget authorized $5.247 billion for the Office of Science, with an enacted appropriation of $4.843 billion. The Administration proposed increases for research programs, including $34 million for a new energy innovation hub on materials for batteries and $24 million for an existing hub on fuels from sunlight. Funding for Office of Science graduate fellowships was tripled to $15 million. The request tripled funding for Office of Science graduate fellowships to $15 million and proposed decreasing the U.S. contribution to International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) from $135 million to $80 million due to construction delays. Despite delays, DOE stated costs are manageable within the existing range. The FY2011 appropriation provided less than the request for each major research program of the Office of Science. The DOE requested $3.850 billion for national security R&D in FY2011, including increases for nuclear weapons certification, naval reactors program, and nonproliferation R&D. The enacted appropriation was $3.697 billion, with more funding for nonproliferation R&D. In FY2011, the DOE requested $3.825 billion for energy R&D, with increases for solar and wind energy, energy efficiency, and nuclear energy. The request also included funding for the RE-ENERGYSE program on education and workforce development. No funds were provided for natural gas or unconventional fossil energy technologies in fossil energy R&D, aligning with the Administration's policy to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. The FY2011 appropriation for energy R&D aligned with the Administration's policy to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. The request included funding for various energy programs, with no funds provided for natural gas or unconventional fossil energy technologies. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) received $180 million in the enacted FY2011 appropriation. The National Science Foundation (NSF) received $180 million in the FY2011 appropriation. Established in 1950, the NSF supports basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering. It is a key source of federal support for U.S. university research and STEM education programs. The FY2011 budget for NSF was $6.806 billion, which was less than the previous year's actual level and the President's request. The FY2011 budget requested $7.424 billion to double funding for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science. However, the doubling path policy for these targeted accounts is now uncertain. The FY2011 enacted funding fell below authorized levels, setting a 15-year doubling pace, longer than previous legislation envisioned. Despite the President's Plan for Science and Innovation proposing an 11-year doubling path, the White House later stated that doubling key research funding would no longer be pursued. Even though the doubling of funding for key research and development agencies will no longer be pursued, strong investments will still be made in the National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Science Foundation, and the DOE Office of Science. The NSF organizes its budget into six major accounts, with the Research and Related Activities (RRA), Education and Human Resources (EHR), and Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) accounts representing the core of its research and education program activities. The FY2011 Current Plan for RRA is $5.510 billion, below the President's budget request. The National Science Foundation's Research and Related Activities (RRA) budget for FY2011 is $6.019 billion. The Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate receives the most RRA funding, with the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate experiencing the largest annual percentage increase. Other RRA directorates and offices either saw reductions or remained constant in funding between FY2010 and FY2011. Three directorates (CISE, Biological Sciences, and Geosciences) saw an increase in proportional funding shares, while three others (Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences) saw a decrease. The National Science Foundation's Research and Related Activities (RRA) budget for FY2011 is $6.019 billion, distributed through a merit-based, peer review system to U.S. colleges and universities. Questions about NSF's research activities include funding balance, high-risk research, and basic vs. applied research. Congress directs NSF to pursue high-risk basic research and specific fields like climate change. Congress also established the EPSCoR program with $154.4 million in FY2011. The FY2011 budget for the National Science Foundation includes funding for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research program (EPSCoR) and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) to support international research partnerships. Additionally, funding is allocated for interagency R&D priorities such as the National Nanotechnology Initiative, U.S. Global Change Research Program, Homeland Security activities, and Networking and Information Technology R&D. The FY2011 budget for the National Science Foundation includes funding for various programs such as EHR, EPSCoR, OISE, and interagency R&D priorities. The EHR program received $861.0 million, which is less than the FY2010 actual level and the President's FY2011 request. The President's request for EHR included funding for various programs like Discovery Research K-12, Mathematics and Science Partnership, Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, and others. Program-level information for EHR in FY2011 is unavailable. In FY2011, NSF's HRD saw an increase in funding, while other EHR divisions experienced a decrease. The budget proposed consolidating MSI programs into the CBPU in STEM program, making HSIs eligible for funds. In FY2011, NSF's HRD received increased funding, while other EHR divisions saw a decrease. The budget proposed consolidating MSI programs into the CBPU in STEM program, allowing HSIs to be eligible for funds. However, the Administration's request to consolidate NSF's MSI programs was rejected by Congressional appropriators and authorizers. The FY2011 Current Plan funding level for MREFC is $117.1 million, which is significantly lower than the FY2010 actual level and the President's FY2011 request. In FY2011, NSF's MREFC funding level is $117.1 million, lower than the President's request. Projects include NEON, Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, Atacama Large Millimeter Array, Advanced Technology Star Telescope, and Ocean Observatories Initiative. Projects must have the potential to advance scientific understanding and technology. In FY2011, NSF's MREFC funding level is $117.1 million, lower than the President's request. There has been debate about the management of major MREFC projects and the prioritization of potential projects. NSF emphasizes the need for flexibility in reconsidering facilities at different stages of development and responding to changes in interagency participation and funding. Some concepts may evolve into major research projects while others may prove infeasible for support. The FY2011 funding for AOAM, NSB, and OIG accounts is $299.4 million, $4.5 million, and $14.0 million respectively, similar to FY2010 levels. NIST aims to enhance U.S. companies' competitiveness through technology support. NIST research contributes to U.S. commerce, technological progress, product reliability, and public safety. NIST is funded at $750.1 million in the final FY2011 appropriations legislation. The final FY2011 appropriations legislation funds NIST at $750.1 million, which is 12.4% below the FY2010 appropriation. Key areas like in-house R&D, Manufacturing Extension Partnership, and Technology Innovation Program receive specific funding amounts. The FY2011 appropriations legislation funds NIST at $750.1 million, 12.4% below the FY2010 appropriation. The construction budget decreases to $69.9 million, 44.0% below the Administration's proposal. Some Members of Congress are skeptical of providing federal funds for technology development in the private sector. The Advanced Technology Program and Manufacturing Extension Partnership faced proposed eliminations. In 2007, the ATP was replaced by the Technology Innovation Program. Funding for NIST laboratories has remained small, despite efforts to increase spending. Both the Bush and Obama administrations aimed to double funding for innovation research at NIST over 10 years. The future of internal R&D funding at NIST and its impact on extramural programs remains uncertain. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducts research in climate, weather, and oceans. Created in 1970, NOAA focuses on climate, weather, and ocean resources. In FY2011, President Obama requested $734.0 million in R&D funding for NOAA, a 7.2% increase from the previous year. R&D accounted for 13.2% of NOAA's total budget request of $5.543.5 billion. In FY2011, R&D accounted for 13.2% of NOAA's total budget request of $5.543.5 billion. NOAA's administrative structure includes five line offices: NOS, NMFS, NESDIS, NWS, and OAR. OAR is the primary center for R&D within NOAA, with a FY2011 request of $430.1 million for R&D, including $77.1 million for R&D equipment. NOAA's R&D funding in FY2011 included $77.1 million for equipment. The specific R&D funding levels for other line offices are not available yet. NOAA highlighted R&D activities such as climate assessments, carbon observation, Earth Observing System support, ocean acidification monitoring, water forecasting, and demonstrating climate change data advantages. In FY2011, NASA received $14.863 billion for R&D, an increase from the previous year. The budget shift was mainly due to the retirement of the space shuttle program. NASA's budget priorities were previously driven by the Vision for Space Exploration announced in 2004. NASA's Vision for Space Exploration, outlined in the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 and 2008, aimed to return humans to the Moon by 2020. The Constellation Systems program developed the Orion crew vehicle, Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket, Altair lunar lander, and lunar surface systems. An independent review in 2009 found that the program would require an additional $3 billion per year. The FY2011 budget request for Exploration was $4.263 billion, a 12.8% increase from the previous year, proposing to end Constellation. The FY2011 budget proposed ending Constellation Systems and canceling the goal of returning humans to the Moon. Instead, it allocated funds for commercial crew transport services to low Earth orbit and future human exploration through robotic precursor missions and technology development. Congress supported commercial services for crew access to low Earth orbit but directed NASA to develop the Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and Space Launch System (SLS) for exploration beyond Earth orbit. The final FY2011 appropriation for Exploration was $3.801 billion, including funds for the MPCV and SLS. The FY2011 appropriation for Exploration was $3.801 billion, including funds for the MPCV and SLS. Concerns were raised about NASA's actions during FY2010 regarding the Constellation program, but NASA officials stated they were in compliance with the law. The restriction on terminating Constellation remained during the first half of FY2011. In FY2011, NASA's Science budget increased by 11.4% to $5.006 billion, with the largest proposed increase for Earth science. This included funding for a replacement for the failed Orbital Carbon Observatory and a global climate initiative. The final appropriation was $4.935 billion, with $572 million proposed for a new Space Technology program. The Administration proposed $572 million in FY2011 for a new Space Technology program focused on advancing technologies applicable to multiple missions in the long term. The authorization act authorized $350 million for Space Technology, but the final appropriation did not include a new account for it. The Administration also proposed extending operation of the International Space Station (ISS) to at least 2020 and requested increased funding for utilization of the ISS national laboratory. The FY2011 appropriation for research and education activities in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is $2.592 billion, a decrease of $403.5 million (-13.5%) from the FY2010 level. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) operates approximately 100 laboratories nationwide focusing on food and fiber production. The FY2011 appropriation for USDA research and education activities is $2.592 billion, with $1.135 billion allocated to ARS labs. This is a decrease of $58.5 million from FY2010. The Administration proposed redirecting funds from discontinued projects to research priorities such as genetic databases, market opportunities, animal health, and healthier foods. The Administration proposed increased funding for animal protection, children's nutrition research, and food supply safety. No specific amount was designated for buildings and facilities in FY2011 for the ARS, but $1.8 million was allocated for a review of USDA research facilities. This review is expected to guide future investments in line with program goals. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) was established in Title VII, \u00a77511. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), established in the 2008 farm bill, focuses on funding research efforts to address critical issues in agriculture. NIFA distributes funds to various institutions for agricultural research, education, and outreach, including land-grant universities and historically black colleges and universities. The FY2011 appropriation for the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) provides $1.217 billion, distributed through competitive awards, formula funding, and special grants. The funding includes the proposed elimination of congressional add-ons and emphasizes competitive, peer-reviewed research funding. Formula distribution for state Agricultural Experiment Stations is $236.8 million, prioritizing critical national issues in agriculture. The FY2011 appropriation for the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) provides $1.217 billion for programs addressing critical national issues such as agricultural security, emergencies, diseases, climate change, obesity, pest management, and biofuel development. Funding supports training, technology applications, rural life improvement, stress assistance for agriculture-related individuals, and minority-serving institutions. NIFA administers the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) with a $265.0 million budget in FY2011, focusing on competitive research grants. The AFRI program received $265.0 million in FY2011, which is $3.0 million above the FY2010 level but $163.8 million below the President's request. The funding supports research in agriculture, including projects for graduate students and efforts to increase opportunities for minority and under-served communities in agricultural science. Research areas include alternative biomass conversion methods, renewable fuels industry impacts on rural communities, agricultural genomics, food and agricultural security, biological invasions, and plant research. The FY2011 appropriation for USDA provides $82.0 million for the Economic Research Service (ERS), which supports economic and social science analysis on agriculture, rural development, food, and the environment. Funding for the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is $156.8 million in FY2011, supporting research on bioenergy production impacts and concerns related to agriculture. In FY2011, funding for NASS supported research on bioenergy production impacts, feedstock storage, transportation networks, commodity production, biomass materials, distillers' grains, ethanol production plants, and chemical use data series. President Obama requested $812.8 million for DOI R&D, an increase of $27.5 million from FY2010. In FY2011, the Department of the Interior received $802.1 million in R&D funding, slightly higher than FY2010. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) received $679.2 million for R&D, with activities in global change, geographic research, geological resources, water resources, biological research, and enterprise information. In FY2011, the Department of the Interior received $802.1 million in R&D funding, slightly higher than FY2010. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) received $640.0 million for R&D, with activities in global change, geographic research, geological resources, water resources, and biological research. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) received $47.0 million for R&D in FY2011. The House-passed version of H.R. 4899 did not include funding for R&D. The Senate version, named the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010, allocated $29.0 million for the Department of the Interior for activities related to emergency offshore oil spill incidents in the Gulf of Mexico. EPA, responsible for carrying out regulations, was involved in the process. The EPA funds R&D activities to support decisions on environmental pollution control laws. The agency's scientific research is mainly funded through the Science and Technology appropriations account, which receives a base appropriation and a transfer from the Hazardous Substance Superfund account for research on cleaning up contaminated sites. In 2011, $840.3 million was provided for these activities under Title VII of Division B in the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 provided $840.3 million for the EPA's Science and Technology account, including transfers from the Hazardous Substance Superfund. This amount was $34.6 million below the FY2010 appropriations. The total FY2011 enacted appropriations for the S&T account represented 9.7% of the total funding for the agency in FY2011. The FY2011 funding for EPA's Science and Technology account showed decreases compared to FY2010 appropriations and the President's FY2011 budget request. The largest decrease was for EPA's homeland security activities, with a $46.2 million decrease in funding. The FY2011 Science and Technology account funding for EPA decreased compared to FY2010 appropriations and the President's FY2011 budget request. The largest decrease was for EPA's homeland security activities, with a $46.2 million decrease in funding. The S&T account funds research conducted by universities, foundations, and non-federal entities with EPA grants, as well as research conducted by the agency at its own laboratories. EPA's Office of Research and Development manages R&D activities, including research laboratories and grants. The account also funds applied science and technology activities through program offices like the Office of Water. The EPA S&T account includes elements of the former EPA Research and Development (R&D) account, as well as portions of the former Salaries and Expenses, and Program Operations accounts. Comparisons before and after FY1996 are challenging due to differences in the scope of activities. OMB reports historical and projected budget authority for R&D at EPA, but the relationship to specific program funding is not explicitly described. The EPA S&T account funding includes R&D activities, with OMB reporting lower amounts than appropriated/requested. Funding for agency operations and facilities includes expenses for rent, utilities, and security, ranging from 8% to 11% of the total S&T account. Prior to FY2007, these expenses were funded within EPA's EPM account, affecting comparisons of S&T appropriations over time. Some Members of Congress and stakeholders have raised concerns about funding for scientific research at EPA, which represents less than 1% of the total S&T appropriation. There is ongoing debate about the adequacy of federal funding for scientific research activities across multiple agencies, with concerns about a downward trend in resources over time. The focus is on whether regulatory actions are based on \"sound science\" and how research is applied in decision-making. President Obama requested $1.022 billion for Department of Transportation (DOT) R&D in FY2011, with most funding going to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The President requested $400.4 million for FAA R&D, with a focus on the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) program to increase airspace capacity and efficiency while reducing emissions and noise. The requested changes for NextGen R&D funding included eliminating funding for demonstrations and infrastructure, reducing environmental research funding, and increasing funding for system development, air-ground integration, alternative fuels for general aviation, and self-separation. The proposed budget also included a reduction in advanced technology development and prototyping funding. President Obama proposed no increase in R&D funding for the FHWA, maintaining funding at $442.0 million for FY2011. The Administration is working on a comprehensive approach for surface transportation reauthorization, including research, development, test, and evaluation. The Budget contains no policy recommendations for programs subject to reauthorization, including R&D for Federal-aid highways. Future authorizations may include activities related to safety initiatives, infrastructure restructuring, environmental improvement, security enhancements, and outreach. The House passed H.R. 5850 for Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development funding. The 111th Congress did not complete action on the Transportation reauthorization. The 112th Congress passed the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, providing FY2011 funding for federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation. The law appropriates funds at the FY2010 level unless specified otherwise, reducing the FAA's RE&D account by $20.5 million to $170 million in FY2011 and DOT's Planning, Research and Development account by $6 million from its FY2010 level. Total FAA funding would decrease from $412 million in FY2010 to approximately $391 million in FY2011. The law does not allow for a complete assessment of how specified changes will affect agency and departmental R&D funding for FY2011. The report will be updated as more information becomes available."
