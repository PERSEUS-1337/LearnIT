    "content": "The \"Aggregate Risk and Revenue Management Act of 2011\" or the \"ARRM Act of 2011\" establishes the Aggregate Risk and Revenue Management Program under the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. The definitions in this section include terms like alternative price, ARRM, CRD, and harvest price. The availability and election of the alternative approach for aggregate risk and revenue management payments are also discussed. During 2013-2017 crop years, operators, tenants, or sharecroppers on a farm can elect to receive aggregate risk and revenue management payments for all producers based on total planted acres of covered commodities and peanuts. Total planted acres eligible for payments is limited to the total acres planted on the farm. Native sod acreage tilled for crop production after the ARRM Act of 2011 is not considered planted acreage for ARRM payments in the first 5 crop years. Ineligibility applies only to the converted native sod acreage. The Secretary shall notify operators, tenants, or sharecroppers about the opportunity to make elections regarding crop production on a farm, including the manner and time periods for making the election. The operator, tenant, or sharecropper on a farm must submit notice of an election to the Secretary within a specified time period. Failure to make an election or notify the Secretary in time will result in all producers on the farm not receiving ARRM payments. Producers on a farm can make an election to receive ARRM payments for 2013-2017 crop years for covered commodities and peanuts. The Secretary will provide ARRM payments if the actual CRD revenue is less than the ARRM program guarantee. The Secretary will make ARRM payments available to producers on a farm in a CRD for a crop year if the actual farm revenue is less than the farm ARRM revenue guarantee. Time for payments is specified for the 2013 crop year. The Secretary will make ARRM payments for the 2013-2017 crop years starting on October 1 or soon after the harvest price determination. The ARRM program guarantee for a crop year equals 90% of the CRD average revenue for covered commodities or peanuts. The ARRM program guarantee for a crop year is calculated based on the average revenue of the preceding 5 crops, excluding the highest and lowest revenue years. The guarantee cannot increase or decrease by more than 10% from the previous year. The ARRM program guarantee is calculated based on the average revenue of the preceding 5 crops, with a limit of a 10% increase or decrease from the previous year. Double-cropped acreage is not included in the guarantee calculation unless the farm has a history of double-cropping and is in a region where it is an accepted practice. If the Secretary cannot establish the CRD yield for each planted acre, adjustments are made for covered commodities or peanuts. The Secretary assigns a CRD yield for each planted acre based on previous average yields for 5 crop years, excluding the highest and lowest yields, or CRD yields for similar CRDs. This applies to CRDs with irrigated and nonirrigated land. The Secretary calculates separate ARRM program guarantees for irrigated and nonirrigated areas of the CRD for covered commodities or peanuts. Actual CRD revenue is determined by multiplying the actual CRD yield for each planted acre by the national average harvest price for the crop. The actual CRD yield for a crop year for a covered commodity or peanuts is determined by the quantity produced divided by the number of acres planted. The farm ARRM revenue guarantee is calculated for the crop year for a covered commodity. The farm ARRM revenue guarantee for a crop year is 90% of the average farm revenue, calculated by summing the average revenue from the preceding 5 crops, excluding the highest and lowest years, and multiplying by actual production history and harvest price. Actual Farm Revenue is determined by multiplying the actual yield of producers on the farm by the national average harvest price for the covered commodity or peanuts in a crop year. The ARRM payment amount for the 2013-2017 crop years is calculated based on the difference between the ARRM program guarantee and the actual revenue, multiplied by 15 percent of the ARRM program guarantee. The ARRM program guarantee for the crop year is determined by 15 percent of the guarantee, 85 percent of the planted acreage, and the actual production history divided by the assigned CRD yield. The Secretary will assess the Crop Reporting District. The Secretary will review Crop Reporting Districts in western States with 7 or fewer CRDs to determine if additional CRDs are needed. SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Repeal of Direct and Counter-Cyclical Payments for Covered Commodities and Peanuts, along with amendments to the period of effectiveness and suspension of permanent price support authority until 2017. Technical amendments are also included. The text chunk discusses technical amendments to the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, including changes to terms like \"aggregate risk and revenue management payment\" and \"average crop revenue election.\" The text chunk includes technical amendments to the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, replacing \"average crop revenue election\" with \"aggregate risk and revenue management\" in various sections. The text chunk amends the Food Security Act of 1985 by replacing \"average crop revenue election\" with \"aggregate risk and revenue management\" in various sections. Additionally, the amendment changes the year from \"2012\" to \"2017\" in subsection (f)."
