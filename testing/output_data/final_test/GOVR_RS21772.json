    "content": "After two decades of economic stagnation, some African countries began to show signs of renewed growth in the early 1990s due to better global economic conditions and improved management. However, growth was threatened by factors like HIV/AIDS and high foreign debt levels. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was enacted to promote trade and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa by providing benefits to countries making progress in reforms. Currently, 37 out of 48 Sub-Saharan African countries are eligible for AGOA benefits, expanding access to the United States duty-free. AGOA extends preferential access to about 2,000 additional products by removing certain product eligibility restrictions of GSP and extends the expiration date of the preferences for beneficiary African countries from 2006 to 2015. AGOA directs the President to provide technical assistance and trade capacity support to AGOA beneficiary countries through various U.S. government agencies and regional trade hubs funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. AGOA provides trade technical assistance to African countries like Kenya and Botswana, focusing on trade policy, business development, compliance with WTO policies, and benefiting from AGOA. Duty- and quota-free entry into the U.S. for certain apparel articles has stimulated job growth and investment in countries like Lesotho and Kenya. To qualify, countries must develop a U.S.-approved visa system to prevent illegal transshipments. 24 out of 37 AGOA-eligible countries are qualified for duty-free apparel trade. The AGOA Acceleration Act extends the LDC provision for duty-free apparel trade until September 30, 2007, with a reduction in the cap on allowable U.S. apparel imports starting in October 2006. Non-LDC countries must use fabric and yarn from AGOA-eligible countries or the U.S. for apparel production. South Africa is the only non-LDC country qualified for duty-free apparel trade. The AGOA Acceleration Act extends duty-free apparel trade for LDC countries until September 30, 2007, with a reduction in the cap on U.S. apparel imports. South Africa is the only non-LDC country eligible for duty-free apparel trade. AGOA was amended in 2002 to double the cap on duty-free apparel imports for non-LDC countries. U.S. duty-free imports under AGOA increased significantly in 2003. The AGOA Acceleration Act extended duty-free apparel trade for LDC countries until 2007, with a reduction in the cap on U.S. apparel imports. U.S. imports under AGOA increased by 58% in 2003, reaching $13.19 billion, with 70% consisting of energy-related products from Nigeria. Excluding Nigeria, AGOA imports grew by 30% to $3.84 billion. The growth in AGOA trade is attributed to more goods receiving duty-free treatment, particularly in the textile and apparel industry, with emerging apparel industries in Lesotho, Kenya, and Swaziland showing substantial growth. Despite the apparent success of the emergent apparel industries in some African countries, the potential benefits from AGOA have been slow to materialize. Export diversification has been limited, with only a few countries actively promoting it. Agricultural products show promise for African export growth, but producers face challenges meeting U.S. standards. Many countries have been slow to utilize AGOA, while others like Mali, Rwanda, and Senegal have implemented projects with minimal gains. Obstacles to export growth in Africa include insufficient domestic markets, lack of investment capital, poor infrastructure, low levels of health and education, protectionist trade policies, and high costs. The apparel industry in Africa faces challenges due to the end of the Multifibre Arrangement quota regime in 2005, leading to competition with Asian producers for the U.S. market. AGOA III extends the preference program to 2015 to improve investment stability in Africa. Export diversification is crucial as AGOA beneficiaries lose quota-free advantage, leading to job losses in countries like Lesotho. Extending AGOA benefits under AGOA III improves investment stability in Africa by providing apparel rules of origin, product eligibility benefits, and extending the third-country fabric rule for LDCs. The extension of the LDC provision was controversial, as without it, LDCs would lose duty-free access to the US for apparel made from third-country fabric. Supporters argued that not extending the provision could lead to significant contraction in the apparel industry, causing the loss of gains from AGOA. Beneficiaries under AGOA would need to source fabric and yarn from the AGOA region or the US for duty-free access. Regional supply may not meet demand, and sourcing from the US would be costly. There were debates on extending the LDC provision to develop a textile milling industry in Africa to support the apparel industry and prevent its collapse. Opponents argued that the LDC provision hinders fabric and yarn production investment in Africa, as cheaper imports from Asia are used in AGOA-eligible apparel. The extension of the LDC provision in AGOA raised concerns about its impact on textile milling investment in Africa. Supporters believed that despite third-country fabric availability, investment in the textile industry would continue due to its profitability. However, there were worries that looser rules of origin could lead to Africa being used as a transshipment point between Asia and the United States. The phase-out of the MFA quota regime in January 2005 further clouded the outlook for the development of the textile industry in Sub-Saharan Africa, as it now competes more directly with Asia for the U.S. apparel and textile market. The promotion of vertical integration between apparel, textile, and cotton producers is seen as necessary to keep apparel plants in Africa and maintain jobs. However, sourcing high-quality cotton in large volumes has been a challenge for investors in textile milling in Africa. Facilitating vertical integration remains a key challenge for the thriving African textile and apparel industry. The growth of agricultural trade in Africa holds potential for improved economic growth. Most Africans rely on agriculture for income, with a large portion of the labor force working in this sector. By exporting to the U.S. market, African agricultural producers could receive higher prices for their goods. AGOA III aims to improve African agricultural market access to the United States by providing technical assistance to meet U.S. standards. The AGOA Acceleration Act calls for technical assistance to help African agricultural producers meet U.S. standards. Some are skeptical about the effectiveness of this assistance without increased market access, while others are concerned about restrictions on agricultural technical assistance. Proponents believe that low institutional capacity in Africa is the main obstacle to export-led development, and U.S.-provided technical assistance can help improve agricultural development and export performance in Africa."
