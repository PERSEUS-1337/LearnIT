The hostages were threatened by the \"Saraya al-Mujahideen\" group to withdraw troops or face burning alive. The hostages, two men aged 18 and 32, and a woman aged 34, were described as pacifists opposed to Japan's involvement in the war. The hostage situation in Iraq tested Prime Minister Koizumi's commitment to non-combat military involvement. The Japanese government dispatched officials to coordinate with U.S. agencies for a possible rescue attempt, but ultimately, the hostages were released to a moderate Sunni group without the need for a rescue operation. The Islamic Clerics Association negotiated the release of Japanese hostages in Iraq, who were later transferred to the Japanese Embassy. Two other Japanese individuals were also seized but were released unharmed. The hostages faced criticism in Japan for ignoring government warnings and jeopardizing the SDF mission in Iraq. The Bush Administration expressed solidarity with Japan in the hostage situation. U.S. officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, prioritized cooperation to secure the release of Japanese hostages in Iraq. Cheney reassured Japan of U.S. support and readiness for a possible rescue mission. Concerns over North Korea's nuclear program and China's influence have influenced Japan's alliance with the U.S. and its international role. Japan's shift in security outlook was evident in its assertive support to the United States after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Koizumi government passed legislation allowing Japan to send Maritime Self-Defense Forces to the Indian Ocean to support operations in Afghanistan, marking a new chapter in U.S.-Japan alliance cooperation. Japan also vocally supported U.S. policy towards Iraq, breaking from past reticence. During a contentious debate in the U.N. Security Council in February 2003, Japan and Australia supported a U.S. and British call for the use of force against Iraq. Despite attacks in Iraq, Japan deployed 550 troops with less constrained rules of engagement in late 2003 and early 2004. Prime Minister Koizumi justified the decision based on Japan's international obligations. Prime Minister Koizumi justified Japan's decision to send troops to Iraq in 2004 by emphasizing the importance of Japan's alliance with the United States for its peace and safety. He argued that the U.N. would not deploy forces to fight with Japan in a crisis involving Japanese security. Some analysts believe Japan's increased support of U.S. policies expects greater recognition of its interests, especially regarding the Korean Peninsula. Japan's logistical support of U.S. and allied warships in the Indian Ocean and deployment of non-combat troops to Iraq stretched constitutional constraints under Article 9 of Japan's \"no-war constitution,\" raising concerns about participation in collective defense. The Japanese public and political parties are considering revising the constitution due to the impact of Iraqi insurgents. Despite not favoring sending troops to Iraq, there is a warming to Japan's increased international role. Hostage incidents have influenced public opinion and leadership in Japan. Editorials and government statements show a shift towards considering international standing and U.S.-Japan relations. The Japanese government is aware that meeting the demands of hostage-takers would damage the country's international standing and the U.S.-Japan alliance. Despite strong public support for this stance, the security situation in Iraq and hostage incidents have weakened support for Prime Minister Koizumi's policy. Criticism from the opposition and senior LDP politicians could further weaken the coalition government. Japan's strong stance in the coalition has been crucial amidst withdrawals by other countries. Questions linger about Japan's commitment due to restrictions on their troops' engagement in combat. The sharp increase in violence in Iraq has raised concerns about Japanese troops being drawn into combat, jeopardizing support for their mission. The acting secretary general of the LDP stated that Japan would withdraw its Self-Defense forces if they engaged in a firefight with insurgents. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda mentioned that Japan was reviewing its options due to the escalating violence. Prime Minister Koizumi must lead his party in elections to the upper house of the Japanese Diet. In June 2004, Koizumi faces challenges leading his party in upper house elections after the LDP's loss of seats in the lower house. The opposition DPJ criticizes the legality of Japanese troops in Iraq. Despite concerns, Koizumi's popularity rises following the release of hostages and economic growth. Despite Koizumi's announcement that he will not seek reelection in 2006, 73% of respondents want him to stay on for another year. The LDP candidates won all three lower house bi-elections on April 26, but the party's prospects remain uncertain. Japan's interest in maintaining troops in Iraq for security reasons is evident, with a replacement contingent of 460 troops being readied. However, the deteriorating security situation in Iraq could lead to new problems for the U.S.-Japan alliance. Japan's commitment to keeping its forces in Iraq could weaken if the Koizumi government perceives that U.S. policy towards North Korea no longer aligns with Japanese interests, potentially straining the U.S.-Japan alliance. Despite sending replacement troops, it is uncertain if Japan will fulfill its original intention to send up to 1,100 troops to Iraq."
