    "content": "The potential outcome of the resignation of long-time Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is uncertain, especially regarding the oil and natural gas sectors. This paper analyzes the impact of disruptions in Egypt's oil and natural gas sector, including the closure of the Suez Canal and the SUMED oil pipeline, on global oil and natural gas markets. Taking such drastic measures could lead to outside intervention, particularly if the Suez Canal is closed. Timing of these actions, such as during the summer driving season or winter heating season, would also affect the impact on oil and natural gas markets. Closing the Suez Canal would have a significant impact on global oil and natural gas markets, leading to a short-lived rise in oil prices. Despite adequate spare production capacity, market disruptions cause quick price reactions before settling back. If the canal remained closed indefinitely, shipping costs would increase. If the Suez Canal remained closed indefinitely, shipping costs would likely increase, putting upward pressure on oil prices. The impact on liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be less significant due to long-term contracts and a global glut of LNG. In 2009, 1.8 million barrels per day of oil moved through the canal, down from 2.4 Mb/d in 2008, mainly due to lower global demand, OPEC production cuts, and piracy. In 2010, there was an increase in cargos passing through the Suez Canal, but data for the year is incomplete. Only about 15% of Europe's oil supplies currently pass through the canal, down from 60% during its closure from 1967 to 1975. The SUMED oil pipeline, owned by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar, is operating below capacity at 1.1 Mb/d in 2009, a 50% decrease from 2008. Additionally, 331 billion cubic feet of LNG passed through the canal in 2009, representing 4% of global LNG trade. The volume of LNG passing through the Suez Canal has been steadily rising, with a significant increase in Qatar LNG exports. Egypt, although a small player in the global natural gas industry, has a larger impact on regional natural gas supply, providing most of the natural gas consumed in Lebanon, Jordan, and over half in Israel. Egypt, with 77 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, exports natural gas through pipelines and LNG facilities. The Arab Gas Pipeline connects Egypt to Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, with plans to expand to Europe. Egypt also has LNG export capacity, sending most cargos to Europe. In 2008, an export pipeline to Israel was opened, which was temporarily shut down due to an explosion in early February. The natural gas terminal near El-Arish in Egypt was attacked for the second time since protests erupted in January 2011. The terminal supplies the Arab Gas Pipeline to Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, as well as a separate pipeline to Israel. Bedouins have targeted the terminal due to feeling neglected by Cairo. Egypt's oil production has been declining since the 1990s, with limited impact on global oil prices. Egypt, with the largest refining capacity in Africa, exports refined products like naptha but imports others. Halting naptha exports could raise European prices. Global oil prices react to Egyptian unrest due to concerns about transit disruptions and potential spread of unrest to major energy exporters in the region. Upward pressure on natural gas prices is also observed. If Egyptian exports are disrupted, there may be upward pressure on natural gas prices, but the UK benchmark price is currently down. Any impact on the global oil and natural gas market would likely be minimal in the long term. Industries may need time to adjust flows, but strategic petroleum reserves could help bridge any significant disruptions."
