    "content": "The people of California enact the following. In 2011, California passed legislation to reduce recidivism by supervising low-level offenders locally. The state allocated $2.5 billion for local jail construction, adding over 9,000 jail beds in 21 counties. In 2012, $500 million in funding was authorized for local jails, with 14 counties awarded funding for facility upgrades and alternatives to incarceration. In 2014, an additional $500 million was authorized for 15 counties to improve capacity and treatment space in local jails. An additional $250 million for local jails and $20 million for Napa County were authorized in 2016. Funding was limited to counties not fully funded previously. Facilities must include space for in-person visitation. Some counties are considering banning in-person visitation in favor of video visitation. Experts have found that prison visitation can significantly reduce the risk of recidivism, with in-person visits being more effective than video visits, especially for establishing secure attachments between young children and their incarcerated parents. The BSCC utilizes the 2015 Adult Titles 15 and 24 Regulation Revision Executive Steering Committee (ESC) for updating regulations. The ESC requested a working group to discuss visitation regulations, specifically video visitation. The BSCC working group on visitation, comprised of law enforcement representatives, discussed the shift towards video visitation in new facilities, with some counties planning for video visits only. The public safety realignment legislation in Chapter 15 of the Statutes of 2011 aims to realign low-level felony offenders to locally run, community-based corrections programs. This legislation is intended to improve public safety outcomes among adult felons and facilitate their reintegration back into society. As a result of this legislation, more individuals are serving lengthy jail sentences for felony convictions. California's criminal justice realignment aims to strengthen by ensuring incarcerated individuals have meaningful connections with friends and family in their communities. Local detention facilities must provide in-person visitation in addition to electronic visitation options. Local detention facilities must offer in-person visitation by January 1, 2022, if they choose to use electronic visitation and lack space for in-person visits."
