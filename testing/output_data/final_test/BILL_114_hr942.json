    "content": "The \"Audit the Pentagon Act of 2015\" aims to strengthen national security by ensuring sound financial controls in military planning, operations, and defense spending. It also seeks to promote accountability at the Department of Defense to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. The 2013 Financial Report of the United States Government highlighted the lack of auditable reporting at the Department of Defense. Despite improvements in financial practices, there was still one disclaimer in FY 2013 out of 24 major agencies. The 2013 Financial Report of the United States Government pointed out weaknesses in financial management practices at the Department of Defense, leading to it being on the \"High-Risk\" list by the Government Accountability Office. The Department struggles with controlling costs, ensuring accountability, measuring performance, and preventing fraud and abuse. Despite past expenditures to improve financial information, challenges persist. The Department of Defense faces challenges in achieving full audit readiness despite past expenditures on new information technology systems. Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, are required to publish regular financial statements by law, but neither the Department of the Army nor the Department of the Air Force has complied with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The Department of the Air Force has not complied with laws requiring auditable financial statements and financial systems to provide cost management information. In 2005, the Department of Defense established a Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan. The FIAR Directorate was established in 2005 within the Department of Defense to improve financial processes and achieve audit-ready financial statements. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates criticized the current management system within the DoD as inadequate. The Department of Defense lacks centralized mechanisms for resource allocation, leading to accounting problems and widespread errors in pay that are difficult to correct, causing hardship for members of the Armed Forces and their families. SEC. 4. SPENDING REDUCTIONS FOR AGENCIES WITHOUT CLEAN AUDITS. This section applies to Federal agencies required to have audited financial statements. Military departments and defense agencies are treated separately. Definitions for \"financial statement\" and \"external independent auditor\" are provided. Adjustments for financial accountability are required annually. In fiscal year 2016 and onwards, Federal agencies must adjust their discretionary budget authority based on their financial statement audit status. Failure to submit or receive a qualified audit opinion results in a 0.5% reduction in budget authority, applied proportionately to each account. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to implement these reductions. In fiscal year 2016 and onwards, Federal agencies must adjust their discretionary budget authority based on their financial statement audit status. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to implement reductions in accounts excluding military personnel, reserve personnel, National Guard personnel, and the Defense Health Program account. The President may waive reductions if it harms national security or combat members of the Armed Forces. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must report to Congress within 60 days of any budget adjustments made by Federal agencies in combat situations. Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) must submit a report to Congress listing all Department reports that hinder the Department's ability to achieve a financial audit with an unqualified opinion. Additionally, there is a Sense of Congress provision. Sense of Congress: \n1. Congress emphasizes the importance of not compromising wounded warrior accounts or vital protection for troops in harm's way as defense budget cuts occur.\n2. The Department of Defense should simplify the valuation of legacy assets without sacrificing essential controls or auditing standards.\n3. The Act should not mandate the declassification of accounting details for classified defense programs, and the Department of Defense must ensure financial accountability using established practices."
