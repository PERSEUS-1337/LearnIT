The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes the procedure for judicial review of removal orders against aliens in the United States. Petitions for review must be filed within specific time frames, and venue is determined by the circuit where the administrative proceedings took place. The action is brought against the Department of Homeland Security, with service made upon the Secretary of Homeland Security and the official in charge of the district where the court is located. Service of the petition stays the removal of the alien pending court determination, unless the alien is convicted of an aggravated felony. The court may not stay the removal of an alien during the petition process unless directed otherwise. The petition will be decided based solely on the administrative record and the Secretary of Homeland Security's findings, which are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. If a petitioner claims to be a U.S. national and the claim is not frivolous, the court must address the issues presented. The court may transfer proceedings to a district court for a de novo hearing on a petitioner's nationality claim if a genuine issue exists. Any review of an order under this section must also include a review of a motion to reopen or reconsider the order. The validity of a removal order can be challenged in a criminal proceeding by a separate motion for judicial review before trial. If a genuine issue of material fact regarding the alien's nationality is raised, a de novo hearing will be granted.

An order of removal can be reviewed only after exhausting administrative remedies or if the alien has left the United States. The section allows aliens to seek judicial review of a removal order through habeas corpus proceedings. A petition for review or habeas corpus must indicate if the order's validity has been upheld in prior judicial proceedings. A petition will not be considered if the order's validity has already been determined, unless new grounds are presented or the prior remedy was inadequate. A petition challenging a final removal order can only dispute the alien's identity. The amendment limits the court's jurisdiction to review specific issues related to an alien's identity, aggravated felony convictions, and procedural requirements. It will take effect immediately and apply to pending determinations with final administrative decisions. The court cannot review any other issues beyond those specified. SEC. 8.
