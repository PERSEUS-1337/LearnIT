    "content": "Before adjourning sine die in December 2006, Congress passed legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water Act's Lake Pontchartrain Basin program (H.R. 6121). President Bush signed this bill into law on December 12 (P.L. 109-392). House and Senate committees reported several other bills near the end of the 109th Congress, but none of these was enacted. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reported H.R. 4126, to reauthorize the act's Chesapeake Bay program. Two other bills reported by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee dealt with security of wastewater treatment facilities (S. 2781), and incentives to promote remediation of inactive and abandoned hardrock mines (S. 1848). Despite progress in achieving Congress's goals to restore and maintain water quality, challenges remain. The Clean Water Act addresses diverse water quality problems, including pollution runoff from various sources and toxic substances discharged from factories and sewage treatment plants. It consists of regulatory provisions for pollution abatement and financial assistance for wastewater treatment plant construction. The Clean Water Act aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters by eliminating pollutants and achieving fishable and swimmable waters. Progress has been made in controlling pollutants from industries and sewage treatment plants, although goals have not been fully achieved. Progress has been mixed in controlling discharges of toxic pollutants from industries and sewage treatment plants. Efforts to control nonpoint source pollution are more recent, with a significant percentage of river and stream miles and lake acres not meeting water quality standards. Many lakes and river miles in the United States are under fish-consumption advisories. River miles in the United States are under fish-consumption advisories due to chemical contaminants, with one-third of shellfishing beds closed or restricted. Mercury contamination is a growing concern, with 45 states issuing consumption advisories as of 2003. The Clean Water Act, last amended in 1987, has seen authorizations for various programs expire, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds for implementation. The Clean Water Act, last amended in 1987, has been successful in achieving its goals but faces criticism from industry, developers, and property rights groups. States and cities have traditionally supported water quality programs but oppose new unfunded mandates. Environmental groups believe further strengthening is necessary. Many environmental groups believe that further fine-tuning is needed to strengthen the Clean Water Act and address remaining water quality problems. Legislative activity on the CWA was limited until the 104th Congress in 1995, where a comprehensive reauthorization bill was opposed by environmentalists and the Clinton Administration. Critics argued that the bill would undermine the existing framework for protecting U.S. waters. In the following Congresses, specific bills were passed to strengthen protection of coastal recreation waters through upgraded water quality standards and monitoring programs. During the 107th Congress, legislative attention focused on financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects under the Clean Water Act. Bills were approved to extend the State Revolving Fund program through FY2007. During the 107th Congress, bills were introduced to extend the State Revolving Fund program through FY2007, but controversies over the Davis-Bacon Act and SRF grant allocation hindered further action. The only water quality measure passed was the Great Lakes Legacy Act, authorizing $50 million annually for sediment contamination remediation in the Great Lakes and reauthorizing provisions for the Lake Champlain Basin program. In the 108th Congress, attention shifted to water infrastructure financing issues, with bills focusing on reauthorizing existing Clean Water Act programs. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4731 to reauthorize the National Estuary Program through FY2010, signed into law as P.L. 108-399. Additionally, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reported three other bills in September 2004. In 2004, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reported three bills: H.R. 784 for sewer overflow projects, H.R. 4470 for Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration, and H.R. 4688 for the Chesapeake Bay Program reauthorization. H.R. 4470 was passed by the House but no further action occurred. Additionally, H.R. 4794 was passed to address sewage treatment from Tijuana impacting the San Diego border region. The Senate passed this bill, signed into law as P.L. 108-425. In 2005, wastewater infrastructure legislation was addressed in the 109th Congress. The Senate approved S. 1400 authorizing federal funds for water quality and drinking water State Revolving Fund programs. The House approved bills to reauthorize funding for CWA programs, including H.R. 624 for sewer overflow projects and H.R. 1359 for alternative water source projects. Other bills related to CWA programs were also enacted. In December 2005 and November 2006, Congress passed bills to extend specific CWA programs, including the Long Island Sound and Lake Pontchartrain Basin programs. President Bush signed these bills into law. Other bills to extend coastal water quality programs were considered but not enacted. In September, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported a bill to promote remediation of inactive and abandoned hardrock mines by modifying Clean Water Act requirements. Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005 damaged public service facilities in the Gulf Coast region, including sewage treatment plants, requiring restoration efforts. EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have assisted in the cleanup and restoration process. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers helped evaluate damages to wastewater treatment facilities in the affected region. Over 95% of facilities were operational six weeks after the hurricane, but some cities, like parts of New Orleans, still faced challenges even a year later. The 109th Congress considered legislative proposals, including S. 1709, to provide assistance for sewage treatment repair. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, legislative proposals were considered by the 109th Congress to provide assistance (such as forgiveness of loan principal and extended repayment) for sewage treatment repair or rebuilding projects in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Some suggested modifying environmental review and permitting requirements to enable swift recovery from the storms, but these proposals did not receive further congressional consideration. Congressional attention has focused on security, preparedness, and emergency response issues since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The House passed legislation authorizing $200 million in grants for security activities at wastewater treatment plants (H.R. 5169) and $15 million in technical assistance for small treatment plant facilities. Congress also enacted legislation authorizing $160 million in grants for drinking water utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments (P.L. 107-188). In the 108th Congress, legislation was passed authorizing grants for security activities at wastewater treatment plants and technical assistance for small treatment plant facilities. The Senate also approved a bill for vulnerability assessments for wastewater utilities, but no further action was taken due to concerns about the lack of mandated assessments. In the 109th Congress, similar legislation was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee for wastewater security issues. In the 109th Congress, S. 2781 was approved to encourage wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and provide $220 million for assistance. It addressed vulnerabilities in collection systems identified by a 2006 GAO report and authorized EPA to conduct research on the topic. An amendment to mandate vulnerability assessments and switch from hazardous substances was rejected during committee consideration. The 30th anniversary of the Clean Water Act in 2002 highlighted ongoing water pollution issues and the need for potential legislative solutions. Key water quality issues include implementing existing provisions, determining additional steps for achieving goals, and defining the federal role in clean water infrastructure. Efforts to amend the act have faced challenges as stakeholders debate potential changes. Efforts to amend the Clean Water Act have stalled due to debates over potential changes, tradeoffs between different sectors, and governmental responsibilities. Congress has focused on narrow bills instead of comprehensive proposals, partly due to political reluctance and lack of presidential initiatives on clean water issues. The Clean Water Act's program for financial aid in wastewater treatment plant construction is a key feature of the law. Congress has provided $76.5 billion since 1972 for projects to meet sewage treatment requirements. Funding needs remain high, with debates stalling new legislation enactment. The Clean Water Act has provided $76.5 billion since 1972 for wastewater treatment plant construction. State and local governments have also spent over $25 billion on construction. Additional federal funding sources exist, but there is still a need for $181 billion nationwide for eligible projects. EPA estimates nearly $390 billion needs to be spent in the next two decades on wastewater infrastructure. The EPA estimates that the United States needs to spend nearly $390 billion over the next two decades to replace and build wastewater infrastructure systems. An additional $148 billion is needed for operation and maintenance. Without increased investment, there will be a $6 billion gap between current annual capital expenditures and projected spending needs. Increasing wastewater spending by 3% annually could reduce this gap by nearly 90%. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act established a program of grants for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRF) to fund wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. This program replaced the previous categorical grants program, requiring states to provide a 20% match of the federal amount. The intent was to transition to full state and local financing by utilizing a revolving fund concept where borrowed funds are repaid by communities for future construction projects. The 1987 Clean Water Act amendments established State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRF) to fund wastewater and drinking water projects. States would transition to full financing by FY1995, with greater flexibility in exchange for ending federal aid after FY1994. Despite complaints about federal rules, states have mechanisms to administer new loan programs and receive SRF funds. Congressional oversight focuses on reducing wastewater facility backlog and future funding needs, especially for small communities and rural states. Many small towns with large rural populations face challenges with the SRF program, needing major projects for compliance but lacking industrial tax base. Despite initial plans to phase out federal support, Congress continues to provide $1.35 billion annually in SRF grants. The SRF provisions in the Clean Water Act have been less controversial, reflecting general agreement on the need for funding assistance. The Clean Water Act's State Revolving Fund (SRF) provisions have served as a model for similar provisions in the Safe Drinking Water Act. The issue now is how to extend SRF assistance to address remaining clean water funding needs, allocate funds among states, and prioritize projects. The Bush Administration acknowledges that federal funding alone cannot meet infrastructure needs, particularly for small and economically disadvantaged communities struggling to transition from categorical grants to SRF loans. Concern also exists about funding for projects addressing sewer overflows that pose health risks. The EPA estimates that controlling sewer overflows nationwide will cost nearly $140 billion. Wastewater utilities are seeking assistance to upgrade physical protection against potential terrorist attacks on water infrastructure systems. Congress has been actively considering water infrastructure funding issues since the 107th Congress, but bills to extend the SRF program and increase federal assistance have faced controversy and not moved forward. In the 108th Congress, bills were introduced to reauthorize the Clean Water Act SRF program and funding for sewer overflow grants. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported legislation authorizing $41.25 billion over five years for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs, including $20 billion for the clean water SRF program. The bill included a new formula for state-by-state allocation of clean water SRF grants and provisions for disadvantaged communities. In July 2003, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee approved legislation similar to H.R. 3930, authorizing $20 billion for the clean water SRF program for FY2004-FY2008. It included provisions to benefit economically disadvantaged communities, such as extended loan repayments and additional subsidies. No further action occurred on the bill. The issue of Davis-Bacon Act's applicability to SRF-funded projects has been a point of contention in Congress. Critics argue it raises construction costs and limits competition, while supporters believe it protects local wages. The House subcommittee approved a bill in July 2003 (H.R. 1560) without specifying Davis-Bacon Act's application, unlike S. 2550. Other factors like Administration opposition to funding levels and allocation formulas also complicated the bills in the 109th Congress. In the 109th Congress, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 1400, the Water Infrastructure Financing Act, which would have authorized $20 billion for Clean Water Act SRFs and $15 billion for Safe Drinking Water Act SRFs through FY2010. The bill aimed to update the state-by-state allocation formula for SRF monies and apply Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements to all projects financed from an SRF. However, no further action was taken on this bill. Interest has been growing in finding new ways to fund water infrastructure projects beyond federal grants and SRFs. In June 2005, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment discussed creating a national clean water trust fund to increase funding for water infrastructure projects. Witnesses and members explored various financing options, including tax-exempt private activity bonds and asset management programs. Legislation was introduced in December 2005 to address these funding challenges. In December 2005, legislation was introduced for a $7.5 billion federal trust fund for wastewater infrastructure improvements, proposing user fees to fund necessary system upgrades. Congress did not act on this bill, which also addressed wetlands protection under the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act's Section 404 permit program requires permits for disposal of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, including wetlands. It is a key tool for wetlands protection but has been criticized as intrusive. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers this aspect, not the EPA. Addressing criticism while achieving wetlands protection goals is a current challenge. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers the Section 404 permit program for wetlands protection, facing tension between regulation and land development desires. Controversies include federal jurisdiction, permit delays, and roles of agencies and states in issuing permits. One issue of controversy in wetlands protection is the jurisdiction over isolated waters under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court ruled in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the Corps' denial of a permit based solely on migratory bird usage exceeded its authority. The SWANCC decision in wetlands protection raised concerns about the extent of impacts on the regulatory program, with differing interpretations leading to uncertainty. Environmentalists criticized the Court's interpretation of congressional intent, while industry groups welcomed the ruling. The decision's policy implications depend on how broadly or narrowly it is applied by federal courts. The government's current view on wetlands protection, as expressed in EPA-Corps guidance, allows federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue. Administration press releases emphasize commitment to \"no-net-loss\" wetlands policy, but issues remain under discussion as indicated by an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on defining waters under regulatory jurisdiction. The government received over 133,000 comments on potential changes to wetland protection rules, with most being negative. Environmentalists and states opposed any rule changes, while developers sought clarification on the SWANCC ruling. In December 2003, the Administration decided not to pursue changes to federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands to avoid a contentious debate. Interest groups on all sides criticized the confusion surrounding the issue. Interest groups criticized confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance on wetland protection. Environmentalists are concerned about diminished protection, while developers seek clarity to avoid contradictory interpretations of wetland rules. Federal courts play a key role in interpreting the SWANCC decision, with two cases (Rapanos v. United States; Carabell v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) heard by the Supreme Court in 2006 to narrow the scope of the CWA permit program for wetland development. The Supreme Court ruling in Rapanos v. United States in 2006 brought clarity to the scope of federal regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands. In a 5-4 decision, the Court held that the lower court had applied an incorrect standard in determining CWA coverage for wetlands. Justice Scalia led the plurality, with Justice Kennedy joining to vacate the lower court decisions and remand the cases for further consideration. The ruling had significant implications for wetland protection and development. The Supreme Court ruling in Rapanos v. United States in 2006 clarified federal regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands. The ruling led to uncertainty in defining which wetlands are subject to federal jurisdiction, resulting in more case-by-case determinations and ongoing litigation. There was pressure on the Corps and EPA to provide clarity through administrative rulemaking. In response to the ruling, the House Government Reform Subcommittee held a hearing to address the lack of guidance leading to inconsistent regulatory decisions. The Corps and EPA faced criticism for their lack of clarity in defining federal jurisdiction over wetlands post-SWANCC decision. Hearings were held in 2003 and 2004 to address lingering confusion, with controversies persisting in 2006. The House adopted an amendment in 2006 to address the issue. The FY2007 appropriations for EPA (H.R. 5386) included an amendment that would prevent EPA from implementing a 2003 policy guidance. Supporters argued that the guidance exceeded Supreme Court requirements, leaving many streams and wetlands vulnerable to development. Opponents feared the amendment would complicate regulatory efforts. Legislation in the 109th Congress aimed to redefine \"waters of the United States\" in response to the SWANCC decision. The Federal Wetlands Jurisdiction Act of 2005 aimed to narrow the definition of \"waters of the United States.\" Congressional interest in addressing uncertainties about federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters may increase following the Rapanos and Carabell cases. Some urge Congress to clarify jurisdictional issues, while others suggest EPA and the Corps issue new guidance or initiate rulemaking. EPA and the Corps are working on new guidance but have not decided on rulemaking. The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires states to develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) to address pollution in water bodies. Environmental groups have filed lawsuits to push for TMDL implementation, resulting in court orders for expeditious development. Current controversies surround TMDL program implementation and EPA's regulatory revisions issued in July. The EPA issued regulatory revisions in July 2000 to strengthen the TMDL program, which was controversial and delayed until October 2001. Congress requested a study by the National Academy of Sciences on the scientific basis of the program, which concluded that scientific knowledge exists to move forward. The NAS panel recommended adaptive implementation for TMDL development, stating that some water quality problems have obvious solutions while others require phased implementation. The General Accounting Office found issues with monitoring and data collection, hindering TMDL program effectiveness. The Bush Administration delayed the rule until May 2003 to review the NAS report. The Bush Administration delayed the TMDL rule until May 2003 to review the NAS report. EPA withdrew the July 2000 TMDL rule in March 2003, with existing rules and requirements remaining in place. EPA is considering revising the current TMDL program but has not announced a timeframe or proposal. Congressional oversight hearings on water resources were held in June and November 2001. In 2001, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee discussed TMDL requirements and potential regulatory changes. Bills were introduced in the 109th Congress to address pollution from inactive mines, particularly in the West. EPA estimated that 40% of headwaters in the West were impacted by drainage from abandoned mining sites. The bills aimed to encourage cleanup by \"Good Samaritan\" entities. The bills proposed to establish a process for issuing permits to Good Samaritans and provide incentives in the form of reduced liability from environmental laws and less stringent cleanup standards. Proponents argue that any cleanup is better than inaction, while opponents fear exemptions could lead to dismantling environmental legislation. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved a bill that would allow Good Samaritans to apply for an EPA permit relieving them of liability and regulatory requirements under various environmental laws. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved a bill that would relieve Good Samaritans from obtaining CWA permits and meeting water quality standards during cleanup. Legislative interest also focused on court rulings regarding Clean Water Act discharge permits for certain activities. The act requires permits for pollutant discharge from point sources under the NPDES program. The Supreme Court decision in South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians raised concerns in agricultural areas about the need for permits when transferring irrigation water. Federal court decisions have also required CWA permits for aerial pesticide application over U.S. waters, impacting pesticide applicators and public health entities. Mosquito control districts are worried about how recent rulings may impact their ability to control pests like the West Nile virus. The EPA finalized a rule in 2006 to clarify when a CWA permit is needed for pesticide use under FIFRA. Congress held hearings on this issue and introduced legislation, such as the Pest Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act, to affirm that a CWA permit is not required for FIFRA-approved pesticides. The House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 1749 in 2005, but no further action occurred. Various reports by the National Research Council, U.S. Congressional Budget Office, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Government Accountability Office provide insights on water quality management and infrastructure gaps.
