    "content": "The Clean Water Act (CWA), enacted in 1972, is the main federal law addressing pollution in the nation's water bodies. It aims to restore water quality and eliminate pollutant discharge into navigable waters by 1985. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversees federal programs, while state and local governments implement CWA regulations. Progress has been made, but challenges persist. The last major amendments were made in the Water Quality Act of 1987. The Water Quality Act of 1987 was the last major amendment to the Clean Water Act. The 111th Congress addressed regional water quality concerns in areas such as Estuaries, Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, and Gulf of Mexico. Estuaries are critical for coastal environments as they provide habitat for wildlife, trap pollutants, and temper storm surges. The National Estuary Program (NEP) was established in response to concerns about the degradation of coastal estuaries. It promotes comprehensive planning efforts to protect threatened estuaries by providing financial and technical assistance for conservation management plans. EPA has approved 28 estuaries for participation in the program since 1987. The Clean Estuaries Act, H.R. 4715, aimed to reauthorize funding for the National Estuary Program through FY2016, increase annual authorization to $50 million, and expand the number of estuaries included. It also proposed additional requirements for comprehensive management plans, including addressing climate change impacts and periodic updates approved by EPA. EPA could reduce grant funding if plans were found deficient. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved an amended version of the bill in June. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved an amended version of H.R. 4715 in June, increasing authorization of appropriations to $75 million per year and requiring updates and evaluations every five years. National Estuary Program provisions were included in Division J, Title CII, Subtitle C. The bill with the greatest potential for controversy is S. 1816, the Chesapeake Clean Water and Ecosystem Restoration Act of 2009. The Chesapeake Clean Water and Ecosystem Restoration Act of 2009 aims to revise CWA Section 117 to address the restoration of Chesapeake Bay's water quality. Despite efforts over several decades, the bay and its tributaries remain in poor health with polluted water and degraded habitat. President Obama declared the bay a \"national treasure\" in 2009, charging the federal government with taking strong action. President Obama declared the Chesapeake Bay a \"national treasure\" in 2009 and called for strong federal leadership in restoring the bay. An executive order established a Federal Leadership Committee to develop a new strategy for protecting and restoring the Chesapeake Basin, including the implementation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to control pollution levels and ensure water quality standards are met. The EPA is required to establish Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for states failing to do so. Over 20,000 waterways in the US, including the Chesapeake Bay watershed, violate water quality standards, necessitating TMDL development. A Chesapeake Bay TMDL must be in place by May 1, 2011, with implementation measures by 2025. This TMDL will be the largest geographically, addressing pollutants like nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment in the bay and its tributaries. Reductions will be allocated to all jurisdictions in the 64,000-square-mile watershed. The federal government is taking a leadership role in restoring the Chesapeake Bay watershed by requiring detailed plans for pollutant reductions. Legislation like S. 1816 aims to set deadlines for restoration actions and provide financial resources totaling $2.26 billion over six years to assist in implementing necessary measures. The legislation for restoration of the Chesapeake Basin watershed, including EPA's TMDL plans and federal Chesapeake Bay restoration strategy, has sparked controversy. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 1816, with companion legislation introduced in the House. Various bills addressing Chesapeake Bay issues were also introduced. House Agriculture Committee approved an amended version of H.R. 5509. The provisions for Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts, included in Division J, Title CII, Subtitle H, were similar to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's bill but with modifications based on H.R. 5509. Changes included directing EPA to create a transparency website, preparing annual financial reports, and modifying compliance provisions for agricultural and private forest conservation plans. S.Amdt. 4845 also amended the Food Security Act of 1985 to authorize conservation practices for agricultural and private foresters in the Chesapeake Bay region. The Columbia River Basin Restoration Act of 2010 aimed to establish a restoration program for the Columbia River Basin, focusing on reducing toxic contamination. It also included a provision to protect the transboundary Flathead River watershed. S. 4016 authorized grants for cross-border collaborations in the US and Canada, with annual appropriations of $33 million from FY2012 to FY2017. The federal share of project costs would not exceed 75%. The bill was introduced on December 8 and included provisions for the Columbia River Basin. The Great Lakes ecosystem faces threats from various stressors. The Great Lakes ecosystem, the largest system of surface freshwater in the world, is threatened by invasive species, pollution, habitat degradation, and contaminated sediments. Efforts by the US and Canada, including the 1987 CWA amendments and the 2002 Great Lakes Legacy Act, aim to improve water quality and remediate toxic sediments in the lakes. In 2004, President Bush created the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force to coordinate restoration efforts for the lakes. President Obama later requested increased funding for an EPA-led Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to address major threats to the ecosystem. Congress approved the appropriations, and a multi-year restoration Action Plan was issued in February 2010. In February 2010, the Interagency Task Force issued a multi-year restoration Action Plan for the Great Lakes, focusing on toxic substances, invasive species, pollution, habitat restoration, and partnerships. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved the Great Lakes Ecosystem Protection Act of 2010, aiming to establish a Great Lakes Leadership Council and continue coordination of restoration efforts with an annual budget of $475 million. The bill aimed to address ecosystem problems by authorizing funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the Great Lakes Legacy Act program for contaminated sediment remediation. The Senate Environment Committee approved the bill, along with a separate bill for reauthorizing the contaminated sediment remediation program. Similar measures were introduced in the House. The bill aimed to reauthorize the Great Lakes contaminated sediment remediation program with $150 million per year in funding through FY2014. It included provisions for establishing a Great Lakes Leadership Council and developing a Great Lakes Restoration Blueprint. The legislation aimed to establish a Great Lakes Leadership Council to oversee the Great Lakes Restoration Blueprint and prioritize projects. It authorized $475 million per year for water quality protection and ecosystem preservation, with provisions for funding transfer and reporting requirements. Additionally, it increased funding for contaminated sediment remediation under the Great Lakes Legacy Act. The Gulf of Mexico Restoration and Protection Act aimed to establish a program under the Clean Water Act to protect and restore the Gulf's ecosystem. It would codify EPA's authority to use interagency agreements and provide grants for water quality monitoring, research, and restoration projects. The Gulf of Mexico Restoration and Protection Act aimed to establish a program under the Clean Water Act to protect and restore the Gulf's ecosystem. The federal share of project costs would be limited to 75%, with a total authorization of $100 million for five years. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 1311, with provisions included in S.Amdt. 4845 for the Gulf of Mexico. Lake Tahoe, the second-deepest lake in North America, has been the focus of environmental protection efforts by California and Nevada governments since the 1960s. In 1969, an agreement between California and Nevada created a regional planning agency to address environmental issues at Lake Tahoe. President Clinton's Executive Order 13057 in 1997 led to the establishment of the Lake Tahoe Federal Interagency Partnership for cleanup efforts. The 2000 Lake Tahoe Restoration Act authorized $300 million over 10 years for various projects, including land acquisition, forest management, fire suppression, and water quality improvement. The act involved multiple federal agencies like the Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and EPA. In the 111th Congress, S. 2724 aimed to reauthorize the 2000 legislation with a focus on priority projects. The 2000 Lake Tahoe Restoration Act reauthorized legislation with a focus on projects like watershed restoration, forest management, fire suppression, and invasive species management. It directed EPA to establish a Lake Tahoe Basin Program for research and restoration support, with $415 million authorized for federal agencies for ecological restoration activities in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Funds were allocated for Forest Service fire risk reduction, EPA water clarity improvement projects, and FWS invasive species activities. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 2724 on June 30, with provisions for Lake Tahoe and Long Island Sound restoration projects. In 2000, Congress amended the CWA to establish a Long Island Sound Program office for conservation management plans and grants. In 2006, Congress enacted the Long Island Sound Stewardship Act (P.L. 109-359) authorizing grants for restoration activities. In the 111th Congress, S. 3119 aimed to reauthorize grant programs for Long Island Sound through FY2015 at current levels. The bill also included new reporting requirements and a pilot project for natural filtration technologies. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 3119, but there was no action in the House on related legislation, H.R. 5876, which focused on the Long Island Sound Program under CWA. The Long Island Sound provisions in S.Amdt. 4845 made significant changes to the Environment Committee-reported bill, defining the area covered by CWA Section 119 as the Long Sound watershed and adding new requirements for stormwater discharge permits on a regional basis. The provisions in S.Amdt. 4845 would have directed EPA to establish a voluntary interstate nitrogen trading program with governors of Long Island Sound states. The legislation would also require the director of EPA's Long Island Sound Office to prepare a list of priority restoration projects annually. Additionally, the bill would increase authorization levels for various programs and authorize funding for municipal wastewater treatment projects. S. 2739, the Puget Sound Recovery Act of 2010, aimed to provide federal funding for the protection and restoration of Puget Sound. The Puget Sound Recovery Act of 2010 aimed to authorize federal funding for the protection and restoration of Puget Sound. It would have allocated $90 million annually through FY2015 to EPA for projects prioritized by the Puget Sound Partnership and approved by EPA. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 2739, but there was no action in the House on similar legislation (H.R. 4029). Amendments were made to clarify procedures for EPA's approval of priority restoration projects. The San Francisco Bay Restoration Act aimed to authorize a grant program for restoration projects in the Bay, with EPA receiving $17 million in appropriations over the last three years for this purpose. The bill would have allowed EPA to increase federal funding for certain projects to 100% and specified percentages of available funds for restoration efforts. The San Francisco Bay Restoration Act aimed to authorize grants for estuary restoration projects in the Bay, with a federal grant not exceeding 75% of the total cost. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 3539, but there was no action in the House on similar legislation. The modified legislation directed EPA to prepare a list of priority projects annually and authorized $350 million over 10 years for assistance. The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act (BEACHES Act) amended the Clean Water Act to improve water quality standards for coastal recreation waters. It authorized grants for monitoring and public notification programs in coastal states. In the 110th Congress, hearings were held on the implementation of the BEACH Act and bills to extend funding for beach monitoring. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to extend funding for beach monitoring grants, including the Clean Coastal Environment and Public Health Act. This legislation aimed to improve water testing and public notification of contamination at beaches, increase grants for monitoring, and extend funding authorization through FY2013. The House also passed similar legislation in July 2009. The amendment extended authorization of appropriations for grants to states through FY2016, included provisions for studies on pollution impact on coastal waters, excess nutrients, and algal blooms, and addressed the formula for distributing state grants under the BEACHES program."
