Recent debates have arisen over the trajectory of federal debt in a low borrowing cost environment. Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) challenges mainstream economic views on these issues. Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) challenges mainstream economic views on deficit financing, suggesting it can be used without harmful effects in low inflation and interest rate conditions. The report explores the differences between MMT and mainstream economics, discusses the justification for deficit financing using MMT, and addresses potential barriers in implementing MMT policies. Institutions may face barriers in adopting MMT for managing the economy as there is no comparative mathematical statement of MMT unlike mainstream macroeconomic theory. Some economists have translated MMT into a mathematical framework, but proponents of MMT may not accept it. Basic macroeconomic models allowing fiscal and monetary policy to influence the economy must balance three relationships: the asset market (IS curve), the money relationship (LM curve), and the economy-wide relationship. The IS-LM model, a simplified macroeconomic model, determines output, prices, and interest rates in the economy. It formalizes the relationship between economic variables and allows researchers to quantify the effects of changes in one variable on the rest of the system. This model is characterized by limited expectations of future economic conditions and sticky prices, forming the core of forecasting models used by government agencies. The IS-LM model is a simplified macroeconomic model used for forecasting by government agencies. It explains the standard model and serves as a foundation for interpreting MMT. Mainstream macroeconomic models focus on fixed capital investment in the short run, with output decisions based on productivity, employment, and IS-LM outcomes. The IS curve represents output as the sum of private consumption, investment, and government spending. The IS-LM model explains the standard model and serves as a foundation for interpreting MMT. It focuses on private consumption, investment, and government spending in a closed economy. Consumption is influenced by disposable income, while investment is affected by interest rates. Fiscal policy can be used to expand or contract the economy by adjusting government spending or taxes. Government spending and taxes can impact the economy by increasing demand through disposable income. The relationship between money supply and demand is crucial for market equilibrium. Money serves as a medium of exchange and a liquid asset, with demand increasing as income rises. In the IS-LM model, money supply and demand balance creates the LM curve, where interest rates and output levels are linked. When interest rates are high, less money is desired as an asset, freeing up more for transactions and income. Fiscal or monetary stimulus can move the economy towards full employment output levels. Expansionary fiscal policy in the IS-LM model leads to a rise in interest rates, reducing investment and limiting the increase in income. Conversely, expansionary monetary policy increases the money available to support income and transactions at every interest rate. Expansionary monetary policy increases the money available to support income and transactions at every interest rate. This leads to more investment and a monetary expansion that increases output and lowers interest rates. Monetary authorities generally target interest rates when making policy choices. Monetary policy can respond to a fiscal policy shift in an IS-LM model by being neutral, accommodating, or offsetting. In a neutral scenario, there is no change in the money supply, mitigating some output effects. An accommodating policy involves a contraction in the money supply to keep interest rates constant, reducing output. An offsetting policy expands the money supply to return output to its original level. The LM curve is affected by the price level, where rising prices and a fixed nominal money supply lead to a decrease in the real money supply. In the short run, the economy's output depends on hiring unemployed labor, with an equilibrium between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Fiscal and monetary policies impact output and price levels through aggregate supply and demand. A fiscal or monetary expansion shifts the aggregate demand curve, leading to more output at every price level. The supply curve is relatively flat in cases of significant underemployment. In full employment, the supply curve is almost vertical, so a demand curve shift increases prices, not output. Price level increase reduces real money supply. Fiscal stimulus contracts real money supply, leading to higher interest rates. Monetary stimulus maintains old money supply position, no output change. Stimulus at full employment leads to rising price levels. Expanding the basic model to include an open economy introduces the balance of payments and exchange rate variables. This new relationship diminishes the impact of fiscal stimulus as interest rates rise in the United States, affecting foreign capital. The rise in interest rates in the United States attracts foreign capital, leading to an increase in the demand for dollars and a decrease in net exports. In an open economy, fiscal stimulus may be offset by capital mobility, but monetary policy becomes more powerful. In an open economy, monetary policy becomes more powerful as an increase in the money supply lowers interest rates, leading to capital outflows and higher net exports. The model also considers how investment responds to expected demand, with firms increasing investment in capital goods as the economy expands. This extension addresses concerns about the IS-LM model not fully accounting for future expectations and lacking microeconomic foundations. Economic growth models incorporate consumption and leisure allocation based on interest rates and disposable income. Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models include demand, supply, and monetary policy components. While academics commonly use DSGE models, private and government forecasters prefer simpler modifications. Critics argue against the DSGE model. Over time, economic business cycle models transition into economic growth models, assuming full employment and long-term growth. In the longer term, economic growth is assumed to be at full employment, driven by labor force, capital accumulation, and technological advances. Mainstream economic theory suggests that fiscal stimulus may benefit growth in the short run but harm it in the long run. Excessive monetary stimulus can lead to inflationary pressures. The section explores MMT's macroeconomic principles and characteristics, interpreting the model into the conventional IS-LM framework. Identifying research on MMT can be challenging due to its emerging nature. Some proponents caution against viewing MMT through a traditional macroeconomic lens, but this approach aligns with elements in mainstream economic analysis. MMT's theory does not consider self-imposed constraints like lack of a sovereign currency or independence of monetary authority and the Treasury. U.S. institutions may limit the application of MMT in managing the economy by restraining monetary policy and relying on fiscal policy to address the business cycle. The model suggests that fiscal stimulus can still be used when there are unused resources in the economy or when it leads to inflation. MMT's macroeconomic principles focus on fiscal stimulus to address unused resources in the economy and inflation. The model highlights the relationship between national saving, investment, government spending, and taxes. One key difference from traditional macroeconomic models is MMT's assumption that private investment levels are not influenced by changes in interest rates. MMT's macroeconomic model emphasizes fiscal stimulus to tackle underutilized resources and inflation. Unlike traditional models, MMT assumes private investment is not affected by changes in interest rates. This leads to a vertical IS curve where desired investment and savings are equivalent at a single output level, regardless of interest rates. Fiscal policy can still impact short-term economic outcomes in line with MMT's investment-savings relationship. Expansionary fiscal policy under MMT would increase income and output without affecting investment levels, as interest rates are not considered a factor. This approach allows for government deficits to impact economic outcomes, with the option of keeping interest rates fixed through a money supply response. Equilibrium in MMT is achieved through a different perspective than mainstream macroeconomic theory. In Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), money is viewed differently than in mainstream macroeconomics, with the government legitimizing money by accepting it as payment for taxes. Government spending is seen as \"creating\" money in the economy, where the monetary authority provides money to finance spending, injecting money into the economy. In Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), the government injects money into the economy by depositing money in the Treasury checking account, which is used to pay taxes. The Federal Reserve can lend money to the Treasury, allowing banking institutions to make lending choices independent of reserve requirements. This limits the ability of central banks to control the money supply. The Federal Reserve can influence market interest rates but may not have direct control over the money supply. The LM curve is horizontal when targeting interest rates, allowing the central bank to set low rates to lower government borrowing costs. The level of the fixed interest rate can be chosen at any rate. The level of the fixed interest rate can be chosen at any rate, with many supporting a zero nominal interest rate. Fiscal policy can be adjusted to maintain a low and stable rate of inflation. Modern Monetary Theory suggests that monetary policy can maintain a chosen interest rate over time, but this requires the absence of other economic forces, such as expected inflation. Inflation expectations have a documented impact on interest rates. The adoption of a chosen interest rate may require constant injections of money to prevent inflation. Modern Monetary Theory suggests that a sovereign government can create money without causing inflation. It is unclear whether MMT proponents advocate for fiscal policy over monetary policy to address an underemployed economy. Proponents believe that monetary authorities can influence interest rates through various methods. The MMT assumption that investment is insensitive to interest rates implies that only fiscal policy can shift an underperforming economy to full output in the short run. This approach, described as \"extreme Keynesian,\" involves deficit financing in a recession to close the output and income gap, with the Federal Reserve tasked with restraining any subsequent increase in interest rates. The MMT model proposes fixed interest rates to reduce federal borrowing costs, with fiscal policy driving the economy to full output. Monetary policy is minimized, and the equilibrium output is determined by total factor productivity, fiscal choices, and employment levels. In an underemployed economy, fiscal stimulus increases output. At full employment, fiscal stimulus may lead to inflation, signaling a need for contractionary fiscal policy. Without investment sensitivity to interest rates, fiscal stimulus at full employment could cause an inflationary spiral under the MMT model. It is important to exert fiscal discipline if inflation arises. These effects are based on MMT's IS and LM assumptions and align with extreme Keynesian views on fiscal policy. There is no link between the IS-LM curve and AD-AS curve in MMT, leading to excess demand causing an increase in the price level. Proponents of MMT also advocate for a federal job guarantee. The job guarantee is widely advocated by MMT proponents to reduce employment fluctuations across business cycles and increase deficit financing. It aims to eliminate certain types of unemployment but may still have challenges in matching workers with tasks. The specific characteristics and implementation process will determine its impact on output, employment, and price levels. The job guarantee proposed by MMT proponents aims to reduce employment fluctuations and increase deficit financing. However, challenges may arise in matching workers with tasks, especially in non-uniform job markets like the United States. Misallocation of resources could occur if goods provided by the government are not based on collective needs or public goods. The job guarantee proposed by MMT proponents aims to reduce employment fluctuations and increase deficit financing. Challenges may arise in matching workers with tasks, especially in non-uniform job markets like the United States. Issues include treating workers who violate employment terms, capital inputs for jobs, and transportation problems for rural workers. In an open economy, the IS curve includes net exports sensitive to interest rates. Mainstream economic theory suggests that rising interest rates lead to increased capital investment, raising the dollar price and decreasing net exports. In the MMT model, the IS curve would no longer be vertical as investment activity responds to interest changes. In an open economy, the IS curve includes net exports sensitive to interest rates. The MMT model suggests that rising interest rates may make financing debt more difficult due to low interest rates, affecting Treasury debt attractiveness to investors. The analysis in MMT literature focuses on short-term application and managing business cycles, with less discussion on its long-term implications. MMT's short-term view of deficit financing contrasts with mainstream economics, which supports deficit financing for managing economic shocks. Mainstream economics recognizes borrowing limits based on investors' willingness and availability of funds. This constraint is determined by total savings and market borrowing options. MMT proponents advocate for a more active fiscal policy role in managing economic shocks, believing that sovereign governments like the United States cannot be forced to default on debt issued in their own currency. This could lead to larger deficits and higher debt levels compared to mainstream economic thinking. The belief in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is supported by the idea of a central bank setting interest rates near zero to support deficit financing at lower economic growth rates. MMT suggests that a sovereign government can avoid default by using money creation instead of taxes or borrowing. However, there have been instances of governments defaulting through other means like inflating currency or renegotiating terms. While the United States currently faces no concerns about selling its debt, a collapse in the market could make it costly or impossible. If a market collapse occurs, it could be costly to implement necessary measures like higher taxes to control inflation from money creation. The Treasury may issue more debt than needed from new deficits to minimize borrowing costs. This could lead to higher interest rates on both new and existing debt, as seen during the Greek debt crisis. The federal debt position could lead to a collapse in demand for Treasury securities, causing a \"debt cycle\" with significant effects on federal borrowing and financial markets. This could result in higher interest rates, more borrowing, and investor avoidance, impacting general financial operations. MMT proponents argue for government deficits. MMT proponents argue that government deficits must be small to limit inflation, which is similar to mainstream macroeconomics. Concerns arise about addressing debt sustainability issues before they become urgent, leading to economic shocks. In the MMT case, the assumption is that the Federal Reserve could finance spending, but institutional constraints may prevent this. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that federal debt held by the public would rise significantly in the coming years, potentially limiting the effectiveness of MMT policies in managing business cycles. However, there are currently no signs of federal borrowing capacity being near exhaustion, as interest rates remain low. Recent international experiences highlight the complexity of borrowing capacity. Recent international experiences with government debt highlight the complexity of borrowing capacity. Greece and Japan both saw significant increases in debt levels over the past decade. Greek debt rose from 115% to 189% of GDP, leading to a severe recession, while Japanese debt increased from 180% to 234% of GDP with more sustainable borrowing. Consideration of institutional characteristics is crucial when evaluating structural changes. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, chosen without political affiliation, adjusts open market operations every six weeks to implement monetary policy changes efficiently. Fiscal policy decisions, affected by legislative calendar and political factors, may have a higher evidential threshold than actions by the Federal Reserve. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was enacted 10 months after the start of the Great Recession to alleviate its effects. In 2008, 10 months after the recession began, the Federal Reserve took significant action. The Treasury and Federal Reserve are treated as a single entity in MMT, allowing the Federal Reserve to indirectly lend to the Treasury. The Federal Reserve can purchase federal debt in the secondary market without limits, while the Treasury must sell bonds when revenues are insufficient. The degree of independence between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury has varied. The Federal Reserve can lend indirectly to the Treasury, but their objectives differ. The Federal Reserve's mandate includes maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. MMT-supported policies may require support from both federal policymakers and the Federal Reserve for full effect. Delegating authority to the Federal Reserve is justified by economists for choosing policies consistent with low inflation. Delegating authority to the Federal Reserve is justified by economists for choosing policies consistent with low inflation. Subordinating the Federal Reserve could result in policies under the MMT framework that remove this check against high inflation.
