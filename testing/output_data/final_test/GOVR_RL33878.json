    "content": "UMNO and its coalition partners have dominated Malaysian politics since independence in 1957, consistently winning parliamentary elections with a two-thirds majority, except in 1969. This supermajority allows them to amend the constitution without opposition support. In 2004, the BN won 90.4% of seats, but the 2008 election results were a surprise, with the BN barely receiving half of the popular vote. In the 2008 elections, the BN barely received half of the popular vote and won just 140 of the 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat, falling short of a \"supermajority.\" UMNO, MCA, and Gerakan were the biggest losers, while opposition parties like DAP, PAS, and PKR saw significant gains in parliamentary seats. In the 2008 elections, the BN won 140 out of 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat, falling short of a \"supermajority.\" The DAP and PAS increased their seats by 16 each, totaling 28 and 23 seats respectively. Malaysia's opposition parties won 82 seats in total, with 46.8% of the popular vote. The BN's weakness was evident in the state elections, with opposition parties winning five states. Some attribute the BN's loss of support to Badawi's failure to implement reforms within the party. In the aftermath of the 2008 elections, there were calls for Badawi to resign due to his failure to make reforms within the BN and the government. Economic factors like rising income disparities and inflation were also cited as reasons for voters switching to opposition parties. The election results were seen as a sign that Malaysia's ethnicity-based political system was outdated. Badawi reorganized his cabinet, reducing the number of ministers and introducing new faces, including removing long-standing members like Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz. Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz, who served as Minister of International Trade and Industry for over 20 years, has been a key figure in U.S.-Malaysian trade relations. The recent drop in support for ethnically-based political parties in Malaysia has sparked calls for political changes, with suggestions to eliminate ethnic restrictions on party membership. Some believe this shift in support to opposition parties indicates a need for reform in Malaysia's political system. The shift in Chinese and Indian support to opposition parties in Malaysia reflects a growing sense among ethnic minorities that the ruling party no longer represents their interests. Economic issues like food price inflation and income disparities are also driving this change. The opposition's increasing power is expected to limit the ruling party's ability to implement policy changes, marking a potential shift towards a two-party, non-ethnic political system in Malaysia. The opposition's control of five states in Malaysia may limit the ruling party's power. The potential for social unrest and policy change is a concern following the ruling party's weak showing in the 2008 election. The 1969 riots in Malaysia led to approximately 200 deaths and the implementation of the New Economic Policy. The 2008 elections in Malaysia are not expected to have a significant impact on U.S.-Malaysia relations, except for the removal of Aziz as Minister of International Trade and Industry. Her replacement, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, may affect the U.S.-Malaysia free trade agreement negotiations. Malaysia's colonial past shaped its diverse demographic mix, with ethnic Chinese and Indians added to the Malay and indigenous populations. The bumiputeras, comprising Malays and indigenous groups, make up 58% of the population, while Chinese and Indians account for 24% and 7% respectively. Ethnic Chinese and Indians historically controlled more wealth, leading to inter-communal politics in Malaysia. After World War II, a British plan to create the Malaysian Union was met with resistance from Malays who feared competition from Chinese. This led to the formation of UMNO, a Malay nationalist organization that later became a political party. Negotiations between the British and UMNO resulted in the Federation of Malaya in 1948, which included special rights for bumiputeras and Malaysia's sultans. Sabah and Sarawak joined to form Malaysia in 1963, while Singapore left in 1965. Malays were expected to dominate politically, with Chinese and Indians granted citizenship and economic roles. During the \"Malayan Emergency\" from 1948 to 1960, the Communist Party of Malaysia, mainly comprised of ethnic Chinese, fought against the British. The Internal Security Act (ISA) was initially used to combat \"communist subversion.\" The Special Branch, inherited from the British, remains the primary intelligence unit. Inter-communal strife continued with the 1969 riots, where Malays generally supported the British against the Chinese communists. The 1969 riots in Malaysia resulted in 196 deaths, mostly ethnic Chinese, following the Alliance Party's electoral loss. The New Economic Policy (NEP) was introduced in 1971 in response to the riots, providing preferential treatment for the bumiputera majority. The NEP was later replaced by the New Development Policy (NDP) in 1990, which aimed to maintain bumiputera control of corporate assets at 30%. The NEP in 1990 retained goals such as 30% bumiputera control of assets. PM Mahathir's Vision 2020 aimed for national unity. BN relies on economic growth to favor bumiputeras without alienating other ethnic groups. Malaysia's social harmony and BN support are tied to economic growth. Economic stagnation could disrupt ethnic balance and BN support. Malaysia is a unique Constitutional Monarchy with 13 states and three federal territories. Every five years, nine hereditary Sultans elect a Yang di Pertuan Agong, akin to a King. Malaysia is a unique Constitutional Monarchy with 13 states and three federal territories. Every five years, nine hereditary Sultans elect a Yang di Pertuan Agong, akin to a King. The Agong exercises limited authority and acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, Parliament, and the Cabinet. The government is based on a \"semi\" democracy with both democratic and authoritarian elements. The government in Malaysia is based on a parliamentary system with regular elections. Despite a democratic structure, authoritarian control limits opposition's ability to defeat the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Badawi leads the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) in the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. The opposition is led by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), People's Justice Party (PKR), and Democratic Action Party (DAP). In 1999, an opposition alliance called Barisan Alternatif was formed. The Barisan Alternatif opposition alliance in Malaysia fragmented in 2001, leading to the formation of the Barisan Rakyat alliance for the 2008 elections. UMNO is the dominant party representing Sunni Malays, promoting a moderate form of Islam under a secular polity. The ruling BN, led by Mahathir, used state power to counter PAS's conservative Islamic views. PAS's influence is mainly in Kelantan and Terengganu. The transition from Mahathir to Badawi in Malaysia was solidified in the 2004 elections, where the ruling BN increased its hold on parliament and votes. Badawi's moderate Islamic approach gained support over PAS's hard-line stance, leading to an improvement in U.S.-Malaysian relations. Badawi's leadership aims to provide stability and a more consultative government, working with BN to achieve Vision 2020 goals. His religious background helps counter Islamic extremism, but internal divisions within UMNO, exacerbated by differences with Mahathir, pose challenges. Party divisions have led to early general election calls. Under Badawi's leadership, Malaysia has been developing Islam Hadhari, a concept promoting a moderate view of Islamic civilization to counter extremism. Some believe it encourages development, social justice, and tolerance. There is increasing focus on the role of moderate Islamic ideology in countering extremism regionally and globally. Malaysia is facing concerns about an increasing Islamisation trend and the emergence of a more conservative form of Islam, despite government efforts through Islam Hadhari. The country plays an active role in international organizations such as APEC, ASEAN, WTO, ADB, Islamic Development Bank, NAM, OIC, UN, and World Bank. Malaysia has chaired ASEAN, OIC, and NAM in the past and contributes to international peacekeeping efforts. Malaysia has been involved in international peacekeeping efforts, including missions in East Timor and Indonesia. It has also played a role in facilitating negotiations between the government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Despite past conflicts with regional states, Malaysia emphasizes regional cooperation. Malaysia is a member of the Five Power Defense Arrangements and has interests in the hydrocarbon potential of the South China Sea. Malaysia has significant interest in the hydrocarbon potential of the South China Sea, leading to conflicts with Brunei in the past. The discovery of the Kikeh field by Murphy Oil in 2002 has provided a significant oil reserve for Malaysia. There are ongoing conflicting claims over the Spratly Islands and the South China Sea involving Malaysia, China, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Malaysia has been a key player in ASEAN since its founding in 1967, advocating for its expansion in the 1990s. Recently, Malaysia has aimed for a more influential role in ASEAN and Southeast Asia, particularly in trade issues. Malaysia plays an influential role in ASEAN and Southeast Asia, focusing on trade issues. It hosted the East Asian Summit in 2005 and supported the drafting of the new ASEAN Charter. Malaysia aims for closer trade relations with nations outside ASEAN through \"ASEAN+3\" and \"ASEAN+6\" models. However, its small size and lack of consensus in ASEAN limit its leadership role. Malaysia's attitudes towards China have shifted from suspicion to viewing China as a competitor and trading partner. Malaysia has shifted its attitude towards China from suspicion to seeing it as both a competitor and trading partner. It has maintained close economic and trade relations with Taiwan, with over 2,000 Taiwanese companies investing in Malaysia. In 2007, China was Malaysia's 4th largest trading partner, while Taiwan was the 7th largest. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, was Malaysia's 8th largest trading partner in the same year. ASEAN states are more concerned about economic competition and cooperation with China rather than security issues. China is now seen as an opportunity with challenges, rather than a threat. Malaysia's perception of China has shifted from suspicion to viewing it as a competitor and trading partner. ASEAN states are more focused on economic competition and cooperation with China rather than security issues. Tensions between Malaysia and Indonesia stem from differences over policies towards illegal workers and a maritime dispute off Borneo. The presence of illegal Indonesian workers in Malaysia may have influenced the Indian population's political shift in the 2008 elections. Many undocumented Indonesians were forced to leave Malaysia in 2004-2005. Allegations of human trafficking of Indonesian women and children for sexual exploitation in Malaysia. Conflict over oil concession in waters off Sabah led to naval tensions with Indonesia. Malaysia participated in monitoring peace treaty between Indonesia and GAM in 2005. Calls for ASEAN states to discuss defense and economic policy. Illegal forest fires in Sumatra in 2005 affected Malaysia. Illegal forest fires in Sumatra in August 2005 caused Malaysia to close schools, its largest seaport, and declare a state of emergency in Kuala Selangor and Port Kelang due to severe smoke pollution. The Indonesian government blamed 10 logging companies, 8 of which were Malaysian-owned. More efforts are needed to establish legal frameworks to control trans-border pollution. 70% of logging in Indonesia is illegal. Malaysian PM Badawi met with Indonesian President Yudhoyono in 2008 to discuss land and maritime border issues. Malaysia and Thailand discussed land and maritime border issues, defense cooperation, migrant workers, illegal logging, and economic cooperation. Malaysia aims to improve relations with Thailand through a Joint Development Strategy for border areas. Relations with Singapore have been challenging due to ethnic tensions, economic interdependency, and security concerns. Singapore is predominantly Chinese. Singapore and Malaysia have economic interdependency due to Singapore relying on Malaysia for resources like water and labor, while Malaysia depends on Singapore for capital investments and trade opportunities. Both countries also rely on the flow of shipments through the Strait of Malacca. They have established coordinated naval patrols with Indonesia to protect freight shipments. The 2008 elections are not expected to affect bilateral relations according to Singapore's minister of foreign affairs. Malaysia's economy relies on domestic forces and external trade for growth. The real GDP has been growing at 5-6% annually for the past five years. The country's per capita income in 2007 was $5,740. In 2007, Malaysia's per capita income was $5,740, but its purchasing power parity value was $13,289. The main sources of GDP growth were domestic consumption, public consumption, public investment, and private investment. Despite external trade growth, imports outpaced exports, impacting economic expansion. Forecasts suggest private investment will drive growth in 2008, reflecting the maturation of Malaysia's economy towards a service sector focus. Malaysia's economy relies heavily on the service sector, similar to South Korea and Thailand. Agriculture, although a small part of the GDP, is significant with one-third of Malaysians living in rural areas. Rice and palm oil are crucial crops, with palm oil being a major export. The manufacturing sector contributes a third of the GDP, employs 30% of workers, and accounts for over 80% of export earnings. Malaysia's economy relies heavily on the service sector, agriculture is significant with one-third of Malaysians living in rural areas. The manufacturing sector contributes a third of the GDP, employs 30% of workers, and accounts for over 80% of export earnings. Malaysia is a regional leader in automobile production, with major manufacturers exporting vehicles to over 40 countries. The electrical and electronics industry is a world-leader in semiconductors and E&E product assembly for international companies. Malaysia's economy heavily relies on the service sector, with over half of its GDP and employment coming from this sector. The nation's export earnings are largely driven by the electrical and electronics industry, which accounts for approximately half of Malaysia's export earnings. The service sector is highly diversified, catering to both domestic and external markets. Malaysia has gradually eased restrictions on foreign participation in some service sectors, including financial services, but access to the country's financial markets remains limited for foreign companies. Malaysia's financial markets have limited access for foreign companies. Foreign trade plays a significant role in the country's economic growth, with total trade exceeding 1 trillion ringgits in 2006. Malaysia maintains a trade surplus of about $30 billion per year, with the United States as its largest export market. The nation's top 10 export markets are in the Asia-Pacific region, with Japan historically being the largest supplier of imports. In 2006, the United States was the second-largest supplier of Malaysia's imports. Malaysia's leading import suppliers are mainly from Asia. China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have a trade surplus with Malaysia. The US has the largest trade deficit with Malaysia. Both Malaysia's exports to and imports from the US decreased in 2007. Malaysia aims to sustain economic growth, maintain employment, control inflation, and reduce the fiscal deficit as part of its economic policies. The government also aims to reduce poverty and enhance living standards under its Islam Hadhari policy. The Malaysian government, under the Islam Hadhari policy, aims to reduce poverty, improve living standards, and address income and wealth inequality between ethnic groups. Key objectives include investing in education for higher value-added activities, enhancing the quality of the workforce, and eliminating poverty by 2010. The Malaysian government aims to reduce poverty by 2010 and improve living standards. To achieve this, they will strengthen government agencies, promote private sector growth, attract foreign investment, control inflation, and reduce the fiscal deficit. The central bank has adopted a managed float exchange rate policy for the ringgit. Malaysia's de facto exchange rate policy aims to maintain the value of the ringgit relatively constant compared to China's renminbi. The country's foreign trade policy supports trade and investment liberalization, with total trade exceeding 1 trillion ringgits by 2007. Malaysia is actively involved in trade liberalization efforts with ASEAN, APEC, and the WTO, particularly supporting discussions with ASEAN+3 for an East Asian economic partnership. The United States and Malaysia have trade relations dominated by outsourcing of machinery and electronic products. Malaysia's exports to the US grew significantly from 2001 to 2006 but declined in 2007. However, US exports to Malaysia did not experience similar growth. Discussions are ongoing about forming an East Asian economic community with ASEAN+3 countries. The U.S. bilateral trade deficit with Malaysia increased between 2001 and 2007, with a difference in reported figures. The relative importance of each country as a trading partner has declined since 2001, with a decrease in the percentage of exports and imports between the two countries. Top categories of goods traded between Malaysia and the United States in 2007 include machinery and electrical machinery. In 2007, bilateral trade between the United States and Malaysia focused on machinery (HS84) and electrical machinery (HS85), with major U.S. companies outsourcing electronic and electrical products production in Malaysia. The United States mainly exported computers, office equipment parts, integrated circuits, and microassemblies, while importing telephones and telephone parts. The United States has been a significant source of foreign direct investment in Malaysia since 2000, along with Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. In 2007, the United States invested $870 million in Malaysia, accounting for 17.3% of the country's total inward FDI. The U.S. is the fourth largest source of FDI in Malaysia after Japan, Germany, and Iran. The cumulative U.S. FDI in Malaysia exceeds $20 billion, primarily in electronics, electrical manufacturing, and petrochemicals. Both Malaysia and the U.S. support trade and investment liberalization but may differ on specific issues. Both Malaysia and the United States support trade and investment liberalization through multilateral and bilateral agreements. Despite some differences in goals and means, both countries share a common baseline in their trade relations as members of the WTO and APEC. They have agreements such as the TIFA and are currently negotiating an FTA. The United States and Malaysia are negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) to remove trade barriers and expand bilateral trade. Six rounds of negotiations have taken place, with outstanding issues including market access for U.S. agricultural goods in Malaysia. The negotiations between the United States and Malaysia for a bilateral free trade agreement include market access for U.S. exports to Malaysia, Malaysian exports to the U.S., U.S. services in Malaysia, intellectual property rights protection, and Malaysia's government procurement system. The fifth round of talks in February 2007 faced complications due to a $16 billion energy deal between Malaysia and Iran. Trade between Iran and Malaysia has been rapidly growing over the past six years. Malaysia's trade with Iran grew significantly, reaching over $1.045 billion in 2007. The U.S. expressed concerns over Malaysia's deal with Iran, but Malaysia rejected calls to revoke it, stating that they have the right to trade with any country. Malaysia firmly rejects political pressure in trade negotiations, particularly in response to Representative Lantos' comments. The country asserts that FTA negotiations should not be influenced by political demands or threats. The passing of the April 2, 2007 deadline for Trade Promotion Authority further complicates the situation, as Congress considers the implementation bill for the proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA. On May 10, 2004, Malaysia and the United States signed a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement known as the U.S.-Malaysia TIFA. The agreement aims to develop trade and investment, ensure supportive trade and environmental policies, and strengthen private sector contacts. It established a Joint Council on Trade and Investment to meet annually for implementation. The TIFA also includes a work program focusing on trade liberalization and facilitation in various sectors. The U.S.-Malaysia TIFA agreement aims to reduce trade and investment barriers in services, ICT, biotechnology, and tourism. Both countries are members of the WTO. Malaysia's trade policy has evolved under the Bawadi Administration to support liberalization. The U.S. and Malaysia have some differences in the specifics of the Doha Round goals. Malaysia and the United States have differing opinions on market access offers for agricultural goods in multilateral forums like ASEAN and APEC. The US proposed transforming APEC into a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, which received mixed responses. Many believe Malaysia prefers an all-Asian approach. Malaysia is a founding member of ASEAN and supports the formation of an all-Asian free trade area that excludes the United States. ASEAN has invited Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, China, and South Korea to attend the East Asia Summit. Malaysia is seen as a major proponent of regional cooperation with Japan, China, and South Korea. Malaysia supports the formation of an all-Asian free trade area that excludes the United States, in response to the growing influence of the European Union and the United States in international trade relations. This is seen as a rival model to the proposed FTAAP by the United States. Malaysia, as a member of ASEAN, ratified the new ASEAN Charter, with one of the main outcomes being the signing of a new charter in November 2007. The November summit in Singapore saw the signing of a new charter on November 20, 2007, which must be ratified by all 10 ASEAN members. The Philippines expressed reluctance to ratify unless Burma (Myanmar) upholds democracy and human rights. The charter aims to transform ASEAN into a regional economic community like the EU by 2015, promoting free flow of goods, services, investment, and capital. However, it includes an \"ASEAN minus X\" provision allowing members to opt out of economic commitments. The creation of an ASEAN Community may impact U.S. policies in Southeast Asia. Bilateral relations between the United States and Malaysia have improved since Badawi became Prime Minister, following a previously strained relationship under Mahathir's leadership. Mahathir's support after 9/11 led to a thawing of relations, culminating in a state visit to the White House in 2002. The warmer relationship has continued into the Badawi administration. Relations between the United States and Malaysia have improved under Prime Minister Badawi, following a previously strained relationship. Tensions arise over Malaysia's opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and critiques of U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. has concerns about Malaysia's relationships with certain nations and includes Malaysia in its annual human rights reports. Prime Minister Badawi visited President Bush in 2004 to strengthen bilateral ties. During his visit to Washington in 2004, Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi and President Bush discussed Islamic issues, bilateral trade, and the need to bridge the divide between the Muslim world and the West. President Bush acknowledged the strong ties between the United States and Malaysia. Malaysia's strong bilateral ties with the United States include trade, investment, defense partnerships, and cooperation in the global war on terrorism. As a moderate Muslim nation, Malaysia serves as a model of a modern, prosperous, multi-racial, and multi-religious society. Malaysia was a vocal critic of the U.S.-led war against Iraq, with then-Prime Minister Mahathir opposing the war in various international forums. Malaysia's opposition to the Iraq war and the continued U.S. presence in Iraq persisted under Prime Minister Badawi. He criticized the invasion as illegal and baseless, attributing it to Western countries fueling international terrorism. Badawi emphasized the ineffectiveness of using force alone in the fight against terrorism. Prime Minister Badawi criticized the attribution of international terrorism to Islam and advocated for the United Nations to lead in restoring peace in Iraq. Malaysia's opposition to the U.S. military presence in Iraq and disagreement with the approach to terrorism remain strong. Badawi emphasized that religion, particularly Islam, is not to blame for economic deprivation or discord between the Muslim world and the West. He highlighted ongoing issues in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Golan Heights, Lebanon, and Palestine as consequences of power projections by world centers. Lebanon and Palestine are remnants of world power projections, causing humiliation among Muslims towards the West. Malaysia opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq but is seen as a valuable ally in combating militant Islam in Southeast Asia. The region, with significant Islamic populations, is experiencing a revival amidst increased radicalization, as seen with groups like Jemaah Islamiya and Abu Sayyaf. Malaysia has detained suspected terrorists and believes in the importance of addressing terrorism. The Malaysian government has detained over 110 suspected terrorists since May 2001, effectively crippling the Kumpulan Mujahedin Malaysia (KMM) with ties to the Jemaah Islamiya (JI) group. Two JI leaders, Noordin Mohammad Top and Azahari Husin, have Malaysian connections. Malaysia improved bilateral relations with the US after September 11, 2001, and former Prime Minister Mahathir criticized the attacks. Former Prime Minister Mahathir strongly criticized the United States for their actions, leading to increased cooperation on counterterrorism. Malaysia and the US signed agreements on counterterrorism, with Malaysia playing a key role in regional efforts by establishing a counterterrorism center in Kuala Lumpur. The center facilitates access to technology, information, and training for combating terror. In 2002, Malaysia hosted the ASEAN Regional Forum Inter-sessional Meeting on Counter-Terrorism following a meeting between President Bush and Deputy Prime Minister Badawi. The U.S. Coordinator for Counter-terrorism emphasized the need for international political will and capacity building to fight terrorism effectively. Malaysia opened the Southeast Asia Regional Center for Counter-terrorism in August 2003, with questions raised about its effectiveness. Prime Minister Badawi has continued Malaysia's commitment to fighting terrorism. During a regional counter-terror conference in Bali in February 2004, U.S. Attorney General Ashcroft praised Malaysia's role in fighting terrorism. Malaysian Defense Minister Razak warned about the consequences of ignoring the need for a balanced approach in the war against terror during a defense conference in Singapore in June 2004. This exchange highlighted differences in approaches to combating terrorism in Southeast Asia. The United States and Malaysia prioritize \"soft power\" approaches in the war against terror, emphasizing military cooperation through defense visits, training exchanges, and equipment sales. The 2007 Congressional Budget Justification highlights the promotion of human rights through exposure to U.S. ideals and confirms that the Malaysian military has not violated human rights. Deputy Secretary of State Zoellick and Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Najib renewed a military cooperation agreement in 2005. Malaysian officers participate in training programs in the U.S. under IMET, and there is a student exchange program between the two countries. The United States and Malaysia prioritize military cooperation through defense visits, training exchanges, and equipment sales. Malaysia has bought military equipment from the U.S. and is seeking to narrow the technology gap with Singapore. Bilateral military exercises and visits between the two countries are common, with a focus on areas such as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, anti-piracy, and counterterrorism. U.S. Navy ships visit Malaysia annually, and U.S. warships and military personnel participate in joint activities in Malaysia. The United States and Malaysia prioritize military cooperation through defense visits, training exchanges, and equipment sales. U.S. warships and military personnel participate in joint exercises with Malaysia in the South China Sea to bolster bilateral ties and enhance the Navy's regional operations. Admiral Fargo highlighted shared concerns over terrorism, proliferation, trafficking, and piracy. Malaysia established a Maritime Enforcement Agency in 2005 to increase patrols in the Straits of Malacca, where some ships have been vulnerable to piracy. Some ships vulnerable to piracy in the 600 mile long strait. Concerns about terrorists attacking shipping in the strategically vital strait. Malaysia and the United States reach understanding on securing the Straits of Malacca from terrorist acts. Admiral Fargo warns of potential terrorist attacks in the area. Idea of positioning U.S. counterterrorism forces in the region to address threats. Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore began coordinated naval patrols of the Straits of Malacca on July 20, 2004. The State Department report on human rights practices in Malaysia noted some issues, despite generally respecting citizens' rights. The State Department report highlighted various human rights issues in Malaysia, including restrictions on freedom of the press, assembly, and association, ethnic discrimination, and detainee deaths. Malaysia aims to boost trade with Sudan, where Malaysian companies are significant investors in the petroleum industry, contributing to Sudan's substantial petroleum export revenues. In 2005, Sudan received $2.3 billion from petroleum exports, with Malaysia as the second largest investor in Sudan after China. Malaysian companies are involved in construction and transportation services for Sudan's oil industry. Malaysia's state oil company, Petronas, has interests in nine oil fields and a refinery project in Port Sudan. Malaysia, as the current chair of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, supports Sudan and opposes proposed U.N. sanctions. Prime Minister Badawi expressed support for Sudan during a 2007 visit, stating that media exaggerated the situation in Darfur. Malaysia opposes U.N. sanctions on Sudan, preferring more time for talks. U.S. assistance to Malaysia has been declining, including military training and anti-terrorism programs. Sudan's President hopes Malaysia will help resist Western pressure for international forces in Darfur. The Bush Administration has requested funding for various programs including International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, Anti-Terrorist Demining, Anti-Terrorism Assistance, and Export Control. IMET programs with Malaysia aim to strengthen military ties and promote interoperability. The U.S. is a key training partner with Malaysia in counter-terrorism efforts."
