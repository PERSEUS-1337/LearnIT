    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicaid Mammography Coverage Act of 1995\". Congress acknowledges the significant impact of breast cancer as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. With an estimated 182,000 new cases expected in 1995, early detection through mammography is crucial for survival. The American Cancer Society recommends screening mammograms for asymptomatic women starting at age 40. The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute recommend annual mammograms for women over 50. Lower-income women often can't afford cancer screening, but many receive benefits through Medicaid. SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY UNDER MEDICAID. Coverage of screening mammography under Medicaid is amended to include procedures conducted by certified facilities, with defined frequency guidelines. Screening mammography is a radiologic procedure for early breast cancer detection, covered under Medicaid with frequency guidelines based on age. For individuals under 50 years of age, at high risk of breast cancer as determined by the Secretary, Medicaid does not cover screening mammography within 11 months of a previous one. If not at high risk, Medicaid also does not cover screening mammography within a certain timeframe. The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Cancer Institute, periodically reviews the appropriate frequency for screening mammography based on age and other factors. For women over 49 years of age, Medicaid does not cover screening mammography within 11 months of a previous one. The Secretary may revise the frequency of medical assistance under this title based on pertinent factors. Coverage under Medicaid is made mandatory for certain services. Charges against beneficiaries are prohibited under specific sections of the Act. Sections 1916(a)(2)(D) and 1916(b)(2)(D) of the Act are amended to include services described in section 1905(a)(25). Section 1905(b) is amended to provide a 100 percent federal match for screening mammography. Conforming amendments are made to sections 1902(a)(10)(C)(iv) and 1902(j) of the Act. The amendments made by this section apply to screening mammography performed on or after January 1, 1996. State plans for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act must meet the additional requirements imposed by these amendments. The Act requires an additional requirement to be met before the first day of the first calendar quarter following the State legislature session. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session."
