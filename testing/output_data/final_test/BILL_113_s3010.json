SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO TRUTH IN CALLER ID ACT OF 2009. Amendments to the Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 include changes to communications from outside the United States, clarification of the definition of \"IP-Enabled Voice Service,\" and addressing spoofing services. Amendments to the Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 address spoofing services by requiring providers to verify users and comply with recordkeeping and reporting obligations set by the Commission. The Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 amendments require providers to comply with regulations to prevent violations, including subpoena authority to disclose caller identification information from spoofing services. The Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 amendments require providers to comply with regulations to prevent violations, including subpoena authority to disclose caller identification information from spoofing services. The Act prohibits users from substituting false caller identification information for calls or text messages. Amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 address the use of substitute names or numbers for caller identification. The term 'text message' refers to real-time or near real-time messages containing text, images, sounds, or other information transmitted or received by a device identified by a telephone number. It includes SMS, EMS, and MMS messages. The term 'text messaging service' refers to a service that allows the transmission or receipt of text messages, excluding real-time voice or video communication. This definition does not modify the authority of the Commission under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. The Robocall Enforcement Improvements Act of 2014 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to include text messages as part of the definition of a 'call'. This amendment does not affect any rules or orders adopted by the Commission under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 or the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. The Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 requires the Commission to implement regulations within 18 months of enactment. The amendments made by this Act will take effect 6 months after the regulations are in place. Congress believes that telecommunications carriers should have the authority to offer services that block robocalls, and government agencies should encourage the development and implementation of these services."
