    "content": "Federal agencies issue regulations to implement government policies and programs. Some regulations have significant economic effects, including costs, benefits, and transfer payments. Congress and Presidents have established procedures for agencies to follow when issuing regulations, which include requirements for considering economic impacts. Regulations are created with delegated authority from Congress, leading to congressional oversight. In recent years, Members of Congress have shown interest in overseeing federal regulations, particularly in monitoring the total cost and benefits of the regulatory system. There is a debate on whether agencies should conduct more rigorous economic analysis of their regulations, with proponents arguing for reform efforts and opponents concerned about potential impacts on the issuance of regulations. Supporters of regulatory reform often discuss the total cost of federal regulations, which is challenging to estimate. Scholars use two main approaches - the \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" methods - to determine the economic impact of regulations. The bottom-up approach combines individual cost estimates from federal agencies, while the top-down approach uses macroeconomic modeling to analyze larger economic factors like GDP. The report analyzes two approaches for estimating the total cost of federal regulations - the \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" methods. The bottom-up method combines individual cost estimates from federal agencies, while the top-down method uses macroeconomic modeling to analyze larger economic factors like GDP. The report aims to inform the regulatory reform debate by comparing these two approaches and discussing their advantages, potential issues, and case studies. The bottom-up approach aggregates estimates of costs and benefits produced by federal agencies during the rulemaking process to calculate a government-wide total. Understanding when agencies are required to estimate costs and benefits is crucial for evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of this method. The bottom-up approach requires agencies to calculate costs and benefits for \"economically significant\" rules under Executive Order 12866. Economically significant rules are those with an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. Other provisions of the executive order encourage agencies to consider costs and benefits for all rules during the rulemaking process. During the rulemaking process, agencies must conduct cost-benefit analyses for economically significant rules under Executive Order 12866. This order has been in effect since 1993 and was reaffirmed in 2011. Agencies submit their rules and analyses to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review. OMB provides guidance on estimating costs and benefits, in addition to statutory requirements for analysis. Cost-benefit analysis and regulatory impact analysis are required by various laws for agencies to calculate the economic effects of rules. The Regulatory Flexibility Act and Unfunded Mandates Reform Act mandate analyses for rules with significant economic impacts. Agencies may also need to consider costs and benefits under their own statutes. The bottom-up approach aggregates these estimates to provide a government-wide figure for regulation costs and benefits. The bottom-up approach aggregates actual estimates of costs and benefits calculated by agencies for individual regulations, allowing for comparison of total costs to total benefits. This information is valuable for evaluating cost-effectiveness and calculating a ratio of costs to benefits. Conducting ex post analysis can validate the components of this approach. Ex post analysis can validate costs and benefits of regulations. Agencies may conduct retrospective reviews to reanalyze rules. Some studies have been done by scholars on this process. Caveats should be considered when using a bottom-up approach to aggregating costs and benefits. The report introduces a case study on the costs and benefits of regulation, focusing on the well-known bottom-up study conducted by OMB. Since the 1990s, OMB has estimated the total costs and benefits of federal regulations as required by various federal laws. The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act, enacted in 2000, requires OMB to report on the total annual costs and benefits of federal regulations, including impacts on various entities and recommendations for reform. The 2014 report to Congress on the costs and benefits of federal regulations found that estimated annual benefits of major regulations were between $281.0 billion and $1,119.0 billion, while estimated annual costs were between $73.6 billion and $109.3 billion. Agencies do not quantify and monetize every rule. During FY2013, executive agencies promulgated 54 major rules, with 30 being \"transfer\" rules implementing federal budgetary programs. In all but one of the transfer rules, agencies quantified and monetized the transfer amounts. Additionally, in 7 of the remaining 24 major rules, agencies quantified and monetized both benefits and costs. During FY2013, executive agencies promulgated 54 major rules, with 30 being \"transfer\" rules implementing federal budgetary programs. In 7 of the remaining 24 major rules, agencies quantified and monetized both benefits and costs, estimating annual benefits of $33.2 billion to $87.4 billion and annual costs of $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion. The challenge in accurately calculating the total costs and benefits of federal regulations lies in the fact that agencies are not required to estimate costs and benefits for all rules. This results in the inability to arrive at a total dollar amount for all rules, as the aggregated costs and benefits will only include rules with a monetized estimate. The cost-benefit analysis requirement does not apply to independent regulatory agencies, which were created by Congress to have independence from the President. According to OMB's 2014 report, independent regulatory agencies issued 18 major rules in FY2013, with information on costs or benefits provided for 12 rules. The cost-benefit analysis requirement does not apply to independent regulatory agencies, excluding many financial regulations issued under the Dodd-Frank Act. This exclusion poses a challenge to estimating costs and benefits accurately. The OMB reports lack information on the magnitude of costs and benefits from rules issued by these agencies. The cost-benefit analysis requirement only applies to economically significant rules, defined as those with an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million. Quantifying and monetizing costs and benefits can be challenging for agencies, leading to incomplete assessments in OMB reports. Monetizing the effects of regulations involves converting costs and benefits into dollar terms to compare them. Agencies are encouraged, but not required, to quantify costs and benefits under current rulemaking requirements. This allows for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a rule, such as calculating the cost of saving a life or the cost-benefit ratio of a rule. Monetizing the effects of regulations involves assigning dollar values to measure the value individuals place on regulatory outcomes, using techniques like \"willingness-to-pay\" or \"willingness-to-accept\". This allows agencies to compare the estimated benefits against the costs of obtaining them. Monetizing regulatory effects involves assigning dollar values to measure the value individuals place on outcomes, using techniques like \"willingness-to-pay\" or \"willingness-to-accept\". Agencies can compare estimated benefits against costs to determine if regulations are justified. Executive orders and OMB guidance allow flexibility in quantifying and monetizing effects, with agencies instructed to provide information on costs and benefits to the extent feasible. When developing regulations, agencies should quantify and convert estimates into dollar amounts when possible. Executive Order 13563 and OMB guidance allow agencies to consider values that are difficult to quantify, such as equity and fairness. OMB instructs agencies to quantify costs and benefits in units and monetize them, as feasible. If primary benefits or costs are not quantified or monetized, agencies should provide justification. Many regulations have benefits or costs that cannot be quantified or monetized due to challenges in obtaining relevant information. The Obama Administration has emphasized the value of qualitative benefits like equity and dignity, which may not always be easily monetized. Debates in the literature question the monetization of qualitative effects like dignity and psychological impacts in regulatory analysis. Monetizing all regulation effects for accurate cost-benefit assessment is not feasible. OMB believes major rules account for the majority of total benefits and costs in rulemaking. Cost-benefit estimates produced by agencies assist in decision-making for individual rules, but there is uncertainty due to not knowing the exact effects of rules. Some literature suggests that agencies may overestimate costs and benefits in their analyses. For example, a rule like an airline safety regulation aimed at reducing the risk of a terrorist attack would have significant uncertainty in estimating costs and benefits. Cost-benefit estimates by agencies help in decision-making for rules, but uncertainty exists in estimating exact effects. Rules like airline safety regulations to reduce terrorist attack risks have significant uncertainty in cost-benefit estimation. To reduce uncertainty, agencies are advised to base estimates on scientific, technical, and economic information, presenting uncertainties in regulatory analysis. This leads to a range of cost and benefit estimates, with analytical techniques used to assess changes in rule impacts. Benefit-cost analysis helps decision-makers understand the consequences of policy changes, even with high uncertainty. However, in some cases, uncertainty may prevent a clear conclusion on whether the economic benefits will outweigh the costs. Combining individual study results may lead to the loss of context and uncertainties. Studies have attempted to total up the costs and benefits of Federal regulations by combining individual estimates, but this approach may lead to an apples and oranges problem due to varying quality and methodology. The illusion of certainty in cost and benefits estimates can be misleading, especially when aggregated, as technical judgments and disagreements are common. Aggregating bottom-up estimates from agencies can lead to the loss of important context and uncertainties in regulatory impact analysis. The accuracy of agency estimates of costs and benefits is questioned, with proponents of regulation suggesting agencies overestimate costs and opponents suggesting they underestimate costs. Studies have examined the accuracy of these estimates to address this issue. One academic study in 2000 compared ex ante and ex post studies on agency cost-benefit estimates, finding that agencies often overestimated costs and benefits of regulations. A 2010 follow-up study by the same authors confirmed this trend, stating that regulatory agencies tend to overestimate total costs of regulations. OMB's 2005 report to Congress also highlighted discrepancies between ex ante and ex post cost estimates, indicating potential differences in realized results. The OMB's conclusions on regulatory costs and benefits found that agencies often overestimated costs but sometimes overestimated benefits as well. Observers attribute cost overestimation to agencies underestimating industry innovation, leading to lower compliance costs than expected. An example is the EPA's acid rain program in the 1990s, where initial cost estimates were too high due to the agency's miscalculations. The EPA's initial cost estimates for regulations were too high due to underestimation of industry adaptation and cost-cutting measures. Delays in implementation can lower compliance costs by allowing time for cost-effective solutions. Inaccuracies in estimating effects of regulations and changes in regulations based on public comments can also lead to cost estimation errors. The accuracy of cost-benefit estimates in regulations may vary, as changes made after the proposal can affect costs and benefits. One challenge is determining the appropriate time period for aggregating costs and benefits, as regulations issued years ago still incur compliance costs. Compliance costs for regulations issued years ago typically decrease over time as initial investments are made. Benefits of regulations, such as health improvements, may not be realized immediately. Individual cost estimates are calculated by comparing the expected effects of a regulation with a scenario without it. The annual OMB reports typically include 10 years' worth of cost and benefit estimates for regulations. OMB acknowledges the weakness in its approach, as estimates do not include non-major rules or rules issued more than 10 years ago, leading to potentially larger total costs and benefits currently in effect. The 10-year rule for including costs and benefits in OMB reports may result in lower estimates over time as it excludes rules issued more than 10 years ago, which could still impose costs. The top-down approach to estimating the effects of regulations uses macroeconomic variables and modeling techniques to measure the impact on the economy as a whole. This method differs from aggregating existing cost estimates and aims to analyze the relationship between the size of the economy, economic growth, and regulations. The top-down approach measures the relationship between economy size, economic growth, and regulation using macroeconomic variables. It compares the U.S. economy to a scenario with less regulation to calculate the potential change in GDP. This method incorporates broader, indirect effects of regulation. The top-down approach in measuring the cost of regulation uses economic factors to estimate the total cost, including indirect effects not monetized. A study by W. Mark Crain and Nicole V. Crain estimates the total cost of regulation and its distribution among regulated entities. The focus is on the total cost of regulation, not the distribution of costs. The Crain and Crain estimate of the total cost of regulation combines top-down and bottom-up estimates, with economic regulation accounting for almost 75% of the total cost. This portion of their estimate is widely cited in the regulatory reform debate. The total annual cost of regulations has been estimated in various studies from 1995 to 2010. Estimates range from $416 billion to $1.75 trillion, with the increase attributed to new methodological techniques. The methodology used in a 2010 report estimating the total cost of regulation raised concerns, with the Office of Advocacy cautioning against taking the findings out of context. Reports from 2011 and 2014 also questioned the methods used to arrive at the total estimate of regulatory costs. The 2014 Crain and Crain study estimated the total cost of federal regulation to be $2.028 trillion in 2012, equal to 12% of U.S. GDP. Economic regulations accounted for $1.448 trillion of this estimate, governing decision-making in market transactions. Crain and Crain conducted a cross-country comparison of 34 OECD countries to estimate the total cost of economic regulation. They used data from the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report to measure the amount of regulation in each country. The report by Crain and Crain uses an \"Executive Opinion Survey\" to construct governance indicators based on business leaders' opinions worldwide. Three indicators were selected to represent economic regulation in each country: burden of government regulation, efficiency of legal framework, and regulation of securities exchanges. Survey respondents rated these indicators from one to seven, with higher values indicating improved regulatory quality. The mean value of these indicators was used to create a regulation index for each country and year. Crain and Crain used a regulation index combining three factors to measure regulatory quality in 34 countries from 2006 to 2013. They conducted a regression model to analyze the impact of regulatory quality on GDP per capita, along with other control variables like foreign trade, population demographics, capital investment, labor force size, and tax revenues. The results showed a statistically significant effect of economic regulation on GDP per capita. The regression model estimated the impact of the regulation index on GDP per capita in the United States. By comparing the U.S. score with top performing countries, a 26% difference was found, equivalent to a $1.439 trillion increase in GDP if U.S. regulations matched the benchmark countries. The total estimate of the cost of economic regulation was $1.448 trillion, including an additional $8.3 billion for import restrictions. Challenges with the top-down approach include the accuracy of the proxy measure of regulation used to calculate the total cost. Identifying an accurate measure of regulation is a significant challenge. The challenge of measuring regulation is highlighted in a report by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which states that quantifying the total amount of regulation is difficult. Economists have not agreed on a reliable way to measure regulatory burden, leading to uncertainty in economic models that use regulation as an explanatory variable. The impact of regulations on businesses, innovation, and entrepreneurship remains largely unknown. Obtaining an accurate proxy measure of regulation is crucial for economic models to avoid introducing serious uncertainty into the results. The importance of content validity in measuring the cost of regulation is illustrated by examining the \"Economic Regulation Index\" created by Crain and Crain. They used data from the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report to measure regulatory quality. The survey involved over 13,000 business leaders rating aspects of regulation on a scale of one to seven. Crain study measured regulation by rating specific aspects of the operating environment on a scale of one to seven. Three questions were selected to create a measure of regulation, focusing on government regulation, legal framework efficiency, and securities exchange regulation. The validity of using these questions as a proxy for economic regulation is crucial for the study's conclusions. The study by Crain and Crain emphasizes the need for an encompassing methodology to estimate the vast reach of economic regulations. Proxy measures like governance indicators may not accurately reflect macroeconomic outcomes, as seen in a recent article discussing the challenges in measuring abstract concepts like the \"rule of law\" or regulation. The concerns raised about the World Bank's \"Worldwide Governance Indicators\" apply to other current governance indicators as well. The article highlighted concerns about the validity of governance indicators and their impact on research and policymaking. It questioned the use of such indicators in the top-down model of total cost of regulation, citing issues with measurement accuracy. Specific concerns were raised regarding the Crain and Crain report in 2010, which still apply to the 2014 report due to similar measures used. The Regulatory Quality Index used in the 2010 and 2014 studies measures perceptions of regulatory environments rather than their stringency. There are differences between measuring something and measuring perceptions of it, as shown in research on crime risk and corruption levels. The importance of using valid proxies for measuring regulation is highlighted, as differences between perceptions and actual levels of corruption and trust in government have been shown. The difficulty in accurately measuring the stringency of regulation in a country is emphasized, as it is crucial for the findings of top-down studies to be valid. The selection of the right model in measuring the cost of regulation is crucial in econometric analysis. Proper selection and inclusion of independent and control variables are essential for the validity of the model's results. It is important to include all theoretically relevant variables and not omit any that may help explain the outcome. Justifying the components of economic models is necessary for explaining the relationship between variables. Proper selection and inclusion of independent and control variables in economic models are crucial for validity. Failure to include all relevant variables can lead to omitted variable bias, where the effects of a variable are overstated due to a related variable being left out. This bias can result in attributing explanatory power to the wrong variable. Top-down methods in estimating the cost of regulation may associate regulatory activity with changes in macroeconomic variables, risking inaccurate attributions. Top-down models of regulation may overstate the effects of regulation by omitting relevant variables, leading to omitted variable bias. Using GDP per capita as a dependent variable can be problematic as it ignores historical circumstances and presumes to explain the current size of each economy based only on factors in the model. The size of each economy can be explained by factors in the model, not just GDP growth. Model specification is crucial to determine if the relationship between variables is linear or nonlinear. Linear relationships show a constant rate of change, while nonlinear relationships allow for variable changes in the dependent variable. The relationship between dependent and independent variables is crucial for interpretation and forecasting. Crain and Crain used linear regression without providing a theoretical basis for assuming linearity. Some scholars suggest the relationship between regulation and economic growth may be nonlinear. The University Regulatory Studies Center suggested that increasing the size of government may initially boost GDP, but the relationship reverses after a certain threshold. Model specification issues, such as selection of variables and functional form, are crucial for the reliability of conclusions based on estimates of the cost of regulation. The top-down approach to estimating the cost of regulation raises methodological concerns, such as unclear causality directions and endogeneity issues. Researchers using this approach must explain the theory behind all components of their models to avoid bias in parameter estimates. Crain and Crain's top-down approach to estimating the cost of regulation emphasizes the importance of a solid theoretical foundation to address causality and endogeneity issues. They assert that GDP per capita is directly influenced by the level of regulation in a country, without considering the possibility of reverse causality. This oversight can lead to incorrect model results, posing a challenge for scholars studying the relationship between regulation and macroeconomic factors. The relationship between regulation and macroeconomic factors is complex. A study on regulatory volume in states found that citizens in prosperous states may demand more regulation. However, the direction of causality between regulation and the economy is unclear. Sample size is crucial for cross-country comparisons, as a small sample size can lead to less reliable results. Researchers studying regulation face challenges in conducting cross-country comparisons. The Crain and Crain study on cross-country regulation comparisons faces challenges due to a small sample size and a limited time period of 2006 to 2013. The narrow time frame around the Great Recession may limit the generalizability of conclusions. In the top-down approach, there is a concern about potential double-counting of costs in their analysis. The Crain and Crain study on cross-country regulation comparisons may be double-counting the cost of regulations due to potential omitted variable bias in their econometric model. Adding other measures of regulation, such as environmental regulations, to their total cost estimate could address this issue. The Crain and Crain study may be double-counting the effects of regulations by including other types of regulation in their total cost estimate, potentially leading to some double counting. The top-down approach has not been used to estimate benefits of regulation, only costs. It is unclear if this method can measure benefits as it focuses on cost in terms of potential economic growth lost due to regulation. Comparing costs against benefits is crucial for evaluating the appropriateness of a country's regulation. Since the early 1980s, the regulatory process in the United States has required agencies to compare the costs and benefits of regulations. This approach was formalized by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 through Executive Order 12291, stating that regulatory actions should only be taken if the benefits outweigh the costs to society. This emphasis on comparing costs and benefits has been a key component of regulatory decisions for decades. The regulatory process in the United States requires agencies to compare costs and benefits of regulations. The bottom-up method is used for individual regulations, but overall comparisons at the macroeconomic level are challenging. Two main approaches to estimating total costs and benefits have pros and cons. This issue is of interest to Congress. The bottom-up approach for estimating costs and benefits of regulations involves individual cost estimates by agencies, aiding decision-making. However, aggregating this information reduces its utility outside of individual rules. The bottom-up approach for estimating costs and benefits of regulations involves individual cost estimates by agencies, aiding decision-making. The individual estimates can be validated through ex ante and ex post comparisons, providing a means of validation. Agencies may revisit the original cost-benefit estimate during retrospective reviews, offering a potential validation method. However, the biggest issue with the bottom-up approach is that the aggregated estimate may not encompass all rules. The bottom-up approach for estimating costs and benefits of regulations involves individual cost estimates by agencies, aiding decision-making. However, not all rules are included in the aggregate due to challenges in monetizing certain costs and benefits. A top-down approach may capture the overall cost more fully by including indirect costs and effects not accounted for in the bottom-up approach, but it faces conceptual and methodological problems in implementation. The top-down approach for estimating regulation costs faces conceptual and methodological challenges, relying heavily on model validity and proxy measures. Results should be approached with caution as comparisons of costs to benefits are not made. Congress has shown interest in having both cost and benefit estimates for a more complete representation of cost-effectiveness. Congress has an interest in overseeing federal regulations, including monitoring the total cost and benefits. Inaccuracies in cost-benefit estimates could undermine public confidence in the regulatory process. Estimating the true cost of regulation is challenging due to inherent flaws in different approaches. The discrepancy between different approaches in estimating the true cost of regulations raises questions about their utility in the regulatory reform debate."
