    "content": "The \"Children's Sports Athletic Equipment Safety Act\" includes provisions for football helmet safety standards, third-party testing requirements for youth football helmets, and regulations against false or misleading claims related to athletic sporting goods. The Congress acknowledges the benefits of sports participation for children but recognizes the risk of sports-related concussions, which can lead to lasting negative health consequences and significant financial costs. Sports are the second leading cause of traumatic brain injury for young Americans, with an estimated 3,800,000 concussions occurring annually. Football has the highest incidence of concussions among various sports, with an estimated 4,500,000 children playing organized youth and school leagues. In 2007, over 920,000 athletes under 18 were treated for football-related injuries. In a football season, 20% of high school players sustain brain injuries, with 47% experiencing at least one concussion and 35% having multiple concussions. An 18-year-old athlete with multiple concussions developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Football helmets can lose their protective ability over time due to repeated hits. According to industry estimates, thousands of football helmets over ten years old were worn by players in the 2009 season, including some almost twenty years old. A high school player suffered brain damage while wearing a twenty-year-old helmet after a previous concussion. Children as young as 5 rely on helmets for head protection. The adoption of a voluntary industry standard led to an 80% reduction in life-threatening injuries, but it does not address concussion risk specifically. Some football helmet manufacturers have used misleading concussion safety claims to sell children's helmets, while reconditioners falsely certified that reconditioned helmets met safety standards without independent testing. The industry organization responsible for setting voluntary football helmet safety standards does not conduct independent testing or market surveillance to ensure compliance. Manufacturers and reconditioners obscure product warning labels underneath padding, making them difficult to read. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is tasked with protecting the public from risks of injury or death from consumer products, including those used in recreation and schools. The Federal Trade Commission Act also plays a role in regulating consumer products. The Federal Trade Commission Act empowers the FTC to prevent unfair or deceptive acts and prohibits misleading claims for devices or services. SEC. 3. FOOTBALL HELMET SAFETY STANDARDS. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must determine the effectiveness of youth football helmet standards within 9 months of this Act. This includes assessing injury risk reduction, compliance likelihood, and standards maintenance by the organization. The American National Standards Institute published requirements for consumer product safety standards in January 2010. This includes standards for youth football helmets, reconditioned football helmets, and new football helmet concussion resistance. New standards for football helmets include concussion resistance, warning labels, and date of manufacture labels. These standards aim to improve consumer safety by providing clear information on helmet protection and proper use. The new safety standards for football helmets include labels indicating the original date of manufacture and the last date of reconditioning, with a warning that the helmet's protective ability can decline over time. These standards aim to improve consumer safety by providing clear information on helmet protection. The Consumer Product Safety Commission evaluates voluntary safety standards for youth football helmets, reconditioned helmets, and new helmets. They may adopt standards that are the same or stricter than voluntary ones to enhance safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may adopt more stringent standards for football helmets to reduce the risk of injury. If a determination is not made within 9 months, rulemaking will commence to ensure the highest level of safety for football helmets. SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF THIRD-PARTY TESTING AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS TO YOUTH FOOTBALL HELMETS. The third-party testing and certification requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Act apply to youth football helmets as if they were children's products, regardless of the age of the user. The definition of \"children's product\" is modified to consider individuals up to 18 years old for testing and certification purposes. For youth football helmets, third-party testing and certification must be conducted by accredited laboratories meeting specific standards. The definition of \"children's product\" now includes individuals up to 18 years old for testing purposes. Product Certification Systems must be from an accredited body signatory to the International Accreditation Forum and include all relevant football helmet standards and test methods. SEC. 5. FALSE OR MISLEADING CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO ATHLETIC SPORTING ACTIVITY GOODS. It is illegal to sell or import athletic equipment with false safety claims. Violations are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission as deceptive practices. The Act allows the Commission to enforce regulations and penalties for violations related to false safety claims on athletic equipment, similar to the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Act allows the Commission to enforce regulations and penalties for false safety claims on athletic equipment. State Attorneys General can bring actions in federal court for violations affecting their residents. The Act allows State Attorneys General to bring civil actions in federal court under title 28, United States Code, for injunctive relief. States must provide prior notice to the Federal Trade Commission before initiating such actions. The Commission can intervene in the civil action, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. Nothing in this section should prevent a State's attorney general from taking action. The Act allows State Attorneys General to bring civil actions in federal court for injunctive relief. States must notify the FTC before taking action. State AGs can proceed in court based on alleged violations of state laws. No separate suit can be filed if the FTC or the US has a pending action on the same violation."
