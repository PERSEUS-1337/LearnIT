    "content": "The \"Juvenile Mentoring Program Act of 2010\" or the \"JUMP Act of 2010\" aims to reduce juvenile delinquency, improve academic performance, and promote personal and social responsibility through mentorship for at-risk youth. The \"Juvenile Mentoring Program Act of 2010\" defines 'at-risk youth' as individuals under 18 at risk of educational failure, dropping out of school, or delinquent activities, and 'mentor' as a responsible adult providing one-to-one support to enhance the youth's citizenship skills. The Administrator will establish mentoring programs for at-risk children in high crime areas or experiencing educational failure, linking them with responsible adults to provide guidance, promote personal responsibility, and enhance their education participation. The program aims to discourage at-risk youth from illegal activities, violence, and gang involvement while promoting community service and participation. The Administrator will provide model guidelines for screening program mentors. Grants will be used for the program. Grants awarded for mentoring programs can be used for hiring coordinators, training mentors, reimbursing for expenses, staff training, and other purposes as regulated. National grants can also be used for improving mentoring programs. The grants awarded for mentoring programs can be used for quality assurance services, child safety standards, information technology systems, and research evaluations. Prohibited uses include direct compensation for mentors, obtaining materials for regular operations, supporting litigation. The grant awarded for mentoring programs cannot be used for grantee's operations, to support litigation, or for any other purpose prohibited by the Administrator. Considerations for the use of the grant awarded for mentoring programs. Priority for grants under this part is given to programs serving at-risk youth in high crime areas with a high percentage of eligible youth under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Consideration is also given to the quality of mentoring plans, including resources for job training or postsecondary education, and involvement of parents, teachers, and community organizations in program design and implementation. The applicant's participation in designing and implementing the mentoring plan, as well as their ability to effectively execute the plan, are key factors considered for grants under this program. \"Applications for grants under this program are evaluated based on the applicant's involvement in designing and executing the mentoring plan.\" An application for assistance under this program must include information on the youth to be served, a mechanism for matching youth with mentors, assurance of a one-to-one mentor relationship, monitoring of projects to ensure youth benefit, recruitment and screening methods for mentors, mentor training, and outcome evaluation for youth. The application must include details on measuring outcomes for youth and monitoring the strength of the mentoring relationship. Grants under this part shall be made for up to 3-year periods. Authorization of appropriations for Part G under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 is amended to include $150,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015."
