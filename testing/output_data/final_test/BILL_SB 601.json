    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation will establish the Case Management Reentry Pilot Program for offenders transitioning from prison to address homelessness, joblessness, mental disorders, and developmental disabilities. The program aims to improve public safety outcomes for offenders reentering society after serving a term in state prison. The Case Management Reentry Pilot Program will be initiated in at least three counties over three years, with department employees providing case management services for eligible parolees. Social workers will assist parolees with basic needs, job training, medical and mental health care, and reentry requirements. Individualized offender reentry plans will be prepared, monitored, revised, and fulfilled during the program. Individualized offender reentry plans focus on connecting offenders to services they are eligible for. Case management services prioritize assistance with food, clothing, shelter, and benefits like California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids program. The individualized offender reentry plans prioritize connecting offenders to various services such as health, substance abuse, income, identification cards, life skills, and activities to support their successful reintegration into society. The pilot program focuses on supporting reentering offenders with developing a support system, academic and vocational programs, and discharge planning to ensure long-term community success. The department will evaluate the program's effectiveness in reducing recidivism and submit a final report to the Legislature and Governor by July 31, 2017. The implementation of a pilot program is subject to funding availability and may be limited in scope or duration. A Data Dashboard will be developed by the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for each institution, providing reports on a quarterly basis. Reports will include information on the warden, prison description, and inmate numbers. Each report for prisons must include information on staff vacancies, rehabilitation programs, deaths, use of force incidents, inmate appeals, contraband seized, and total budget. This information is not currently collected by COMPSTAT. The report for prisons must include details on staff vacancies, rehabilitation programs, deaths, use of force incidents, inmate appeals, and contraband seized. Additionally, it should cover the total budget and number of days in lockdown."
