    "content": "The 110th Congress is expected to address major agriculture and food legislation through the omnibus farm bill. This bill covers federal commodity support, conservation, food assistance, agricultural trade, marketing, and rural development policies. The omnibus farm bill allows for periodic evaluation, revision, and renewal of these laws, providing an opportunity for a comprehensive reexamination of agriculture and food issues. The most recent omnibus farm bill, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, is set to expire in 2007. The omnibus farm bill, set to expire in 2007, includes provisions on farm income and commodity price support, agricultural trade, and foreign food aid. Without new legislation, outdated permanent laws will take effect, impacting national agricultural policy and program funding. The omnibus farm bill covers various aspects of agriculture, including agricultural trade, conservation, food assistance, credit, rural development, research, and marketing programs. It brings together a diverse coalition of supporters, including farm organizations, input suppliers, processors, retailers, environmentalists, and more. This broad support helps policies that may not survive on their own to pass through the legislative process. Farm bills are complex and interactive, with changes in one program affecting others. For example, a change in corn prices can impact planting decisions for other crops, support programs for soybeans, dairy and beef producers, sugar producers, food manufacturers, consumers, exporters, and foreign competitors. The level and type of support provided can have wide-ranging implications for various sectors. The farm bill titles are becoming more integrated, with provisions affecting various sectors like farm equipment companies, agricultural investors, and rural communities. External pressures, such as promoting domestic energy independence and meeting treaty obligations, are driving further policy integration. Federal farm policy is a continuous concern for lawmakers, even though farm bills are only periodically reviewed. The 1996 farm bill was intended to guide agricultural support through 2002, but a drop in commodity prices led to the debate for the \"next\" farm bill in 1998. Congress passed emergency assistance measures and introduced \"counter-cyclical payments\" in the 2002 farm bill. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns held \"Farm Bill Forums\" in 2005 to gather public input on farm policy design for U.S. competitiveness in global markets and addressing unintended consequences. Secretary Johanns held \"Farm Bill Forums\" in 2005 to gather public input on farm policy design for U.S. competitiveness in global markets and addressing unintended consequences. The USDA's goal for a new farm bill is to be \"equitable, predictable, and beyond challenge\" in the WTO, focusing on fair distribution of benefits, dependable assistance, and compliance with World Trade regulations. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees are working on enacting a 2007 farm bill before the year's end. Representative Collin Peterson and Senator Tom Harkin are leading the committees. The Democratic party is considering a pay-go budget policy for increased spending. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees are facing budget challenges as they work on the 2007 farm bill. The Congressional Budget Office predicts lower spending due to high commodity prices. Interest groups have differing opinions on commodity support programs, with some advocating for their continuation and others proposing changes. The American Farmland Trust has a proposal endorsed by former Secretaries of Agriculture. The 2007 farm bill faces budget challenges as Congress must decide on competing proposals for risk protection and conservation. Strong crop and livestock receipts in recent years have led to record high farm income and low debt levels. Agricultural exports have also seen a significant increase. The farm sector experienced a rapid rise in agricultural exports from $53 billion in FY2002 to a forecast $77 billion in FY2007, a record high. Exports account for about 25% of agricultural production value, with one-third of harvested acreage being exported. Farm income is also influenced by government subsidies, with 2006 net cash farm income at $66.6 billion. Cash receipts from crop sales increased in 2006, while livestock receipts declined, leading to a total net cash farm income 18% lower than in 2005. Direct government payments of $16.5 billion in 2006 helped support agricultural land value, keep farm debt low, and stabilize farm operator incomes. Influenced by high commodity prices, farm income forecast for 2007 is uncertain. Changes in farm revenues impact rural communities and businesses. Rural non-farm employment is crucial for smaller farms. Food stamp program spending competes with agriculture programs in the budget allocation. Agriculture faces spending constraints, with $2.7 billion trimmed from USDA mandatory programs in FY2006. These constraints will shape the 2007 farm bill. The USDA faces spending constraints for its mandatory programs, with limits set by Congress through the annual budget resolution. Program spending cannot exceed these limits without offsets or declaring it an emergency. The USDA operates through about 30 internal agencies and offices. The USDA operates through about 30 internal agencies and offices, with a wide array of responsibilities and a budget of approximately $97.8 billion for various programs. Spending by USDA is not solely for farmers or agriculture, as it includes programs like food stamps, conservation, and foreign food aid. The USDA budget of $97.8 billion covers various programs such as foreign food aid, rural housing loans, and rural community grants. These programs are scattered throughout the federal budget and are controlled by Congress through eligibility rules and benefit formulas. The Agriculture Committees determine eligibility standards and benefits for programs indirectly through authorizing laws. Mandatory spending includes farm commodity price support and food stamp programs. Appropriations Committees provide funding for these programs annually, with some mandatory programs limited in the 2002 farm bill. Savings from limiting mandatory programs are used to boost discretionary programs. In FY2006, $1.5 billion in mandatory programs was prohibited from being spent. Discretionary programs in agriculture are determined by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Examples include agricultural research, animal health protection, and rural development. Both mandatory and discretionary spending must be approved by the full House and Senate. Before decisions are made on funding, the panels must know their allocated spending room. The opening stages of debate over a new farm bill usually occur in the House and Senate Budget Committees, where the panels determine their allocated spending room based on the Congressional Budget Office's baseline budget projections for federal spending over a 10-year period. The baseline serves as a benchmark for future budget analyses. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses baseline projections to measure the impact of new legislation on federal mandatory spending, such as the farm bill. CBO estimated that total spending for farm programs would average $12 billion annually from FY2006 to FY2016. Due to rising commodity prices, the baseline for government spending on commodity programs is decreasing. The CBO baseline for FY2008 will determine the allocation of funds for commodities and interest groups, allowing policymakers to make changes in farm policy to fit within the budget. The new farm bill, shaped by international trade agreements and disputes, could be influenced by multilateral trade negotiations. The World Trade Organization (WTO) agricultural agreement constrains US policy choices on agricultural subsidies. WTO membership opens avenues for influence through trade commitments, disputes, and negotiations. The 1995 Uruguay Round of WTO trade negotiations led to the United States agreeing to abide by disciplines governing agricultural subsidies and domestic farm program spending. These programs are categorized into amber, blue, or green boxes based on their trade-distorting effects, with amber box policies subject to spending limits. The US has reported its amber box spending below the annual limit of $19.1 billion, with programs like dairy and sugar price supports, crop marketing loans, and crop insurance included in this category. The United States abides by WTO rules on agricultural subsidies, categorizing programs into amber, blue, or green boxes based on trade-distorting effects. Amber box policies have spending limits, while blue box policies are narrowly defined. Green box policies, the least trade-distorting, are exempt from spending limits and include conservation programs, farm disaster relief, and income supports. De minimis exempted outlays are domestic support outlays not exceeding 5% of the value. The United States complies with WTO rules on agricultural subsidies, categorizing programs into amber, blue, or green boxes. De minimis exemptions allow domestic support outlays not exceeding 5% of production value. The U.S. provided $50 billion in green box payments and $16 billion in amber box spending during 1999-2001. A narrowing gap between spending and the WTO ceiling could limit flexibility in supporting farmers under a new farm bill. Amber box payments are linked to price variations. The United States risks exceeding its $19.1 billion amber box ceiling due to price variations. This could lead to a shift towards green box programs like conservation and rural development payments. Litigation in the WTO could impact U.S. farm programs, as seen in the U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute. The WTO ruled against the United States in a dispute with Brazil over the U.S. cotton program. In response, the USDA made changes to comply with the ruling, including removing a fee cap and terminating certain guarantee programs. Congress also repealed the Step 2 cotton program, which subsidized U.S. cotton users and exporters. Brazil's success in challenging U.S. farm subsidies could lead to other countries attempting similar challenges, such as Uruguay potentially challenging the U.S. rice program in the WTO. Uruguay may challenge the U.S. rice program in WTO dispute settlement. Legal, political, and economic factors may limit U.S. trading partners from challenging U.S. programs. The Doha Round aims to expand market access for agricultural products and reduce trade-distorting subsidies. A WTO trade agreement could tighten U.S. commitments to alter farm programs. The U.S. negotiating position in the Doha Round depends on market access expansion for agricultural products globally. The negotiations, launched in 2001, were suspended in 2006 due to an impasse among key WTO member countries over reducing subsidies and increasing market access. The U.S. made ambitious reductions in trade-distorting domestic support in the Doha Round negotiations, but the EU, Brazil, and India did not reciprocate with tariff reductions or market opening. There was disagreement over the U.S. offer on domestic support, with concerns that it did not go far enough. The negotiations were under pressure due to the impending expiration of U.S. Trade Promotion Authority. Some believe Congress may extend Trade Promotion Authority temporarily if a Doha Round agreement is close. Several agreements in the Doha Round agricultural negotiations, such as eliminating export subsidies and food aid, are on hold pending a comprehensive agreement. Subsidy reductions for cotton are also dependent on a comprehensive Doha Round agreement. The suspension of Doha Round negotiations has reduced pressure for changes in U.S. farm policy. Legislation was introduced to extend the 2002 farm bill, but there is a push for a new long-term authorization. The economic argument for federal support of farms is based on market inefficiencies in balancing commodity supply and demand. Imbalances in agricultural markets arise from price inelastic demand and supply, leading to inadequate resource adjustments by farmers. Federal commodity programs aim to stabilize farm incomes by shifting market price risks to the government. The suspension of Doha Round negotiations has reduced pressure for changes in U.S. farm policy, with legislation introduced to extend the 2002 farm bill. The law mandates federal support for specific commodities, which began during the 1930s Depression era to raise farm household income. Commodity support programs have evolved into direct income support payments, but critics argue they distort world production and trade and lead to high subsidies capitalized into land prices. The levels of subsidies in the United States have raised land prices and production costs, making the country less competitive globally. Benefits are concentrated on a few commodities and large farms. Supporters acknowledge the criticisms but argue that other nations also have distorting subsidy programs. Landowners fear a drop in rents and wealth if subsidies are reduced, while rural communities worry about losing the tax base that supports local services. Large farms receive most subsidy payments, but argue that lower costs and efficiencies benefit them. As Congress approaches the expiration of current farm support programs, policymakers must design a new law that meets domestic needs, satisfies international trade obligations, and fits within budget constraints. Secretary of Agriculture Johanns aims for equitable and predictable commodity assistance that complies with the World Trade Organization. The 2002 farm bill mandates support for 25 farm commodities. The 2002 farm bill requires support for 25 farm commodities, including \"covered commodities\" like food grains, feed grains, oilseeds, and upland cotton. Producers receive direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing assistance loans. Other \"loan commodities\" are eligible for marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments. Raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar prices are supported through limits on domestic output and nonrecourse loans. Milk prices are supported by government purchases of nonfat dry milk, cheese, and butter at set prices. The 2002 farm bill introduced new support tools like counter-cyclical payments and expanded coverage to include soybeans, minor oilseeds, and peanuts. It also broadened the \"loan commodities\" category to include additional commodities like honey, wool, and dry peas. Sugar support was modified to include domestic production controls. The 2002 farm bill introduced new support tools like counter-cyclical payments and expanded coverage to include soybeans, minor oilseeds, and peanuts. Sugar support was modified to include domestic production controls, in addition to import quotas, as a price-boosting mechanism. Commodity support programs are financed through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), with spending totaling about $78.8 billion over six years, mainly for crops like corn, cotton, wheat, soybeans, and rice. The federal deficit situation is expected to lead to constraints on farm bill legislation, especially with the WTO ruling against the United States on cotton subsidies. Democratic leaders plan to implement a pay-as-you-go policy for new legislation, and certain aspects of U.S. cotton support have been deemed illegal subsidies by the WTO. The collapse of the Doha Round negotiations in 2006 led to a focus on reducing production and trade-distorting subsidies in U.S. farm policy. Despite the indefinite suspension of the Doha round, the shift towards greener farm subsidies remains a serious consideration influenced by WTO commitments and dispute settlement rulings. The shift in U.S. farm policy towards greener subsidies, influenced by WTO commitments and dispute settlement rulings, aims to move away from market-distorting programs like direct farm income and price supports. Instead, the focus is on green box programs that cause minimal market distortion and are exempt from spending limits. This includes decoupled farm subsidy payments and exempted programs such as agricultural research, conservation, rural development, and food security stocks. The debate continues on whether there should be farm-level limits on commodity payments. The debate over farm subsidy payments has been ongoing for years, with some advocating for limits on payments to large farms. Direct farm payments have had limits since the 1970s, but concerns have grown as a small number of large farms receive a significant portion of the payments, raising questions of equity and the impact on smaller farms. The USDA proposed tightening payment limits in the FY2006 budget to save $1.2 billion over 10 years. Rice and cotton have a higher concentration of payments, leading to regional divides among Members of Congress. Sugar and milk are supported by maintaining farm prices above market levels. The USDA supports sugar and milk prices above market levels through various programs like nonrecourse loans, import tariff rate quotas, and direct payments. Congress debates whether to continue these programs, which critics argue distort the market by encouraging excess production. Previous attempts to alter or phase out these programs have not been successful. Supporters argue that import-limiting programs are necessary to protect farms from foreign competition, with producer subsidies totaling $4.5 billion for milk and $1.1 billion for sugar in 2001. Direct payments have been considered as an alternative to supply controls, but cost remains a significant deterrent. The MILC program paid out over $2 billion in its first two years, with CCC dairy acquisitions costing $600-$700 million in FY2002 and FY2003. In FY2002 and FY2003, CCC dairy acquisitions cost $600-$700 million. The 2002 farm bill included a buyout of peanut marketing quotas, paying about $1.221 billion to 8,600 farms. Tobacco marketing quotas on 57,000 farms were terminated after the 2004 crop, with $9.6 billion to be paid out over 10 years as buyout compensation. The 2002 farm bill included a buyout of peanut marketing quotas and tobacco buyout funds come from tobacco product manufacturers. Some suggest replacing commodity support programs with incentive payments for natural resource protection, known as green payments in the US and agri-environmentalism in the EU. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) was introduced as a green payments program to encourage whole-farm planning. The EU's farm policy includes payments to farmers for agri-environmental measures, such as reducing chemical inputs and maintaining landscapes. The US's Conservation Security Program (CSP) aims to encourage whole-farm planning but has low participation due to stringent criteria and limited funding. Reforms of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have increased funding for green payments and integrated agri-environmental measures into rural development policy. There is a discussion about potentially buying out all commodity support programs, focusing on direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and loan rate price guarantees. Agricultural economist David Orden initiated this discussion at USDA's 2005 Agricultural Outlook Forum. Agricultural economist David Orden's analysis at USDA's 2005 Agricultural Outlook Forum suggested that buying out farm support payments could increase short-term budget costs but reduce long-term expenditures. Other presenters emphasized that a buyout would only work if future Congresses did not reinstate support payments, especially during economic downturns. Economists at the USDA's Economic Research Service discussed the idea of devolving farm program funds to states, arguing that state-designed responses could better address local needs than national programs. They believe devolution would not necessarily undermine national farm policy goals like income stability and food security. Economists at ERS suggest that food security in the U.S. is not solely dependent on domestic production. Federal programs and private methods like forward pricing and insurance can stabilize farmers' incomes. Devolving commodity payments to states would pose challenges in distribution. Devolution of commodity payments to states could allow for changes in programs delivered to farmers and rural communities, but current subsidy recipients may lose benefits. This could lead to lower land values and rental rates, potentially shifting production between commodities. However, lower costs of land could make U.S. producers more competitive globally. The federal government aims to support farm revenue through a combination of income support and indemnity payments. However, current farm subsidy programs operate independently and may not effectively support revenue during various scenarios like poor weather or low prices offset by high yields. The federal government provides income support and indemnity payments to boost farm revenue. Federally subsidized revenue insurance products have been offered to producers for the past decade, indemnifying for reduced revenue from yield or market prices. Revenue insurance was purchased on 60% of eligible crop land by 2004. There is a proposal to expand pilot programs for universal farm revenue insurance. Iowa State University analysis shows modifications can be made to current revenue insurance products. State University suggests that modifications can be made to current revenue insurance products to align with congressional revenue targets. Payments can be triggered by either low prices or low yields, but not both. Rationalizing commodity, disaster, and crop insurance programs into a single-payment program could increase transparency, reduce costs, and prevent over- and under-compensation of farmers. The National Corn Growers Association proposes a revenue insurance option for crops, different from the current support framework. Specialty crops make up a significant portion of U.S. crop cash receipts and agricultural exports. Specialty crops, despite occupying only 3% of U.S. harvested cropland, contribute significantly to crop receipts and exports. While not eligible for USDA support programs, their production is linked to major program crops. Some specialty crop producers advocate for extending provisions that restrict major commodity producers. The 1996 farm bill restricts major commodity producers from planting fruits and vegetables on program acreage without a history of doing so. Some stakeholders and policymakers are pushing for specialty crop issues to have a larger role in farm bill policy discussions due to budget constraints and trade obligations. Policies covering subsidized and unsubsidized crops more comprehensively could address pressures while increasing U.S. competitiveness. USDA has authorized programs benefiting specialty crops, including marketing orders and agreements to enhance commodity marketing. The Agriculture Marketing Service oversees 30 active marketing orders and agreements for specified fruit, vegetable, and tree nut crops. These activities are financed by assessment fees collected from handlers and operate within legal bounds authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a program called Qualified Through Verification that helps produce packers prevent food contamination. This program is similar to the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system used by USDA's meat and poultry regulatory agency. The FDA encourages the fresh and processed produce industries to adopt this preventive approach. The Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 authorizes block grants to states for research and marketing projects promoting specialty crops. Each state receives $100,000 annually, with the remaining funds distributed based on crop production value. State Departments of Agriculture administer the program for marketing, education, research, pest management, and food production. The USDA administers export promotion programs like the Market Access Program (MAP) and Quality Samples Program (QSP) to support marketing of U.S. agricultural products overseas. The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program funds projects addressing trade barriers for specialty crops. Specialty crop producers receive crop loss assistance through federally subsidized crop insurance or USDA's Noninsured Assistance Program. Congress has also authorized ad hoc disaster assistance for specialty crops since 1988. The Department of Homeland Security conducts agricultural inspections for disease and pest protection. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from plant pests and diseases. They manage emergency control and eradication programs for sudden threats and oversee inspection programs for exports. APHIS ensures pest-free exports and assists in trade agreement negotiations. They certify specialty crop exports meet phytosanitary regulations. Fruit and vegetable purchases through child nutrition programs account for 20% of total purchases. The Department of Defense (DoD) Fresh program provides funding for schools to offer free fresh fruit and vegetables to students. Federally sponsored research is crucial for the specialty crops industry due to the challenges in private sector research. The 2004 Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act prioritized specialty crop research and established a subcommittee to address research needs in the sector. The Agriculture Research Service (ARS) and Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) study research needs in the agricultural sector and provide funding to support research and extension programs at the state level. CSREES block grants, although a small portion of total funding, are essential for sustaining core programs. Additionally, provisions in P.L. 108-465 aim to enhance exports, protect specialty crops from pests, and support competitiveness in specialty crop projects. Provisions in the 2007 farm bill aim to support specialty crops by facilitating exports, protecting against pests, and increasing agricultural research. Legislative proposals in the 109th Congress called for mandatory funding for these programs. Specialty crop interests prioritize expanding marketing order rules for contamination prevention and encouraging certification of standardized handling practices. The curr_chunk discusses various measures to support specialty crops, including funding for certification programs, block grants to states, increased funding for the Market Access Program, and establishing positions to address trade issues. It also suggests raising payment limitations for disaster payments, creating an SPS export petitions division, increasing funding for pest and disease eradication programs, and expanding compensation for affected growers. The curr_chunk discusses expanding programs and compensation for growers affected by specialty crop programs, increasing funding for research, establishing grant programs for specialty crop biomass waste, and addressing trade issues in the meat and poultry industries through federal support. Omnibus farm legislation plays a crucial role in achieving these objectives. The farm value of animal production in the U.S. averages $124 billion annually, with over 1.1 million farms primarily focused on animal production. Producers are under pressure to become larger, more specialized, and cost-efficient to compete globally. Transactions are shifting towards contractual relationships from live cash markets. Transactions are moving towards contractual relationships for a guaranteed supply of live animals at set prices, with Canada and Mexico supplying more animals. The U.S. is facing competition from countries like Brazil, Australia, India, Argentina, and New Zealand in the export of red meats and poultry. Rising feed costs, driven by government promotion of corn-based ethanol, are a concern. Debate in Congress centers on the government's role in addressing economic impacts in the livestock industry. Public policy issues include environmental protection, food safety, and animal welfare in animal agriculture. The livestock industry faces challenges such as rising feed costs due to government promotion of corn-based ethanol. Meat and poultry producers do not receive the same price and income supports as major crops. They are wary of government policies that can increase feed prices, such as commodity support programs and ethanol incentives. Meat and poultry producers have only sought ad hoc aid for losses from natural disasters or disease control. The livestock industry is affected by rising feed costs due to government support for corn-based ethanol, which increases demand for feed grains. Animal producers do not receive the same price and income supports as major crops. They may benefit from potential energy legislation that could further boost feed grain demand and prices. Some livestock producers participate in livestock revenue insurance programs for protection against revenue losses from natural causes or economic conditions. Ad hoc federal payments are occasionally provided to animal producers in declared disaster areas to help offset costs. The livestock industry faces challenges from rising feed costs due to government support for corn-based ethanol, leading to increased demand for feed grains. Animal producers may receive ad hoc federal payments in declared disaster areas to help with purchasing off-farm feed. Questions about the federal government assuming more livestock and poultry producers' disaster risks may arise in the farm bill debate. Changes in animal agriculture have seen a shift towards fewer and larger operations, with smaller cow-calf operations still representing a majority of operations in the U.S. The livestock industry has seen significant changes in the past 20 years, with a decrease in the number of hog farms and an increase in the size of remaining operations. Larger feedlots dominate the market for fed cattle, while vertical integration is becoming more common. Traditional auction markets are being replaced by closed contractual arrangements between producers and meat packing companies. The livestock industry has undergone significant changes in the past two decades, with a decrease in the number of hog farms and an increase in the size of remaining operations. Closed contractual arrangements between producers and meat packing companies have replaced traditional auction markets, leading to concerns about market control and the weakening negotiating power of farmers and ranchers. Critics argue that these trends have undermined the traditional U.S. system of smaller-scale, independent, family-based farming. However, others believe that structural changes in animal agriculture are a result of technological advancements, changing consumer demand, and expanding international trade. Federal laws and agencies, such as the Packers and Stockyards Act, are in place to ensure open and competitive markets. The Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA) of 1921, administered by USDA's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), prohibits anti-competitive practices in the meat and poultry industry. The Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting (LMPR) addresses concerns about market information and industry concentration. The Sherman Act and Clayton Act also regulate activities that may restrict market access or suppress competition. The U.S. Department of Justice enforces antitrust laws. The Capper-Volstead Act provides limited antitrust exemption for farmer cooperatives. Various bills have been proposed in Congress to address competition issues in the livestock sector and agriculture. In 2001, the Senate Agriculture Committee debated including a \"competition\" title in the farm bill, which included provisions on producer contracts and country of origin labeling for red meats. In 2001, the Senate Agriculture Committee debated a \"competition\" title in the farm bill, which included provisions on producer contracts and country of origin labeling for red meats. The committee cited statistics on the growing proportion of cattle and hogs processed by top firms, expressing concerns about increased imports. Opponents argued against the title, fearing it would harm U.S. competitiveness, but COOL was added through a Senate floor amendment. Additional competition provisions were included in the final 2002 bill, giving USDA authority to oversee swine production contracts. Livestock and poultry producers were granted permission to discuss contract terms with specified parties. In 2001, the Senate Agriculture Committee debated provisions on producer contracts and country of origin labeling for red meats in the farm bill. The Senate approved variations of these provisions, including a ban on meat packers owning livestock for more than 14 days before slaughter. The final 2002 bill removed this ban but interest in the proposal remains. In the 109th Congress, there were proposals to ban packer ownership of animals for more than seven days before slaughter. A study on livestock and meat marketing practices is being completed for USDA. Retailers are required to provide country-of-origin labeling for fresh beef under Title X of the 2002 farm bill. Title X of the 2002 farm bill mandates country-of-origin labeling for fresh beef, pork, and lamb. The implementation of this program has been delayed multiple times by Congress, with debates on making it voluntary for meats or expanding the requirements. Some lawmakers proposed bills to expand country-of-origin labeling requirements for food products, reflecting differing opinions on the need for a federally-mandated program. Supporters argue that mandatory labeling can give U.S. products a competitive edge and provide consumers with information on food origin, especially with increasing food imports and safety concerns like mad cow disease. Since 2003, there have been cases of encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease) in Canadian-born and two U.S. cows. Supporters of the COOL law argue that it is unfair to exempt meats and produce from country labeling, as most other imported products require it. Opponents believe COOL is a trade barrier that increases importers' costs and unfairly portrays imports as less safe than U.S. products, despite domestic food safety issues. Opponents of the COOL law argue that food imports already meet U.S. safety standards and that industry implementation costs outweigh economic benefits. There is debate over whether animal producers should keep detailed records for country of origin verification. Some producers support a universal animal identification program to address disease outbreaks like avian influenza and foot and mouth disease, which can have devastating economic impacts and harm humans. Despite efforts and funding from USDA and industry groups, challenges remain in implementing such a program at the farm level. Despite efforts and funding from USDA and industry groups, challenges remain in implementing a universal animal identification program in the U.S. Policymakers are grappling with questions about the design, purpose, and cost of the system, including whether it should be mandated, what information should be collected, and who should hold it. Past bills may resurface in Congress, potentially as part of a farm bill item. In the 110th Congress, the animal ID program may resurface as a farm bill item. USDA's APHIS has the lead on animal health matters and legislative authority to implement the program. Farm animals are not covered by the Animal Welfare Act but are addressed by other federal laws on humane transport and slaughter. Members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees are involved in these issues. Animal activists push for new legislation to regulate on-farm animal activities, such as banning horse slaughter for human consumption and requiring products to meet specific care standards. Agricultural interests acknowledge the influence of animal welfare organizations like the Humane Society of the United States in advocating for animal care initiatives at the state and court levels. Animal welfare provisions have been included in farm bills over the years, with amendments increasing penalties for Animal Welfare Act violations. The 1985 farm bill set new standards for animal care, while the 1990 bill extended protections for pets. The 2002 farm bill called for the enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act and excluded certain animals from AWA coverage. USDA's Animal Care Division oversees the implementation of these regulations. The USDA's Animal Care Division enforces the Animal Welfare Act and other animal welfare statutes. The United States is a major exporter of agricultural products, with agricultural exports steadily increasing over the past two decades. Total U.S. agricultural exports are forecasted to reach $77 billion in FY2007. (Figure 2 shows export and import growth over time). Exports of horticultural products and pork/poultry meat have seen significant growth, with beef products also showing rapid expansion until foreign markets banned U.S. beef due to BSE. Animal diseases can impact farm product trade, influenced by global factors like income, population growth, commodity supplies/prices, exchange rates, government policies, and trade agreements. Agricultural imports have steadily increased over the past two decades, leading to a shrinking agricultural trade surplus. The excess of agricultural exports over imports is forecasted to decrease from $27 billion in 1996 to $8 billion in 2007. Competition from imports raises concerns among producers and policymakers, but farm bill trade titles have not addressed import issues. The Doha negotiations aimed to strengthen agricultural trade but were suspended in 2006. The Doha negotiations in 2001 aimed to reform agricultural trade rules by addressing market access, export subsidies, and domestic farm support. U.S. agricultural groups supported negotiations that opened new markets for U.S. farm products in exchange for reducing trade-distorting domestic support. However, when market access offers were deemed insufficient, the negotiations collapsed. Farm bills and legislation since the 1970s have included trade provisions to promote commercial exports of U.S. agricultural products, administered by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). Title III of the 2002 farm bill extended and authorized funding through FY2007 for USDA's export promotion programs, including Export credit guarantees, the Export Enhancement Program, the Dairy Export Incentive Program, the Market Access Program, and the Foreign Market Development Program. These programs aim to promote U.S. agricultural exports. The Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP) partially funds agricultural trade organizations' efforts to promote U.S. farm products overseas. Other programs in the 2002 farm bill promote exports of specialty crops and bio-engineered agricultural commodities. Congress will need to consider program direction and funding for these export promotion programs. The URAA prohibits new export subsidies, with EEP used minimally and DEIP used in recent years. Decisions on export subsidies may be influenced by the Doha Round negotiations, which aimed to eliminate agricultural export subsidies by 2013. Market promotion programs like MAP and FMDP are not considered trade distorting under the URAA. Some agricultural groups, such as specialty crop producers, have proposed significant increases in Market Access Program (MAP) funding, currently at $200 million annually. There have been debates about eliminating MAP funding, with arguments that it is a form of corporate welfare that could be financed by private firms benefiting from the program. Maintaining export credit guarantees as a tool for promoting exports is also being discussed. Export credit guarantees are facing challenges due to a WTO dispute panel ruling in the U.S.-Brazil cotton case, which deemed them as effectively prohibited export subsidies. These programs have supported an average of $3.3 billion per year of U.S. agricultural exports since 1999, mainly in grains, oilseeds, and cotton. In response to the ruling, the U.S. has eliminated its long-term credit guarantees program and implemented a risk-based fee structure for short-term guarantees. Further changes may occur depending on the outcome of Doha Round negotiations. The federal government provides crop insurance to help farmers mitigate weather-related production losses, which can be significant due to the inherent risks in agriculture. This program, authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act, is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency. The Federal Crop Insurance Act, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, provides crop insurance to farmers. The Non-Insured Assistance Program, administered by the Farm Service Agency, offers coverage to producers not eligible for insurance. Ad hoc disaster assistance programs were initiated after the 1988 drought. Federal crop insurance policies are sold by private companies, allowing producers to choose coverage levels for yield and price. The federal crop insurance program offers coverage to farmers, with producers paying a portion of the premium. Various insurance products are available, including revenue insurance. The program covers over 100 crops, with the majority of policy premiums accounted for by corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton. Major changes to the program are not typically addressed in omnibus farm bills. The federal crop insurance program has undergone three major legislative enhancements in the past 25 years, increasing federal subsidies to about $3.0 billion per year. Two-thirds of the spending goes towards subsidizing insurance policy premiums, with the rest covering program losses and private insurance companies' expenses. Despite the program's expansion, the goal of replacing disaster payments has not been fully achieved. Over the past 25 years, Congress has provided ad hoc disaster payments to farmers with weather-related crop losses, totaling over $20 billion since 1988. Despite efforts to enact disaster assistance, the goal of crop insurance replacing disaster payments has not been achieved. Farmer benefits from federal crop insurance and disaster payments have averaged $3.3 billion per year over the past six years. The government cost of crop insurance averages $4.4 billion per year, including costs associated with private insurance companies. The Administration proposed legislative changes in FY2006 to increase insurance coverage, save $140 million annually, and eliminate the need for disaster payments. These proposals were not approved but may resurface in the next farm bill, including requirements for farmers to purchase insurance to receive commodity payments and reductions in government premium contributions. The government proposed changes to crop insurance in FY2006 to increase coverage and save money. Producers may soon pay 25% of the premium for catastrophic coverage, with a $5,000 cap, and face a 2% reduction in reimbursement rates to insurance companies. Concerns exist about the Premium Reduction Plan (PRP) offered by USDA, which could impact commissions for independent agents. Some farm groups are concerned about the impact of the Premium Reduction Plan (PRP) on their commissions and profitability. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act (ARPA) of 2000 addressed issues of farmers with multiple years of crop losses, but concerns remain about lower insurance coverage for producers with a history of losses. Some producers argue that their assigned yields are below their potential production, while critics believe that recent crop loss experience reflects the current level of risk. Critics are concerned that assigning higher yields could encourage production in high-risk areas and increase government costs. USDA data shows that some disaster payment beneficiaries collected aid for over 11 years, totaling $2.5 billion, with a significant portion going to four states. Some specialty crop growers in four states (Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma) face challenges with insurance products due to the unique characteristics of their crops. They are interested in whole-farm insurance programs and farm savings accounts as new risk management tools. Livestock growers are looking to expand and develop new programs to manage price risks. Policymakers have long been concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal crop insurance program. The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 included provisions to improve program compliance and integrity. USDA used data mining techniques to identify producers with high loss ratios or suspected poor farming practices. The USDA has implemented a spot-check list to prevent production losses and improper payments, saving between $70 million and $110 million annually. Funding for data mining and program integrity activities authorized by ARPA expired in FY2005, with $3.6 million allocated in the FY2006 agriculture appropriations act. Future funding for these activities is uncertain, with some advocating for permanent funding in the next farm bill. Policymakers are considering including disaster payments in the farm bill to supplement crop insurance programs. Supporters advocate for a permanent disaster fund similar to FEMA for the crop insurance program, addressing emergency needs during major disasters. Questions arise about funding and potential impact on participation rates. Historically, farm risks from low commodity prices were shared with the government through income support programs, while weather-related risks were covered by subsidized crop insurance and disaster payments. A proposed concept is to combine these programs. A proposed concept is to combine income support programs, subsidized crop insurance, and disaster payments into a single revenue insurance program. This concept has gained momentum recently and could potentially provide whole-farm revenue coverage for all farms in the nation. The National Corn Growers Association has proposed a version of revenue insurance to replace commodity support programs and crop insurance for covered commodities like corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, and cotton. The shift from commodity support programs to a revenue insurance system aims to reduce production and trade distortions caused by federal subsidies. However, there are limits under WTO rules for what qualifies as non-trade distorting support. The USDA's Farm Service Agency provides credit assistance to farmers through direct and guaranteed loans, with the goal of eventually transitioning borrowers to commercial loans. The Farm Service Agency provides credit assistance to farmers through direct and guaranteed loans, aiming to transition borrowers to commercial loans. The Farm Credit System is a major holder of farm debt, chartered by the federal government for agriculture-related borrowers. Commercial banks are the largest lenders to the farm sector, followed by the Farm Credit System, individuals, and life insurance companies. Credit is a crucial input for agriculture, with lenders holding about $214 billion in outstanding farm loans in 2005. Only 66% of farmers have any debt, with 38% having farm debt. Larger commercial farms and medium-sized family farms hold the most debt. Creditworthy farmers mainly access loans from commercial banks, the Farm Credit System, and merchants. Credit conditions are good, with lower default rates. USDA data shows stable or slightly declining debt-to-asset ratios in the farm sector over the past decade. Farm sector debt levels have been stable or slightly declining over the past decade, indicating low leverage with debt. Despite strong farm income, some farmers still face financial stress and may struggle to qualify for loans. Federal intervention in agricultural credit markets is seen as necessary by many in production agriculture. Farm bills typically include a credit title that makes policy changes to statutes authorizing FSA and FCS loan programs. FSA loan programs, authorized under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, provide direct loans to family-sized farms unable to access commercial credit. FSA also guarantees loans made by commercial lenders, supplying 3% of the sector's debt through direct loans and guaranteeing another 4% of the market. Farm ownership loans can be used for land purchase and construction. The FSA farm loan program offers direct loans for family-sized farms and guarantees loans from commercial lenders, totaling 7% of the market. Loans can be used for land purchase, building construction, equipment, livestock, and other farm needs. Maximum loan amounts vary, with a shift towards more guaranteed loans to reduce reliance on direct federal lending. Emergency loans are available for disasters. The FSA farm loan program offers direct loans for family-sized farms and guarantees loans from commercial lenders, totaling 7% of the market. Loans can be used for land purchase, building construction, equipment, livestock, and other farm needs. Maximum loan amounts vary, with a shift towards more guaranteed loans to reduce reliance on direct federal lending. Funds are reserved for beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, and a maximum loan authority of $3.796 billion for direct and guaranteed loans for each fiscal year 2003-2007 was approved. The farm bill specified the division of funds for direct and guaranteed loans, with restrictions on the use of funds for ownership versus operating loans. A maximum of $750 million of the guaranteed operating loan amount can be used for interest assistance. Appropriators control the annual appropriation to FSA for loan subsidies, which are related to interest rate subsidies and projected loan losses. The appropriated loan authority is larger than the loan subsidy. Table 5 displays that appropriators have funded between 83% and 101% of the total $3.796 billion in loan authority annually authorized in the 2002 farm bill. Direct operating loans have been appropriated 7%-14% more than authorized, and guaranteed farm ownership loans have been appropriated up to 39% more than authorized. The Administration requested these higher amounts. Table 6 shows the loan subsidies appropriated to support the loan authority. For example, in FY2006, $150 million in total loan subsidy supported $3.7 billion in loan authority, resulting in a multiplier of 25. Guaranteed loans have higher multipliers than direct loans, and farm ownership loans have higher multipliers than operating loans. The highest multiplier in FY2006 is 208 for guaranteed farm ownership loans, while the lowest is eight for subsidized guaranteed loans. In FY2006, loan subsidies for farm ownership loans have declined from $226 million to $150 million, attributed to higher farm incomes and lower interest rates. The multiplier for the farm loan program has increased from 17 to 25. FSA personnel expenses have risen from $285 million to $310 million, keeping pace with inflation. In FY2006, loan subsidies for farm ownership loans decreased from $226 million to $150 million due to higher farm incomes and lower interest rates. The 2002 farm bill made adjustments to FSA programs, including increasing USDA lending percentages for real estate down payments and extending loan durations. Additionally, it created a pilot program for seller-financed land contracts and expanded emergency loan authority for losses from USDA-imposed quarantines. The Farm Credit System (FCS) was established in 1916 to provide affordable credit to rural areas when commercial lenders avoided farm loans. The Farm Credit System (FCS) was established in 1916 to provide credit to rural areas when commercial lenders avoided farm loans. FCS is a for-profit lender with a statutory mandate to serve agriculture, authorized to lend to farmers, ranchers, and harvesters of aquatic products for various purposes. The system is regulated by the Farm Credit Administration and overseen by the Agriculture Committees, with benefits such as tax exemptions. The Farm Credit System (FCS) is regulated by the Farm Credit Administration and had $113 billion in loans outstanding as of June 2006. Funds are raised through the sale of FCS bonds and notes on Wall Street, with five large banks allocating funds to 96 credit associations for loans. The 2007 farm bill may set new loan authorization levels for FSA, with some advocating for an increase in the $200,000 limit per farmer on direct farm ownership and operating loans. The $200,000 limit per farmer on direct farm ownership and operating loans set in 1984 and 1986 has not kept pace with inflation. Farmer eligibility has term limits for receiving loans, with a provision suspending the 15-year limit until October 1, 2007. Term limits aim to prevent inefficient farms from receiving federally subsidized credit, but some farmers may face financial collapse if they cannot transition to commercial credit. The Farm Credit System (FCS) has expanded lending beyond traditional farm loans to include rural housing and non-farm businesses. There are pressures to extend eligibility allowance for \"family farms\" receiving federally subsidized credit. FCS aims to update the Farm Credit Act of 1971 and increase lending authority, with potential legislative or regulatory changes in the future. Commercial banks oppose expanding FCS lending authority, citing sufficient commercial credit availability in rural areas. The controversy over the Farm Credit System's (FCS) government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) status and lending authority was highlighted in 2004 when a private bank attempted to purchase an FCS association. The board initially voted for the sale, sparking debate over the necessity of federal benefits for FCS. However, a general outcry led to the deal being withdrawn at a significant cost. In response, FCS asked Congress to eliminate the provision allowing for its GSE status. In 2004, FCS requested Congress to remove the provision allowing institutions to exit the system. The Farm Credit Administration addressed the termination issue in July 2006 with amended regulations, allowing more time for review and shareholder involvement. A proposed rule in October 2006 aimed to expand eligibility for farm processing and marketing loans, potentially increasing lending authority for larger value-added farm processing firms. The proposed regulations may allow more non-farm financing by FCS, prompting potential statutory changes by Congress. Federal agriculture conservation programs focus on soil and water conservation, with increasing attention on wetlands restoration and wildlife habitat. These programs encourage voluntary farmer participation through land rental payments, cost-sharing funds, and technical assistance. Conservation programs prioritize partnerships over regulations. Compliance programs like Sodbuster, Swampbuster, and Conservation Compliance enforce rules on cultivating erodible lands and wetlands. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was authorized in 1985, leading to a significant increase in conservation spending from $1.0 billion to $5.2 billion annually. The conservation effort, funded mainly by the Commodity Credit Corporation, focuses on cropland retirement, creating buffers for water protection, and reducing tillage. The 2002 farm bill increased funding for conservation programs and introduced the Conservation Security Program. With agriculture playing a larger role in renewable energy production, working lands conservation may become more prominent. The upcoming farm bill debate in 2007 will likely focus on the need for more energy and land to produce energy crops. The conservation portfolio includes various programs enacted in recent farm bills, with topics such as land retirement, funding levels, green payments, and measuring accomplishments being key points of discussion. Other topics may include invasive species eradication and promoting energy crop production on conserved land. Land retirement programs, including invasive species eradication and energy crop production on conserved land, are set to expire at the end of FY2007. These programs have been successful in improving natural resources on agricultural lands, retiring almost 40 million acres. Reauthorizing and adjusting these programs to meet changing needs may be a priority, as they account for over 40% of conservation spending. The Conservation Reserve Program, the largest land retirement program, may see declining interest due to higher commodity prices driven by the ethanol market. There are proposals to allow early withdrawal of certain lands from the program for energy crop production. This shift in focus may lead to less land being retired in the future and some currently retired land returning to production. Some stakeholders in the agriculture industry are concerned about the need for more corn production to meet growing demand, with estimates suggesting 5 to 10 million additional acres may be required in 2007. There may be conflicting views between production agriculture and environmental groups on land use policies, such as the Conservation Reserve Program. Wildlife groups may advocate for maintaining large tracts of retired lands for natural habitat, while there could be opportunities to retire smaller acreages or parts of fields for concentrated environmental benefits. Total funding for conservation has increased rapidly since FY1990, with the largest category of spending being rental and easement payments to retire land from production (37% of total). Cost-sharing assistance has been the most rapidly growing category in recent years (21% of total). Funding for data collection, research, and public works projects has been declining as a portion of the total funding. Conservation programs funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation have seen significant growth since the 2002 farm bill. The Commodity Credit Corporation has seen significant growth in conservation spending since the 2002 farm bill, with programs like EQIP reaching $1.3 billion in FY2007. Funding for other programs like Farmland Protection and Wildlife Habitat Incentives has also increased. Despite efforts to reduce backlogs, participation and unfunded applications remain high. Congress may need to consider increasing funding or setting higher eligibility criteria to address the backlog. The term \"green payments\" refers to providing financial rewards to producers based on their conservation activities, as a way to support farm income and comply with WTO obligations. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) is a model for implementing green payments. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) was enacted as the first true entitlement program for conservation, allowing all eligible producers to receive payments. Despite initial expectations of becoming a major conservation program, implementation has been slow and funding limited by Congress. Debate continues on whether the CSP is the best way to provide green payments or if other designs should be considered. Some advocate for using green payments to support farmer income by replacing or supplementing traditional commodity programs, viewing it as a way to transfer funds to producers providing environmental services. A green payments program could reach more farms than current federal conservation programs. In 2003, 14% of the nation's farms received federal conservation payments. A green payments program could focus on conservation goals like reducing CO2 emissions, protecting endangered species, and eradicating invasive species. Congress has shown increased interest in learning about the accomplishments of conservation efforts, particularly in how programs benefit agriculture, the environment, and the rural landscape. Questions also focus on the enduring benefits of these programs, especially considering the dynamic nature of production agriculture. If the farm bill debate faces budget constraints, providing information on the impact of conservation efforts will be crucial. Conservation proponents are facing budget constraints and need to show significant accomplishments to prevent funding reductions. The Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) is a major program initiated by USDA to evaluate conservation efforts, but results may not be available in time for the farm bill debate. CEAP is spending $8 million annually to document conservation accomplishments, with a focus on cropland. Agriculture-based renewable energy production, such as biofuels and wind power, has seen significant growth. Agriculture-based renewable energy production, including biofuels and wind power, has expanded significantly in the past two years, leading to higher grain and oilseed prices. Federal and state subsidies for biofuels are estimated at $5.5 to $7 billion per year. This growth is seen as a potential economic breakthrough for agricultural producers and small towns, but some market watchers and policymakers have concerns. The rapid growth of U.S. biofuel production, mainly ethanol and biodiesel, has raised concerns among market watchers and policymakers. The development of cellulosic-based ethanol is hindered by expensive technology, but the abundant supply of low-cost plant material in the U.S. makes it an attractive feedstock. Ethanol production has increased from 175 million gallons in 1980 to 4.8 billion gallons per year. Ethanol production in the U.S. has grown rapidly, reaching 4.8 billion gallons per year in 2006. Biodiesel production has also increased, reaching 75 million gallons in 2005. The ethanol sector is projected to use 20% of the 2006 corn crop to produce nearly 6 billion gallons of ethanol. Government incentives, including a $0.51 per gallon tax credit, are driving the growth of ethanol production. The rapid expansion of ethanol production capacity in the U.S. is exceeding the Renewable Fuel Standard goal, with 5.3 billion gallons of annual ethanol production capacity currently in operation and another 4.4 billion gallons under construction. This growth will require over 3 billion bushels of corn as feedstock in 2007 and over 3.6 billion bushels in 2008. The increase in agriculture-based biofuel production has led to a rise in corn and other grain prices since September 2006. The rapid expansion of ethanol production in the U.S. is causing concerns about the unintended consequences of large federal incentives supporting the profitable ethanol sector. This includes potential higher prices for grains and oilseeds, increased livestock feed costs, and possible impacts on food costs and agricultural exports. There are also worries about the environmental effects of a potential large expansion in corn planting, such as increased soil tillage and soil erosion. Increased ethanol production in the U.S. is leading to higher levels of soil erosion, nitrogen fertilizer use, and chemical run-off. Livestock production costs are rising due to corn feeding, while protein-meal markets are facing distortions from expanded production of distillers dried grains. Dairy and cattle operations can benefit from using DDG in rations, but poultry and pork operations may see increased feed costs with rising corn prices. Expanding ethanol production in the U.S. may lead to increased pressure on transportation infrastructure and potential over-production issues. This could impact the profitability of corn-based ethanol, leaving small-town investors at risk and causing regional economic variations. Wind power, unlike biofuel energy, relies on the kinetic energy of wind for electricity production, resulting in low operating costs but high initial capital investment. In 2006, the United States had over 10,000 MW of installed wind power capacity, with more under construction or in planning. Policymakers have implemented various incentives and regulations to promote wind energy since the late 1970s. Both federal and state levels have enacted incentives and programs to promote agriculture-based renewable energy for reasons like energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy production is crucial in agricultural, energy, tax, and environmental policies. Federal programs supporting renewable energy, including agriculture-based energy, often originate outside the USDA and are governed by different legislative bodies. Production tax credits in the U.S. tax code, managed by the IRS, are key incentives for biofuels and wind energy production. The primary federal biofuel policy intervention is the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), originating from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Major incentives include production tax credits for ethanol and biodiesel, ad valorem tariffs on ethanol imports, and a wind energy production tax credit. The Renewable Fuels Standard mandates blending requirements for renewable fuels, with specific targets for each year. Additionally, there are income tax credits for small ethanol and biodiesel producers, as well as a wind energy production tax credit. The USDA's Bioenergy Program provided incentive payments for renewable energy production increases from 2001-2006. Federal support for agriculture-based renewable energy includes loans, grants, research assistance, and state-level incentives. Commercial cellulosic ethanol production has not yet occurred in the US, but the 2002 farm bill allows for the use of Conservation Reserve Program lands for wind energy generation. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 encourages research in renewable energy, specifically requiring ethanol production from cellulosic biomass. The 2002 farm bill introduced an energy title to support biofuels development, including provisions for federal procurement preference for biobased products and funding for biodiesel fuel education programs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 promotes research in renewable energy, focusing on ethanol production from cellulosic biomass. The 2002 farm bill introduced an energy title supporting biofuels development, including federal procurement preference for biobased products and funding for biodiesel fuel education programs. Additionally, sections 9006, 9008, 9009, and 9010 of the bill allocate CCC funding for renewable energy programs, research and development of biofuels, carbon cycle research, and grants to land-grant universities for carbon-cycle research. The 2002 farm bill included provisions for funding biofuel producers who increase production using agricultural commodities as feedstock. However, several sections, such as biorefinery development grants and energy audit programs, were never funded or implemented. Additionally, the bill aimed to promote research, production, and use of renewable fuels like ethanol. The 2002 farm bill aimed to promote research, production, and use of renewable fuels like ethanol, biodiesel, and wind energy systems. Title II allows the use of CRP lands for biomass harvesting and wind energy generation. Title VI provides support for renewable energy projects through loans and grants under USDA's Rural Development Agency programs. Loans are available for wind energy systems and anaerobic digesters, expanding eligibility to include farmer and rancher equity ownership in wind power projects. The USDA has provided grants for farm-based renewable energy systems since 2003, with priority given to biomass energy projects. Energy prices have been volatile since 1999, impacting the agricultural sector. In 2005, energy prices surged due to international events and hurricanes. Agriculture's energy consumption is low compared to other sectors, but energy plays a significant role in agricultural policy discussions. U.S. direct energy consumption in agriculture is critical, with energy used for machinery, grain drying, heating, lighting, and inputs like fertilizers and pesticides. Efficiency gains have reduced energy use by 28% since the late 1970s, but energy costs still make up 14.3% of production expenses. Unexpected changes in energy prices can significantly impact farm revenues. Unexpected changes in energy prices can greatly affect farm revenues, especially for major field crop production. High natural gas prices have led to a significant decrease in U.S. nitrogen fertilizer production capacity. Disruptions in agriculture's energy supplies could cause shifts in crop and livestock production, impacting farm incomes and rural economies. A sustained increase in energy prices may result in changes in cropping practices and drive resources away from the agricultural sector. Policymakers may need to assist farmers in becoming more energy-independent by improving on-farm energy efficiency. The text discusses the importance of improving on-farm energy efficiency and increasing agriculture's share of renewable energy production. Policymakers are interested in supporting domestic renewable fuel production due to factors like U.S. oil import dependence and strong petroleum prices. Questions arise about the role of agriculture-based renewable energy in meeting national energy needs, government involvement in its development, potential market effects on crops and livestock, and the impact on the environment, conservation, trade, and consumers. The discussion also touches on the integration of government energy policy within the farm bill. The new Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Collin Peterson, prioritizes energy in the 2007 farm bill. He plans to establish a subcommittee on energy and increase support for cellulosic ethanol production. Other policymakers are interested in funding research for biofuel production, infrastructure investments, and research and development. Some Members of Congress propose expanding the Renewable Fuels Standard beyond the current 7.5 billion gallons required in 2012. However, concerns arise about the energy, environmental, and financial impacts of increasing the mandate for ethanol and biodiesel. While ethanol proponents highlight its benefits, others question its higher cost and potential environmental drawbacks. As awareness of these issues grows, the potential benefits of biofuels will be scrutinized more closely. The potential benefits of biofuels will be more carefully weighed against their costs, diminishing some of the euphoria surrounding rapid ethanol expansion in 2006. Factors influencing agricultural research policies for the 2007 farm bill include funding, specialty crop issues, reforming federal fund distribution, and trade. The USDA's mission since 1862 has been to conduct research beneficial to U.S. agriculture. This includes agencies like the Agricultural Research Service, Economic Research Service, National Agricultural Statistics Service, and Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. These agencies work together with state partners, such as land grant universities, to administer grant programs and federal funds. The colleges of agriculture at land grant universities in 50 states and eight U.S. territories, along with affiliated state agricultural experiment stations, schools of forestry, and veterinary medicine, have played critical roles in increasing U.S. agricultural productivity since World War II. This includes historically black land grant colleges of agriculture and Native American colleges that gained land grant status in 1994. Agricultural research, education, and extension are fundamental to farm sector profitability, international agricultural trade competitiveness, environmental protection, and improvements in human nutrition and food-related health. The rate of return on federal investment in agricultural research is estimated to be 6.8% per year. The federal investment in agricultural research has a rate of return estimated at 6.8% per year. USDA spends $2.4 billion on agricultural research, representing 3.1% of its budget and 2% of all federal R&D funding. Funds are distributed to intramural agencies and state programs through block grants, competitive grants, and congressional earmarks. The 2002 farm bill increased funding for agricultural research and extension programs by requiring states to match a higher percentage of federal funds. The reauthorization of the Initiative for Future Food and Agriculture Systems (IFAFS) was a significant provision, supported by mandatory funds from savings in the food stamp program. Appropriators have limited the use of mandatory funds for the initiative in most years since its authorization in 1998. Congress has also allocated additional funds to existing research, education, and extension programs using discretionary funds. Funding for agricultural research and extension programs has not significantly increased since the 1980s when adjusted for inflation. Growth in funding since 1996 has only brought the level back to where it was in the early 1990s. The rise in nominal dollars from 1996 to 2001 was due to reduced pressure on the federal budget. In FY2000 and FY2001, USDA spent $120 million in mandatory funds on IFAFS, with a focus on anti-terrorism activities. The specialty crop industry is advocating for increased support in the 2007 farm bill, including expanded agricultural research and extension spending. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns also supports this initiative. Pressure has been mounting for over a decade to reform federal funding mechanisms for agricultural research and extension. The USDA is looking to reform how federal dollars for agricultural research are distributed, with a focus on intramural research and block grants to state universities. Critics argue that the competitive grant process is costly but the scientific community believes it is the best way to support quality research. Peer review in agricultural research may favor traditional approaches and established subjects, stifling innovation. Proposals to distribute USDA research funds competitively raise concerns among federal and state scientists. Policymakers are considering a national institute for agricultural research to avoid controversy over funding distribution methods. The 2002 farm bill required USDA to create a task force to evaluate the establishment of a National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to support basic research in food and agriculture sciences. The task force recommended NIFA as a separate entity with a budget building to $1 billion over five years, supplementing existing USDA research programs. Companion bills in the 109th Congress reflect the task force's recommendations. The CREATE-21 proposal by the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges aims to establish a national institute for food and agriculture research. It incorporates key elements of the USDA task force recommendations and includes programs like ARS, ERS, Cooperative Extension, and the research functions of the Forest Service. The CREATE-21 proposal aims to increase competitive grant funding for research and designate existing funding programs as \"capacity funding.\" The response to the NIFA concept has been positive, but hearings have not been held on the proposals introduced in the 109th Congress. Some voters on the draft CREATE-21 proposal were not in favor of it, and potential issues may arise if Congress decides to make major reforms to agricultural research, education, and extension programs. Congress may address diverting mandatory funds from commodity support programs to support research, impacting the federal-state partnership in research and extension. Policymakers aim to make farm support less production and trade-distorting, with a focus on reducing commodity support spending capitalized into land values. Research, extension, and education have a history of lowering production costs and improving output quality. Shifting resources from commodity support to these areas is seen as a beneficial policy option for U.S. agriculture. Rural areas vary in economic success, with less diversified economies facing more challenges during downturns. Agricultural production and related businesses have historically dominated rural economies, with federal policies aimed at strengthening agriculture also benefiting small communities and rural residents. However, the decline in this linkage has led to fragmented and unfocused rural policies, raising questions about their effectiveness in creating new economic capacity in rural America. Researchers primarily focus on nonmetropolitan areas when discussing conditions in rural America. In June 2003, the Office of Management and Budget released the Census 2000 version of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, defining urban and rural America. Nonmetro America comprises 2,052 counties, covering 75% of the nation's land and housing 17% of the U.S. population. Currently, less than 10% of rural people live on farms, with only 6.5% of the rural workforce directly employed in farm production. Off-farm income sources now make up about 89% of farm household income. Counties with significant agricultural production, mainly in the Great Plains and upper Midwest, have experienced population declines. Manufacturing is a significant source of rural private sector earnings, with over a quarter coming from this sector. The USDA leads rural development efforts, with 88 programs targeting economic development. Three agencies under USDA - RHS, RBS, and RUS - provide support for rural infrastructure, housing, and businesses through loan and grant programs. The USDA leads rural development efforts through agencies like RUS, RHS, and RBS, providing support for infrastructure, housing, and business expansion. Legislation like the 2002 farm bill reauthorizes programs benefiting rural America. The 2002 farm bill allocated the majority of funds to farmers, with only a small percentage going towards non-farm rural development efforts. Research shows that counties receiving the most payments did not see growth in jobs, businesses, or population. Farm payments were found to create dependency rather than economic growth. Additionally, the 1996 farm bill created the Fund for Rural America, and the 2002 farm bill established new mandatory rural development programs. The 2002 farm bill introduced new mandatory rural development programs to support innovative agriculture, telecommunications access, and rural capital development. However, funding for these programs has been partially blocked by appropriators. Some programs received discretionary appropriations in FY2004-FY2007. Farmers rely on a healthy rural economy, and there is a growing recognition of the need to enhance rural competitiveness in the global economy. The development of economically viable rural communities is being impacted by traditional extractive industries, commodity subsidies, and peripheral manufacturing. Rural manufacturing is facing restructuring due to foreign competition, while the service sector is growing in rural America with a focus on lower-wage personal services. Policymakers are exploring new sources of competitive advantage and innovative ways to provide public services in sparse rural populations amidst population and economic decline in farming and rural areas. Rural economic development efforts focus on innovative ways to provide public services and integrate agriculture into changing economies. Entrepreneurial strategies target local assets to build on existing strengths, fostering a culture of entrepreneurship. Building \"business incubators\" and collaborating with colleges and universities are common strategies. Communities also aim to improve efficiency in local government, schools, and hospitals through telecommunication innovations. A popular rural development strategy involves producing fuel ethanol from corn, wheat, and barley, along with other by-products. Ethanol production from corn, wheat, and barley has rural development potential. Other by-products like starches, corn oil, amino acids, and high-protein animal feeds can also be produced. Farmer-owned cooperatives are gaining market share in ethanol production. Improvements in technology may lead to the use of feed stocks other than grain for ethanol production, stimulating local economies. Economic development in rural areas may require new policies to support small and medium-sized businesses. Improving the quality of life for rural citizens and strengthening the long-term potential of rural communities involves focusing on quality growth, such as income growth and higher per capita income. Creating an environment for small and medium firms to flourish, including new community-based farming enterprises, is essential for viable rural communities. Technology-based development may require different public support than traditional rural businesses. Worker training should be integrated with economic development efforts. Improving Workplace Skills through community employment initiatives that combine training with local business development. Work-based training \"ladders\" help workers gain initial skills and move on to other local businesses. Intergovernmental planning is crucial for small communities facing tax base and population losses, requiring greater coordination for essential services like medical care, education, and income support. Federal assistance may be a catalyst for achieving scale efficiencies in rural communities through infrastructure investment. Infrastructure plays a significant role in increasing public capital, productivity, and employment. Different infrastructure components impact various economic sectors differently, with trends suggesting potential issues for rural development in a 2007 farm bill. These issues may include conservation, environmental concerns, and the importance of infrastructure for different sectors like manufacturing, retail, and business services. The 2007 farm bill addresses various issues for rural development, such as conservation, economic growth, rural employment, infrastructure rebuilding, bio-based energy production, and broadband connectivity. The United States is a leading supplier of food aid for humanitarian relief and economic development. The United States is a major contributor to global food aid, providing almost 60% of total aid from 1995-2005. The European Union is the second largest provider with 25%. The US is also the main contributor to the UN World Food Program, supplying over 50% of resources during the same period. Foreign food assistance programs, including P.L. 480 (Food for Peace), have been in place since 1954 to aid low-income countries. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service administers food aid programs for low-income foreign countries, including P.L. 480 Title II for commodity donations. The 2002 farm bill extended these programs through 2007, reinforcing market and economic development components. The Food for Progress Program provides commodities to countries with a market economy in agriculture. The USDA administers food aid programs for low-income foreign countries, including the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT), Food for Education (FFE), and donations of surplus commodities under Section 416(b). The Administration attempted changes to food aid programs during the current farm bill. In FY2003, the President's budget proposed streamlining food aid programs by reducing the number of programs and giving USAID responsibility for development components. The proposal included transferring $300 million from P.L. 480 to a famine account administered by USAID for emergency food aid programs, which was opposed by farmers and private organizations. The proposal to substitute cash for commodities for emergency relief in U.S. food aid programs was rejected by House and Senate appropriators. This idea may resurface during a farm bill debate, as it is believed that using cash for emergency food aid would be more cost-effective and timely compared to commodity shipments. Transportation costs currently consume half of the funds allocated for P.L. 480 commodity donations for humanitarian emergencies. Opponents argue that using cash to purchase emergency food aid would reduce U.S. food aid due to lack of support from farm groups and private voluntary organizations. Allocation of food aid commodities between humanitarian emergencies and development projects is a recurring issue during appropriations debates. The 2002 farm bill mandates three-fourths of commodity donations for development projects, but demand for emergency food aid has led to more commodities being allocated to emergencies in recent years. Organizations and supporters may seek ways to make food aid more reliable. Projects and supporters in Congress aim to enhance the reliability of food aid for development activities. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust could be utilized for emergency food assistance, allowing P.L. 480 Title II to focus on development. Critics argue that food aid is mainly used for U.S. farm surpluses, leading to fluctuating levels of aid. Calls for more stability in U.S. food aid levels are being made. Critics question the effectiveness of mechanisms in the farm bill and international machinery designed to monitor commercial displacement and disincentive effects of U.S. food aid. Preliminary agreement in the now-suspended Doha Round negotiations to eliminate food aid that displaced commercial sales is on hold. CARE, a major U.S. private voluntary organization, plans to phase out the sale of food aid. CARE, a private voluntary organization, will stop selling food aid commodities in developing countries to fund development projects by 2009. The nutrition title makes up 62% of farm bill spending, with a large portion going to the Food Stamp program for low-income Americans. Farm bills reauthorize nutrition program authorities and appropriations, including the 2002 bill through FY2007. The USDA oversees numerous domestic nutrition assistance programs, with a budget of $54 billion in FY2006, administered by states, schools, or local grantees under federally prescribed rules. Federal oversight is the responsibility of the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), along with other agencies like AMS, FSA, and CCC, are involved in procuring commodities for various nutrition aid programs. The upcoming farm bill may cover five program areas, including the Food Stamp program, nutrition assistance block grants, FDPIR, TEFAP, CSFP, and SFMNP. The 2002 farm bill also added funding for the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program. The 2002 farm bill added funding for the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and established a pilot program for free fruit and vegetable distribution in schools, later made permanent. USDA spending on domestic nutrition assistance programs, excluding CSFP and TEFAP administrative costs, is estimated at $35 billion for FY2006. The Food Stamp program accounts for 95% of nutrition title spending in the farm bill, providing low-income households with access to a minimally adequate diet. Budgetary considerations will heavily influence action on emerging issues for the 2007 farm bill. The Food Stamp program aims to provide low-income households with access to a minimally adequate diet, evolving over time to support poor families and address food security concerns. Despite its significant impact on food purchasing power and the agriculture sector, only an estimated 60% of eligible individuals choose to participate. The Food Stamp program, a vital part of the safety net for the needy, helps move recipients out of poverty and provides significant purchasing power for low-income families. In 2005, 11% of U.S. households were food insecure, with 3.9% experiencing very low food security. Food stamps supplement household spending on food, with benefits varying based on income and expenses like shelter costs. The Food Stamp program provides benefits based on income, household expenses, and size. Eligibility is determined by financial status, with monthly gross income needing to be below 130% of the federal poverty income guideline. Benefits are delivered through EBT cards and some households may be categorically eligible. Program costs are shared with states under federal rules. The Food Stamp program is administered by states under federal rules, with the federal government covering the full cost of benefits. Participation and benefit levels are linked to economic conditions and eligibility rules. Since 2002, participation has increased, with costs growing to over $33 billion in FY2006. The program also has a quality control system in place. The Food Stamp program has a quality control system to measure eligibility and benefit accuracy. Recent statistics show low error rates, with states facing financial sanctions for high errors and receiving bonuses for low errors. The 2002 farm bill expanded eligibility for noncitizens, increased benefits for larger households, and allowed for transitional food stamps. It also provided state options to ease access and administrative burdens, and revamped the quality control system to reduce financial sanctions and grant bonuses. The Food Stamp program has a quality control system to measure eligibility and benefit accuracy, with states facing financial sanctions for high errors and receiving bonuses for low errors. A preliminary list of major potential issue areas includes proposals to loosen and tighten rules governing noncitizen eligibility, potential changes in immigration law affecting food stamp eligibility, and concerns about states categorically making TANF participants automatically eligible for food stamps. Various limits on categorical eligibility have been proposed, including concerns about states categorically making TANF participants automatically eligible for food stamps. Current policy excludes most retirement savings from consideration as assets when testing for food stamp eligibility. The Administration and others support disregarding all retirement savings to avoid penalizing those who have saved for retirement but are temporarily in need. The Food Stamp program's dollar asset limits have not been changed in over 25 years, leading to debates on raising or abolishing them. Food stamp benefits can be used for any food purchase except alcohol, tobacco, hot prepared food, or dietary supplements. Critics suggest placing nutrition-related limits on food choices or providing incentives for purchasing healthy foods. Benefit levels are adjusted for high shelter costs relative to income, but with significant limitations. Some advocates argue for increasing food stamp benefits to address eroded value and low participation rates. States are making changes to how they administer food stamps, Medicaid, and TANF programs, including privatizing back-office functions. Government initiatives involving privatizing back-office tasks and modernizing administration aim to save costs and improve client service. There is a lack of federal standards for these initiatives, leading to calls for legislative standards. Some suggest increasing federal funding for food stamp administrative costs during major disasters. Participation rates for food stamp eligibles have increased since 2002. Since 2002, participation rates for food stamp eligibles have increased to 60%, but advocates argue for further steps to ease access. The Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) began in 1981-1982 to address food assistance program reductions and economic concerns. The 1983 Emergency Food Assistance Act gave the program official status and funding for administrative costs. The Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) was established in 1981-1982 to provide an alternative source of food assistance for the needy by distributing excess farm-support commodities. In 1988, Congress mandated funding for TEFAP commodities to ensure a minimum level of assistance, and in 1996, this entitlement component was written into permanent law guaranteeing $100 million annually for the program. The welfare reform act (P.L. 104-193) ensured TEFAP $100 million annually, increased to $140 million in 2002. States receive federal food commodities and grants for distribution costs. Eligibility decisions are made by states for recipients and emergency food providers. States also receive $50 million in discretionary funds for administration and distribution expenses. The 2002 farm bill increased entitlement commodities to $140 million a year, supplemented by bonus commodities from USDA. Bonus commodity donations have decreased significantly since 2002. Calls for the 2007 farm bill to increase entitlement commodity assistance. The CSFP was established in the late 1960s to aid low-income women. The CSFP was established in the late 1960s under appropriations laws to provide aid to low-income women, infants, and children. It now serves mostly elderly low-income individuals who need extra help beyond food stamp benefits. Eligibility is limited to those with income below 130% of the federal poverty income guidelines. The program provides supplemental foods through projects in 32 states, the District of Columbia, and two Indian reservations. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) provides aid to low-income elderly individuals with income below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. The program distributes food packages designed to meet recipients' nutritional needs, funded by the USDA through local grantees. CSFP projects receive funding for administrative costs based on the number of persons served in the prior year. In FY2005, over 500,000 individuals were served monthly, with 90% being elderly. The commodities provided by USDA include \"entitlement\" commodities bought with appropriated funds and \"bonus\" commodities donated from USDA stocks. In FY2005, the CSFP served over 500,000 persons a month, 90% of whom were elderly. $82 million in entitlement commodities and $38 million worth of bonus commodities were distributed. Food packages were valued at $18 to $21 per person per month. Administrative cost support was $29 million. CSFP advocates have called for raising the income eligibility limit to 185% of the federal poverty guidelines. The 2002 farm bill addressed the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables in schools due to concerns over childhood obesity. It also supported a Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program. A pilot project provided funding for schools to offer free fresh produce to students, which was later expanded and made permanent through child nutrition reauthorization laws. In FY2006, 400 schools in 14 states and three Indian reservations received $15 million in funding for this project. The 2002 law also mandated a minimum annual spending of $50 million on fresh produce for school meal programs. The 2002 farm bill mandated annual spending on fresh produce for school meal programs and established the SFMNP for low-income seniors to redeem vouchers at farmers' markets. The program was popular and saw funding expansion in FY2007. Proposals for further growth in the program are expected in the 2007 farm bill, along with support for the DOD Fresh program. A proposed change may include barring the use of SFMNP funds for sales. The proposed change in the SFMNP may include barring the use of funds for sales taxes and disregarding the value of benefits for tax and public assistance purposes. Forestlands in the United States total nearly 747 million acres, providing wood and environmental services. Ownership is divided among private owners, the federal government, and state/local entities. Ownership of forestlands in the United States is divided among private owners, the federal government, and state/local entities. The federal government administers 247 million acres, with the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management and the USDA's Forest Service managing the majority. The Forest Service also provides assistance to non-industrial private landowners and may be addressed in future farm bills. The Agriculture Committees may include a forestry title in the next farm bill to modify existing programs and establish new options for forest land management. Forestry assistance programs are managed by the State and Private Forestry branch of the Forest Service, funded through annual appropriations acts. Programs include forest health management, cooperative fire assistance, and cooperative forestry assistance programs such as forest stewardship and forest legacy. Forestry assistance programs managed by the State and Private Forestry branch of the Forest Service include forest legacy, urban and community forestry, economic assistance, and forest land enhancement. Appropriations for these programs increased in FY2001 in response to the National Forest Plan. Funding for forest health management, cooperative fire assistance, and forest legacy has increased since FY2001. However, economic assistance to rural, forest-dependent communities has declined, with appropriations decreasing from $63.6 million in FY2001 to $9.5 million in FY2006. This assistance is crucial for helping businesses and workers transition to a more diverse economy and utilize excess biomass fuels. The upcoming farm bill may examine approaches to expand and fund FS economic assistance programs, including the Forest Land Enhancement Program. Funding for forestry assistance programs has been a topic of debate, with concerns about the threat of wildfires to forests and communities. The 2002 farm bill authorized a community wildfire protection program, but funding has been a point of contention. The 2002 farm bill authorized a community wildfire protection program, but funding has been a point of contention. Invasive species are a major threat to forests and rangelands, with options to prevent their spread potentially becoming a farm bill issue. Concerns about environmental losses from converting forestlands to non-forest uses have led to the expansion of the forest legacy program. The forest legacy program has expanded due to concerns about environmental losses. Stakeholders suggest compensating non-market services from private forestlands. Federal support for developing markets for these services may be included in the upcoming farm bill."
