    "content": "The United States faces various threats like natural disasters, terrorism, pandemics, and manmade disasters. Prioritizing resources for disaster preparedness is crucial to minimize human casualties and economic damage. The Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006 mandates the development of national policies for disaster preparedness. President Obama's Presidential Policy Directive 8 aims to strengthen national preparedness in line with this mandate. PPD-8 aims to strengthen national preparedness for various threats, including terrorism, cyber attacks, pandemics, and natural disasters. It will be implemented gradually through supporting documents, with a focus on preventing, protecting against, mitigating, responding to, and recovering from these threats. The component policies include a National Preparedness Goal and a National Preparedness System as required by PKEMRA. The practical impacts of PPD-8 and its component policies could significantly influence daily operations and priorities of homeland security officials, emergency managers, and first responders at all government levels. PPD-8 may also impact federal assistance decisions, guide efforts to build homeland security capabilities, and establish a national baseline for hazard preparedness. It rescinded the previous HSPD-8 and may influence future budget requests and priorities. PPD-8, signed by President George W. Bush on December 17, 2003, evolved from HSPD-8 by expanding the scope of the National Preparedness Goal to include mitigation, modifying the planning approach, and identifying key mission areas for national preparedness. It builds on previous national preparedness policies and may impact daily operations, federal assistance decisions, and homeland security capabilities. The report discusses the evolution of national planning scenarios and capabilities under PPD-8, as well as the creation of National Planning Frameworks for different mission areas. It also addresses the implementation status of directed activities and potential content of future frameworks. Congress may need to evaluate how PPD-8 policies align with PKEMRA statute, federal roles in implementation, and non-federal resource utilization. The Obama Administration describes a \"Presidential Policy Directive\" as a mechanism for communicating presidential decisions about national security policies of the United States. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel has opined that there is no substantive legal difference between a presidential directive, such as PPD-8, and an executive order. Executive Orders have been used by all Presidents for various purposes, including delegating authorities granted by Congress, achieving policy goals, setting standards for managing the executive branch, and influencing private citizens' behavior. The Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-8) orders federal government elements to develop national preparedness policies, assigning responsibilities to execute necessary capabilities. However, it does not have authority over state, local governments, private sector, non-profit sector, or citizens. Stakeholders in emergency management and national security typically follow the guidance in presidential directives. PPD-8 aims to establish federal policies and plans on national preparedness. PPD-8 aims to establish federal policies and plans on national preparedness, fostering partnerships across all levels of government and building capacity for coordination and cooperation. It defines capabilities as the ability to accomplish tasks under specific conditions and performance standards. The Implementation Plan for PPD-8 and HSPD-8 utilize a \"capability-based planning\" approach to develop national preparedness policy. This concept evolved from traditional national defense planning and involves planning under uncertainty to provide suitable capabilities for modern-day challenges within an economic framework. Capability-based planning involves developing capabilities to effectively deal with a wide range of challenges and circumstances while working within an economic framework. It addresses uncertainty by analyzing various scenarios to identify necessary capabilities, offering scalability and flexibility. Capability-based planning is scalable and flexible to address unknown threats and disasters. It can incorporate scenario planning to identify necessary capabilities without becoming fixated on specific enemies or wars. This approach is suitable for developing all-hazard preparedness policy. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act defines \"hazard\" as any emergency from natural or man-caused events. PKEMRA adopts this definition for national preparedness for all hazards, including natural disasters, terrorism, and man-made disasters. However, some hazards like slow-onset natural disasters may not be fully addressed by current policies. The PPD-8 policies will guide the nation's response to technological hazards, such as oil spills and train derailments caused by human error or technological failures. However, these policies are unlikely to replace established procedures for preventing and protecting against these types of hazards. Additionally, an Implementation Plan for PPD-8 and the National Preparedness Goal were completed in 2011, along with two National Planning Frameworks. The National Preparedness Goal was completed in 2011, along with two National Planning Frameworks. PPD-8 policy documents are still in development. FEMA sought public comments on the draft goal in 2011 before releasing the final version in late September. The goal aims for a secure and resilient nation with capabilities to prevent, protect, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards. PPD-8 focuses on mitigating threats and hazards, distinguishing it from HSPD-8. PPD-8 differs from HSPD-8 by emphasizing the mitigation of threats and hazards to increase national resilience. Mitigation includes capabilities before and after disasters, transcending preparedness. There are debates on whether isolating mitigation capabilities in a separate mission area may lead to neglect or heightened awareness. The National Preparedness Goal, outlined in PPD-8, includes mitigation as a new element, akin to adding a new floor to an architectural drawing. This evolution from HSPD-8 emphasizes the importance of building resilience by defining core capabilities in prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. The National Preparedness Goal, outlined in PPD-8, includes core capabilities in prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. 32 core capabilities were identified across the five mission areas, with three core capabilities required in all areas. The goal aims to enhance the nation's ability to protect against all hazards, such as \"Access Control and Identity Verification\" in the protection mission area. FEMA is expected to provide a comparison of core capabilities between the National Preparedness Goal and HSPD-8 Target Capability List. PPD-8 emphasizes the need for physical, technological, and cyber measures to control access to critical locations and systems. Unlike HSPD-8, PPD-8 does not heavily rely on National Planning Scenarios to identify national preparedness capabilities. PPD-8 policy does not extensively use Planning Scenarios to identify capabilities for the Goal. The draft mentioned a \"meta-scenario\" but it was simplified in the final version to a \"no-notice, cascading incident\". A \"Strategic National Risk Assessment\" was completed to help identify capabilities. The President mandated a national-level risk assessment to guide where core capabilities are needed. The national risk assessment is used to identify core capabilities needed for all hazards and measure progress. The Director of National Intelligence and Attorney General provide terrorism-related intelligence for the assessment. The methodology and results of the assessment are classified, but key findings include the potential catastrophic consequences of cyber attacks. The national risk assessment identifies core capabilities needed for all hazards and measures progress. Key findings include the potential catastrophic consequences of cyber attacks, which can lead to power grid or financial system failures. The process of identifying capabilities is compared to developing an engineering blueprint for a house, adding detail to the plan. The construction foreman needs the capability to install plumbing, construct masonry structures, or safely install electrical wiring to build the house. The example capability, \"Access Control and Identity Verification,\" is essential for a secure and resilient nation. The National Preparedness System, including National Planning Frameworks and interagency operational plans, will determine how these capabilities are achieved. The National Preparedness System includes National Planning Frameworks to assign roles and responsibilities to federal agencies for developing national preparedness. The Frameworks are built upon coordinating structures to deliver necessary capabilities and support an all-hazards approach to preparedness. The National Planning Frameworks assign roles and responsibilities to federal agencies for national preparedness, with defined key terms and assigned Interagency Policy Committees to oversee policy coordination. Lead federal officials are designated for each Framework in the Implementation Plan. The National Preparedness Goal lists the capabilities of each Framework mission. The National Preparedness Goal outlines the capabilities of each Framework mission area, as detailed in Table 2 of the report. The capabilities under each Framework are not necessarily in a chronological order, with prevention, protection, and response capabilities not always following a specific sequence. For instance, the National Mitigation Framework includes capabilities essential for all focus areas, focusing on long-term activities to enhance resilience by reducing hazard risk and vulnerability. The Frameworks aim to enhance the nation's resilience by leveraging resources and authorities from various sectors, including federal, state, and local governments, as well as private and nonprofit organizations. PPD-8 provides guidance for the delivery of core capabilities, utilizing a variety of legislative sources to support emergency management and homeland security stakeholders. The Frameworks aim to enhance the nation's resilience by leveraging resources and authorities from federal, state, and local emergency management and homeland security agencies. Each Framework is accompanied by an interagency operational plan detailing critical tasks, responsibilities, resource requirements, and provisions for rapid resource integration. The interagency operational plan is expected to be prescriptive only to the federal government, serving as a guide for the whole nation. The national authorities and resources leveraged by the Frameworks are likened to specialized construction equipment and tools essential for building a house, with some tools, like the Stafford Act, being fundamental to the project. The national preparedness policies, including the National Planning Frameworks, establish the operational level of planning for the federal government. The hierarchy of national preparedness policies is structured like a pyramid, with the strategic level provided by documents like PPD-8 and the Implementation Plan. The National Preparedness Goal shapes the tactical level of planning, with interagency operational plans guiding the execution of capabilities. The National Planning Frameworks translate the strategic vision of the National Preparedness Goal into detailed directions for stakeholders on disaster preparedness. Table 2 summarizes key information on each Framework, its Implementation Plan, and the National Preparedness Goal. The Frameworks should leverage established planning documents, with potential policy issues and challenges discussed in this report. The National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) and other Frameworks will likely leverage existing policy documents for guidance. The National Response Framework (NRF) may remain unchanged or be updated, while the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) will serve as a baseline for the National Protection Framework. The National Prevention and Mitigation Frameworks have less precedent, making their content harder to predict. PPD-8 emphasizes the need for scalable and adaptable coordinating structures for the Frameworks. The Support Function model used by the NRF and NDRF may be adopted in all Frameworks for coordinating responsibilities and delivering necessary capabilities. This aligns with the policy guidance for a unified system with common terminology and approach. Support functions involve federal agencies working together to achieve core capabilities. Support functions in the NRF and NDRF involve teams of federal agencies working together to achieve core capabilities in specific mission areas. Each support function, such as Search and Rescue or Infrastructure Systems, unifies agencies with the necessary resources and authorities for disaster response and recovery. These functions have a coordinating agency, primary agencies, and support agencies with varying levels of responsibility. The National Prevention Framework focuses on preventing imminent terrorist threats in the homeland by connecting terrorism intelligence, sharing actionable intelligence with stakeholders, and detecting potential threats like \"sleeper cells\" or \"lone wolf\" terrorists before they can carry out an attack. Unlike other frameworks, it does not cover all sources of major hazards but specifically targets terrorism prevention. The National Prevention Framework aims to prevent terrorist attacks by detecting \"sleeper cells\" or \"lone wolf\" terrorists before they strike. It will utilize existing resources like the National Counterterrorism Center and fusion centers for information sharing and prevention. The Framework will focus on investigating and apprehending those responsible for attacks, but may not address long-term issues like countering violent extremism. Coordination between domestic and international security activities is crucial for effective counterterrorism efforts. The impact of the Framework on international prevention efforts by the State Department, Department of Defense, and intelligence agencies remains to be seen. The National Protection Framework aims to coordinate existing counterterrorism and intelligence efforts among federal agencies, including DHS, DOJ, and intelligence agencies. Challenges include delineating roles and responsibilities of key officials like the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General. The Framework covers topics such as critical infrastructure security, border security, cyber security, and weapons interdiction. The National Protection Framework covers security, supply chain security, cyber security, and detection of weapons of mass destruction. It is a comprehensive plan with a broad range of responsibilities. The challenge is to address all topics effectively within a single coordinating structure. The National Mitigation Framework's impact on traditional protection measures against natural hazards and the allocation of federal protection resources is uncertain. Mitigation efforts encompass pre and post-disaster capabilities, requiring an understanding of threats and hazards across various sectors. The National Mitigation Framework expands traditional hazard mitigation to include land use, environmental, infrastructure, and health policy. This could involve non-traditional partners and resources in disaster resilience efforts. The impact on existing state hazard mitigation plans and floodplain management remains uncertain. The National Mitigation Framework aims to mitigate flood damage through levee construction in high-risk areas. It is unclear what risk levels will dictate mitigation measures for other threats. The National Response Framework (NRF) guides the nation's immediate response to incidents, with potential revisions to address transitioning response operations to recovery. The NRF may need revisions to address transitioning response operations to recovery, as well as aligning response capabilities with other frameworks. The extreme catastrophic meta-scenario discussed in the National Preparedness Goal could lead to higher response standards, potentially requiring a realignment of ESF roles and responsibilities. The NRF and its ESF structure are widely adopted by states and local governments for disaster response guidance. The NRF and its ESF structure may need revisions to address transitioning response operations to recovery and align response capabilities with other frameworks. Concerns have been raised about the cost of federal disaster assistance and the increasing number of disaster declarations. The NDRF, the first national Framework released under PPD-8, raises questions about how changes will be communicated to stakeholders and if they will be adopted. Coordination of national efforts across the Frameworks and potential confusion between old and new policies are also key considerations. The development of the NDRF began before the release of Directive in March 2011, mandated by Section 682 of PKEMRA. The President requested the Secretaries of DHS and HUD to co-chair a working group for disaster recovery policy. The NDRF uses a Support Function coordinating structure with six Recovery Support Functions. It also establishes a Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator position. The NDRF, like the NRF, has a Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator and FEMA coordinates only one of the six RSFs. The final NDRF draft did not meet PKEMRA requirements or address funding issues as outlined in the National Preparedness Goal. The NDRF draft raised concerns about limited authorities and resources for resilient disaster recovery, especially after a catastrophic event. It questions if the federal government's current capabilities are enough to recover from the National Preparedness Goal's \"meta-scenario\" and if new legislation is needed. Additional components of the National Preparedness System are mentioned in strategic guidance, but details are lacking. The National Preparedness System lacks detailed information on additional elements, which will be further described in a forthcoming report on November 24, 2011. Congress may need to assess the alignment of PPD-8 and component policies with PKEMRA requirements. DHS is set to submit a National Preparedness Report by March 30, 2012, to fulfill reporting requirements under PKEMRA. The Report under PKEMRA, specifically 6 U.S.C. \u00a7752, serves as a tool for Congress to evaluate the Executive Branch's compliance. Congress may also review National Planning Frameworks, including the alignment of the National Disaster Recovery Framework with PKEMRA in 6 U.S.C. \u00a7771. Evaluating the coordination and primary agency roles assigned to federal departments, as well as leadership responsibilities under PPD-8, may be necessary. The President has directed the Secretary of DHS to lead the development of the National Preparedness Goal and System, diverging from PKEMRA language. Congress may need to review the impact on FEMA and DHS missions. PPD-8 assigns leadership roles for National Planning Frameworks. PPD-8 policies aim to avoid financial burden on various government entities and citizens. Congress should assess the guidance's compliance with the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act and evaluate preparedness policies in their districts. The National Preparedness Goal outlines tasks for state and local governments in prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. Davis emphasizes capability-based planning for effective preparedness. In capability-based planning, Paul Davis emphasizes working within an economic framework. The National Preparedness Goal highlights the importance of using an economic framework in planning to inform budget decisions and resource allocation. This detailed analysis is crucial for assessing budget implications and guiding Federal preparedness assistance. The approach of capability-based planning emphasizes working within an economic framework to inform budget decisions and resource allocation. Congress and the Administration may need to assess the budgetary implications of the \"preparedness enterprise\" developed by PDD-8, especially in light of current fiscal constraints. The establishment of new National Planning Frameworks could impose additional responsibilities on federal agencies, requiring a evaluation of existing resources to meet the challenges described in the catastrophic scenario. The transition from HSPD-8 to PPD-8 involves conceptual and strategic changes that will impact the nation's disaster preparedness. Evaluating the effectiveness of PPD-8 policies may be challenging due to the time needed for concepts to be implemented fully. Some policy elements may not be finalized until September 2012, making it difficult for Congress to assess the overall value of PPD-8. Full analysis may only be possible after a major disaster occurs."
