    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sudan Cessation of Support for the Lord's Resistance Army Certification Act of 2011\". Congress finds that Sudan was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and the Lord's Resistance Army has committed atrocities in northern Uganda and central Africa. The Lord's Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony, has been designated as a terrorist group by the Secretary of State since 2001. The Government of Sudan has supported the LRA as a proxy force against Uganda and Southern Sudan. The Government of Sudan supported the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) as a proxy force against Uganda and Southern Sudan, providing weapons, supplies, intelligence, and safe haven to LRA members. The Sudanese Armed Forces were the only documented state-supporter of the LRA, with evidence of material support as late as 2005. High-level LRA members sought assistance from Sudanese authorities, including safe passage and political asylum for Joseph Kony. Former LRA commanders and abductees confirmed these findings. The Ugandan military is leading the regional counter-LRA effort in Southern Sudan, but not in South Darfur, potentially a safe haven for LRA fighters. The US policy aims to disarm and demobilize the Lord's Resistance Army. The Obama Administration is willing to remove Sudan from the list of state sponsors of terrorism if Sudan allows the referendum on Southern Sudan's independence to proceed peacefully. Ambassador Princeton Lyman stated that Sudan could be removed from the state sponsor of terrorism list by July 2011, but any support of the LRA would prevent this. SEC. 3. CONTINUATION OF RESTRICTIONS AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF SUDAN. SEC. 3. CONTINUATION OF RESTRICTIONS AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF SUDAN. Restrictions imposed by the Secretary of State due to Sudan's support for terrorism remain in effect unless the President certifies to Congress for their lifting. The President certifies that Sudan no longer supports the Lord's Resistance Army or its leaders."
