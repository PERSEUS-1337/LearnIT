    "content": "The Act titled \"World Trade Center Worker and Contractor Protection Act\" provides indemnification, liability limitation, and insurance facilitation for contractors involved in the response to the World Trade Center attacks. The United States Government shall indemnify Contractors against claims, subject to limitations. Indemnification applies if a claim is not covered by insurance for risks in response to the World Trade Center attacks. Indemnification may be payable before insurance is applicable. Willful misconduct or lack of good faith by Contractors' officials limits indemnification. The Contractor must promptly notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of any claim that may involve indemnification, provide necessary documents, evidence, and comply with the government's instructions for settlement or defense of claims. The United States Government may direct, control, or assist in settling or defending claims involving indemnification. This section provides budget authority for indemnification payments, with a liability limit of $350,000,000 for Contractors. Insurance coverage does not increase this limit and may have lower liability coverage levels. The liability limit for Contractors under Federal indemnification is $350,000,000. No punitive damages may be awarded except in cases of willful misconduct, and interest prior to judgment is not applicable. The United States Government cannot be held liable for punitive damages. The liability limit for Contractors under Federal indemnification is $350,000,000. Contractors are liable for damages in proportion to their responsibility. Exclusion applies to those involved in terrorism or related criminal acts. The United States has the right of subrogation for claims resulting in federal indemnification. The liability limit for Contractors under Federal indemnification is $350,000,000. Contractors are not subject to subrogation rights.
