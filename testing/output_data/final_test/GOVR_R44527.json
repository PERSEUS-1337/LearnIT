    "content": "The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program is a federal-state partnership providing temporary wage replacement to involuntarily unemployed workers. Federal law sets guidelines for UC benefits and financing, while states administer the program with oversight from the U.S. Department of Labor. State laws establish the specifics of the program, resulting in 53 different UC programs. The framework of the UC program is established in Titles III, IX, and XII of the Social Security Act. Financing for UC is specified in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act of 1939. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program, established in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act of 1939, is funded through payroll taxes by the federal government and states. States typically cover 90% of UC expenditures during economic stability, while federal expenditures mainly cover administrative grants and are financed by federal unemployment taxes. Federal funds also support state administrative costs, half of Extended Benefits (EB), and loans to insolvent state UC programs. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program is funded through payroll taxes by the federal government and states. Federal funds cover administrative grants, half of Extended Benefits (EB), and loans to insolvent state UC programs. State unemployment taxes are deposited into the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) to pay for benefits and EB costs. Federal unemployment tax revenue for FY2016 is projected to be $5.8 billion of the $46.7 billion in all unemployment taxes collected.

Federal funds cover administrative grants, half of Extended Benefits (EB), and loans to insolvent state UC programs. State unemployment taxes are deposited into the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) to pay for benefits and EB costs. Federal unemployment tax revenue for FY2016 is projected to be $5.8 billion of the $46.7 billion in all unemployment taxes collected. The projected federal spending on administration, EB, and benefits for former federal employees and former servicemembers is much smaller than the projected state spending on regular UC benefits. During economic recessions, the UC program stabilizes the economy with increased federal unemployment expenditures through the EB program and additional administrative grants. Federal expenditures accounted for 60% of the total benefits paid during the recent recession. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program is funded through payroll taxes by the federal government and states. Federal and state unemployment tax revenue is deposited into the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) and invested in federal securities. When states pay UC benefits, the Treasury redeems securities from the UTF account, affecting federal revenue and the financial position of the government. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program is funded through payroll taxes by the federal government and states. UC benefits are mandatory spending, not subject to annual appropriations. States may borrow money to pay benefits if trust fund account is depleted. Congress appropriates funds for administering UC programs annually. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) imposes a 6.0% tax rate on the first $7,000 of yearly earnings for workers. States with approved UC programs can receive tax incentives, allowing employers to credit up to 5.4% of state unemployment taxes against the federal tax rate, resulting in a minimum net federal tax rate of 0.6%. This tax credit is provided by two separate IRC provisions. The employer pays less than 5.4% in state taxes based on the state unemployment tax schedule. The total state tax credits cannot exceed 5.4%. The federal unemployment tax is limited to the first $7,000 of yearly earnings per worker, resulting in a tax of $42 per worker per year. The federal unemployment tax has changed significantly since 1936. The federal unemployment tax law has undergone changes, including alterations to the taxable wage base or tax rate. The original Social Security Act imposed the tax on total annual wages, but in 1939, taxes were limited to the first $3,000 of annual wages. More details on major changes to UC law can be found at http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/chronfedlaws.pdf. Since 1940, the FUTA wage base has been increased three times, but these adjustments have not kept up with inflation or wage growth. The $7,000 taxable wage base in 2015 is equivalent to $487 in 1940, significantly lower than the original tax base of $3,000 in 1940. The net tax rate has gradually increased from 0.1% in 1936 to 0.3% in 1938, applied to all covered annual wages. Since 1939, the net FUTA tax rate has been permanently increased three times, from 0.3% to 0.6% in 1983. There were also three temporary surtax increases, with a 0.2% surtax lasting from 1977 to 2011. Figure 2 shows changes in the federal unemployment tax rate since 1954. The effective federal unemployment tax rate has decreased from 0.2% to 0.1% since 1954 due to limited increases in the taxable wage base. Employers must pay federal unemployment taxes quarterly once they owe more than $500. They use IRS Form 940 to reconcile deposits to actual tax liability, with fourth quarter taxes due on January 31. Instructions for federal unemployment tax can be found at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i940.pdf. If quarterly tax is less than $500, it can be rolled over to the next quarter. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) requires employers to pay FUTA taxes to the Treasury once their liability reaches $500 or when annual income tax is due. FUTA provides guidelines for states to construct unemployment benefits and financing. States have independence in determining qualification requirements, disqualification provisions, and tax structures for UC benefits. FUTA offers lower federal unemployment tax rates for states that meet certain guidelines. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) requires employers to pay FUTA taxes if wages reach $1,500 in a quarter or if one worker is employed for 20 weeks. Failure to meet federal coverage requirements can have costly tax implications for state employers. States may cover additional employment types not required by FUTA, but most have chosen not to expand coverage significantly. Unemployment insurance generally does not cover self-employment, work by relatives, hospital patients, student interns, alien farmworkers, or seasonal camp work. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) requires employers to pay FUTA taxes if wages reach $1,500 in a quarter or if one worker is employed for 20 weeks. Certain exceptions exist for coverage requirements, such as nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, federally recognized Indian tribes, agricultural labor, and domestic service. Nonprofit employers need to have at least four workers for one day in each of 20 different weeks to be subject to coverage requirements. State or local governments and Indian tribes are subject to coverage requirements regardless of the number of employees. Agricultural employers are subject to coverage requirements if they paid cash wages of at least $20,000 for agricultural labor in any calendar quarter or employed 10 or more workers for at least one day in each of 20 weeks.

Agricultural employers are subject to coverage requirements if they paid cash wages of at least $20,000 for agricultural labor in any calendar quarter or employed 10 or more workers for at least one day in each of 20 weeks. FUTA provides guidelines for state unemployment taxes, including the option for reimbursable employers to reimburse the UC program for benefits paid to laid-off employees instead of paying state and federal unemployment taxes. States may tax employers that generate the most claimants at a rate of at least 5.4% with a taxable wage base of at least the first $7,000 of each employee's annual earnings.

States may tax employers that generate the most claimants at a rate of at least 5.4% with a taxable wage base of at least the first $7,000 of each employee's annual earnings. FUTA allows a state tax credit of up to 5.4% to be applied against federal unemployment taxes if certain minimum tax requirements are met. Experience rating allows states to set up their tax systems so that employers with fewer claimants have lower tax rates. The experience rating system in state unemployment tax rates ensures fair distribution among employers and promotes workforce stability. Federal law sets a minimum floor of 5.4% on the maximum tax rate for employers with high claims. Some states, like Iowa, Montana, and South Dakota, apply a 0% tax rate to employers with few claims. In comparison, state unemployment tax rates range from 5.4% in states like Florida and Nevada to 11.13% in Massachusetts. The taxable wage base must be at least $7,000 per worker per year according to federal law. State ceilings on taxable wages vary from $7,000 to $44,000 in January 2016."
