Despite the difficulty, a well-organized group could potentially detonate a crude nuclear bomb in a major city. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks and Harvard University's Project on Managing the Atom highlight the serious threat posed by terrorists seeking nuclear weapons. A report estimates the devastating consequences of a ten-kiloton nuclear bomb detonated in Manhattan, emphasizing the urgent need to accelerate U.S. threat reduction programs. The acquisition of a nuclear bomb involves obtaining fissile material and delivering it to a target. Terrorists may seek two types of nuclear weapons: a \"gun-type\" weapon using highly enriched uranium, and an implosion weapon using weapons-grade plutonium. WGPU is a complex implosion device surrounded by explosives to compress plutonium for a nuclear explosion. Experts debate whether terrorists could create such a weapon. Concerns exist about terrorists or rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons, with Russia being a major source of worry due to its large amount of fissile material. Work is needed for the disposition of this material, as there is a risk of diversion. The report highlights the high risk of diversion of special nuclear material from Russia due to lack of inventory controls and increased indigenous threats. Concerns also exist about Pakistan potentially providing nuclear weapons or materials to terrorists under various scenarios. Additionally, President Bush has identified Iran as the primary state sponsor of terror, urging it to abandon its nuclear weapons program. According to a press report, the International Atomic Energy Agency's Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, is certain that North Korea has converted nuclear material into fuel for multiple bombs. North Korea declared in February 2005 that it possessed nuclear weapons. A.Q. Khan, known as the father of Pakistan's atomic bomb, reportedly provided equipment and plans for making nuclear weapons to Libya, North Korea, and Iran. Reports also suggest North Korea provided Libya with uranium hexafluoride, a key ingredient for making highly enriched uranium. Transfers of uraniumhexafluoride to rogue states or terrorist groups are a concern. More than 130 research reactors worldwide still use highly enriched uranium (HEU) as fuel, with limited security measures. Some reactors have converted to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, including six on U.S. university campuses. A gun-assembly nuclear weapon can be relatively small in size. The Hiroshima bomb was not particularly large, with the actual nuclear explosive device being 6 feet in length and weighing about a half-ton. A terrorist-made implosion weapon could be smaller and fit in a car, boat, or small airplane. The United States has many pathways for terrorists to smuggle a nuclear bomb into the nation. The United States has various types of borders, including oceans, land and river borders with Mexico and Canada, and the Great Lakes, each providing opportunities for smugglers. Legal and illegal crossings present different risks and opportunities for terrorists. Legal crossings are points like seaports, airports, and border stations, while illegal crossings are unguarded stretches of coasts and land borders. Securing points requires finding the needle in the haystack while expediting legal traffic. Attempts to smuggle a nuclear weapon through a legal crossing would pose risks. Attempts to smuggle a nuclear weapon through legal crossings face detection risks due to various screening methods. ABC News successfully smuggled depleted uranium into the US, highlighting detection challenges. The DHS Inspector General found that improvements are needed in the inspection process to prevent weapons of mass destruction from entering the U.S. through cargo containers. Detection equipment and search protocols are areas where enhancements would increase effectiveness. (Source: The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1998) The U.S. borders with Canada, Alaska, and Mexico are discussed, highlighting the varying measurements of the coasts. CBP resources are thinly spread along the borders, posing risks of smuggling activities. Detection of smugglers is crucial, as anything entering the U.S. illegally across the borders is a concern. Terrorists could avoid risks of smuggling by placing weapons on airplanes or ships bound for the US and detonating them before inspection, exploiting the difficulty of patrolling borders. Smuggling nuclear weapons is feasible due to border patrol challenges, unlike smuggling marijuana where interception is expected. Terrorists may attempt to smuggle a nuclear weapon into the United States by placing it in a shipping container, which are commonly used to transport goods. With nearly 9 million containers entering the US by ship each year, there is concern that terrorists could exploit this method to carry out an attack. Under the Container Security Initiative (CSI), CBP agents and foreign counterparts screen containers at certain foreign ports to prevent terrorists from smuggling bombs into the United States. Terrorists may try to evade CSI by using trusted shipping companies, falsifying data, or shipping from non-CSI ports. A nuclear explosion from a bomb in a shipping container could have devastating effects on the world economy due to its reliance on container traffic and just-in-time deliveries. The potential impact of a terrorist attack on the shipping industry, particularly sea containers, could lead to a halt in shipping and global economic collapse. With concerns about terrorist weapons being smuggled, the closure of ports for even a few weeks could result in gridlock and severe consequences for the entire system. The Middle East is a major source of anti-American terrorism, with the United States importing over 2 million barrels of crude oil daily from the Persian Gulf. This oil is transported by large supertankers, making it difficult to detect a bomb inside. Supertankers can carry up to 500,000 deadweight tons of crude oil, posing a significant security risk. Supertankers can carry 500,000 deadweight tons of crude oil, making it challenging to detect a bomb inside due to their size and steel thickness. Neutron activation is a possible method for detecting a nuclear weapon in a shipping container by sending neutrons to cause fission in uranium-235, producing gamma rays with unique energies for identification. Neutrons sent into crude oil would be absorbed or scattered by hydrogen atoms, making detection of a bomb inside a tanker difficult. Designing a means to detonate a bomb in a tanker could be a technical challenge for terrorists. A tanker bomb could devastate an oil port and impact global crude oil shipments, potentially damaging the world economy. The U.S. and global response to such threats has become clearer in the years following the September 11 attacks. The U.S. and global response to nuclear terrorism post-9/11 is focused on a \"layered defense\" strategy to prevent terrorists from acquiring and smuggling nuclear weapons. Various programs have been established to address this threat, categorized based on their impact on terrorist efforts to obtain and deliver a nuclear weapon. The U.S. response to nuclear terrorism post-9/11 focuses on preventing terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons. Threat Reduction Programs in the Former Soviet Union, authorized by the Nunn-Lugar Amendment, assist in dismantling Soviet nuclear weapons. Three agencies fund threat reduction programs: DOD, DOE, and the Department of State. Efforts to secure highly enriched uranium (HEU) worldwide have been ad hoc rather than part of a comprehensive plan. Projects like Project Sapphire in 1994 and Project Vinca in 2002 have removed poorly guarded HEU from research reactors in Kazakhstan and Serbia, respectively, to prevent terrorists from acquiring material for nuclear weapons. Efforts to secure fissile material have slowed since September 11, 2001. A Global Threat Reduction Initiative was announced to secure Russian-origin HEU by 2005, Soviet-origin spent fuel by 2010, and U.S. origin fuel within a decade. The initiative also aims to convert civilian research reactors to use low-enriched uranium and identify other nuclear materials of concern. The U.S. plans to dedicate over $450 million for this program. The approximate cost to complete the program is mentioned, with funds expected to be spent over more than 10 years. Concerns about the security of Iranian, North Korean, and Pakistani HEU are highlighted. Diplomatic efforts to secure such material are not discussed in this report. Programs like DOE's Second Line of Defense and the State Department's Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance aim to prevent nuclear materials from being smuggled out through borders. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) is also mentioned. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) was established in January 2002 by the former U.S. Customs Service, now part of CBP in the Department of Homeland Security. It screens containers in overseas ports before they are loaded onto U.S.-bound ships to prevent terrorists from shipping a nuclear weapon to a U.S. port. CSI is operational in 34 ports with another 13 possible as of February 2005. U.S. CBP agents work with host country officers to target containers for inspection using non-intrusive inspection devices like gamma-ray imaging machines. The Mega-Ports program supports CSI by equipping foreign seaports with radiation detection equipment to screen cargo for nuclear and radioactive materials. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) involves 60 governments cooperating to interdict shipments of WMD or related materials to states of proliferation concern. The first interdiction under PSI was of the German ship BBC China in October 2003. The first interdiction under PSI was of the German ship BBC China in October 2003, seizing its Libya-bound cargo of parts for special centrifuges used in enriching uranium. U.S. Border Security involves various measures like border patrols, barriers, sensors, radiation monitors, and Customs inspections to prevent terrorists from smuggling nuclear weapons across borders. However, securing legal entry points and guarding thousands of miles of land borders and coasts poses significant challenges, highlighting the importance of multiple defensive layers beyond just border security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 assigns the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology to coordinate efforts in developing technology to counter terrorist WMD threats. This includes collaboration with agencies like the National Nuclear Security Administration and the National Institute of Standards and Technology for homeland security technology programs. Various entities such as national laboratories, corporations, and universities are conducting research and development on technologies to detect smuggling of nuclear materials and weapons. Detection of HEU and WGPU is challenging due to their low radioactivity. Technologies like radiation portal monitors and active imaging systems, such as the Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System (VACIS), are currently in use. Advanced systems like a neutron-interrogation system developed by Livermore are being developed to screen containers by bombarding them with neutrons to produce nuclear fissions in materials like HEU and WGPU, which emit gamma rays with unique energy levels for identification. The FY2006 DHS budget includes the establishment of a new Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) within DHS to develop a domestic system to detect and report attempts to import, assemble, or transport nuclear or radiological materials for illicit use. Enhanced intelligence capabilities are necessary to complement other detection methods and focus defense efforts. Improving intelligence for homeland security has been debated, including nuclear forensics to analyze nuclear weapon debris and radioactive material for various purposes such as verifying the safety of U.S. nuclear warheads and detecting nuclear proliferation. With the current moratorium on nuclear testing, forensic studies play a crucial role in thwarting illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. Nuclear forensics plays a crucial role in detecting signs of nuclear proliferation and thwarting illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. In the event of a terrorist nuclear attack, forensics can help identify the nation of origin of the weapon and aid in preventing further leakage. Additionally, attributing a weapon to a nation can deter them from providing such items to terrorists. Other related issues include missile defense, export controls, and nuclear nonproliferation efforts. In combating nuclear terrorism, the United States aims for zero nuclear detonations, requiring prevention of terrorist or rogue state acquisition and delivery of nuclear weapons. Despite various initiatives, studies reveal weaknesses in U.S. ability to counter nuclear terrorism, prompting policymakers to enhance programs. The Government Accountability Office report and House Policy Committee recommendations focus on defending against catastrophic threats like terrorist incidents involving Weapons of Mass Destruction and nuclear proliferation. Key recommendations include enhancing federal and state authority, improving incident planning and response capabilities, allocating more resources for research and development, and strengthening international regimes to limit proliferation-enabling technology spread. Specific policy options to counter nuclear terrorism include accelerating the safeguarding of Russian fissile materials, expanding efforts globally to secure HEU, broadening CSI to more ports, strengthening the Coast Guard through programs like Integrated Deepwater Systems, and enhancing capabilities to detect and disable terrorist nuclear devices. Congress funds programs to counter nuclear terrorism through various authorization and appropriations bills, including the National Defense Authorization Act and Department of Defense Appropriations Act for DOD programs, Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for DOE programs, and funding for DHS. Other agencies also conduct R&D funded by different bills. The FY2006 requests for Cooperative Threat Reduction, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and DHS Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) are $415.5 million, $1,637.2 million, and $1,368.4 million, respectively. Congress also holds oversight hearings, establishes legislative requirements, and introduces bills related to nuclear terrorism, such as H.R. 173 (Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2005). H.R. 282 (Ros-Lehtinen) Iran Freedom Support Act aims to hold Iran accountable for threatening behavior and support a transition to democracy. H.R. 422 (Tauscher) 9-11 Commission Combating Proliferation Implementation Act establishes an office to combat WMD proliferation and authorizes funds for removal of fissile material. S. 3 (Gregg) is also mentioned. S. 3 (Gregg) Protecting America in the War on Terror Act of 2005 criminalizes the transport of radioactive or nuclear material by vessel. S. 21 (Collins) Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2005 aims to screen commercial motor vehicles carrying municipal solid waste for radiological and nuclear weapons before entering the United States."
