    "content": "The National security letter (NSL) authority was established due to dissatisfaction with the exception to the privacy provisions of the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA). Congress acted to ensure the exception was not broadly construed, allowing financial institutions to decline requests for information. However, some institutions refused to grant the FBI access to financial records, especially in states with privacy protection provisions. In states with privacy protection laws, financial institutions may refuse FBI access to customer records due to potential liability. Congress passed the NSL statute to grant FBI access to financial records in certain foreign intelligence cases. The Communications Privacy Act and the NSL provisions granted the FBI access to customer information from communications and financial service providers for foreign counterintelligence investigations. These provisions included nondisclosure requirements and limitations on dissemination, without specified enforcement mechanisms or penalties for non-compliance. Additional NSL provisions were added in the mid-1990s for investigating government employee leaks. The FBI requested an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act to access credit agency records for counterintelligence investigations. This amendment would help the FBI identify which financial institutions are being used by the subjects of their investigations. The FBI requested access to credit agency records for counterintelligence investigations, as it can be time-consuming and resource-intensive to identify financial institutions. The National Security Act NSL provision authorized access to credit and financial institution records of federal employees with security clearances for investigations of classified information leaks. The provision was passed in response to the Ames espionage case and is seen as a deterrent to espionage for financial gain. The Committee believes Section 801 will deter espionage for financial gain without burdening investigative agencies with unproductive recordkeeping or new reporting requirements. Information obtained under this section alone should not be used against the employee. Fair Credit Reporting Act and National Security Act have dissemination restrictions, safe harbor provisions, and penalties for improper disclosure. The USA PATRIOT Act amended NSL statutes and added a fifth one exclusively available to the FBI. The USA PATRIOT Act amended NSL statutes to expand FBI issuing authority, allowing field office heads to issue NSLs for investigations related to international terrorism or foreign spying, with restrictions on investigations of Americans based solely on First Amendment-protected activities. This streamlined the process, enabling quicker and broader use of NSLs. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded NSL statutes to allow any government agency investigating international terrorism to request consumer information from consumer reporting agencies. This provision was added to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, granting access to consumer reports and related information for terrorism-related investigations. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded NSL statutes to allow any government agency investigating international terrorism to request consumer information from consumer reporting agencies. Congress intended to provide other agencies with national security letter authority similar to the FBI's under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The reauthorization statutes amended the NSL statutes to include judicial enforcement, penalties for non-compliance, and clarified that nondisclosure requirements do not prevent recipients from seeking advice. The Department of Justice Inspector General reports criticized the FBI's use of National Security Letters (NSLs), noting a significant increase in requests from 2000 to 2005. The reports highlighted a rise in NSLs used to investigate Americans and emphasized the majority of requests were related to telephone or email communications. The FBI's use of National Security Letters (NSLs) was criticized for violations of statutes and guidelines, including issuing \"exigent letters\" to obtain information without proper authorization. The second Inspector General report in 2006 showed an increase in NSL requests related to investigations of U.S. persons, with efforts made to address the issues identified in the first report. The FBI and DOJ are working to address issues identified in previous IG reports, including the casual and unsupervised use of exigent letters to obtain customer records. Two federal court cases raised concerns about NSLs violating the First Amendment, leading to amendments and reconsideration. The District Court for the Southern District of New York found that the amended NSL secrecy requirements violated First Amendment free speech and separation of powers principles. The Court of Appeals allowed the government to invoke secrecy and judicial review authority in a limited but constitutionally permissible manner. The court would limit the duration of the nondisclosure requirement to specific time periods pending judicial review, conforming to First Amendment requirements. If the NSL recipient does not contest the requirement within the specified time frames, the nondisclosure requirement would continue, with opportunities for annual challenges. The court upheld Sections 2709(c) and 3511(b) but declared exclusive presumptions of Section 3511 invalid. Government can use reciprocal notice procedure for partial invalidation ruling. Government submitted FBI official's declaration for continued secrecy need of NSL. The district court granted the plaintiff's motion for a redacted summary of the FBI declaration regarding the continued need for secrecy concerning the NSL. A federal district court in the Ninth Circuit disagreed with the Second Circuit on the constitutionality of NSL confidentiality and judicial review provisions, stating that the statutory language and congressional intent were clear and not susceptible to narrowing. The district court barred the government from using Section 2709's NSL authority and enforcing related confidentiality provisions, citing clear statutory language and Congressional intent. The court stayed the order pending appeal. The President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology recommended changes to NSL procedures to align them more closely with Section 215 FISA court orders, including court approval for all NSLs, limiting Section 215 orders to international terrorism and espionage investigations, and increasing oversight and reporting requirements for both NSLs and Section 215 orders. Congress did not adopt these recommendations, but the USA FREEDOM Act addressed some of the concerns raised. The USA FREEDOM Act addresses NSL shortcomings by eliminating bulk metadata collection, revising procedures for NSL issuance and judicial review, and increasing transparency. NSL demands must now be limited to specific information, and judicial review of nondisclosure orders is handled with complementary amendments. The USA FREEDOM Act amends Section 3511 to allow recipients of NSLs to disclose information to those necessary for execution of the order, to an attorney for legal advice, and to others approved by the issuing agency. Recipients must notify the agency and advise those they tell of the nondisclosure requirements. The issuing agency must petition for judicial review upon request, providing specific facts justifying the need for a nondisclosure order. The USA FREEDOM Act amends Section 3511 to allow recipients of NSLs to disclose information to those necessary for execution of the order, to an attorney for legal advice, and to others approved by the issuing agency. Recipients must notify the agency and advise those they tell of the nondisclosure requirements. The court must issue a nondisclosure order if there is a risk of danger to national security, interference with diplomatic relations, or physical injury. The reference to \"the applicable time period\" suggests a time limit on the order, as was the practice before the USA FREEDOM Act. The USA FREEDOM Act's final NSL adjustment focuses on public disclosures, requiring the Director of National Intelligence to annually report the number of NSLs issued. Recipients of FISA orders or NSLs can also publicly report the total number of orders and customers covered. The differences among the five NSL sections are outlined in various statutes."
