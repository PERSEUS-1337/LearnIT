In the 12-month period ending on June 30, 2005, tourism was a significant industry in Louisiana and Mississippi, employing thousands of workers and generating substantial tax revenue and economic impact in both states. Louisiana generated $14 in revenue for every dollar spent on tourism, while Mississippi generated $12. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita severely impacted Louisiana's travel and tourism industry, reducing direct traveler expenditures by over 18% from $9.9 billion to $8.1 billion, and travel-generated employment by 9% between 2004 and 2005. Hurricane Katrina also had a severe impact on Mississippi's travel and tourism industry, reducing direct traveler expenditures by over 18% from $6.35 billion to $5.2 billion, and travel-generated employment by nearly 18% from 126,500 jobs. The Gulf Coast economy suffered a significant decline in travel-generated employment between 2004 and 2005, dropping from 126,500 jobs to 103,885 jobs. The revitalization of the tourism industries in Louisiana and Mississippi is crucial for the region's full recovery. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
