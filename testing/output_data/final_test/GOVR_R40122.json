    "content": "The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program is the main source of federal student loans, offering Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. The program replaced the Federal Family Education Loan program, which was terminated by the SAFRA Act. The FFEL program, terminated by the SAFRA Act in 2010, provided low-interest student loans through private and state-based lenders with federal guarantees against borrower default. Loans were funded with nonfederal capital and serviced by private sector and state-based lenders. Incentives were provided to ensure availability of nonfederal capital for FFEL program loans. The FFEL program loans, serviced by private sector and state-based lenders, are due to be repaid. The DL program, established in 1993, aimed to streamline student loan delivery and replace the FFEL program. Provisions for a \"phase-in\" of the DL program were repealed in 1998. The DL program, established in 1993, uses federal capital to provide loans to students and their families. Schools can be direct loan originators or loans can be originated by contractors. In FY2016, 20.4 million new DL program Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans totaling $109.2 billion will be made to students and parents. In recent years, changes have been made to the terms and conditions of DL program loans. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 lowered interest rates for Subsidized Stafford Loans and established the income-based repayment plan. The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 increased borrowing amounts for Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. The Higher Education Opportunity Act reauthorized the HEA and made various changes to loan terms. The SAFRA Act terminated new loans under the FFEL program after June 30, 2010. The Budget Control Act eliminated Subsidized Stafford Loans for graduate students after July 1, 2012. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act established a new fixed interest rate structure for DL program loans after July 1, 2013. This report discusses key provisions of federal student loans through the DL program, focusing on borrower eligibility, loan terms, repayment relief, and default consequences. It also includes historical information on prior loan conditions. The report covers eligibility requirements, loan limits, interest rates, and fees for DL program loans, as well as Consolidation Loans. The report examines terms and conditions of FFEL and DL program loans, including discounts, repayment, default consequences, rehabilitation, discharge, and forgiveness. Types of federally sponsored student loans available through the DL program are Subsidized Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. The federal government assumes the risk for losses in student loans through borrower default and pays for loan discharge in cases of borrower death or disability. Maximum interest rates and fees are set by statute for each type of need-based loan available only to undergraduate students since July 1, 2012. Subsidized Stafford Loans require financial need and the government pays the interest while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time. Subsidized Stafford Loans have fixed interest rates for loans disbursed after July 1, 2006, and are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The federal government does not cover the interest while the borrower is in school. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans also have fixed interest rates for loans disbursed after July 1, 2006, and are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students, as well as graduate and professional students. The government does not cover the interest on PLUS Loans while the student is in school. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan with a fixed interest rate based on the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. Special Direct Consolidation Loans were available for a limited time to borrowers with specific loan types. Borrowers can qualify for Consolidation Loans regardless of financial need. Loans made through the DL or FFEL program can be consolidated into a Special Direct Consolidation Loan held by ED, simplifying repayment. Borrower eligibility, loan limits, interest rates, and fees for Subsidized Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and PLUS Loans are discussed. Student borrowers must meet specific eligibility requirements to qualify for new loans under the DL program. To qualify for a PLUS Loan, the borrower must meet various eligibility criteria, including being a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, maintaining satisfactory academic progress, and not being in default on a federal student loan. Parent borrowers must also meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as student borrowers. Parent borrowers must meet citizenship and residency requirements, not be in default on a federal student loan, and undergo a credit check to qualify for a PLUS Loan. Eligible parents include biological, adoptive, and stepparents if their income is considered for the student's expected family contribution. Legal guardians cannot borrow PLUS Loans. Adverse credit history may require an endorser for loan approval. To qualify for a PLUS Loan, parent borrowers must meet citizenship and residency requirements, not be in default on a federal student loan, and undergo a credit check. An adverse credit history may require an endorser for loan approval. Applicants with adverse credit histories must complete loan counseling offered by ED. Dependent undergraduate students can borrow increased Unsubsidized Stafford if parents are unable to obtain a PLUS Loan due to adverse credit history. Dependency status and grade level, along with financial need and cost of attendance, impact eligibility for different types of loans and borrowing limits. Dependency status is determined by FAFSA responses, with students considered independent if they meet certain criteria. Dependency status and grade level are important factors as they determine the type of borrowing available for students. This includes being an orphan, in foster care, a ward of the court, an emancipated minor, in legal guardianship, a veteran, on active duty in the Armed Forces, a graduate or professional student, married, having legal dependents, homeless, self-supporting and at risk of being homeless, or meeting other unusual circumstances for independence. Dependency status and grade level determine the type of borrowing available to students and their families, affecting borrowing limits. PLUS Loans are only available to parents of dependent students, while independent undergraduates have higher personal borrowing limits. The assumption is that dependent students' expenses will be financed by parents, while independent students will finance their expenses without parental assistance. Dependency status also impacts which income and assets are included in need analysis calculations. Need analysis calculations for student loans are based on income and assets of the student and their parents for dependent students, and on the student's income and assets (and spouse if applicable) for independent students. Grade level progression does not always align with a new academic year for Stafford Loans, as students can receive loans multiple times as a first-year student if they meet academic progress requirements. Once enough credits are earned to progress to a higher grade level, higher borrowing limits become available. To borrow Stafford Loans or PLUS Loans as a graduate student, one must be enrolled in a program above the baccalaureate level, have completed three years of full-time study at an IHE, and not be receiving Title IV aid as an undergraduate student. Graduate and professional students have the highest personal borrowing limits but are no longer eligible for Subsidized Stafford Loans. They can still borrow Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans, provided they do not have an adverse credit history. Amendments by MAP-21 establish new limits on Subsidized Stafford Loans eligibility. The eligibility for Subsidized Stafford Loans for new borrowers after July 1, 2013 is limited to 150% of the program length. Dependency status and grade level determine loan types and limits, while need analysis procedures determine specific loan amounts. Additional rules apply for Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans. Applicants must undergo a \"need test\" to determine expected family contribution. The family contribution towards college expenses is determined based on the student's financial resources. The student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is calculated and subtracted from the estimated Cost of Attendance (COA) to determine need-based financial aid eligibility. Additional calculations are done to determine the federal student aid package, including eligibility for Federal Pell Grants and Stafford Loans for undergraduates. This ensures needy students receive maximum grant aid before taking on student loan debt. The mix of Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans is determined based on calculations considering the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and Estimated Financial Assistance (EFA). The maximum Subsidized Stafford Loan amount is calculated by subtracting the EFC and EFA from the Cost of Attendance (COA). Subsidized Stafford Loan eligibility is capped by annual loan limits and includes scholarships, grants, and other assistance in the EFA. The EFA determines the amount that can be borrowed through a Subsidized Stafford Loan, excluding national service education awards. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are not based on need and students can borrow up to the annual total Stafford Loan limit, minus any amount borrowed through a Subsidized Stafford Loan. The calculation for determining Unsubsidized Stafford Loan eligibility is based on the lesser of the difference between the Cost of Attendance (COA) and Expected Family Contribution (EFA), or the difference between the total Stafford Loan limit and the amount borrowed through a Subsidized Stafford Loan. PLUS Loans are non-need-based loans available to graduate/professional students and parents of dependent undergraduates, with eligibility determined by subtracting the EFA from the COA. The PLUS Loan eligibility is based on the Cost of Attendance (COA) minus the Expected Family Contribution (EFA). Dependent undergraduates can borrow the total PLUS Loan amount by one parent or split among multiple parents. Parent borrowers do not need to complete a FAFSA, but the student must have completed it. Graduate students must complete a FAFSA to be eligible for PLUS Loans. There are separate borrowing limits for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. There is no specified limit for PLUS Loans. Annual loan limits apply to the maximum principal amount that can be borrowed. Borrowing limits for Stafford Loans vary by borrower dependency status and grade level, with limits prorated for students enrolled for less than one year. Limits are also placed on the total amount of outstanding Stafford Loan debt for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Annual and aggregate loan limits vary by borrower type for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, with no aggregate limits on PLUS Loans. The amount that can be borrowed is based on financial need for Subsidized Stafford Loans, and on the difference between cost of attendance and financial assistance for total Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans. The text discusses the annual and aggregate loan limits for different types of borrowers, including those with special circumstances. It also covers the interest rates applicable to Stafford Loans, which have changed over time. Stafford Loans disbursed between October 1, 1992, and July 1, 2006, have variable interest rates based on the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus a premium. The rates are determined annually on June 1 and become effective on July 1 for the following year. The borrower interest rate is based on whether they are in school or in repayment. The interest rates for Stafford Loans vary based on whether the borrower is in school or in repayment. For loans disbursed between July 1, 2006, and July 1, 2013, fixed rates apply, with a rate of 6.8% for most loans. Loans disbursed after July 1, 2013, have market-indexed fixed rates, with rates for undergraduate students at 10-year Treasury note rate plus 2.05 percentage points, and rates for graduate and professional students at 10-year Treasury note rate plus 3.6 percentage points. The maximum interest rate is capped at 8.25%. The interest rates for PLUS Loans vary based on the disbursement date. Loans disbursed before July 1, 1987, have fixed rates, while those disbursed after have variable rates. The formula for calculating variable rates stays in effect for the life of the loan. New PLUS loans disbursed from July 1, 1998, through June 30, 2006, have a specific interest rate formula. The interest rates for PLUS Loans vary based on the disbursement date. Loans disbursed before July 1, 1987, have fixed rates, while those disbursed after have variable rates. New PLUS Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2006, have statutorily specified fixed rates, with a premium of 3.1 percentage points. Loans made under the DL program have a fixed interest rate of 7.9%, while those made under the FFEL program before July 1, 2010, have a fixed interest rate of 8.5%. Under the Higher Education Reconciliation Act, the interest rate for PLUS Loans made under the FFEL program was increased to 8.5%. All PLUS Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2013, have market-indexed fixed rates based on the 10-year Treasury note rate plus 4.6 percentage points, capped at 10.5%. The interest rates for DL program loans made during AY 2015-2016 are based on the 10-year Treasury note rate plus 4.6 percentage points, capped at 10.5%. Historical interest rates for Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans are detailed in tables in the appendix. Borrowers are responsible for repaying loan principal and interest. Borrowers of DL program Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans are responsible for paying a loan origination fee to offset federal subsidy costs. The loan origination fee is 1% for Stafford Loans and 4% for PLUS Loans disbursed after July 1, 2010. No fee is charged on Consolidation Loans. Loan origination fees are deducted from each disbursement of loan proceeds to the borrower. Under the FFEL and DL programs, borrower fees were charged on loans disbursed before July 1, 2010. For Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans, origination fees were limited to 3% of the loan amount under the FFEL program. In the DL program, borrowers paid a 4% origination fee initially, which was later reduced to 3% on Stafford Loans. Changes to borrower fees were made under the HERA for both programs. Loans under the FFEL program had borrower fees limited to 3%. Changes were made under the HERA, with origination fees reduced for Stafford Loans disbursed after July 1, 2006. The origination fee for FFEL program PLUS Loans remained at 3%. The DL program specified a 3% origination fee for Stafford Loans disbursed after July 1, 2006. The origination fee for DL program Stafford Loans was reduced by 0.5 percentage points each year until it reached 1% for loans disbursed after July 1, 2010. PLUS Loans maintained a 4% origination fee. Special rules apply during budget sequestration periods, increasing origination fees by a uniform percentage. Loan origination fees depend on the first disbursement period. Revised loan origination fees vary depending on the first disbursement period. For loans disbursed between October 1, 2014, and October 1, 2015, fees are 1.073% for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and 4.292% for PLUS Loans. For loans disbursed between October 1, 2015, and October 1, 2016, fees are 1.068% for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and 4.272% for PLUS Loans. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine multiple federal student loans into one, potentially extending the repayment period and reducing monthly payments. Consolidation Loans through the DL program offer borrowers the opportunity to lock in a fixed interest rate based on the weighted average of existing loan rates. Eligibility requires having an outstanding balance on a qualifying loan. No origination fees are assessed on Consolidation Loans, which can include various federal student loans. Consolidation Loans can include various federal student loans such as Subsidized Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, Federal Perkins Loans, Guaranteed Student Loans, and others. Applicants must be in repayment status or in the grace period to qualify for a Consolidation Loan. To qualify for a Consolidation Loan, borrowers must be in repayment status, in the grace period before repayment, or in default with satisfactory repayment arrangements. Defaulted borrowers must make three consecutive full monthly payments on time. Borrowers with court judgments or wage garnishments are not eligible. Loans can generally be consolidated only once, but in some cases, reconsolidation is possible. Loans taken out within 180 days of obtaining a Consolidation Loan can be added. Borrowers with existing Consolidation Loans can add other eligible loans taken within 180 days before or after obtaining the loan. They can also consolidate additional eligible loans with their existing Consolidation Loans to obtain new ones. Borrowers with FFEL program Consolidation Loans can reconsolidate into the DL program for repayment options like ICR or IBR plans, loan forgiveness, or no accrual of interest for active duty servicemembers. The interest rates on Consolidation Loans are determined by averaging the rates on the loans being consolidated. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 removed the cap on interest rates. Borrowers can consolidate loans during the grace period, allowing them to use lower interest rates. The grace period interest rate can be used in weighted average calculations for Consolidation Loans, which are determined by averaging the rates on the loans being consolidated. Borrowers must be informed of any loss of loan benefits when consolidating FFEL or DL program loans, including Perkins Loan benefits. Subsidized Stafford Loans retain interest subsidies when consolidated with other unsubsidized loans. The Secretary pays interest that accrues during school and deferment periods for borrowers of DL and FFEL program Consolidation Loans. Maximum interest rates and fees are set by statutory and regulatory provisions. Lenders in the FFEL program were required to pay origination fees to the government. Default fees were paid to guaranty agencies. The default fee in the FFEL program could be paid by the borrower or other sources like the lender or guarantor. Lenders and guaranty agencies competed by offering interest rate and fee discounts to attract borrowers. The practice of waiving fees may have started due to competition from the DL program. The Secretary offered interest rate reductions to borrowers in the DL program until June 30, 2012, with amendments limiting incentives to a 0.25 percentage point reduction for electronic debit account repayment. FFEL program lenders had discretion in offering loan discounts, with a variety of discounts and rebates previously available to borrowers. In the final years of the FFEL program lending, various student loan discounts were offered by lenders, such as paying fees on behalf of borrowers and reducing interest rates. Some benefits required consecutive on-time payments, but may not be beneficial for borrowers who want to pay off their loans early or consolidate them. Common discounts included lenders paying loan origination fees and guaranty agencies covering default fees. Some lenders offered interest rate reductions to borrowers for reaching certain milestones, such as graduation or making consecutive on-time payments. Borrowers could apply up to 100% of the loan amount toward education expenses, with some lenders also offering reductions for signing up for automatic loan payments. Some lenders provided incentives for borrowers, such as interest rate reductions and principal balance reductions, for meeting milestones like graduation or making consecutive on-time payments. They also offered benefits like forgiving the last several payments on a loan. The repayment incentives for Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans under the DL program included an up-front interest rebate and an interest rate reduction for EDA repayment. However, for loans disbursed after July 1, 2012, only the interest rate reduction for EDA repayment is available. Borrowers of Stafford Loans from July 1, 2010, to July 1, 2012, received a 0.5% up-front interest rebate, while PLUS Loans borrowers before July 1, 2012, received a 1.5% up-front interest rebate. The rebate was a percentage of the loan amount borrowed and was applied to increase the borrower's loan proceeds. The borrower must make the first 12 monthly payments on time to retain the interest rebate amount. Borrowers can opt for EDA repayment, where payments are automatically deducted from their account, receiving a 0.25% interest rate reduction. This reduction does not apply during certain periods. Repayment for Stafford Loans starts six months after the borrower stops being enrolled at least half-time. The repayment period for PLUS Loans and Consolidation Loans begins the day the loan is fully disbursed, excluding deferment and forbearance periods. The first payment is due within 60 days after the repayment period starts or after exiting a deferment/forbearance period. Subsidized Stafford Loans have interest paid by the government while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time in school. Recent changes to the Direct Loan program have limited the interest subsidy for some borrowers of Subsidized Stafford Loans. Interest is not subsidized during the six-month grace period for loans disbursed between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2014. Additionally, the period of interest subsidy is now limited to 150% of the borrower's academic program length for new borrowers after July 1, 2013. In contrast, borrowers of Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans are responsible for paying all accrued interest on their loans. Borrowers of Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans may pay the interest that accrues on their loans prior to entering repayment, while they are enrolled in school and during the six-month grace period, on either a monthly or quarterly basis. Otherwise, this interest is capitalized, or added to the loan principal. Borrowers of FFEL and DL program loans may repay their loans ahead of schedule without penalty. Prepayments exceeding the monthly payment amount are applied to future installments, advancing the next payment due date unless the borrower requests otherwise. Borrowers of FFEL and DL program loans have various repayment plan options available to them, including standard, graduated, extended, and income-based repayment plans. Prepayments can be applied to future payments or to the principal balance to shorten the repayment period. Repayment options for FFEL and DL program loans include income-sensitive, income-contingent, Pay As You Earn, and alternative plans. Prior to HERA, differences existed between FFEL and DL repayment plans, but now standard, graduated, extended, and IBR plans are consistent across both loan programs. Repayment plans for FFEL and DL program loans are now consistent, allowing borrowers to switch plans annually or at any time. Payment amounts under various plans must cover at least the interest due. Loans held by a particular lender must be combined into a single account and repaid under the same plan. Borrowers of DL program loans must repay all loans under the same plan, except for PLUS Loans which may be repaid under a different plan. Repayment plans for FFEL and DL program loans are now consistent, allowing borrowers to switch plans annually or at any time. Borrowers of Subsidized Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and PLUS Loans make fixed monthly payments of no less than $50 under a standard repayment plan for up to 10 years. Loan holders may adjust the monthly payment amount or repayment period for loans with variable interest rates. If the interest rate change would prevent repayment within 10 years, administrative forbearance must be provided for up to three years. The loan holder must provide administrative forbearance for up to three years, extending the repayment period. Consolidation Loans have a minimum monthly payment of $50, with longer repayment periods based on the borrower's outstanding loan balance. Repayment periods for Consolidation Loans are determined by the combined balances of the loan and other federal student loans. Repayment plans can be switched annually, with fixed monthly payments under standard plans for up to 10 years. Graduated repayment plans adjust monthly payment amounts over time. A graduated repayment plan involves monthly payments that increase over time, starting with smaller payments and ending with larger ones. Payments are limited to avoid extreme variations and must be at least $50 or the accrued interest for Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans, with repayment within 10 years. Variable interest rates on loans allow for adjustments to either the monthly payment amount or the repayment period annually. If the repayment amount remains the same on a variable rate loan and the interest rate change would prevent repayment within 10 years, the loan holder must offer administrative forbearance for up to three years. For Consolidation Loans on a graduated repayment plan, monthly payments can be adjusted over a period of 10 to 30 years based on the borrower's outstanding balance. Repayment periods are determined by the combined balances of the Consolidation Loan and other federal student loans. The extended repayment plan allows borrowers with large loan balances to make lower monthly payments over a longer period, with a maximum repayment period of 25 years. The IBR plan bases monthly payments on the relationship between student loan debt and income. The Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan offers debt forgiveness for borrowers with prolonged low income. There are two versions of the plan based on the date of borrowing. The original IBR plan is for borrowers of FFEL and DL program loans who demonstrate a partial financial hardship. The Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan provides debt forgiveness for borrowers with prolonged low income. Borrowers may qualify for partial financial hardship if their annual student loan payments exceed 15% of the amount by which their AGI exceeds 150% of the poverty line. Monthly payments under IBR can range from $0 to a certain amount based on income levels. The Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan allows for loan forgiveness for borrowers with low income. Monthly payments can range from $0 to a maximum amount based on income levels. Repayment periods may exceed 10 years for borrowers no longer demonstrating financial hardship. Married borrowers' payment amounts are based on combined AGI if filing jointly. Since July 1, 2010, married borrowers can choose to repay their loans jointly under the IBR plan based on their combined loan balances and AGI. Individual payment amounts are determined proportionally to each borrower's debt. Payments under IBR are credited to interest, fees, and then principal. If the required payment doesn't cover all interest on subsidized loans, the Secretary covers the remaining interest for up to three years. Unpaid interest on unsubsidized loans accrues separately. Any unpaid interest on unsubsidized loans or Subsidized Stafford Loans after three years is capitalized when a borrower no longer demonstrates a partial hardship or opts out of the IBR plan. If the monthly payment is insufficient to cover the principal, the payment will be postponed until the borrower no longer has a financial hardship or leaves the IBR plan. Borrowers in the IBR plan may have any remaining balance forgiven after 25 years of reduced payments during a partial financial hardship. The IBR plan requires recalculated monthly payments during a partial financial hardship, or upon leaving the plan. New borrowers after July 1, 2014, have reduced thresholds for determining financial hardship and maximum monthly payments. The IBR plan now allows borrowers to have their federal student loan balance forgiven after 20 years instead of 25 years. Monthly payments under the New IBR plan can range from $0 to a maximum of 10% of any amount by which their AGI exceeds 150% of the poverty line. For example, a single borrower with an AGI of $40,000 would have a partial financial hardship if their annual student loan payments were greater than $2,235. Repayment under the ICR plan allows borrowers to make payments based on their income and offers debt forgiveness for those with low incomes. The plan is available for Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students, and most Consolidation Loans borrowers. Payment amounts are adjusted annually based on outstanding loan balance, AGI, and family size. The Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan calculates payment amounts based on a 12-year repayment period and borrower's AGI. Payments range from $0 for borrowers at or below the poverty line to amounts sufficient for high-income borrowers. A $5 minimum monthly payment is required for payments less than $5. Unpaid interest is capitalized if the monthly payment is less than accrued interest. The ICR plan limits loan balance to 110% of original principal. Remaining balance after 25 years is forgiven. The PAYE plan is similar to IBR and available to new borrowers after October 1, 2007. The PAYE plan, available to borrowers after October 1, 2011, is similar to the IBR plan. Borrowers must have a partial financial hardship to qualify, with monthly payments based on income. Under the PAYE plan, monthly loan payments vary based on income, ranging from $0 for low-income borrowers to a maximum of 10% of income exceeding 150% of the poverty line. Remaining loan balances may be forgiven after 20 years. Income-sensitive repayment plans adjust payments annually based on income and are only available for FFEL program loans. Stafford and PLUS Loans require monthly payments of at least $50 or accrued interest, with repayment within 10 years. Payments cannot exceed three times the amount of any other payment. If income is too low to repay the loan within 10 years, administrative forbearance of up to five years is provided. For variable interest rate loans, monthly payments or repayment period length may be adjusted annually. Consolidation Loans on income-sensitive repayment plans can have monthly payments adjusted based on income changes over 10 to 30 years. Repayment periods for Consolidation Loans under the income-sensitive repayment plan can be up to 30 years. The Secretary may offer alternative repayment plans for borrowers facing exceptional circumstances, allowing up to 30 years for repayment. Borrowers can choose to accept the terms of the alternative plan or select from other available repayment options. Repayment for Consolidation Loans can be up to 30 years with alternative plans available. Minimum payment is $5 and payments cannot vary significantly. Unpaid interest may be capitalized but loan balance cannot exceed 110% of the original amount. Four alternative repayment plans are offered. Borrowers facing difficulty can access repayment relief options. Repayment relief options, such as deferments, forbearance, and interest rate benefits, are available for borrowers struggling to make payments on their student loans. Deferment and forbearance provide temporary relief from loan payments, while interest rate benefits are offered to active duty servicemembers. These options can help prevent defaulting on loans and mitigate the impact of student loan debt. Deferment is a temporary pause in loan repayment, allowing borrowers to pursue further studies, deal with unemployment, economic hardship, or military service. Once a borrower has used a deferment for a specific condition, they cannot receive another one for the same reason. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 consolidated deferment terms for borrowers, with eligibility varying based on loan disbursement, type, and outstanding balances. New conditions applied to borrowers after July 1, 1993, with additional deferment types introduced later. Some deferments are now available to all borrowers regardless of when they obtained their loans. For Subsidized Stafford loans, the government pays the interest during deferment. Other loans require the borrower to pay accrued interest monthly or quarterly, or have it added to the principal balance. Deferments are available for borrowers pursuing at least half-time study. PLUS Loan parent borrowers can also qualify for deferment. During in-school deferment, borrowers can qualify for deferment. Parent, graduate, and professional student borrowers of PLUS Loans can also defer payments during the six-month grace period after the student stops being enrolled at least half-time. This deferment is available for borrowers pursuing graduate fellowship programs approved by the Secretary, rehabilitation training programs for disabled individuals, or for those who are unemployed. Unemployment deferment is available to borrowers who are jobless or unable to find work after registering with an employment agency. It can be granted for up to three years, even for those who have never been employed before. This deferment is applicable to loans under the FFEL and DL program, under certain conditions like receiving public assistance payments. Economic hardship deferment is available to borrowers who meet specific criteria such as receiving public assistance or working full-time with a limited income. This deferment can be granted for up to three years in one-year increments. It is also available to borrowers serving in the Peace Corps or on active duty in the military, including National Guard duty during a war or national emergency. Borrowers of FFEL and DL program loans who are National Guard or reserve members called to active duty can receive a deferment. This deferment lasts for 13 months after active duty or until re-enrollment. If eligible, borrowers can receive both military service and post-active duty deferments concurrently. Forbearance is temporary relief from repayment for borrowers facing financial hardship. Forbearance is a temporary relief from repayment obligations for borrowers who are willing but unable to make regular payments. It can involve pausing payments, extending payment timelines, or accepting reduced payments. Unlike deferment periods, borrowers are responsible for all accrued interest during forbearance, which is added to the loan balance at the end of the forbearance period. Forbearance is typically granted at the discretion of the loan holder, although mandatory forbearance may be required in certain cases. Borrowers must apply for forbearance. Forbearance is a temporary relief from repayment obligations for borrowers who are unable to make regular payments. Borrowers must apply for forbearance, provide supporting documentation for certain types, and reapply each year. Maximum time limits depend on the type of forbearance granted. Lenders are required to provide forbearance in certain circumstances, such as for medical or dental interns/residents and those with high federal student loan payments. No adverse credit information can be reported solely due to forbearance. Borrowers may qualify for administrative forbearance for up to three years under specific conditions, such as changes in variable interest rates affecting repayment ability. This applies to various situations, including AmeriCorps service, Department of Defense loan repayment programs, teacher loan forgiveness programs, and National Guard members on active state duty for 30 or more consecutive days. Administrative forbearance can also be granted under limited conditions authorized by the Secretary. The SCRA provides interest rate benefits for active duty servicemembers on FFEL and DL program loans, capping the interest rate at 6% during military service. Creditors must forgive interest above 6% and cannot accelerate loan repayment. If loans with reduced interest rates are included in a Consolidation Loan, the 6% rate applies for weighted average interest calculation. For DL program loans disbursed on or after October 1, 2008, interest does not accrue for up to 60 months during active duty or qualifying National Guard duty in hostilities. A defaulted loan occurs when a borrower fails to make payments for 270 days (or 330 days for less frequent installments) and shows no intention to repay. Defaulted student loans are a significant issue. Defaulted student loans are a significant problem for both the federal government and borrowers. When a loan goes into default, the borrower loses certain rights and privileges associated with the loan. The agency in charge of collections can demand full payment of principal, interest, and collection costs. There is no statute of limitations on student loan collections, and borrowers must be informed of the consequences of default during entrance counseling. As part of due diligence, the agency collecting on defaulted student loans must inform the defaulter of consequences. Loan holders and collection agencies must exchange information with consumer reporting agencies. Default information can be reported for seven years from the date of default claim payment. Defaulters who reenter repayment after defaulting may have their federal tax refunds and state income tax refunds attached by the IRS to repay their student loans. Social Security benefits can also be offset by up to 15% or the amount exceeding $750. Guaranty agencies or the Secretary can garnish up to 15% of a defaulter's disposable pay. Defaulter's must receive written notice before garnishment and have the right to examine the debt record and request a hearing. The garnishment process allows agencies to collect on defaulted student loans through litigation, with federal employees being common targets. Defaulters can regain Title IV eligibility by making six consecutive payments on their loans. Litigation is the final step in compelling repayment, following garnishment and other collection methods.
