    "content": "The primary function of standing committees in the House of Representatives is to evaluate bills and resolutions introduced by Members during each two-year Congress. This evaluation process involves initial screening by committee leaders and staff to identify measures that merit further consideration. Committees may hold public hearings to receive testimony on legislation and conduct oversight and investigations as part of their legislative duties. Committees in the House of Representatives conduct oversight and investigations as part of their legislative duties. They hold hearings and markup meetings to propose amendments to legislation before recommending it to the House for approval. This report examines how committees implemented House rules in the 114th Congress. The House rules for committees in the 114th Congress focus on legislative activities such as hearings, oversight, and markups. Committee rules must be consistent with House rules, but there is limited guidance on specific procedures. Each standing committee is required to adopt written rules governing its procedure. The House rules for committees in the 114th Congress focus on legislative activities such as hearings, oversight, and markups. Committee rules must be consistent with House rules, but there is limited guidance on specific procedures. Rule XI, clause 1(a)(1)(A) states that the Rules of the House are applicable to committees and subcommittees. Rule XI, clause 1(a)(1)(B) subordinates subcommittees to their respective committees. Rule X contains the legislative and oversight jurisdiction of each standing committee and procedures for committee operations. The House rules for committees in the 114th Congress focus on legislative activities, including hearings, oversight, and markups. Rule XII addresses legislation referral and committee procedures, while Rule XIII covers committee reports and privileged reports. This report analyzes House Rules X, XI, XII, and XIII, along with relevant provisions of other House rules applicable to committees' legislative activities in the 114th Congress. House rules are crucial for both the majority and minority parties in setting committee agendas, conducting hearings, and reaching conclusions on legislative policies. Adherence to these rules ensures fairness for all committee members in presenting their views and seeking changes in legislative texts. Committees are expected to adhere to House rules and precedents, presenting a clean parliamentary record for floor action. However, decisions during the markup process could impact the majority-party leadership's strategy. The Rules Committee may need to include waivers in a special rule if procedural issues arise. Failure to follow procedures could erode trust in party leadership. Committees must adhere to House rules and precedents to maintain a clean parliamentary record for floor action. Failure to follow procedures could erode trust in party leadership, leading to potential challenges from the minority committee members. Committee rules must be adopted at the first meeting of a new Congress and published in the Congressional Record within 30 days. Committees have the discretion to create their own rules and procedures, consistent with House rules. Committees must enforce both House and committee rules governing hearings, debate, and reporting. Committees typically adopt previous rules with incremental changes, tailored to fit their jurisdiction and practices. The rules favor the majority and are considered in light of major policy issues and the political environment. The chair also considers party leadership expectations for committee operations. Committees often adopt rules with adjustments to suit their jurisdiction and practices, favoring the majority. Key aspects of committee rules include the chair's authority in scheduling meetings, referring legislation, and issuing subpoenas. The role and authority of the ranking minority member are also important, determining actions that may require their involvement or concurrence. The committee's power in relation to the chair and the minority party is crucial, with decisions often requiring a majority vote. The implementation of changes to House rules affecting committees includes requirements for committee chairs to provide legislation text 24 hours in advance of markups. Rule XI states that subcommittees are subject to the authority of their committee. Some rules apply specifically to subcommittees, such as subpoenas. Some committees grant autonomy to subcommittees, while others limit their authority. The Committee on Small Business restricts subcommittees to conducting hearings, while the Foreign Affairs Committee requires subcommittee recommendations for consideration, except in \"extraordinary circumstances.\" In \"extraordinary circumstances,\" the chair, in consultation with the ranking minority member, determines the referral of measures to subcommittees. Some committees restrict subcommittees' scheduling and provide funding or staff, while others leave the decision to the committee chair's discretion. The Small Business Committee rules state that subcommittees do not have separate staff. Rule X, clause 5(d) limits most committees to 5 subcommittees, but allows for 6 if an oversight subcommittee is established. The Appropriations Committee can have up to 13 subcommittees, and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee can have up to 7. Rule X, clause 2(b)(2) requires standing committees with more than 20 members to establish an oversight subcommittee. The rules of nine committees allow for the creation of ad hoc task forces and subunits, with varying levels of authority to report legislation. The Ethics Committee has special provisions for investigative and adjudicatory subcommittees, while the Budget Committee mentions \"task forces\" but lacks a specific rule. Subcommittee ratios must reflect full committee party ratios for four committees, while five committees list specific ratios for their subcommittees. The Energy and Commerce Committee has different rules on ratios. The Energy and Commerce Committee and the Homeland Security Committee have different rules on subcommittee ratios, requiring at least two more majority-party members than minority-party members. House rules mandate equal party representation on the Ethics Committee and its subcommittees. Chairs and ranking minority members of full committees can serve on subcommittees. Committees can decide if ex officio members can vote or affect the majority-minority ratio. Nine committees allow ex officio members to vote on subcommittees, while four committees allow them to be counted for quorum purposes. Three committees count ex officio members when determining the majority to minority ratio, and five committees did not address ex officio membership on subcommittees. Additionally, nine committees permit other committee members to sit on subcommittees they do not serve on, and six allow committee members to participate in subcommittee hearings and meetings. Some committees allow committee members to join subcommittee hearings and meetings, ask questions of witnesses, but prohibit voting, being counted for a quorum, or raising a point of order. Two committees also disallow offering amendments at markups. Temporary assignments to subcommittees may be made under certain committees' rules. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee allows temporary assignments to subcommittees for field hearings to establish a quorum or enable non-subcommittee members to participate. Rules disallow voting for members with temporary assignments. Some committees' rules state that subcommittee vacancies do not interrupt work. The Agriculture Committee's rules permit the chair to schedule subcommittee hearings during a vacancy. Foreign Affairs and Veterans' Affairs Committees allow non-committee members to sit with subcommittees at hearings by unanimous consent. The Small Business Committee requires Representatives to notify the chair and ranking minority member 24 hours in advance to participate in hearings. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee allows non-committee members to question witnesses with the chair's permission. Various committees have rules for subcommittee chairs to report promptly on matters. The Agriculture Committee's rule mandates the majority staff director to notify all committee members of subcommittee reports. The Education and the Workforce Committee allows a majority decision on certain matters. The Education and the Workforce Committee's rules require subcommittees to provide detailed analyses of reported bills, including section-by-section and Ramseyer-type analyses. The Homeland Security Committee treats tie votes in subcommittees as votes to report measures without recommendation, while the Foreign Affairs Committee requires a majority of subcommittee members to be \"actually present\" to report measures to the full committee. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee allows the chair to direct subcommittees on report formats. Various committees require detailed analyses and documentation from subcommittees, including roll-call votes. The Ways and Means Committee mandates four analyses for reported measures, with a layover period before committee consideration. The Agriculture Committee has a two-day layover requirement that can be waived by the chair or committee majority. The Ways and Means Committee, Armed Services Committee, Natural Resources Committee, Education and the Workforce Committee, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Science, Space, and Technology Committee all have specific layover rules for committee consideration of reported measures or matters. These rules vary in duration and waiver provisions, with some allowing the chair or committee majority to waive the layover requirement. Table 1 compares committee rules in the 114th Congress across the 21 standing House committees on referring measures or matters to subcommittees. Committees are listed in alphabetical order, with key terms describing rules. Checks indicate adopted rules, while empty boxes show no address of the subject. Certain checks are footnoted for additional detail on specific committee rules. In the 114th Congress, Table 1 compares committee rules across 21 standing House committees on referring measures to subcommittees. The table explains headings such as Chair Must/May Refer to Subcommittee, Time Allowed before Referral, Chair May Refer to Subcommittee(s), and Authority to Reassign or Discharge. The authority to reassign or discharge measures or matters within a committee rests with the chair or the majority of the committee. Committees follow rules for scheduling hearings and meetings, notice requirements, document availability, open-meeting rules, and quorum requirements. Committees are prohibited from meeting during joint sessions or recesses with joint meetings in progress. Committees are authorized to meet and hold hearings according to House and individual committee rules. Rule XI, clause 2(m)(1)(A) authorizes committees to meet and hold hearings in the United States, whether the House is in session or has recessed. Rule XI, clause 6 allows business to be carried over to a successive session of Congress. Standing committees must establish regular meeting days not less than monthly. The chair has the authority to cancel or call additional meetings. Committees can hold meetings several times a month and may adopt rules for additional meetings. Committee members, including minorities, can request additional meetings. Committee chairs must designate vice chairs who can preside in their absence. Regular meeting days must be established, and business can be carried over to the next session of Congress. In the absence of a chair and vice chair, the ranking majority member can preside over committee meetings. Table 2 compares committee rules in the 114th Congress, including scheduling and canceling meetings. Committees must establish regular meeting days and can carry over business to the next session. Table 2 compares committee rules in the 114th Congress regarding scheduling and canceling meetings. Committees establish regular meeting days, meeting times, and the authority of the chair to call additional meetings or cancel them. In the 114th Congress, committee rules allow chairs to cancel meetings at their discretion. If a chair hasn't called a meeting, a majority of the committee can request one, and if the chair doesn't act, the majority can order the meeting to occur. Committee rules allow chairs to cancel meetings at their discretion in the 114th Congress. If a majority requests a meeting and the chair doesn't act, the meeting can be ordered to occur. This tactic may be used by the minority to seek action on a measure, but success depends on the chair's party backing. Rule XI, clause 2(c)(1) authorizes committees to schedule \"additional and special\" meetings. Committee rules require advance notice for meetings and hearings. Meetings must be announced at least three days in advance, while hearings require one week notice. Chairs can shorten notice with \"good cause.\" Committee chairs can shorten notice for meetings or hearings with \"good cause\" by obtaining concurrence from the ranking minority member or a majority vote of the committee. Some committees have specific rules for this, including waivers for distributing agendas and alternate schedules. Notices must promptly appear in the Daily Digest of the Congressional Record and be published electronically. Ranking minority members may have a role in the notice process, and emergency meetings can be scheduled at the chair's discretion. Committee chairs have the authority to schedule emergency meetings at their discretion, with input from the ranking minority member. Committees may use electronic notification in addition to written notification for scheduling decisions. Some committees have specific requirements for subcommittees. Committee rules require advance notice for markups, including providing the text of legislation at least 24 hours in advance in electronic form. If a meeting is held sooner, the legislative text must accompany the announcement. Committees may add interpretative provisions to notice requirements. The House Administration, Budget, Appropriations, and Homeland Security Committees have specific rules regarding advance availability of texts for consideration. These rules include provisions for notice requirements, markup text availability, and waivers for certain timeframes. The House Administration, Budget, Appropriations, and Homeland Security Committees have specific rules regarding advance availability of texts for consideration, including markup text availability and submission deadlines for amendments. The Veterans' Affairs, Science, Space, and Technology, and Judiciary Committees also have similar rules in place for markup texts and amendments. The Education and the Workforce Committee, Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Small Business Committee, Agriculture Committee, and Rule XI have rules regarding the submission of amendments and markup texts in advance of meetings. Committees may dispense with the first reading of a measure if printed copies are available. Rules require documents to be distributed before hearings, including witness lists and relevant reports. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and Small Business Committee have similar rules. The Small Business Committee rule requires the chair to provide a memorandum and related reports 48 hours in advance of a hearing. The Agriculture Committee rule also requires a summary of the subject matter to be distributed to committee members before a hearing. Other committees, such as Energy and Commerce, Education and the Workforce, and Homeland Security, have similar rules for distributing information before hearings. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee's rule requires a witness list to be available 48 hours before a hearing. The Financial Services Committee's rule prohibits modifying the witness list less than 24 hours before a hearing without the ranking minority member's concurrence. Defective notice can lead to procedural roadblocks, and committees vary in how they schedule subcommittees' hearings and meetings. Some committees have rules that restrict subcommittees from meeting when the full committee is meeting. Other committees require approval from the full committee chair to schedule subcommittee meetings. Consultation with the committee chair may also be required before scheduling a subcommittee meeting. Some committees have rules that restrict subcommittees from meeting when the full committee is meeting, while others require consultation with the committee chair before scheduling subcommittee meetings. The Agriculture Committee requires consultation with the full committee chair and other subcommittee chairs for field hearings, while the Oversight and Government Reform Committee mandates notification to the full committee chair two weeks in advance of a hearing. The Ethics subcommittee meets at the discretion of its chair. The Education and the Workforce Committee requires subcommittee chairs to consult with various members before scheduling hearings. The Foreign Affairs Committee has specific rules for scheduling hearings, and the Small Business Committee allows overlapping field hearings. All committee and subcommittee meetings must be open to the public, with the option for closed markup sessions. The committee or subcommittee must vote in open session to close a meeting for reasons such as national security, law enforcement information, defamation, or violation of a law or House rule. Only members of the committee and authorized individuals can attend closed executive sessions. The committee rules specify who can attend closed hearings or meetings, with different procedures for various reasons such as defamation. The committee must vote in open session to close a meeting for specific reasons, and only authorized individuals can attend closed executive sessions. The Intelligence Committee allows a vote to close a hearing if testimony may defame, degrade, or incriminate. Briefings are closed to the public, and a member of the minority must be present for a vote to close a hearing. Members cannot be excluded from a hearing unless the House votes to close it. The committee can vote to close hearings for additional days, with three nondebatable motions available. Testimony from executive sessions can only be released by a committee vote. House rules have been amended over the years to increase public access to committee meetings and hearings, with a focus on media access. Rule XI, clause 4 regulates audio and visual coverage, prohibiting the use of recordings for partisan political campaigns. Committees must adopt rules implementing these provisions. House rules have been amended to increase public access to committee meetings and hearings, focusing on media access. Rule XI, clause 4 regulates audio and visual coverage, ensuring meetings are conducted with dignity and decorum. Meetings open to the public must allow audio and visual coverage, with specific guidelines for camera placement and lighting. Media representatives must be accredited for access. Committee quorum rules require a specific number or portion of members present. A point of order can be raised if a committee proceeds without a quorum. Failure to have a majority present may require the committee to reassemble for a vote. Rule XI, clause 2(h)(3) addresses these issues. The quorum for committees to conduct business is set at one-third of members, with some committees requiring a majority for specific actions. Committees may adopt the House rule as their quorum rule, with exceptions for certain committees. The Natural Resources Committee has a procedure for conducting a roll call to ascertain quorum presence. The Ethics, Rules, Veterans' Affairs, and Ways and Means Committees require a majority of members to conduct business. A majority must be \"actually present\" to report a measure or recommendation, close a meeting, release testimony, or issue a subpoena. Most committees follow the House quorum rule of two members for testimony, except the Rules Committee which requires five members for special rules. The quorum requirements for receiving testimony on requests for special rules and measures vary among committees, with some requiring the presence of minority-party members. The Small Business Committee mandates a minority-party member, while the Ways and Means and Foreign Affairs Committees encourage their presence. The Intelligence Committee stipulates that at least one member present must be from the majority party. The Homeland Security Committee requires consultation between majority and minority staff to ensure a quorum that includes at least one Minority Member. Quorums with minimal requirements benefit the majority in committees. Minority participation in hearings promotes comity and can be a tactic for the minority. Committee rules allow for opening statements by members. Committee rules may restrict oral opening statements to the chair and ranking minority member. Some committees allow subcommittee chairs and ranking minority members to make statements at full-committee markups. Equivalency in treatment between majority and minority is typically required for oral opening statements. Other committee members may submit statements by unanimous consent. Committee rules may limit oral opening statements to five minutes or less, with some committees capping total opening statement time. Exceptions exist, such as the Science Committee allowing five minutes for ex officio members. The Education and the Workforce Committee prohibits oral opening statements, but the chair can make an exception. Committee rules may restrict oral opening statements, with exceptions for chairs and ranking minority members. The Natural Resources Committee extends this privilege to the vice chair. The Homeland Security Committee allows chairs, with the ranking minority member's agreement, to permit additional opening statements. Chairs must announce the hearing's subject at the start. Standing committees have the authority to hold necessary hearings. The committee is authorized to hold necessary hearings as per House rules. The chair must announce the subject of the hearing at the beginning. The chair is responsible for maintaining order and decorum during the hearing and can punish breaches by censure or exclusion. The committee may cite individuals for contempt. The chair of a committee or designated member can administer oaths to witnesses as per House rules. A quorum of two members is required to receive testimony. Rules related to witnesses, including presenting testimony in executive session, are discussed. Components of committees' rules in the 114th Congress related to hearings are summarized in Table 3. The curr_chunk provides a detailed explanation of how time allocation for questioning witnesses may be extended and the order of recognition to question witnesses across the 21 standing House committees. It lists the committees in alphabetical order and explains key terms describing committees' rules. Checks in boxes indicate adopted rules, with footnotes offering additional details on specific committee rules. The curr_chunk explains the headings in Table 3 for committee rules, including quorum requirements, minority member attendance, extended time for questioning witnesses, and time limits for questioning. It details the process for obtaining extended time and the roles of the chair and Ranking Minority Member (RMM) in granting additional questioning time. The curr_chunk discusses the rules for questioning witnesses in committee hearings, including equal time division between majority and minority, staff questioning, order of recognition based on seniority or arrival, and consideration of majority to minority ratio when recognizing members for questioning. The Ways and Means Committee has a unique rule that oral and written testimony and statements will be accepted only from U.S. citizens or entities organized under U.S. laws, with exceptions at the chair's discretion. The committee may make exceptions for non-citizens submitting written statements by request of a Member of Congress. Before testifying, the chair introduces the witness and may allow a committee member to do so as well. Witnesses are entitled to a copy of the committee's rules, can have counsel present for advice on constitutional rights, and can submit a written sworn statement for the record. The committee has sole discretion on accepting statements. Witnesses can also request a transcript of their public testimony. The Committee on House Administration regulates spending by committee and Member offices, including reimbursement of travel expenses for witnesses. Reimbursement is considered an \"extraordinary measure\" and requires authorization by the committee chair. Witnesses travel at the government rate when reimbursed by a committee, and transportation expenses to and from the United States may be covered for witnesses residing outside the country. The Committee on Foreign Affairs allows witnesses to present testimony other than in person. The Committee on Foreign Affairs allows witnesses to present testimony other than in person, with rules regarding notification, verification of identity for remote testimony, need for translators, and discretion to withhold witness names. Committees in the 114th Congress require witnesses to submit written testimony in advance and limit oral presentations to a brief summary. Testimony must be submitted 24 or 48 hours in advance, with some committees specifying \"two working days\" or \"two business days.\" The Financial Services Committee mandates electronic format for presenting information. Services require witnesses to submit information in electronic format one business day before a hearing. Committees may waive this requirement with chair approval. Some committees waive rules for less than one week notice. Witnesses must provide copies of advance statements and some require electronic files. Committees aim to distribute advance testimony 24 hours before a hearing. Non-government witnesses must also submit a CV and disclose any federal grants or contracts. Witnesses appearing before committees must submit a curriculum vitae and disclose any federal grants or contracts related to the hearing's subject matter. Failure to comply with submission deadlines could result in denial of the opportunity to testify. The Homeland Security and Ways and Means Committees' rules require advance testimony submission, failure to comply could result in denial of the opportunity to testify. Various committees have rules stating consequences for failure to comply with testimony requirements, such as exclusion of written statements or disallowing oral or written testimony. The Armed Services Committee allows exclusion of testimony with agreement from the ranking minority member. The Foreign Affairs Committee allows witnesses to seek waiver of advance submission of testimony through a written explanation. Witnesses may be excluded if testimony is not timely submitted, unless a majority of the committee votes to accept it. Committee members are given five minutes each to question witnesses, with the option to allocate longer questioning time to a specified number of members. Committees have rules for questioning witnesses, including allowing committee staff to question with extended time. Members can yield time to others for more questions. Witnesses give brief oral statements before questioning. Committees have rules for questioning witnesses, including allowing committee staff to question with extended time. Members can yield time to others for more questions. Witnesses give brief oral statements before questioning, typically five minutes, to summarize their written statements. Most committees follow the House rule of allowing five minutes per member for questioning witnesses, with exceptions for committee leaders like the chair and ranking minority member. Rules on subsequent rounds of questioning and extended times vary among committees. The rules of various committees allow for additional rounds of questioning and extended time for questioning witnesses, with options for consultation with ranking minority members or making decisions by motion. Some committees reference the House rule in their rules. Many committees' rules address the order of recognition for speaking, with some giving precedence to chairs and ranking minority members. Some committees require recognition by seniority or order of arrival, while others alternate recognition between majority and minority members based on their ratio. Some committee rules prioritize speaking order based on seniority or arrival, while others alternate recognition between majority and minority members. Rules in various committees dictate the process for submitting questions for the record within a specific timeframe. The Natural Resources Committee's rule allows the minority to call witnesses of their choice during hearings. Committees typically negotiate to include minority witnesses without the need to invoke this rule. The majority and minority in committees usually cooperate to schedule hearings efficiently. The minority can call witnesses of their choice, and there may be disputes over the classification of administration witnesses. Rule XI, clause 2(g)(2) applies the same requirements to hearings as it does to committee business meetings. Committees' Meetings and Hearings involve a process where testimony that may defame a person is determined to be received in executive session or open session based on a majority vote. The committee must allow witnesses to voluntarily appear. Clause 2(k)(5) requires committees to allow witnesses to voluntarily appear and handle requests for subpoenaing additional witnesses. Testimony received in executive session is protected under clause 2(k)(7) and can only be released to the public by a committee vote. Witnesses can submit written sworn statements for the record at the committee's discretion (clause 2(k)(8)). Committees and subcommittees can issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents under Rule XI, clause 2(m)(1) and (3), with authorization required by a majority present. A quorum of one-third is generally needed unless specified otherwise in the rules. Committees can delegate subpoena authority to their chair under specific rules. Subpoenas must be signed by the chair or a designated member. Enforcement of subpoenas requires House authorization. Meetings to consider subpoenas are held in a markup session. Committees may meet in a markup session to consider subpoenas, where members can offer amendments, make motions, and engage in procedural strategies. The House Office of General Counsel provides standard subpoena forms for committees. Some committees, like Oversight and Government Reform, have experience subpoenaing witnesses and documents. Table 4 compares committee rules in the 114th Congress on subpoena authorization and notification procedures. The headings in Table 4 explain committees' rules on subpoena authorization and notification procedures. A check in a box indicates adoption of a rule, while an empty box means the committee did not address the subject. Footnotes provide additional details on specific committee rules. The list includes information on issuing subpoenas by majority vote, chair's authority to issue subpoenas, and ranking member's role. Committees have discretion in authorizing subpoenas, with the ranking minority member needing to concur or be consulted before issuance. A chair can only issue a subpoena when the House has adjourned for more than three days, and must notify the committee promptly. Committees have legislative and oversight jurisdiction, allowing them to report legislation and conduct oversight on subject matter. Oversight jurisdiction among committees may overlap due to specific legislative enactments or responsibilities for broad subject areas. Rule X assigns oversight responsibilities to standing committees on a continuing basis, allowing them to study laws, agency organization, potential legislation needs, and tax policy impacts within their jurisdiction. Special oversight functions are also assigned to committees for broad subject matter not specifically named in legislative jurisdiction. The House committees have oversight responsibilities for broad subject areas not specifically named in their jurisdictional statements. Thirteen committees are named, with additional functions assigned to four standing committees. For example, the House Administration Committee provides policy direction to the House inspector general and conducts oversight of House officers and services provided by the Architect of the Capitol. The House Administration Committee oversees House officers and services provided by the Architect of the Capitol, accepts gifts on behalf of the House, establishes standards for electronic document availability, and approves settlements by House offices under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. Standing committees study appropriations for federal and District of Columbia programs to ensure consistency with program objectives. The House Administration Committee oversees House officers and services, accepts gifts, establishes standards for electronic document availability, and approves settlements. Committees have authority to conduct investigations, studies, and depositions. The 114th Congress rules package provided deposition authority to specific committees. Rule XI, clause 2(n) directs committees to hold hearings on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in federal programs. The House committees are authorized to conduct oversight on instances of waste, fraud, and mismanagement in federal programs. This includes holding hearings when agency financial statements are disclaimed or when a federal program is identified as high risk by the GAO. Standing committees with more than 20 members must establish oversight subcommittees or conduct oversight through their subcommittees. Each committee must adopt an oversight plan by February 15 of the first session of Congress. The House committees are authorized to conduct oversight on waste, fraud, and mismanagement in federal programs. Oversight plans must be adopted by each committee by February 15 of the first session of Congress and submitted to specific committees. Committees are required to include oversight findings and recommendations in reports on legislation. The House committees are required to file activities reports every two years, detailing legislative and oversight activities. The reports must include oversight plans, actions, recommendations, and hearings held. The House committees must file activities reports every two years, detailing legislative and oversight activities, including oversight plans, actions, recommendations, and hearings held. Rule XI, clause 1(b) outlines procedures for oversight and investigative reports, allowing reports to be considered as read if available for 24 hours, filed jointly if conducted by multiple committees, filed after session adjournment, and filed with the clerk after sine die adjournment. Committees filing reports after the sine die adjournment of a session of Congress must allow committee members seven calendar days to file supplemental views. Committee jurisdiction is determined by Rule X, which lists subject matter within each committee's purview. Rule X was largely based on 19th and early 20th-century precedents and codified in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, with modest revisions in 1974 and 1980. The formal provisions of Rule X, supplemented by precedents and informal agreements, govern the referral of legislation to committees. Once a measure is referred to a committee, it falls within that committee's jurisdiction for legislative action. Amendments to enacted laws are presumed to be within the originating committee's jurisdiction, and comprehensive bills are under the jurisdiction of the reporting committee. The jurisdictional boundaries of committees are defined by formal agreements and careful monitoring to prevent conflicts. Agreements are considered authoritative when approved by the Speaker and relevant committee chairs. Committees seek referrals for measures falling within their jurisdiction and may request the removal of provisions encroaching on their responsibilities. Committees within the House of Representatives seek referrals for measures falling within their jurisdiction and may request the removal of provisions encroaching on their responsibilities. The Speaker refers legislation and other matters to committees based on Rule XII authority, with referrals made almost exclusively by the Speaker. Committees in the House of Representatives have the authority to consider provisions within their jurisdiction, with the Speaker making referrals based on Rule XII authority. Referrals can be made to a primary committee or multiple committees in extraordinary circumstances, with options for sequential referral, split referral, ad hoc committees, and time limits. The Speaker can determine the period for committees to consider provisions within their jurisdiction. This allows for time limits on committees and the ability to discharge them after the primary committee reports. In the 113th Congress, the Speaker referred legislation to the Committees on Foreign Affairs and the Judiciary with a time limitation of June 7, 2013, later extended to June 10. The Committee on the Judiciary reported the measure, while the Committee on Foreign Affairs was discharged. In a similar House referral decision in the 107th Congress, a Select Committee on Homeland Security was created through H.Res. 449, authorizing the Speaker to refer a bill to committees with time limitations, directing them to report recommendations to the select committee for legislation. The select committee was directed to report legislation to the House, with H.R. 5005 introduced by the majority leader on June 24, 2002. House rules govern the introduction and referral of bills, petitions, and communications, with committees operating within the Speaker's decisions. Different procedures are outlined in House rules for considering bills and resolutions, but not all procedures are applicable to committees simultaneously. The House parliamentarian's guidance notes that procedures in the House and Committee of the Whole generally apply to committee markups. These procedures are based on precedent and may include motions like the previous question. Procedures in the House and Committee of the Whole generally apply to committee markups, based on precedent. Committees typically follow these procedures unless unanimous consent to diverge. House rules and precedents on legislative procedures are employed in markups, with some differences in committee procedures. In House committees, procedures similar to those in the House and Committee of the Whole are followed during markups. However, there are some differences, such as the requirement to read sections of a measure before amendments can be offered. In House committees, procedures similar to those in the House and Committee of the Whole are followed during markups. A measure must be read verbatim before committee members offer amendments, which can only be waived by unanimous consent. Members offer amendments to each section of a measure after it has been read. Debate on amendments and the legislative vehicle is conducted under the five-minute rule. The chair in House committees entertains parliamentary inquiries and debates on points of order at their discretion. Discussion on unanimous consent requests is brief but not limited by the five-minute rule. A committee member can move to limit or close debate on a pending section or amendment, specifying when debate should end. The previous question motion stops debate but allows for additional amendments to be offered. A member may move the previous question on pending amendments and all amendments thereto, or on an entire measure after it has been read in full. After disposing of the last amendment, a committee votes on a motion to report the measure with any agreed-upon amendments. A majority of the committee must be present to vote. Additional sections in the report explain committee markups, scheduling, open meetings, closed meetings, media coverage, and quorums. Rule XI authorizes three specific motions for committees: a motion to recess, a motion to waive the first reading of a measure at a markup, and a rule allowing the committee chair to offer a motion in the House. These motions provide the chair with authority to initiate requests for conferences with the Senate. Rule XI authorizes specific motions for committees, including a motion to recess, waive the first reading of a measure at a markup, and allow the committee chair to offer a motion in the House. These motions give the chair the authority to request conferences with the Senate. Rule XXII, clause 1 allows the Speaker to recognize the chair of the primary committee to make motions related to Senate amendments or House amendments, request or agree to a conference, or make points of order. Various other motions and requests can be made in committees to facilitate or impede committee action. Rule XI, clause 1(a)(2) establishes a privileged motion to recess a committee within a 24-hour period, or to recess day to day, which is not debatable. Rule XX, clause 1(b) states that a recorded vote in the House will be taken if requested by one-fifth of a quorum. Committees may not report any measure unless a majority is present, with sixteen committees specifying procedures for recorded votes. Four committees do not have a rule on obtaining a recorded vote. Committees in the House may obtain a recorded vote through various methods, such as requiring a quorum and one-fifth member support, allowing individual roll-call votes, or adopting specific rules. Proxy voting is not allowed in committees, and most committees have rules allowing votes to be postponed for further debate or amendment. Only three committees have not adopted such a rule. Committees in the House can postpone votes for various reasons, such as allowing members to vote on the House floor or clustering votes for convenience. Chairs may strategically postpone votes to gather support or wait for absent members. A quorum must be reestablished when the committee reconvenes after a vote postponement. Committees in the House may strategically use recesses to delay votes, allowing time for absent members to return or for negotiations with sponsors. Rule XI, clause 2(e)(1) mandates keeping records of roll-call votes accessible to Members, staff, and the public.
