    "content": "Over the past decade, global health has become a priority in U.S. foreign policy, with appropriations for health-related efforts more than tripling. The 112th Congress is expected to debate funding levels for global health programs, improve effectiveness, and engage other countries like China and India. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have gained importance in U.S. global health assistance since 2006, with $15 million allocated by Congress and the launch of the NTD Program by President George W. Bush. NTDs are a group of 17 diseases prevalent in 149 countries, primarily affecting the poorest populations in areas with poor sanitation. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are prevalent in 149 countries, primarily in areas with unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and limited health services. The diseases are targeted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners, transmitted by people, vectors, or contaminated sources. NTDs afflict the impoverished and exacerbate poverty, with consequences like unemployment due to lymphatic filariasis and cognitive impairments in children with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) impact cognitive functions, health, nutrition, and school attendance, reducing lifetime earning potential. In 2003, WHO identified neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) as a group of 17 infections that often coexist in individuals. NTDs share three key characteristics and are prevalent in over 100 countries, with some facing multiple endemic disease burdens. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are long-standing health problems primarily affecting the world's poorest populations. They cause chronic conditions with low mortality rates but may lead to long-lasting deformities. Research and development could identify second-line treatments and potential cures for diseases like dengue fever and buruli ulcer. Innovative research is needed for diseases like sleeping sickness to develop safer and more effective medicines. Research and development efforts are focused on finding medicines to replace toxic drugs with complex regimens and severe side effects for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). A framework developed in 2005 emphasizes three key strategies: Preventive Chemotherapy through mass drug administration, vector control, and disease surveillance and care. Over 2 billion people are at risk of NTDs, with more than 1 billion already affected. Over 1 billion people are afflicted with neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), with roughly 534,000 deaths annually. The exact number of NTD infections is uncertain due to issues like lack of healthcare in marginalized communities and hidden symptoms. Weak health systems and poor reporting lead to underestimation, with one NTD case reported for every 40 occurrences. Developing countries' health information systems are inadequate for precise disease data. Developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, lack precise data on disease prevalence. Disease assessments are often based on projections from household surveys rather than medical records. NTD prevalence mapping has improved with increased international investments. By the end of 2009, the burden of the seven most common NTDs was identified in most districts supported by the United States. STH, caused by three parasitic worms, accounts for roughly 80% of the 14 most common NTDs. More than 1 billion people worldwide are afflicted with soil-transmitted helminths (STH), with children being the most vulnerable. NTDs independently cause high levels of illness and worsen the health of those with diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB). Co-infections such as HIV/AIDS and schistosomiasis are associated with higher viral loads, while malaria and STH co-infection lead to higher incidence of anemia. TB and STH co-infection is linked to higher rates of latent TB conversion into active TB. The international community has prioritized combating NTDs, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where co-infections with HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are prevalent. Efforts include raising awareness, implementing public-private partnerships, and engaging over 100 groups in fighting NTDs. Some initiatives target specific neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), with a focus on seven diseases that account for 90% of the global burden. Drugs for these diseases are either donated or sold at low prices, allowing treatment for around 500 million people annually. Proper use of these drugs can help control or eliminate some NTDs. Historically, countries addressed each disease separately in distinct programs. Within the past decade, health experts found that integrating national responses to the seven neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) could improve efficacy and reduce costs. Medicines for these diseases could be safely administered to people co-infected with other NTDs, one drug could treat multiple diseases, and entire communities could be treated once a year without individual diagnosis. Non-health workers could dispense treatments in non-clinical settings, and pooling resources through integrated drug delivery was beneficial for countries. By integrating drug delivery for seven neglected tropical diseases, countries and partners have reduced costs by up to 41% and training costs by 30%. The remaining 10 NTDs must be treated individually, which can be more difficult and costly due to limited access to diagnostic tools and the need for trained health practitioners for administration. Some diseases have no cure and treatments may have significant side effects. The global response to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) involves countries developing national plans with support from donors, WHO, USAID, pharmaceutical companies, NGOs, and academic groups. Collaboration is key in implementing early detection and treatment to prevent irreversible disability or death. The Global Plan to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases, released by WHO in 2007, set goals for global control, elimination, and eradication of NTDs by 2015. Key goals included eliminating or eradicating targeted NTDs, reducing the burden of treatable NTDs, and promoting interventions for costly and difficult-to-treat NTDs. WHO estimated it would cost $1.7 billion to purchase drugs for the seven most common NTDs by October 2010. The Global Plan to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases set goals for global control, elimination, and eradication of NTDs by 2015. Donors had committed to provide most of the funds needed for the Global NTD Plan. WHO estimates an additional $1.2 billion is needed to distribute drugs. The near eradication of guinea worm disease is a success story, with global incidence declining 99% since 1986. Today, guinea worm disease is endemic in only four countries. Prolonged conflict in Sudan has hindered efforts to eradicate guinea worm disease, but health experts are hopeful it could be the first infectious disease to be eradicated since smallpox. Progress has been made in eliminating other NTDs, such as lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, with some countries no longer needing treatment for the diseases. The United States has been a supporter of efforts to control NTDs. The United States has been a key supporter in efforts to control Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in the region since 2007. U.S.-based institutions, including government agencies like USAID, CDC, NIH, and DOD, as well as non-profit organizations and private companies, have been leading global investments in combating NTDs. In 2006, the U.S. government launched the Neglected Tropical Disease Control Program to address a group of NTDs. The Neglected Tropical Disease Control Program was established in 2006 in response to congressional support for integrated responses to NTDs. The program aimed to provide 160 million treatments to 40 million people in 15 countries and received continued funding from President George W. Bush in 2008. In 2008, George W. Bush proposed $350 million for expanding the fight against NTDs to 30 countries. The NTD Program remains important under the Obama Administration's Global Health Initiative, which integrates NTD efforts with other health programs. The Administration plans to integrate malaria and NTD activities and expand drug provision for intestinal worms through USAID-supported programs. The Obama Administration's NTD Program, part of the Global Health Initiative, aims to improve health worldwide by setting ambitious targets for NTD treatment and elimination. By September 2010, over 385 million treatments had been provided through the program in 21 focus countries. The USAID-led NTD Program works with 21 focus countries to support national strategic planning and implementation of NTD programs to improve health systems and build political commitment. USAID provides technical and financial support to help countries achieve national coverage of integrated NTD programs, including disease mapping, securing drug donations, training health workers, and monitoring mass drug administration campaigns. Monitoring and evaluation efforts focus on measuring the impact of NTD programs and integrating them into other global health initiatives. USAID also publishes findings and collaborates with WHO on best practices. USAID partners with WHO to share tools and best practices for NTD control, contributing to global guidelines. Some tools developed by USAID are endorsed by WHO in the \"NTD Rollout Package.\" USAID leverages resources from related USG programs for NTD programs. CDC focuses on controlling and eliminating various NTDs. CDC plays a key role in training health workers, conducting research, supporting mass drug administration, developing global policy, and studying neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). NIH institutes research tools to treat and eradicate NTDs, with Congress funding the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Department of Defense (DOD) are actively involved in research and development of drugs for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). NIAID conducts basic research on NTDs and participates in public-private partnerships for prevention and treatment options. DOD collaborates with the private sector and academia to develop vaccines for diseases like yellow fever, mumps, measles, and polio. The Department of Defense (DOD) is involved in developing vaccines for various diseases such as yellow fever, mumps, measles, and polio. Ongoing efforts include research for vaccines against dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis, conducted in DOD facilities worldwide. Activities focus on developing vaccines and drugs, rapid infection identification, data analysis for control strategies, and evaluating vector control methods. Bipartisan support for global health programs, including addressing Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), has remained strong in Congress. The Congressional Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases Caucus, co-chaired by Representatives Payne and Fortenberry, has shown commitment to addressing these diseases through increased appropriations. Congress has allocated significant funding for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) programs, with $135 million available from FY2006 to FY2010. Funding increased from $15 million in FY2006 to $65 million in FY2010. The President requested $155 million for the NTD Program in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $100 million for NTD efforts in FY2011. Funding for NTD programs was maintained at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011. Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) encompass a group of diseases with varying treatability. While some can be controlled with drugs, others cannot be eliminated through treatment alone. The term has raised awareness about these health challenges but oversimplifies the complexity of the issue. Economic development is seen as the lasting solution to these diseases, which are largely rooted in poverty and poor infrastructure. Industrialized countries have successfully eradicated NTDs by combining drug treatment with improved sanitation, agricultural practices, and water systems. Although investments in NTD treatments have alleviated suffering, over 80% of NTDs cannot be eradicated solely through drug delivery. Countries and partners must continue supporting the treatment of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths to control NTDs. USAID is considering the cost-efficiency of programs, with NTD control being one of the least expensive health interventions. It costs less than $2 annually to treat each person for the seven most common NTDs. In FY2010, global HIV/AIDS programs and U.S. contributions to the Global Fund accounted for roughly 70% of all U.S. global health spending, while U.S. support for NTDs amounted to less than 1% of the total global health budget. HIV treatments are more expensive than treatments for the seven most common NTDs, but both illnesses impact affected populations' ability to live productive lives. Key debates related to NTD control include defining NTDs and evaluating reliance on MDA campaigns. There is no consensus on which diseases should be considered NTDs, leading to skewed investments and analysis. While MDA campaigns have reduced disease prevalence, limitations such as the need for continued treatment plans, potential resistance, and incomplete interruption of transmission cycles exist. Integrating development and health efforts is crucial in addressing these challenges. Integrating development projects with health efforts can either worsen or improve NTD infection rates. Concerns exist regarding the adequacy of research and development for NTD-related vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tools, including issues with treatment toxicity, lack of field-ready diagnostics, vaccine shortages, and drug resistance. Some health experts disagree on which diseases should be included in the list of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). In the 111th Congress, members urged funding for research on leishmaniasis, Human African trypanosomiasis, and Chagas disease. Supporters of expanding the definition highlight the threat these diseases pose, while some argue against it fearing it may diminish support for countering NTDs. Advocates of a concentrated approach argue that focusing on the seven most common NTDs, which are the least expensive to treat, could help build momentum in global health efforts. USAID leads U.S. efforts to combat NTDs, with other agencies also involved. Congress has not specified which neglected diseases the United States should address, but could define NTDs through legislation if desired. To combat neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), legislation similar to the Lantos-Hyde Act could define NTDs and authorize strategies. Mass drug administration is key in NTD programs, breaking transmission cycles in endemic areas. Aggressive campaigns in Latin America have reduced lymphatic filariasis burden, with transmission interrupted in some countries. Merck, Inc. reports success in interrupting onchocerciasis in certain areas. Mass drug administration (MDA) has interrupted disease transmission in one-third of previously affected areas and eliminated the disease in Colombia. Debate surrounds the reliance on MDA, with concerns about diverting investments from long-term solutions like water and sanitation projects. Prolonged use of MDA for diseases like soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis may lead to drug resistance, but some experts argue for its continued use due to its success in eliminating some NTDs. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been effective in eliminating some neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), but concerns remain about its sustainability and ability to break the transmission cycle of diseases like soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis. The current approach does not support strategies like vector management or improved water supply, which are crucial for interrupting disease transmission. Sustained MDA campaigns are necessary until parasites are eliminated from the environment. In Mali, a 10-year MDA campaign reduced schistosomiasis prevalence, but the government struggled to maintain drug delivery and reduce exposure to contaminated water. After a decade of inconsistent MDA, prevalence rates rebounded. In 2004, donors supported a new integrated treatment campaign focusing on multiple NTDs and consolidating health management resources. The Mali case raises questions about the sustainability of MDA programs and the debate on donor investment in health systems. Some urge donors to channel health assistance through local governments. An official from the Ugandan Ministry of Health suggests fully funding the NTD Program through the national health ministry to ensure sustainability. One study evaluating the U.S. NTD Program contradicts the Ugandan official's assertion, highlighting health system strengthening as integral to U.S. support. Resources were used to train over 220,000 community-based health workers and drug distributors, empowering them to treat NTDs within their populations. The Obama Administration has shown efforts to enhance country ownership of global health programs. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator advocates for country ownership in HIV/AIDS programs funded through PEPFAR. In Nigeria, the government commits to funding half of the program by 2015. Key components of the NTD Program include measuring recipient country contributions, developing funding plans, and requiring commitments to sustain NTD control. USAID requires participating countries to ensure duty-free import of NTD drugs and dedicate staff to manage the programs. The Partnership Framework aims to strengthen health systems in NTD focus countries by promoting country ownership, clear strategies, defined roles, alignment with national health plans, and investment in the national health system. Experts emphasize the need to strengthen recipient countries' health systems for sustained NTD programs supported by donors. One consortium of aid organizations recommends that donors allocate 15% of their budgets for specific diseases to health system strengthening. The 112th Congress could consider legislation similar to the Global HEALTH Act, which emphasizes country ownership and coordinated global health assistance. Some argue that concerns about recipient countries' capacity to sustain NTD programs are unfounded. Some argue that concerns about recipient countries' capacity to sustain NTD programs are unfounded. Donors support plans developed by endemic countries, which have already allocated resources to combat diseases. Community-based NTD treatment programs pose little burden on health systems and reach remote areas, increasing awareness and demand for health services. Budgets for treating common NTDs can decrease as diseases are eliminated. NTDs, accounting for 80% of the disease burden, are linked to poverty. Development projects like agricultural irrigation can help prevent these diseases, but without proper health assessments, they can also create breeding grounds for disease-carrying vectors like mosquitoes. In Tanzania, poorly maintained sanitation projects have been identified as mosquito breeding grounds. Development projects can inadvertently spread diseases like malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and schistosomiasis due to poorly maintained sanitation and dam projects. Reliable data on disease prevalence is crucial for effective planning and implementation of health initiatives. Collaboration between development experts and health practitioners can help prevent the spread of diseases during large-scale projects and improve disease monitoring and response efforts. Integrated vector management (IVM) is a key approach in combating diseases across sectors like health, agriculture, water, construction, and waste disposal. WHO emphasizes an intersectoral approach to controlling NTDs, focusing on MDA, case-management, vector control, safe water, sanitation, and veterinary public health. Successful elimination of NTDs in countries like the United States has involved an IVM approach, particularly in water and sanitation. CDC experts highlight the importance of water and sanitation improvements in controlling NTDs, with estimates showing that better sanitation and water safety can reduce schistosomiasis prevalence rates. Improved sanitation and water safety can significantly reduce the prevalence rates of schistosomiasis and blinding trachoma. China is planning to launch a comprehensive NTD control program in sub-Saharan Africa, modeled after its successful schistosomiasis control methods. This program includes supporting the construction of latrines, converting human and animal waste into biofuel, and providing tractors to minimize contact with snail-infested water during farming. Successful intersectoral approaches have involved collaboration among health and agricultural sectors in controlling NTDs. Collaboration among health and agricultural sectors in Asia to control malaria, Japanese encephalitis, and reduce soil-transmitted helminths in Korea, as well as eliminate Chagas in Argentina. USAID identified cost-efficiencies in improving health information systems for NTD Program implementation, addressing inefficiencies in drug distribution based on prevalence data and WHO guidelines. In the third year, USAID improved drug management and forecasting processes, leading to fewer drug procurements. Integrating NTD programs with other health programs could enhance cost-efficiencies. Community networks distributing NTD drugs could also provide bednets and treatments for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The Lantos-Hyde United States Government Malaria Strategy plans to integrate malaria and NTD activities, but details are lacking. Improved integration of NTD activities into projects funded through the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act may offer further opportunities. The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act (P.L. 109-121) could enhance NTD control by developing strategies for improving water and sanitation worldwide. The act may provide opportunities for sharing resources through the Millennium Challenge Corporation for water and sanitation programs. U.S. aid agencies operating in the same country have used different implementing partners and consulted with different stakeholders for projects. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged duplication in some areas of U.S. health aid but stated that the Global Health Initiative (GHI) aims to address this challenge. USAID defended U.S.-supported NTD programs, stating they support national NTD plans. Ambassadors in recipient countries could ensure that USG agencies align their activities for joint working agreements, as endorsed in the 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The Global Health Initiative aims to address challenges in U.S. health aid, including duplication. USAID supports national NTD plans, with Ambassadors ensuring alignment of activities as endorsed in the 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The complexity of NTDs varies, with some diseases nearly eliminated through inexpensive drugs and massive treatment programs. Endemic areas require ongoing treatment and public health measures to control NTDs effectively. Several health advocates call for greater investments in R&D in four key areas: Drug and vaccine development. Donor funding has led to an unprecedented capacity to treat NTDs, but concerns about drug resistance and prudence in drug administration persist. Experts emphasize the need for developing vaccines to prevent NTDs and creating innovative treatments for diseases with no cure or toxic drugs. Innovative treatments for diseases without a cure or toxic drugs are essential. Vector control is crucial for NTDs without vaccines, but faces challenges like pesticide resistance. Diagnostic tools are necessary for disease monitoring and surveillance, especially in low-resource settings. Some epidemiologists are concerned about low-resource settings lacking diagnostic tools and trained health practitioners for disease surveillance. Health experts suggest considering factors affecting drug efficacy, like co-application of traditional remedies. Research shows TB vaccine is less effective in people with schistosomiasis, and co-infected individuals may experience serious side effects from certain treatments. Observers are calling for more research and development in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, to address issues related to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Weak medicine regulatory authorities in some developing countries need access to better resources to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs. High-income countries have better systems in place to monitor adverse drug reactions compared to low-income countries. According to a study by the George Institute for International Health, the US is the largest funder of research for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), accounting for 41% of all funding in FY2008. High-income countries may not have sufficient data for comprehensive risk-benefit assessments when approving drugs for poorer countries. Regulatory authorities in low-income countries heavily rely on those in high-income countries for evaluating medicines. The US is the largest funder of research for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), accounting for 41% of all funding in FY2008. Contributions by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation increase total US support for R&D for NTDs to 62% of all spending. NTD activists call for greater investments in research, as HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria received 72% of funds in 2008. Some analysts believe that investments in these diseases outpace spending on other NTDs due to high-income countries being affected by HIV/AIDS and TB. The US government supports higher spending on global health R&D, including NTDs. Members of Congress have called on USAID to develop a funding strategy for NTD research. The Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2010 directed the FDA to establish internal review groups for rare and neglected diseases. In response, the FDA established the Rare Disease Review Group and the Neglected Disease Review Group. The Neglected Disease Review Group held a public hearing to gather ideas on tackling neglected diseases. The FDA indicated a need for additional resources and expertise in neglected diseases, with Congress authorizing market incentives for research and development in this area. Despite market incentives authorized by Congress, few innovative products for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) have been developed. Only two NTD products were approved by the FDA between 1983 and 2008. Experts argue that existing NTD products have limited value due to inappropriate formulation and pricing for developing countries. Major pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to invest in NTD research due to low profit margins. Some advocates propose enhancing R&D capacity in developing countries and supporting public-private partnerships for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). Innovative partnerships with experts from endemic areas have developed cost-effective tools for field use. Calls are made for increased U.S. funding for programs like the Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DND i). U.S. contributions to these programs in 2008-2009 were 6% to TDR and 0.9% to DND i. In addition to calls for greater U.S. support for NTD-related R&D, supporters urge the 112th Congress to consider enacting legislation similar to a bill introduced in the 111th Congress called the 21st Century Global Health Technology Act, which would have authorized $5 million annually from 2010 through 2014 to improve laboratory capabilities in developing countries. Other recommendations include aligning U.S. regulatory guidelines with WHO, encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop patent pools, and applying U.S. regulatory expertise to review novel NTD products produced outside the United States. The review focuses on novel NTD products produced outside the United States, highlighting the vulnerability of industrialized countries like the United States to neglected tropical diseases. Concerns arise from the spread of dengue fever in Key West, FL, with no vaccine or treatment available. Mosquitoes capable of spreading the disease are gradually spreading across the country, posing a significant health risk. Access to trained health practitioners can significantly reduce the mortality rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) from 20% to about 1%. Mosquitoes spreading dengue are now present in the southeastern United States, along the eastern seaboard up to southern New England, and around areas bordering the Mississippi River up to Chicago. Cases of Chagas disease have also emerged in the continental United States, with some experts believing that it remains undiagnosed and could be a hidden cause of heart disease and stroke. Travelers from industrialized countries are increasingly contracting neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis. Industrialized countries are facing an increase in neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis due to eco-tourism. Improving global health and countering NTDs is beneficial for both recipient and donor countries. The United States could benefit from research and development of tools to detect and treat NTDs, as well as improve its capacity to respond to tropical diseases within its borders. The 112th Congress may consider a bill similar to one passed in the 111th Congress to address the epidemiology and funding needed to combat NTDs. The report to Congress focuses on neglected diseases of poverty like Chagas and soil-transmitted helminths. The U.S. faces challenges in addressing NTDs due to factors like conflict and global urbanization. Population shifts from rural to urban areas could lead to increased NTD outbreaks in urban areas, especially in slums with limited access to clean water and health services. Donor support for NTD-related resolutions is lacking, with few pledging sufficient resources. At the 2008 G8 summit, members committed to reaching at least 75% of people infected with NTDs, with countries like Britain and the United States pledging significant funds to combat NTDs. In May 2010, the Netherlands pledged \u20ac70 million for medicines and vaccines against NTDs. Calls for countries like Brazil, China, and India to contribute more to the global fight against NTDs. One study suggests that if these countries took full control over their NTD efforts, the global disease burden could be reduced by 20%. Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa are emerging in addressing global health challenges. One expert urges the Organization of Islamic Conference to support the Global NTD Plan due to member countries like Bangladesh, Chad, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Indonesia, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen facing NTDs. Concern is raised about limited expertise in addressing NTDs, especially in vector control, case-management, pesticide management, and veterinary health. WHO recommends strengthening veterinary capacity to tackle NTDs effectively. The United States would need to make tough decisions on funding health and development efforts based on the cost effectiveness of health programs. Factors like mortality rates, disease prevalence, and contagiousness would need to be considered. Questions arise on how to address diseases that countries may not prioritize but could easily spread, and whether assistance should be based on a country's ability to fund a national response or their portion of the global disease burden. For NTDs, challenges arise in graduating from U.S. health assistance if treatment alone cannot eliminate diseases causing a significant burden. Experts are debating the best approach to reevaluating U.S. foreign assistance programs, particularly in terms of funding for health issues like HIV/AIDS and NTDs. Glossary terms include anemia, chemotherapy, coverage, and disability-adjusted life years. Disease burden is the amount of ill health in a population, while disease mapping displays the spatial distribution of cases. Elimination aims to control a communicable disease by reducing transmission, endemic refers to a constant presence of a disease, and eradication involves ending all transmission of an infectious disease agent. Integrated Vector Management is a decision-making process for managing vector populations to reduce transmission of vector-borne diseases. Mass drug administration involves delivering preventive or therapeutic regimens to a population. Mass drug administration is the delivery of preventive or therapeutic regimens to the entire population or selected portions. Morbidity refers to sickness, while mortality measures the proportion of people who have died from a specific cause within a certain time period. Pathogens are organisms that cause disease, and prevalence is the total number of designated conditions present in a population at a point in time. Reservoir of infection refers to human or animal hosts of infectious pathogens. Over the past two decades, various groups have worked to increase access to treatment for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in high-burdened countries. These efforts range from providing treatment for specific NTDs to regional elimination programs. Various groups have worked to increase access to treatment for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in high-burdened countries through regional elimination efforts. Partnerships focus on drug procurement, advocacy, and R&D for new drugs. Prominent examples include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which targets specific NTDs and provided over $717 million for projects between 1998 and 2009, and the Carter Center, which focuses on six diseases. The Carter Center focuses on six diseases: dracunculiasis (guinea worm), onchocerciasis (river blindness), trachoma, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and malaria. Efforts by the Carter Center have led to a 99% reduction in global guinea worm incidence since 1986. Children Without Worms, a partnership between Johnson & Johnson and The Task Force for Global Health, works to reduce soil-transmitted helminth infections in children from eight countries. They distribute medendazole based on local population needs. The Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) was launched in 2003 to develop new treatments for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) like sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease. DNDi aims to deliver six to eight new treatments by 2014. The Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases, established in 2006, advocates for controlling and reducing the burden of NTDs globally. The Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases aims to raise awareness and support for NTDs through advocacy, resource mobilization, and global coordination efforts. The International Vaccine Institute focuses on developing vaccines for diseases affecting developing countries, with support from various partners including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Infectious Diseases Research Institute (IDRI) in Seattle focuses on developing treatments for diseases like leishmaniasis, TB, malaria, leprosy, and Chagas. The Institute for One World Health is a non-profit organization working on new medicines for infectious diseases common in poorer countries, including leishmaniasis, diarrheal diseases, malaria, Chagas, and soil-transmitted diseases. The pharmaceutical industry, including companies like Bayer HealthCare, GlaxoSmithKline, and Merck, plays a crucial role in global initiatives against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Merck's Mectizan Donation Program, launched in 1987, has donated over 2.5 billion tablets to treat onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, benefiting millions in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. The Sabin Vaccine Institute is a non-profit organization focused on developing vaccines against infectious and neglected tropical diseases. They also support technology transfer to less developed countries. The Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) was established to support the development of new tools to fight tropical diseases and strengthen research capacity in affected developing countries. The TDR aims to eliminate four NTDS globally and visceral leishmaniasis in Latin America. Donor contributions have increased over the past decade, with the United States being a key donor, although its contributions have declined."
