The curr_chunk defines terms related to registered owners, registrants, secured areas, security agreements, services, and violent acts. The curr_chunk amends Section 7504 of the Business and Professions Code, stating that an applicant for a qualification certificate must be at least 18 years old. To qualify for a certificate, an applicant must be at least 18 years old and have two years of lawful experience in recovering collateral within the state, consisting of 4,000 hours of work. Lawful experience includes skip tracing or actual collateral recovery as a registrant or employee of a financial institution or vehicle dealer. An applicant must provide written certifications from employers, licensees, financial institutions, or vehicle dealers to verify their qualifying experience. If unable to obtain these certifications, other written certifications from individuals can be submitted for consideration. All certifications must affirm the truthfulness and completeness of the information provided. Failure to provide truthful certifications is a misdemeanor offense. To apply for a qualified certificate, complete the application form, submit two photos, fingerprints, pass an exam, and pay the required fees. Personal information of applicants is kept confidential. Upon issuance of a qualification certificate, the bureau will provide a pocket ID card with a photo of the holder and the licensee's name. The application form warns that false information may lead to denial or revocation of the certificate. A repossession agency must maintain records of all transactions, including assignment or repossession order forms, vehicle reports, vehicle condition reports, personal effects inventory, notice of seizure, and sale records. These records, including bank statements, must be kept for at least four years and made available for bureau inspection. Storage areas for collateral and personal effects must also be accessible for bureau inspection. Storage areas must be accessible for inspection by the bureau upon demand. An assignment or repossession order form can be in various formats. Section 7507.13 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to state that a licensed repossession agency is not liable for the actions of others in assigning or accepting repossession orders, and is entitled to indemnity for any losses incurred. This does not limit the liability of individuals for their own wrongful actions. The legal owner, debt collector, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, or registered owner, or their agent, are not liable for actions of a licensed repossession agency in carrying out an assignment or repossession order. They are entitled to indemnity for any losses incurred, including court costs and attorney's fees. This does not limit liability for tortious conduct. The legal owner, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, or registered owner, or their agent, is not in violation of Section 7502.1 or 7502.2 if they possess the repossessor's current license and qualified manager's certificate at the time of assignment or repossession order, and have no knowledge of any suspension or revocation of the license or certificate. A licensed repossession agency or any related party cannot instruct others to violate laws regarding collateral recovery. The agency must provide certain legal owners with specific sections of the law annually. The act does not require reimbursement as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, as outlined in the California Constitution."
