    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Therapy Act of 2017\". The \"Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Therapy Act of 2017\" emphasizes the importance of intensive medical rehabilitation in inpatient facilities for Medicare beneficiaries to achieve health, function, independence, and quality of life. Medicare uses an \"intensity of therapy\" requirement, including the \"Three Hour Rule,\" to determine eligibility for treatment in these facilities. Before 2010, CMS regulations allowed various therapies to count towards the Three Hour Rule for inpatient rehabilitation, including recreational therapy if deemed necessary on a priority basis by the physician and rehabilitation team. CMS revised regulations in 2010, limiting the Three Hour Rule to only include physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as orthotics and prosthetics. This change removed the discretion of the physician and rehabilitation team to count other therapeutic services towards the rule, leading to a lack of access to recreational therapy for patients who need it as part of their care plan. Recreational therapy in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals is provided by qualified therapists as part of a patient's care plan to restore functioning and independence. The purpose of this Act is to rely on the professional judgment of the treating physician and rehabilitation team for Medicare patients to access intensive therapy in these settings. The patient needs to be in the hospital or unit to access necessary rehabilitation services like physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, orthotics, prosthetics, and recreational therapy. SEC. 3. Recreational therapy is now included as part of intensive rehabilitation therapy programs in determining medical necessity at inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Recreational therapy is added to intensive rehabilitation programs at inpatient facilities to determine medical necessity, effective January 1, 2018."
