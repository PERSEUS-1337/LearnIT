    "content": "The report examines the cash income and poverty status of families with children, focusing on the role parents play in supporting their families through work and the negative consequences of poverty on a child's development. The report focuses on the adequacy of parental earnings in supporting families with children. It addresses questions about the economic well-being of American families, including the prevalence of poverty despite parental work, the need for multiple family members to work for income security, and the vulnerability of families to economic shocks. The report examines parents' wages relative to poverty, factors affecting wages, and job attachment to earnings adequacy for families with children. It highlights vulnerable families based on parents' earnings and discusses relevant public policies and government programs. Data is primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey for 2005. The report analyzes parents' wages in relation to poverty, focusing on factors influencing wages and job attachment for families with children. It identifies vulnerable families based on earnings and discusses relevant public policies. Data is primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey for 2005. The CPS cannot address questions regarding compensation beyond earnings, such as sick and family leave, or other benefits like health and retirement benefits. Key findings include 6.8 million families with children living in poverty in 2004, and 14.4 million families qualifying as low-income. Many parents work low-wage jobs, with 13% earning below-poverty income and 45% earning low incomes in 2004. In 2004, a significant number of parents worked low-wage jobs, with many earning incomes below 200% of the poverty threshold. For married-couple families with children, it often required both parents to earn a modest income. Single-parent families, especially mother-only households, faced poverty or near-poverty due to low earnings. The economy's division of labor led to some parents working in occupations with relatively low wages, such as \"cashiers.\" In March 2005, 1.2 million parents worked as \"cashiers,\" earning a median wage of $8.00 an hour, which is below the poverty threshold for a family of three. Factors influencing parents' earnings include educational attainment and age, with older workers earning more due to experience. Younger parents in their 20s and early 30s typically earn less. The definition of families differs in this report compared to the Census Bureau's measures. The Census Bureau defines a family as all persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption living in the same household. This report uses a more restrictive definition, focusing on married couples or single parents with at least one child under 18. The report focuses on defining family units as nuclear families, which may differ from the Census Bureau's definition in complex households. The analysis compares family income to poverty thresholds, with a specific emphasis on parents' earned income. The analysis focuses on nuclear family income compared to Census Bureau poverty thresholds, excluding extended family members' income. In this report, income to poverty ratios are calculated by dividing family earnings by the poverty threshold. Families with income below certain multiples of the poverty line are labeled as \"near poor,\" \"economically fragile,\" or \"low-income.\" These labels are for narrative purposes and not official government designations. The report focuses on married-couple families and families headed by lone mothers. The report primarily focuses on married-couple families and families headed by lone mothers, with limited discussion of lone-father families due to their small numbers. Data for all three family types are presented in Appendix B. In 2004, an estimated 6.8 million families with children were poor, accounting for 17.1% of nuclear families. There were approximately 39.7 million nuclear family units with children in 2004, with 80% living in independent households. Taking other family members into account reduces the number of poor families with children. In 2004, an estimated 6.8 million families with children were poor, accounting for 17.1% of nuclear families. Taking other family members into account reduces the number of poor families with children to 5.9 million, with a poverty rate of 14.9%. Figure 1 illustrates families with children by their incomes relative to the poverty line, showing the percentage of families below specified income levels. In 2004, over two-fifths of families with children headed by a single mother were poor, while only 7.1% of families with children headed by a married couple were poor. More than two-thirds of single mother families had incomes below twice the poverty line, compared to just over one-fifth of married-couple families. Married couples with children also contribute to the number of poor and low-income families. In 2004, 27.8% of poor families with children were headed by a married couple, while 41.8% of low-income families with children were headed by married couples. About 22.5% of married-couple families with children were low-income. Earnings are crucial for supporting families, with 92% of families with children having at least one parent earning income. Married-couple families may have one breadwinner or both parents working to improve their economic status, while single parents face tougher choices between work and family obligations. When comparing family income and poverty, single parents face difficult choices between work and family obligations. The assessment includes primary earner's earnings, second parent's earnings if present, all sources of cash income in the nuclear family, and extended family members' income and needs. Earnings alone do not account for other forms of income. In 2004, over half of families with children headed by a single mother would have been poor based on her earnings alone, highlighting the importance of other income sources like alimony and child support in lifting families out of poverty. In 2004, over half of families with children headed by a single mother would have been poor based on her earnings alone. Other income sources, such as alimony, child support, social insurance payments, and government cash assistance, reduce the poverty rate of these families to 41.8%. Lone-mother families often live with extended family members, which affects their poverty rate. Single mothers struggle to provide a basic level of income security due to low wages and limited work hours. When considering only full-time, full-year working single mothers, a significant percentage are unable to attain a standard of living above poverty or near-poverty. Single mothers face challenges in achieving a modest earnings-based level of income security above twice the poverty line. Limited time for in-home production and the need for childcare make it difficult for them to work more. Among married-couple families with children, the poverty rate based on the earnings of the primary earner alone is estimated at 12.9%. Among married-couple families with children, the poverty rate falls to 6.9% when considering all family income sources, including earnings from a second working parent. Adding the second parent's earnings reduces the percentage of low-income married couple families with children from 40% to 27%. This highlights the importance of both parents working to achieve a higher family income standard. In 2004, 9% of primary earners in married-couple families with children working full-time were unable to provide above poverty level, 15% couldn't reach near poverty level, and 36% couldn't attain a modest income security above twice the poverty line. The decision for both parents to work is influenced by factors like earnings potential, career ambitions, child care costs, and income security. In 2004, the ability of a worker to support a family is influenced by factors such as earnings potential, career ambitions, child care costs, and other work-related expenses. The poverty income cutoffs vary based on family size and composition, with full-time work not always sufficient to support a family above the poverty line or secure a modest standard of living. Table 1 displays poverty income thresholds and hourly wage rates for families of different sizes and types in 2004. For example, a four-person family had a higher poverty income threshold ($19,157) compared to a three-person family ($15,205). In 2004, poverty income thresholds and hourly wage rates for families of different sizes were displayed in Table 1. For a four-person family, a single earner would need to earn $9.21 per hour to support the family at a poverty-line income. For a three-person family, the parent would need to earn $7.31 per hour, and a single parent with one child would need to earn about $6.26 per hour to reach the poverty line. Full-time work at the federal minimum wage of $5.15 per hour would not be enough to support a family. A full-year work of one parent at the federal minimum wage of $5.15 per hour is insufficient to bring a family's income up to the poverty line under any family configuration. For a married-couple family with one child, it takes one parent earning above $14.62 per hour to support the family at twice the poverty line. In many families, both parents must work to achieve a modest level of income security above twice the poverty line. Employers determine wages based on workers' productivity, not the size of their families. Workers' wages are determined by their productivity, which is based on their skills and abilities. Employers pay wages based on the demand for specific skills and the scarcity of those skills in the labor force. Educational attainment and work experience are key factors in determining a worker's market value. In this section, the effects of educational attainment on parents' wages and family poverty status are examined based on the highest education credential attained. Wage rates vary due to factors like race, ethnicity, and gender, with African-Americans, Hispanics, and women often earning less. Studies analyze wage differentials attributed to measurable factors like education and work experience, as well as potential discrimination. The distribution of hourly earnings for working parents by educational attainment shows higher wage rates for those with more education. The lines in Figure 4 indicate that wages increase with higher levels of education, with greater variability in returns at higher levels. In 2004, the median wage rate for parents with less than a high school diploma was $9.62 per hour. The median hourly wage rates for working parents vary based on educational attainment, with higher levels of education generally leading to higher wages. However, this does not always translate into higher earnings, as seen in the distribution of hourly earnings at each education level. For example, a family with one earner and one child can have a standard of living equal to 175% of poverty with a high school diploma, and 200% of poverty with some college but no degree. Some workers with lower educational attainment earn more than those with a college degree. For instance, 20% of parents with less than a high school diploma earn $15.38 per hour or more, while 20% of those with a bachelor's degree earn $13.33 per hour or less. This disparity in wages affects the ability to support a family, with top earners with less education able to support a family at a higher income level compared to lower earners with a bachelor's degree. Parents' potential earnings are compared to the poverty threshold for a three-person family. The estimates assume full-time full-year work and exclude parents who did not work during the year. Standards of living relative to poverty would be lower for parents working less or supporting larger families. Parents' potential earnings are compared to the poverty threshold for a three-person family. As workers' educational attainment increases, so do their wage rates and their ability to support a family. Younger workers tend to have lower wages than older workers. Younger workers typically earn lower wages than older workers due to less job experience. Older parents tend to have higher earnings than younger parents, with wage dispersion increasing with age. In 2004, the median hourly earnings of very young married-couple families were $11.06, with 10% earning below $6.11 and 10% earning above $18.68. Parents age 45 to 49 as primary earners had a median hourly earnings of $24.04, with 10% earning $10.68 or less. Younger parents earned more per hour than the bottom 10% of older parents. Lone mothers had similar earnings patterns to primary earners in married-couple families, with lower earnings for younger mothers. Hourly earnings for younger lone mothers are lower compared to older lone mothers. Median hourly earnings for lone mothers are much lower than primary earners in married-couple families. For example, lone mothers under 25 earn $7.69 compared to $11.06 for primary earners of similar age in married-couple families. For parents aged 45 to 49, lone mothers earn $13.94, only 58% of primary earners in married-couple families who earn $24.04. Single mothers' earnings are significantly lower than primary earners in married-couple families. In married-couple families with children, the husband is usually the primary earner. Among parents of different ages, a significant percentage have wages that are too low to support a family of three above the poverty line, especially for young parents. Only about half of parents aged 30 to 34 have wages that would provide a family of three with an income above twice the poverty line. Families headed by young parents are particularly economically vulnerable. Young parents face economic vulnerability due to lower wage rates and limited job experience. Their children's care needs may hinder their ability to work outside the home, impacting future wage possibilities. Additionally, younger parents lack job security and are at a higher risk of being laid off during economic downturns. Figures 9 and 10 show family income relative to poverty for married-couple and mother-only families by parents' age. In 2004, poverty rates varied among married-couple and single-mother families based on parents' age. Younger parents faced higher poverty rates, with over one-fifth of married-couples under 25 being poor. Single-mother families had even higher poverty rates, with over seven-in-ten of those under 25 living in poverty. In 2004, poverty rates varied among married-couple and single-mother families based on parents' age. Younger parents faced higher poverty rates, with over one-fifth of married-couples under 25 being poor. Single-mother families had even higher poverty rates, with over seven-in-ten of those under 25 living in poverty. For mothers aged 25 to 29, half were poor. The characteristics of individuals and their jobs affect wage rates, with some occupations paying wages insufficient to support a benchmark family of three. Adam Smith discussed the division of labor and wage differences among jobs in Wealth of Nations. Employers set wage rates based on job requirements and other attributes to attract workers. Table 2 lists occupations employing over 500,000 parents in March 2005 that paid less than $14.62 per hour. In March 2005, occupations employing over 500,000 parents paid wages below $14.62 per hour. The lowest median hourly wage was for waiters and waitresses at $7.75 per hour. Other occupations like cashiers, cooks, maids, and child care workers also paid wages just above the poverty threshold for a benchmark family of three. In March 2005, occupations employing over 500,000 parents paid wages just above the poverty threshold. Teacher assistants, nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides, and janitors and building cleaners were among the occupational groups that paid wages producing annual incomes between 125% and 200% of the poverty level for full-time workers. In March 2005, some parents in certain occupations earned wages just above the poverty threshold. For example, the median hourly wage for parents who were cooks was $8.20, enough to be above the poverty line for a benchmark family. However, 37% of all parents who worked as cooks earned wages below the poverty line, even if they worked full-time. More than 90% of parents who were cooks earned wages below 200% of the poverty line for a family of three. The amount of work done during the year, including number of hours and weeks actually worked, determines annual earnings. Many parents work less than full-time, year-round due to unemployment, seeking employment, or choosing to work part-time. Parental work decisions are based on balancing income from work with the value of leisure and home production. The decision to participate in the labor force involves weighing income from work against the value of leisure and home production, including childcare. Work schedules may not always accommodate parents' needs. In 2004, married-couple families with children varied in annual hours worked, from no work to full-time employment. In 2004, married-couple families with children had varying levels of work attachment, ranging from no job to full-time employment. The data shows that 80.5% of married fathers were fully engaged in the workforce, while 35% of married mothers were fully engaged. About 7-in-10 mothers worked at some point during the year, with 29.2% having no job attachment. The most common scenario was when both parents worked full-time. The data from 2004 shows that the most common scenario for married-couple families with children is when both parents work full-time. Single mothers are more likely to work full-time year-round compared to married mothers. Despite the increase in women's labor force participation, job attachment patterns between married fathers and mothers (both married and single) remain different. In 2004, most families with children had one working parent. Economic status depends on the amount of work parents engage in. Working full-time for 50 weeks or more was linked to lower poverty and higher earnings. In 2004, most families with children had one working parent, with economic status depending on the amount of work parents engage in. Working full-time for 50 weeks or more was associated with lower poverty and higher earnings, especially among married-couple families. In 2004, the economic status of families with children depended on the parents' work engagement. For married-couple families, having one or both parents fully engaged in the workforce affected their poverty status. Nearly half of earnings-poor married-couple families had no parent fully working, while affluent families often had both parents working full-time. Single mothers' work status differed from married couples in 2004. In 2004, single mothers still faced challenges in workforce participation despite increases in the mid-1990s. Over 40% of earnings-poor single mothers did not work, hindering their ability to escape poverty. Even with full-time, full-year work, many single mothers struggled to achieve a modest standard of living. Two-thirds of near-poor lone-mother families had a single mother working full-time, year-round. In 2004, single mothers faced challenges in workforce participation. Despite working full-time year-round, many struggled to achieve a modest standard of living. Nearly half of lone mothers worked full-time, but a significant portion still fell below poverty thresholds. The ability to support a family was closely related to parents' education and age. Single parents, especially single mothers, face economic challenges in supporting their families. Despite working full-time, many struggle to achieve a modest standard of living above the poverty line. The absence of a second caretaker and limited earning capacities contribute to their economic disadvantage compared to married couples. Adam Smith's concept of the division of labor and its impact on wage differentials further highlight the challenges faced by single parents in the workforce. The division of labor creates wage differentials, leading to an unequal distribution of rewards. Single parent families, especially those headed by young parents, are at high risk for low-income and poverty due to limited earning capacities and challenges in finding affordable childcare. The low earnings of young parents under 25 are due to their early career stage and lack of job experience, resulting in potential economic fragility. In young married-couple families, it may not be financially beneficial for both parents to work due to high childcare costs. Many families choose to have a parent stay home to care for their children, leading to temporary low income and economic insecurity during the early years of family formation. Families headed by a parent without a college degree are likely to be low-income, with earnings below 200% of poverty. This low-income status may not be temporary, even with behaviors like marriage, work, and education. Rates of poverty and low income for single-parent families are high. Rates of poverty and low income are higher for single-parent families compared to married-couple families. 28% of poor families with children are headed by married couples, and 20% have a college-educated principal earner. Even affluent families with children can be economically vulnerable, with 27% of married-couple families considered low-income based on both parents' earnings. The economic well-being of many married-couple families is at risk if the second earner loses their income. Reasons for parents not working full-time include involuntary unemployment, illness, or disability. Government policies play a crucial role in promoting economic well-being and security for families with children. While a strong economy is important, many families still face economic vulnerability even during healthy economic times. Various government programs, particularly federal or federal-state programs, impact the economic well-being and vulnerability of families with children. These programs need to be carefully evaluated to ensure they effectively support working families. Government policies play a crucial role in promoting economic well-being and security for families with children, particularly through programs that address economic vulnerability. These programs face tradeoffs between providing economic security and promoting personal responsibility, especially in safety net programs. Some policies aim to mitigate undesired effects like work disincentives and marriage penalties, while others focus on increasing financial returns from work and reducing intergenerational poverty transmission. These programs include social insurance and need-tested programs. The social insurance programs provide benefits based on past earnings earned through work in covered employment. The safety net for families with children was established in the Social Security Act of 1935, with additions like Medicaid, Medicare for the disabled, and food stamps in the 1960s and 1970s. The welfare reform law of 1996 converted Aid to Families with Dependent Children into a block grant providing time-limited cash assistance to poor families. Policies aim to raise wages to increase financial returns from work. Policies to raise wages include minimum wage legislation, Earned Income Tax Credit expansions, and increased funding for child care. Tax policies like deductions for dependents and child credits benefit families based on the number of children, adjusting tax burdens and helping offset work costs. Cash welfare and child support enforcement programs have been controversial in their role in supporting single-parent households. Recent attention has focused on marriage penalties in the tax code and the introduction of marriage promotion and education programs. Family planning grants aim to defer child-bearing, while programs like adolescent family life and abstinence education target preventing teenage pregnancy. Policies aimed at preventing intergenerational transmission of poverty focus on helping poor children escape poverty through programs like Head Start and Title I grants. The report primarily focuses on parents and their nuclear families, diverging from the common definition of extended families. In this report, families are defined as extended families, including unrelated individuals living in the household. Figure A-1 shows that 91% of married couples with children live as independent nuclear family units. Lone-mother and lone-father families are less likely to live independently, with about 60% and 41% respectively. Some married-couple families live with extended family members, while lone-parent families are more likely to have extended family members in the household. About 18% of lone-mother families and 41% of lone-father families reside in households with unrelated members. Among lone-mother families, 15% live only with unrelated members, while 3% also include extended family members. For lone-father families, 36% live only with unrelated members, and 5% also include extended family members. The report considers both nuclear and extended family members' income and needs when assessing family economic well-being. Some families live with unrelated members, potentially affecting their well-being. The impact of unrelated household members' income and needs on family well-being varies depending on the extent of resource sharing. While some unrelated members may contribute significantly to the nuclear family's finances, in other cases, economic sharing may be minimal. It is challenging to determine the extent of income sharing among unrelated household members. When analyzing family economic well-being, unrelated household members' income and needs are excluded. Family living arrangements and income-sharing arrangements play a significant role in determining poverty status. Figure A-2 shows the impact of family living arrangements and income treatment on the economic well-being of lone-mother families in relation to poverty. The poverty rate for lone-mother families is 41.8% when only immediate nuclear family income and needs are considered. However, this rate drops to 35% when all related household members are included as the economic unit for poverty determination. If unrelated household members are also included, the poverty rate further decreases to 29.9%. Official Census Bureau statistics do not combine unrelated household members' income or needs for poverty determination. Among lone-mother families, 60% live independently without extended family or unrelated members. 37% of these families are poor, regardless of the poverty definition used. 22% of lone-mother families live with extended family only, with 51% being poor based on immediate family income. When considering the income and needs of all related household members, the poverty rate drops to 23%, lower than those living independently. The poverty rate among lone mothers living with extended family members is 51%, but when considering support from extended family, the poverty rate drops to 23%. If these lone mothers lived independently, their poverty rate might not be as high as 51%, but also might not be as low as the 37% among those currently living independently. About 15% of lone mothers live with only their children and at least one unrelated household member. When considering all household members' income, the poverty rate among lone-mother families living with unrelated members drops to 14.8%, significantly lower than those living independently. Approximately 65% of these families may be in cohabiting relationships, sharing economic resources. Unmarried partners may share economic resources and responsibilities similar to married couples."
