The Secretary of Agriculture will compensate producers of agricultural commodities in the US for damages incurred due to trade embargoes imposed by the President or foreign countries. Producers must file a claim specifying the amount of damages to receive compensation. The Secretary of Agriculture compensates US agricultural producers for embargo-related damages by calculating the price difference before and after the embargo on each commodity. Producers use this adjusted amount to determine their losses, with ongoing adjustments if the embargo continues beyond a year. The Secretary of Agriculture compensates US agricultural producers for embargo-related damages by calculating price differences before and after the embargo on each commodity. The Commodity Credit Corporation pays the producer three times the damages for a trade embargo or the damages for a retaliatory embargo. The Secretary of the Treasury reimburses the Corporation for all payments made. The United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes arising from claims related to embargo damages. The President must notify Congress of agricultural commodities affected by the embargo, estimated damages to producers, and the funding source for compensation. During the one-year period following the lifting of a trade embargo on an agricultural commodity, the Secretary of Agriculture will provide assistance to producers to regain lost market share.
