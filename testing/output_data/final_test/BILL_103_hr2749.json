    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Convict Service Labor Prohibition Act of 1993\" and includes findings and purpose. The Congress finds that the United States is in a changed international economic environment with increased international trade, advocating for free trade. However, this may lead to job losses as companies move operations overseas for cheaper labor. The United States faces threats to the well-being of its workers due to the shift towards service-based jobs and the importation of goods produced by forced labor, as ruled by the Customs Service in 1992. The Customs Service ruling of July 15, 1992, will cost thousands of additional United States jobs as international trade expands and U.S. companies take advantage of low-waged labor, including imprisoned workers. Existing Federal trade law is inadequate to protect U.S. workers from unfair foreign competition of work done by forced, convict, or prison labor. The purpose of this Act is to amend and enhance existing laws. The Act aims to protect United States jobs by prohibiting the importation of goods made by convicts or prisoners from other countries and establishing penalties for violations. The Act prohibits importing goods made by convicts or prisoners and requires marking packages to identify such goods or services. Enforcement measures are in place to prevent the importation of convict-made goods. Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to include penalties for importing goods into the US customs territory in violation of the act, with a focus on goods manufactured or on which services are performed. The amendment removes references to \"Forced Labor\" and introduces new subsections outlining penalties for violators. The Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to include penalties for importing goods into the US customs territory in violation of the act. Violators can be liable to pay civil penalties ranging from $10,000 to $1,000,000 based on the number of violations. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to establish regulations within one year of enactment. The Secretary of the Treasury must establish regulations within one year of the enactment of the Tariff Act of 1930 to prescribe procedures for imposing penalties, including prepenalty notice."
