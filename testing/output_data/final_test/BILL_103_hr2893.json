Whenever an attorney general of a State believes that residents are affected by a violation of FTC rules, the State can file a civil action in federal court to stop the violation, enforce compliance, seek damages, or obtain other relief. The State must notify the FTC before taking legal action. The State must provide the Commission with a copy of its complaint before taking legal action. The Commission has the right to intervene, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal in civil actions. Venue for civil actions can be where the defendant does business or where the violation occurred. The attorney general can conduct investigations and compel attendance for civil actions. The Federal Trade Commission can administer oaths, compel witnesses, and evidence production. During a civil action by the Commission, no State can initiate a separate action against the same defendant for the same rule violation. State or local officials can still pursue cases based on general statutes. Other officials authorized by a State or locality can bring actions against persons engaged in violations of FTC rules. Definitions for \"attorney general\" and \"State\" are provided. The term \"locality\" refers to any political subdivision of a State as defined in the context."
