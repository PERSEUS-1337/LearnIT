    "content": "The \"Refinery Streamlined Permitting Act of 2012\" aims to streamline the review process for refineries. The Secretary of Energy offers assistance to States for assigning responsibilities related to petroleum refining facility construction. Federal and State agencies must enter into a memorandum of understanding for permit approvals, defining required actions and coordination for efficient review processes. The approval process for petroleum refining facility construction must be completed within 1 year of receiving a complete application. Priority is given to projects that promote cleaner fuel production, increase refining capacity, or reduce pollution output. The approval process for petroleum refining facility construction must be completed within 1 year of receiving a complete application, with priority given to projects that promote cleaner fuel production, increase refining capacity, or reduce pollution output. Additionally, there is a statement of energy effects outlined in SEC. 103. An agency must prepare and submit a Statement of Energy Effects for each proposed significant energy action, detailing adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, and use, as well as reasonable alternatives and their expected effects. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs provides guidance to agencies on implementing the requirement to publish Statements of Energy Effects for proposed significant energy actions. Agencies must include these statements in related Notices of Proposed Rulemaking and Final Rules. The term \"significant energy action\" refers to any agency action expected to result in a final rule or regulation that has a significant adverse effect on energy supply, distribution, or use, or is designated as such by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. TITLE II--REFINING CAPACITY ON CLOSED MILITARY INSTALLATIONS\n\nSEC. 201. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this title, the term \"base closure law\" refers to specific acts related to military base closures. A \"closed military installation\" is a base that has been shut down or approved for closure under a base closure law. A \"designated refinery\" is a refinery identified under a certain section. The term \"Federal refinery authorization\" encompasses any necessary approval under Federal law for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a refinery. The term \"refinery\" refers to a facility designed for processing crude oil to produce gasoline or other fuels through various chemical processes. A refinery is a facility for processing crude oil to produce gasoline or other fuels. A facility can also be designed and operated to refine coal through chemical or physical processes to produce gasoline, diesel, or other liquid fuel. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, and \"State\" includes states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. SEC. 202. STATE PARTICIPATION AND PRESIDENTIAL DESIGNATION. The President must designate at least 3 closed military installations suitable for refinery siting within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The analysis for site selection includes factors like crude oil availability, refined petroleum demand, and proximity to pipeline infrastructure. The President must designate closed military installations suitable for refinery siting within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Factors for site selection include crude oil availability, refined petroleum demand, and infrastructure feasibility. The Federal Government is prohibited from selling or disposing of designated military installations for 2 years, unless a Governor objects. Other considerations include diversifying refining capacity, impact on gasoline prices, and effects on Armed Forces operations. The Governor of a State can object to a refinery site designation within 60 days, which can be overridden by Congress. Redevelopment plans for closed military installations must consider the feasibility of siting a refinery on the site. The Secretary of Defense must consider recommendations from the redevelopment authority when managing real property at a closed military installation, giving substantial deference to their suggestions on siting a refinery on the site. SEC. 203. PROCESS COORDINATION AND RULES OF PROCEDURE. The Department of Energy is designated as the lead agency to coordinate Federal refinery authorizations and environmental reviews. All relevant agencies must cooperate and comply with deadlines set by the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to establish a schedule for all Federal refinery authorizations to ensure timely completion. The Secretary, in coordination with Federal and State agencies, maintains a consolidated record of decisions and actions related to Federal refinery authorizations. If deadlines are not met, applicants can seek remedies under subsection (d). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has original and exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions for the review of orders or actions related to Federal refinery authorizations by Federal or State administrative agencies. If the court finds the record insufficient, it may remand the proceeding to the Secretary for further development. The failure of an agency or official to act on a Federal refinery authorization in accordance with the Secretary's schedule shall be considered inconsistent with Federal law. If the Court finds an order or action inconsistent with Federal law governing the authorization, it will remand the proceeding for appropriate action. The Court may remand orders or actions to agencies for appropriate action. The Secretary must file records promptly for civil actions. Civil actions are expedited, and attorney's fees may be awarded in challenges to Federal refinery authorizations. The prevailing party may be awarded attorney's fees and litigation expenses, excluding actions related to Federal refinery authorizations."
