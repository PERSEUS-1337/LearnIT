    "content": "The ESRP provisions of the ACA incentivize large employers to offer adequate health insurance to full-time employees and dependents. Employers must determine if they are considered an ALE, which is generally defined as having at least 50 full-time employees. ALEs are subject to penalties if they fail to offer sufficient coverage. Employers qualifying as an Applicable Large Employer (ALE) are subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility Provision (ESRP) in the subsequent year, incentivizing them to provide affordable health insurance to full-time employees and their dependents. Failure to offer such coverage may result in penalties if at least one full-time employee receives a premium tax credit or subsidy through a health insurance exchange. Non-ALE employers are not subject to the ESRP or penalties for not offering health insurance coverage. The report outlines how employers determine ALE status, details ESRP penalties, and introduces administrative aspects of the ESRP. The Employer Shared Responsibility Provision (ESRP) applies to Applicable Large Employers (ALE) with at least 50 full-time employees. Non-ALE employers are not subject to ESRP or penalties for not offering health insurance coverage. Employers determine if they are Applicable Large Employers (ALE) by averaging full-time and full-time equivalent employees monthly. ALEs with at least 50 employees are subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility Provision (ESRP) on an annual basis. Businesses with shared ownership must be aggregated into a controlled group to determine ALE status. Aggregation occurs for businesses with shared ownership, collectively determining ALE status. Each subcomponent of a controlled group is considered an ALE and subject to ESRP. ALEs provide health care coverage to full-time employees only, excluding full-time equivalent employees for ESRP penalty calculation. Full-time employees work an average of at least 30 hours per week or 130 total hours in a month. The monthly measurement method determines full-time employee status based on working at least 30 hours per week or 130 total hours in a month. Part-time employee hours are converted to full-time equivalent employees for ALE determination. Seasonal workers are defined by their intermittent labor and their hours are included in calculations. Seasonal workers' hours are included in the determination of whether an employer is an ALE, unless specific conditions are met to exclude them. The definition of seasonal workers differs from seasonal employees used in ESRP. Various types of workers, besides full-time and part-time employees, are also considered. The rules for determining ALE status include special considerations for workers who are not full-time, part-time, or seasonal employees. These rules address discrepancies in compensation and other characteristics. ALEs must offer affordable health insurance to full-time employees or face penalties. Definitions and explanations of these other types of workers are provided in Appendix B. Employers must identify full-time employees for health insurance coverage to avoid penalties. They can use the ALE determination or a different measurement method. Each ALE member in an aggregated group is responsible for offering coverage and paying penalties if necessary. Employers must offer health insurance coverage to full-time employees to avoid penalties. The coverage must be adequate and affordable, with a minimum actuarial value of 60%. Actuarial value reflects the share of cost sharing imposed on a standard population's medical expenses. The affordability of health insurance plans is determined by the employee's required contribution not exceeding a certain percentage of their W-2 wages. This calculation does not consider the cost of family plans. Employers may use different methodologies to determine full-time employees for offering health insurance coverage. Employers may determine full-time employees using the Look-Back Measurement Method instead of the monthly method to assess if they are an Applicable Large Employer (ALE) and who needs health insurance coverage to avoid penalties. They can use a combination of both methods for different employee categories but cannot use the Look-Back method for variable-hour and seasonal employees if they use the monthly method for those with predictable schedules. Employers can use the Look-Back Measurement Method to determine full-time employees for health insurance coverage. The method involves three stages: Measurement Period, Administrative Period, and Stability. The Treasury Department and IRS have raised concerns about the subjectivity of using employer expectations to classify employees. The stability period is the duration employers may be penalized for not offering health insurance to full-time employees. Employers can customize period lengths for different worker categories. Seasonal employees' work hours are treated differently in determining full-time status under the ESRP. The ESRP regulations define seasonal workers and seasonal employees differently, impacting how full-time status is determined. Seasonal workers affect ALE determination if employed for more than 120 days, while seasonal employees are hired for six months or less. The \"Look-Back Measurement Method\" can be used by employers to calculate employee status. The \"Look-Back Measurement Method\" allows employers to calculate full-time status of seasonal employees based on a 12-month period. This method may exclude seasonal workers from being considered full-time under the ESRP. ALEs with full-time employees must report information to the IRS and employees annually using Form 1094-C and Form 1095-C. These forms contain details about the health care coverage offered by the employer. Each Applicable Large Employer (ALE) must submit Form 1094-C to the IRS, reporting general information, total full-time employees, coverage offered, and total employees. Additionally, ALEs must submit Form 1095-C for each full-time employee, detailing personal and employer information. Employers must submit Form 1094-C and Form 1095-C to the IRS by specific deadlines, detailing employee personal information, coverage offered, and cost. Failure to file correctly may result in penalties. Employers must provide full-time employees with a written statement containing contact information and IRS details by January 31 of the following year. Failure to do so may result in penalties up to $3.2755 million. Penalties may increase if reporting requirements are intentionally disregarded, but may be waived for reasonable cause. ESRP assessment payment may apply if at least one full-time employee is not reported. An Applicable Large Employer (ALE) may face an Employer Shared Responsibility Payment (ESRP) penalty if a full-time employee receives a premium tax credit due to inadequate or unaffordable health insurance coverage. Penalties apply to all common-law employers, including government entities and nonprofits, for each month of violation. The penalty amount is determined by specific formulas based on the violation duration. The penalty amount for an Applicable Large Employer (ALE) facing an Employer Shared Responsibility Payment (ESRP) penalty is determined by specific formulas based on the number of full-time employees offered health insurance coverage. If more than 95% of full-time employees are offered coverage, the penalty is calculated based on the number of employees receiving premium credits. If less than 95% are offered coverage, the penalty is based on the total number of full-time employees. The penalty for an Applicable Large Employer (ALE) facing an Employer Shared Responsibility Payment (ESRP) is calculated based on the number of full-time employees offered health insurance coverage. ALEs at risk of ESRP penalty receive notifications from exchanges and the IRS. Exchanges must inform employers when an employee is eligible for premium tax credits. Employers can appeal exchange notifications, but these do not determine ESRP liability. The IRS contacts employers after the tax year regarding ESRP penalties. The IRS notifies Applicable Large Employers (ALEs) about potential Employer Shared Responsibility Payment (ESRP) liabilities if employees received premium tax credits through an exchange. ALEs have 30 days to respond to the IRS notification and can appeal the penalty amount. The IRS will provide a final penalty amount and payment options after correspondence with the employer. Transition relief was provided in 2014, delaying the enforcement of ESRP penalties. In 2014, the IRS provided transition relief by not enforcing the ESRP or associated penalties. Enforcement of ESRP began in 2015 for employers with at least 100 full-time employees. In 2016, enforcement expanded to nearly all businesses, except for specific circumstances. ESRP enforcement started for all ALEs in 2017. ALEs did not receive notifications from federally facilitated exchanges in 2015 due to a phased employer notification program. ALEs began receiving IRS notifications about potential penalties for tax year 2015 in November 2017, with only 3,820 out of 33,080 ALEs notified by January 2, 2018. The IRS notified only 3,820 out of 33,080 ALEs potentially subject to penalties for tax year 2015 by January 2, 2018. An audit found delays in IRS notifications due to compliance process issues. As of March 21, 2018, the IRS still struggled to process paper information returns promptly and accurately."
