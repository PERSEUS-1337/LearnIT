    "content": "For purposes of subsection (a)(1), a joint resolution is described as a resolution of both Houses of Congress calling upon the President to negotiate amendments to specific provisions of the Uruguay Round Agreement mentioned in a report by the WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission. The joint resolution submitted to Congress by the Commission states that due to the failure to address issues identified in reports and negotiations, it is no longer in the national interest for the US to be a member of the WTO, leading to the withdrawal of approval by Congress. The Congress withdraws its approval of the WTO Agreement as defined in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, if certain procedural requirements are met. The Congress can withdraw approval of the WTO Agreement if specific conditions are fulfilled, including submitting affirmative reports and overriding a presidential veto within a specified timeframe. The Congress can introduce a joint resolution to withdraw approval of the WTO Agreement within a specified timeframe after receiving an affirmative report from the Commission. Joint resolutions described in subsection (b) can be introduced in either House of Congress by any Member. Expedited procedures apply to these resolutions, with provisions from the Trade Act of 1974 being applicable if the committee has not reported on the resolution within 45 days of its introduction. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines procedures for joint resolutions in Congress. If a committee fails to report on a resolution within 45 days, it is automatically discharged and placed on the calendar. The Senate and House have specific committees responsible for reporting on joint resolutions before they can be considered. The Trade Act of 1974 establishes rules for joint resolutions in Congress. A motion in the House to consider a joint resolution can only be made on the second legislative day after announcement. It is not allowed to consider a second resolution if the same matter has already been addressed by a joint resolution in either the House or the Senate. This section is enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House. The Trade Act of 1974 establishes rules for joint resolutions in Congress, enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House and Senate.
