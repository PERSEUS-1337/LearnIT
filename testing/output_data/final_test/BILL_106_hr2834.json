Congress finds that the placement of telecommunications facilities near residential properties can devalue properties, impact views, and deter people from living in the area. States and local governments should have control over the placement of such facilities through zoning and land use regulations to protect the environment and public health. There are alternatives to building new facilities, such as using existing towers or structures for colocation. Alternative methods of designing towers for telecommunications and broadcast needs include small towers that do not require safety lights, break skylines, or protrude above tree canopies. The Federal Communications Commission proposed a rule in 1997 to preempt State and local zoning ordinances on broadcast transmission facilities. The Federal Communications Commission proposed a rule in 1997 to preempt State and local zoning ordinances on broadcast transmission facilities, but it is in the interest of the Nation that the Commission not adopt this rule. Memoranda opinions and orders should be modified to allow State and local governments to regulate the placement of telecommunications or broadcast facilities. PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber, and satellite telecommunications systems, including low-Earth orbit satellites, offer an opportunity for emergency telephone service in the US. The FCC seeks guidance from health experts on radio frequency exposure effects, while the FAA lacks authority to regulate facility placement. The FCC proposes rules to regulate telecommunications facilities near airports, potentially preempting State and local zoning laws. Concerns are raised about the impact on aviation safety, airport capacity, and airspace use. The telecommunications industry is expected to provide accurate technical information to governmental authorities. To repeal limitations on State and local authority for personal wireless service facilities and related facilities under the Communications Act of 1934. Permitting State and local governments to require alternative technologies when inconsistent with regulations, and to regulate placement and construction of facilities. The curr_chunk discusses the need for telecommunications facilities to be constructed in a way that does not interfere with public airspace or compromise public safety. It also emphasizes the accountability of applicants and service providers for the accuracy of information provided during permit hearings. State and local authority over telecommunications facilities placement, construction, and modification. Repeal of limitations on regulation of personal wireless facilities under the Communications Act of 1934 to prevent unreasonable discrimination among providers of equivalent services. Redesignation and amendment of clauses for administrative remedies. The Federal Communications Commission is prohibited from adopting a rule that preempts state and local authority over broadcast transmission facilities. In any legal action involving the placement, construction, or modification of a telecommunications facility, the burden of proof lies with the party seeking to make the changes. In 1997, the Communications Act of 1934 was amended to grant authority over placement, construction, and modification of transmission facilities to state and local governments. SEC. 338 grants state and local governments authority over placement, construction, and modification of telecommunications facilities. SEC. 338 of the Act grants state and local governments authority over the placement, construction, and modification of telecommunications facilities. This provision ensures that no one can bypass state or local laws or decisions when placing or modifying towers, as long as alternative technology can deliver signals without the need for a tower. Additionally, it allows state and local governments to require safety and interference studies for telecommunications facilities within their jurisdiction. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for broadcast transmission facilities to comply with radio frequency exposure limits and aviation safety standards. This ensures the facilities' compliance with laws and regulations governing health, safety, and welfare of local residents. The curr_chunk states that a person may be denied authority to locate facilities if they fail to produce required studies or documentation. It also clarifies that states and local governments can enforce compliance with submitted information for placing telecommunication or broadcast facilities."
