    "content": "The development of satellite reconnaissance systems by the U.S. Intelligence Community began in the Eisenhower Administration to gather information on potential enemies without manned overflights or covert agents. Satellite imagery supported U.S. strategic planning and arms control agreements with the Soviet Union. Data transmission improved in the 1970s, focusing on gathering information in Europe and Asia. During the 1970s, satellite passes were optimized to gather information on areas of interest in Europe and Asia. Collection on domestic targets over U.S. territory was also obtained as a \"free good.\" Engineering passes provided detailed aerial photography of domestic sites. Declassified documents show consideration to provide satellite images to civilian agencies for various purposes. Concerns about monitoring U.S. persons extended to reconnaissance satellites in the mid-1970s. The 1975 Rockefeller Commission reviewed the CIA's use of reconnaissance satellites for various purposes, including mapping, assessing natural disasters, and detecting crop blight. The Commission raised concerns about potential misuse of aerial photography for law enforcement, noting that the systems in use were beyond what legislators had envisioned in the National Security Act of 1947. The Civil Applications Committee (CAC) was established in 1975 to prioritize civilian agencies' needs for satellite data in response to concerns raised by the Rockefeller Commission. It serves as a communication interface between civil users and the Intelligence Community, chaired by the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey. The CAC had a membership of 10 departments and agencies by July 2001. In 2001, the Civil Applications Committee (CAC) had a membership of 10 departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, National Science Foundation, Army Corps of Engineers, and others. The end of the Cold War led to increased use of Intelligence Community assets for civilian purposes, particularly in environmental issues. Intelligence agencies started providing more analytical products to non-security government agencies. In 1992, civilian scientists reviewed data from intelligence satellites for scientific use. President Clinton made 860,000 satellite images public, including U.S. territory images. The use of intelligence resources for domestic purposes was discussed by then-DCI John Deutch in 1996. The Intelligence Community provides support to civil agencies during natural disasters by assessing and reporting damage using data from various sources. They only provide support upon request and produce unclassified products from classified information. A Disaster Response Team quickly creates maps and diagrams showing damage from disasters like earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, oil spills, and volcanic eruptions. Intelligence satellites have classified capabilities with greater resolution than publicly available options. Intelligence satellites have greater resolution than commercial options like Google Earth, SPOT, or Landsat. They are crucial for map-making, monitoring environmental events, and providing information to government agencies and military commanders. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency combines satellite-derived intelligence with other sources to meet military needs. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) utilizes various platforms and techniques to provide mapping, elevation data, and situation analysis for military commanders and policymakers. They collaborate with government, non-profit, academia, and industry partners to exchange ideas and discuss advancements in geospatial intelligence technology. The NGA has been involved in disaster relief efforts, providing graphics for relief operations after events like the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The NGA and other intelligence agencies believe their expertise can provide value-added information support for homeland security and law enforcement. Satellites support MASINT, an intelligence discipline involving radar, laser, and infrared analysis. MASINT could help locate weapons of mass destruction for domestic security efforts. The potential value of satellite-derived information for homeland security and law enforcement efforts is being explored by congressional committees. Intelligence satellites offer advantages such as emergency targeting, cost-free products, and high resolution imagery. However, their availability for civilian use may be limited during international crises or combat operations. The extent of the value added by satellites for these purposes remains uncertain. The 9/11 attacks prompted a reevaluation of the relationship between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, leading to the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security. There was a perceived need for increased imaging of the United States for homeland security and counterterrorism efforts. The Committee expressed concern about the process for authorizing imaging the United States by NIMA (later NGA) to support homeland security operations and the U.S. Northern Command. They want to ensure checks and balances are in place to prevent improper imaging requests without hindering urgent collection needs. The DCI, NIMA, and NRO were directed to provide a report on the processes for using intelligence satellites to image the U.S. and any proposed changes. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) position to coordinate intelligence activities. Satellite data was seen as having potential for law enforcement and homeland security. An Independent Study Group in 2005 reviewed satellite surveillance's contribution to the civil sector. The Independent Study Group (ISG) reviewed the use of satellite information for scientific and environmental research, emphasizing the potential for better utilization of satellite-derived data for homeland security and intelligence sharing. Geospatial information, particularly maps and map products, was highlighted as a valuable tool for information sharing across different agencies and organizations. The ISG discussed the lack of collaboration between law enforcement agencies and the Intelligence Community in utilizing satellite information due to concerns about protecting sources and methods. Law enforcement agencies have limited budgets and focus on post-event criminal activity, making them unattractive partners for the IC. The Intelligence Community and law enforcement face challenges in collaborating due to concerns about protecting classified information. The lack of cooperation hinders the utilization of satellite information for domestic applications. The ISG highlighted concerns about limited support for homeland defense due to barriers in sharing intelligence information between agencies, including the reluctance to use satellite data for law enforcement. This reluctance stems from the historical separation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies, driven by the need to protect intelligence sources and methods and prevent the gathering of information on U.S. persons. The ISG aimed to address these challenges by creating a platform for information sharing. The ISG recommended that DHS act as an intermediary between the Intelligence Community and law enforcement agencies to improve information sharing for domestic needs, particularly in counterterrorism efforts. The Bush Administration accepted the recommendations of the ISG to improve information sharing for counterterrorism efforts. In 2006, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Interior and Homeland Security Departments to support homeland security. In 2007, DHS was designated as the executive agent for the National Applications Office. Congress agreed with this approach. In 2007, Congress approved funding for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to initiate operations. The funding transfer likely involved moving funds from the DNI to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). However, it was discovered that these actions were not approved by the House Committee on Homeland Security, which has oversight over the DHS. The House Committee on Homeland Security was surprised by the establishment of the National Applications Office (NAO) in August 2007. During a hearing, Chairman Bennie Thompson and Representative Peter King expressed concerns about the lack of notification regarding the sharing of satellite imagery with law enforcement agencies nationwide. Civil liberties organizations criticized the use of spy satellites for domestic surveillance, emphasizing the importance of transparency and oversight. The House Committee on Homeland Security expressed concerns about the deployment of spy satellites domestically, emphasizing the need for rigorous oversight and checks. Civil liberties organizations raised alarm about the potential use of sophisticated technical systems by law enforcement agencies, warning of the impact on the government-citizen relationship. Witnesses recommended further investigation and withholding funds until civil liberties issues are addressed. The House Committee on Homeland Security raised concerns about the deployment of spy satellites domestically and emphasized the need for oversight. Witnesses recommended further investigation and withholding funds until civil liberties issues are resolved. Charles Allen defended the new office, stating that it will provide a transparent process and ensure protection of civil rights and privacy. The Homeland Security Committee expressed concerns about the lack of legal and operational safeguards for military spy satellites, urging the Department of Homeland Security to provide a written framework for the National Applications Office (NAO) to protect Constitutional rights. There were worries about potential violations of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 regarding the use of satellites for law enforcement. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 may not be consistent with the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security delayed opening the National Applications Office (NAO) to provide more information to Congress on civil liberties issues. The Bush Administration was preparing to submit plans for the NAO to Congress. Charles Allen mentioned finalizing the charter of the NAO in a testimony to the House Homeland Security Committee in February 2008. The Charter of the NAO, to be signed by key officials, will clarify permissible and impermissible uses of the National Applications Office. It will address requests for IC support for domestic missions, prioritize requests, and ensure legal compliance with the U.S. Constitution and laws. The NAO aims to promote information sharing and protect intelligence. The NAO Charter outlines goals for information sharing, protection of intelligence sources, and budget advocacy to the IC for domestic missions. It prohibits the NAO from accepting requests for intercepting communications covered by certain laws, directing such requests to the Justice Department. The NAEC will oversee the NAO, chaired by officials from Homeland Security, DOI, and the DNI. The NAO Charter establishes a senior-level agency group chaired by officials from Homeland Security, DOI, and the DNI. It clarifies that activities will align with respective authorities and mission priorities without transferring legal authority or funds among parties. The Interior Department will provide the initial facility for the NAO on a reimbursable basis, while the DNI will allocate National Intelligence Program funding as needed. The Appropriations Committee included language in their homeland security appropriations bills for FY2009 to withhold authorization for NAO operations until DHS submits and the GAO reviews an explanation of the legality of NAO operations. Despite steps taken to comply with privacy standards, the GAO reported that DHS had not fully justified the NAO's compliance with applicable laws. The Obama Administration reviewed the NAO and decided to end the program in June 2009. The National Applications Office faced concerns about its constitutionality and compliance with privacy laws. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, required certification of legal compliance before operations could begin. The program was ultimately ended by the Obama Administration in June 2009. The NAO Charter faced opposition from the House Homeland Security Committee due to concerns about using IC capabilities for domestic law enforcement without a legal framework. Legal issues surrounding satellite-derived information for law enforcement purposes further complicated the discussion. The use of satellite intelligence for domestic law enforcement has raised concerns about civil liberties and potential violations of the Posse Comitatus Act. Questions also arise regarding the involvement of intelligence agencies like the CIA and DHS in surveillance activities. The NRO and NGA, components of DOD, have military personnel assigned to support domestic law enforcement. The Fourth Amendment applies to satellite surveillance, and there are laws governing intelligence collection and military involvement in law enforcement. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring warrants based on probable cause and specific descriptions. It protects individuals' privacy in their persons, homes, papers, and effects from government intrusion. Government surveillance that does not violate a legitimate expectation of privacy does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment, and therefore does not require a warrant or probable cause. The analysis of whether surveillance is considered a search depends on the circumstances, such as what information is collected and how it is obtained. Satellite surveillance may be considered a search, and its reasonableness is evaluated based on the specific details of the collection. The Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches now focuses on individuals rather than physical locations, following the Supreme Court's decision in Katz v. United States in 1967. This ruling established that individuals have a legitimate expectation of privacy even in public places. The amendment no longer solely relies on the trespass doctrine to determine what constitutes a search, but also considers the protection of individuals' privacy rights. Katz reinforced the \"plain view\" doctrine, stating that what is knowingly exposed to the public is not protected by the Fourth Amendment. However, what is sought to be kept private, even in a public area, may be constitutionally protected. The legitimacy of a person's expectation of privacy depends on factors like whether the object is hidden and if the viewing equipment is in common use. Taking normal precautions to maintain privacy is also considered. The legitimacy of a person's expectation of privacy depends on factors like whether the object is hidden and if the viewing equipment is in common use. Taking normal precautions to maintain privacy, such as those customarily taken by those seeking to exclude others, is also a factor in determining legitimacy. Persons have a greater expectation of privacy in the home than in public places, with the curtilage of a private home receiving greater protection than privately owned land used for business purposes. Fourth Amendment protection does not extend to activities that take place outdoors in an area beyond the curtilage of a home. The Supreme Court has not addressed whether satellite imagery constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In California v. Ciraolo, the Court determined that aerial observation from an altitude of 1,000 feet of a fenced-in backyard within the curtilage of a home, conducted without a warrant, did not constitute a search. The defendant was growing marijuana in a small garden plot in his backyard, protected by two fences from observation by casual passersby. The Supreme Court's ruling in California v. Ciraolo stated that aerial observation of marijuana in a backyard from public airspace defeated the expectation of privacy. In Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, aerial photography of an industrial compound was also deemed not a search. However, the Court suggested that surveillance using less common technology or involving private property's curtilage might constitute a search. Satellite imagery's legality for surveillance purposes remains uncertain. The Supreme Court's ruling in California v. Ciraolo allowed aerial surveillance of private property using sophisticated equipment without a warrant. The use of satellite technology for surveillance raises questions about Fourth Amendment protection due to the infrequency of private space travel. The Court's emphasis on government officials' vantage point and public navigable airspace suggests objections to aircraft flying below navigable airspace for more intrusive surveillance. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of aerial surveillance in Florida v. Riley, where a police helicopter observed marijuana growing inside a greenhouse from 400 feet. The Court concluded that as long as there was no breach of FAA safety regulations, the property owner had no expectation of privacy for non-intimate activities visible from above. The Supreme Court has not addressed whether the use of airborne surveillance equipment other than standard photography would implicate Fourth Amendment concerns, but Kyllo v. United States suggests such concerns would arise, especially if targeting a private dwelling. In Kyllo v. United States, a federal agent used infrared thermal imaging equipment to compare the heat emanating from a triplex unit to nearby residences. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that using sense-enhancing technology to reveal details about the interior of a private home constitutes a search, even if the heat was not concealed. The Supreme Court ruling in Kyllo v. United States emphasized that using sense-enhancing technology to reveal details inside a private home constitutes a search. The unresolved issue is when surveillance equipment becomes common enough to impact a resident's expectation of privacy. The dissent criticized this criterion, stating that as intrusive technology becomes more available, privacy threats may increase. Satellite surveillance capabilities, kept secret, may widen the gap between individuals' perceived privacy and actual government observation risk. The use of surveillance techniques that narrowly focus on revealing unlawful activity or contraband may not be considered a search, especially outside of a home and not targeting a specific individual. In United States v. Place, the Supreme Court ruled that using a drug-sniffing dog to detect narcotics in closed luggage was not a search as it only reveals contraband. However, technology like satellite surveillance that uncovers unlawful activity or contraband without exposing noncontraband items may not constitute a search. On the other hand, according to Kyllo, technology that reveals phenomena associated with unlawful activity, even if not the activity itself, would be considered a search. The Fourth Amendment requires that surveillance techniques, including satellite surveillance, must be reasonable to not violate privacy rights. The reasonableness is determined by balancing the intrusion on privacy against legitimate governmental interests. Warrants may play a role in determining the reasonableness of a search, but they are not always required. Warrants are not always required for searches; warrantless searches may be justified by \"exigent circumstances\" or the \"special needs\" exception. For example, routine border inspections can be conducted without a warrant. The reasonableness of a search may vary depending on the context, with different standards for criminal investigations versus other situations. Many courts have found exceptions to the warrant requirement for searches conducted for foreign intelligence gathering purposes. Evidence of criminal activity discovered during these warrantless searches may be used in criminal prosecutions. Warrantless satellite surveillance falling under a special needs exception can be conducted without a warrant, subject to reasonableness and probable cause in some cases. Courts consider statutory authority in determining if an investigation is a search and how the fruits of surveillance are treated. The National Security Act of 1947 grants authority for satellite surveillance, impacting court treatment of surveillance results. The Department of Defense manages military intelligence satellites, with the ability to collect information abroad for law enforcement purposes. The National Security Act of 1947 grants authority for satellite surveillance, impacting court treatment of surveillance results. DOD intelligence agencies can collect information outside the US for law enforcement purposes, with limitations on direct military involvement in arrests. The Secretary of Defense must establish regulations for providing assistance to law enforcement agencies by DOD intelligence elements. The National Security Act of 1947 grants authority for satellite surveillance, impacting court treatment of surveillance results. DOD intelligence agencies can collect information outside the US for law enforcement purposes, with limitations on direct military involvement in arrests. The Secretary of Defense must establish regulations for providing assistance to law enforcement agencies by DOD intelligence elements. There is no similar statutory authority (or restriction) regarding DOD's collection of imagery intelligence in support of law enforcement agencies within U.S. territory. The NGA has statutory authority to process and disseminate imagery intelligence and geospatial information for the armed forces and other US departments and agencies. The National Security Act of 1947 grants authority for satellite surveillance, impacting court treatment of surveillance results. DOD intelligence agencies can collect information outside the US for law enforcement purposes, with limitations on direct military involvement in arrests. The NGA has the mission of supporting geospatial intelligence requirements of the Department of State and other US agencies. The Director of National Intelligence establishes collection requirements for NGA. NGA does not have direct authority to support state or local law enforcement, except possibly during emergencies under the Stafford Act. Military personnel assigned to defense intelligence entities are subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of Army or Air Force for law enforcement activities, with exceptions for Navy and Marines. Violations occur when military is directly involved in civilian law enforcement or exercises regulatory power over citizens. DOD support for law enforcement is allowed for military purposes that benefit civilian agencies. DOD support for law enforcement agencies in the United States is authorized under chapter 18 of title 10, U.S. Code, allowing sharing of information, equipment, and training between military and civilian authorities. Personnel can provide expert advice, maintenance, and use DOD equipment and facilities for civilian benefits. DOD personnel are authorized to operate equipment for specific federal law enforcement operations, including counter-terrorism, renditions of suspected terrorists, and investigations involving certain laws. They can detect, monitor, and communicate air and sea traffic movements outside the US boundary and within 25 miles if the initial detection was outside the boundary. Additionally, DOD equipment, facilities, and personnel can be provided during emergency situations. During emergency situations involving chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction, facilities and personnel can be provided for assistance. The authority granted is subject to caveats to ensure it does not undermine US military capability and civilian beneficiaries must pay for the assistance. Regulations are in place to prevent direct participation by military members in certain activities. During emergencies involving weapons of mass destruction, DOD and DOJ regulations prohibit DOD personnel from making arrests or directly participating in law enforcement activities, unless necessary for immediate protection of human life or authorized by law. Military assistance was initially presumed to be limited by the Fourth Amendment, but DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel disagreed in 1991. DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel in 1991 opined that using military personnel for aerial infrared monitoring of private property for law enforcement is authorized by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 374(b)(2)(B) and not prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act. They interpreted that Congress did not intend the term \"search\" in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 375 to include all Fourth Amendment searches, but only those involving physical contact likely to result in a confrontation. The legislative history of [10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371-375] suggests that Congress intended to prevent direct confrontation between military personnel and civilians. Military participation in satellite surveillance may not violate the Posse Comitatus Act if it does not constitute a search under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 375. The Posse Comitatus Act and related statutes are complex and intertwined with legislation predating satellite reconnaissance. Congress has allowed military assistance to law enforcement but emphasizes the importance of maintaining separate roles. The use of satellite-derived information for domestic law enforcement depends on executive and legislative agreement on appropriateness and limitations. Adherence to government regulations is crucial. Regulations, including E.O. 12333, play a role in determining if an investigation is a search and if it is conducted reasonably. The NGA's functions involve producing and sharing geospatial intelligence for foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, and military operations. E.O. 12333 also allows Intelligence Community agencies to assist in law enforcement activities to investigate clandestine intelligence activities. The order E.O. 12333 permits intelligence agencies to assist in law enforcement activities related to investigating clandestine intelligence, international terrorism, and narcotics trafficking. It allows for the use of specialized equipment and expert personnel to support agencies and local law enforcement when lives are at risk. Monitoring devices can only be used with approved procedures that protect legal rights and limit information use to lawful purposes. The Attorney General has the authority to approve their use within the United States. The Attorney General has the authority to approve the use of techniques requiring a warrant for law enforcement purposes, as long as there is probable cause to believe it is directed against a foreign power. DOD Directives govern intelligence activities in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, applicable law, and other policies. The DODD 5240.1-R governs the intentional collection of foreign intelligence information about U.S. persons, with specific criteria for such collection. Intelligence collection against U.S. persons requires a reasonable belief that the targeted person poses a threat or has relevant knowledge for a valid intelligence mission. Special emphasis is placed on protecting the constitutional rights and privacy of U.S. persons. The DODD 5240.1-R governs the intentional collection of foreign intelligence information about U.S. persons, requiring a reasonable belief that the targeted person poses a threat or has relevant knowledge for a valid intelligence mission. Collection should be done using the least intrusive means, such as open sources or with consent. If not feasible, information can be collected from cooperating sources or through lawful investigative techniques, with the approval of the Attorney General. Unintentionally collected intelligence or collection not targeting specific persons is not subject to these restrictions. The directive permits the collection of information from overhead reconnaissance not directed at specific U.S. persons, with compliance with relevant statutes and regulations. The NAO would comply with E.O. 12333 and other relevant statutes, ensuring privacy protection. Concerns arose over using satellites for law enforcement and homeland security, with Congress and groups worried about potential misuse of intelligence resources against U.S. persons. Congressional oversight challenges were compounded by reports of new satellite missions not being disclosed to Congress. The Bush Administration delayed establishing the NAO, leading to concerns about satellite missions not being disclosed to Congress. The Obama Administration terminated the NAO but has not provided detailed information on current satellite use for domestic purposes."
