    "content": "The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for the federal government to create a deep underground repository for radioactive waste from nuclear power plants. Yucca Mountain, Nevada was considered as a potential site for this repository. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site to Congress in 2002, leading to current congressional action. Nevada exercised its authority to disapprove the site on April 8. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for a deep underground repository for radioactive waste. Yucca Mountain, Nevada was proposed as a site, but Nevada disapproved it on April 8. The Act requires a resolution of repository siting approval within a specified period, likely after Congress reconvenes from its August recess. An expedited procedure for congressional consideration is in place, similar to other expedited procedures in existing law. Expedited procedures in existing law regulate congressional consideration of resolutions to approve or disapprove specific actions. These procedures, also known as \"fast track\" procedures, aim to facilitate timely decision-making by Congress on the specified matter. The expedited procedures, also known as \"fast track\" procedures, facilitate timely decision-making by Congress on specific matters. The NWPA incorporates elements such as fixed time periods for committee and floor action, discharge of committees if they do not report, prohibitions on amendments, and expedited final action to send a measure to the President. The procedures for resolutions of repository siting approval follow a similar model. The Act outlines procedures for the House and Senate separately, with adaptations made for divergent general rules during floor consideration. The NWPA incorporates expedited procedures for timely decision-making by Congress on specific matters, including fixed time periods for committee and floor action, discharge of committees, prohibitions on amendments, and expedited final action. The Act outlines procedures for House and Senate separately, with adaptations for divergent general rules during floor consideration. Congress can override a state notice of disapproval by passing a joint resolution of repository siting approval within the first 90 days of continuous session after receiving the notice. The 90-day period includes all calendar days except those when either house is adjourned for more than three days. The NWPA includes procedures for timely decision-making by Congress, with fixed time periods for actions and prohibitions on amendments. Congress can override a state notice of disapproval within the first 90 days of continuous session. Days not counted in the 90-day period are those included in authorized session recesses. It is estimated that 90 days of continuous session after April 8 will expire on or about Wednesday, September 4. Continuity of session in Congress is broken if it adjourns sine die before the 90-day period expires. A new period of continuous session begins with the convening of the next session. If a state notice of disapproval is received less than 90 days before adjournment, Congress has until the 90th day of continuous session in the following session to act. These provisions may apply if Congress receives a disapproval notice late in a session. During a session, if Congress fails to act on an approval resolution, it can still be considered in the next session. However, if the notice is received late in the second session, it will be treated as the first session of the next Congress. In such cases, the legislation would need to be reintroduced and go through the full legislative process again. The joint resolution of approval must become law for the site to be approved, either by the President signing it or Congress overriding a veto, within the 90-day period. The NWPA specifies the requirements for a resolution of repository siting approval, including the need for a joint resolution with specific wording. Any resolution that does not meet these requirements would not be eligible for expedited consideration. In this case, only one resolution was introduced in each house and they are identical in wording. The terms of the NWPA also state that a state's disapproval of a site can impact the approval process. The NWPA outlines the procedures for introducing resolutions of repository siting approval, with differences between the House and Senate. The Senate requires the introduction of an approval resolution by the next session day after receiving a disapproval notice, while the House provision does not have this requirement. This allows for the possibility of an approval resolution not being introduced in the House. The NWPA outlines procedures for introducing approval resolutions for repository siting, with differences between the House and Senate. Approval resolutions may not be introduced in the House, or may be delayed. In the Senate, S.J.Res. 34 was introduced on April 9, and in the House, H.J.Res. 87 was introduced on April 11. The Act allows for multiple approval resolutions for a single site disapproval, but no additional resolutions have been introduced for the Yucca Mountain site. The Act requires approval resolutions to be referred to the appropriate committee or committees upon introduction. S.J.Res. 34 was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and H.J.Res. 87 to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Subcommittee referral is left to the practices of the committees. H.J.Res. 87 was referred to the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality; S.J.Res. 34 received no subcommittee referral. Committees have 60 days of continuous session to report an approval resolution, or it would be automatically discharged. The statutory 60-day period for committees to report or be discharged begins with the introduction of the first approval resolution. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce reported H.J.Res. 87 on April 25, while the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported S.J.Res. 34 on June 10. A measure reported adversely or without recommendation is still placed on the calendar for consideration. The House and Senate have expedited procedures for considering repository siting resolutions. Only one resolution per chamber can reach the calendar, and committees can avoid discharge by reporting an identical resolution. Multiple identical resolutions can be introduced, but if the committee reports one, it is not discharged from the others. The expedited procedures for considering repository siting resolutions in the House and Senate involve only one resolution per chamber reaching the calendar. Committees can avoid discharge by reporting an identical resolution, even if multiple identical resolutions are introduced. The statute specifies the resolution from which the committee is discharged, but discharge can also occur in the absence of the automatically introduced resolution. The expedited procedure for repository siting approval resolutions in the new Congress allows committees to be discharged if they do not report an approval resolution by the 60th day of continuous session. Each chamber can alter or amend the procedures as needed, giving them the power to consider any siting approval resolution. The expedited procedure for repository siting approval resolutions in the new Congress allows committees to be discharged if they do not report an approval resolution by the 60th day of continuous session. Either house could consider siting approval resolutions under terms different from those provided by the statute. The House has the discretion to take up measures for expedited consideration through special rules or motions to suspend the rules, but in this case, H.J.Res. 87 was passed through the statutory procedure on May 8. The NWPA expedited procedure gives the majority party leadership control over when and whether the House will consider an approval resolution. The House will consider an approval resolution in the hands of the majority party leadership, following House scheduling practices. The Speaker has discretion over recognizing a Member to call up the resolution, ensuring consideration will occur once called up. Terms of debate include 2 hours of debate, equally divided and controlled between the Member calling it up and an opponent. The House rules require the Member calling up an approval resolution to be a supporter, and the opposing manager to be an opponent. The managers are typically the chair and ranking minority member of the reporting committee. The Speaker may ask each manager their position on the resolution before consideration. If a manager cannot answer appropriately, another senior member of the committee may be recognized. The House rules dictate that the Member calling up an approval resolution must support it, while the opposing manager must be against it. The Speaker may inquire about each manager's stance before consideration. The Act prohibits any motions or amendments after a 2-hour debate, ensuring a vote on the resolution in its original form. The House rules require managers to support or oppose an approval resolution. After a 2-hour debate, no amendments are allowed, ensuring a vote on the resolution in its original form. In the Senate, the expedited procedure controls the motion to proceed with an approval resolution. The Senate's expedited procedure allows any Senator to move to proceed with an approval resolution on the calendar. Supporters of S.J.Res. 34 may offer a motion to proceed before mid-July, sparking debate on whether it should be the majority leader or their designee making the motion. The Senate's expedited procedure allows any Senator to move to proceed with an approval resolution on the calendar. The majority leader is typically given control of the motion to proceed, seen as a key tool in managing the floor agenda. Some argue that this prerogative should also apply to a motion to proceed offered pursuant to a statute, while others believe the statute is meant to ensure the measure can reach the floor regardless of leadership decisions. The Act specifies that a motion to proceed on a repository siting approval is nondebatable, unamendable, and cannot be superseded or postponed, ensuring its timely consideration. The Senate's expedited procedure allows any Senator to move to proceed with an approval resolution on the calendar. Provisions for floor consideration include features designed to prevent filibustering, such as limiting total debate on the resolution to 10 hours. These provisions ensure that once the Senate takes up an approval resolution, it will be able to reach a final vote. The Senate's expedited procedure limits total debate on approval resolutions to 10 hours, precluding filibusters. The time is divided equally between supporters and opponents, managed by the chair and ranking minority member. A vote must occur at the end of the debate, with no motion to reconsider allowed. The 10-hour limit includes debate on debatable motions, and appeals of the chair's ruling are not debatable. The Act allows nondebatable motions to proceed to consider an approval resolution and to reduce debate time. While these motions cannot be amended or postponed, the approval resolution itself can be amended. The Act does not explicitly prohibit offering amendments to the approval resolution, leaving room for potential changes through floor recommendations or committee suggestions. The NWPA allows for nondebatable motions to proceed with approval resolutions and reduce debate time. While these motions cannot be amended or postponed, the approval resolution itself can be amended. The Act does not explicitly prohibit amendments to the approval resolution, leaving room for potential changes through floor recommendations or committee suggestions. The legislative history and purposes of expedited procedures suggest that the approval resolution was intended not to be subject to amendment in either house. The specific language requirements for a resolution of repository siting approval support this conclusion. If the Senate allows for amendments to the resolution, the potential consequences are unclear. The NWPA allows for nondebatable motions to proceed with approval resolutions and reduce debate time. The expedited procedure for each house ensures that both will take final action on the same measure, and a single approval resolution will be cleared for Presidential action. If the Senate allows for amendments to the resolution, it may become ineligible for further consideration under the expedited procedure. The NWPA allows for expedited procedures in both houses to ensure final action on the same measure with a single approval resolution for Presidential action. The receiving house will consider its own approval resolution but vote on the one received from the other house. This mechanism is part of many expedited procedure statutes to ensure substantively similar resolutions are passed by each house. The NWPA allows for expedited procedures in both houses to ensure final action on the same measure with a single approval resolution for Presidential action. Each house must first consider its own measure before voting on the one received from the other house. The provision for final action requires identity in language for approval resolutions to be enacted under the expedited procedure. The provision for final action in the NWPA requires identical language in approval resolutions for automatic substitution, creating a potential conflict in interpretation if resolutions are not identical. The NWPA requires identical approval resolutions for automatic substitution, potentially leading to conflicts in interpretation if resolutions differ. The Act does not specify a procedure for clearing approval resolutions received from the other house, leaving room for dilatory tactics. The current situation involves identical resolutions for repository siting approval. The NWPA requires identical approval resolutions for automatic substitution, potentially leading to conflicts in interpretation if resolutions differ. Differences in text between House and Senate measures could arise if amendments are made or new measures introduced. If the Senate adopts a resolution with different wording from the House, a point of order could be raised, requiring the measure to be cleared under general Senate rules. The Senate may face difficulties in approving a resolution for repository siting under the NWPA's expedited procedure, as amendments could lead to conflicts between House and Senate approval resolutions, making the automatic procedure unavailable. The constitutional power of each house allows for dealing with complications in approving a resolution for repository siting under the NWPA's expedited procedure. This power extends to procedural provisions and rules, which can be adopted, altered, waived, suspended, or modified as needed. The power to make rules also includes the power to interpret them. The power to interpret rules includes the ability to modify them, allowing each house to alter provisions of the expedited procedure for approving a resolution. Resolutions for siting approval can be considered under different procedures, and each house can amend its rules through resolutions. Resolutions for siting approval can be modified by each house through resolutions to effect permanent changes in statutory expedited procedures. The House is more likely to adopt such resolutions, with the Committee on Rules typically involved in the process. In the House, resolutions can be considered under procedures that allow for debate termination and amendment prohibition by vote. In the Senate, resolutions can be reported by the Committee on Rules and Administration or brought to the floor by the majority leader, subject to general Senate rules. Each house can modify rules for specific measures through special rules adopted before consideration begins. The House can consider resolutions under procedures allowing for debate termination and amendment prohibition by vote. Special rules can be adopted to modify the consideration of a siting approval resolution, including automatic final votes on Senate measures or different procedures from the Act. The House can consider resolutions under special rules that modify procedures, such as immediate call-up, debate time alterations, and amendment prohibition. A motion to suspend the rules for passing a measure requires a two-thirds' vote and limits debate to 40 minutes. Approval resolutions can also be considered by unanimous consent in the House, with specified terms of consideration. The Senate typically establishes modified procedures for consideration. The Senate often uses unanimous consent agreements to restrict amendments and control final action on measures. In contentious situations, obtaining unanimous consent for such agreements may be difficult. Senate rules also allow for the suspension of specified rules in relation to a given measure. The Senate often uses unanimous consent agreements to control final action on measures. Senate rules allow for the suspension of specified rules in relation to a given measure, which could be subjected to filibuster. The Senate interprets its rules through voting on procedural questions, determining the intent and effect of its rules. The Senate can decide on amended statutes under expedited procedures without filibuster, establishing precedent for the general meaning of the statutory provision. The House typically defers to the Speaker on procedural questions. The House has a tradition of deferring to the Speaker's rulings on procedural questions. If a point of order is raised regarding the statutory procedure for final action on an approval resolution, the House would likely accept the Speaker's ruling as precedent for future cases. The previous section discusses whether an approval resolution can be amended and still be eligible for expedited consideration under the Act. Certain provisions suggest that if the resolution is enacted in a different form, it may still qualify. Certain provisions of the NWPA suggest that the form of an approval resolution may raise questions about authorizing construction of a repository. The Act implies that the resolution must be passed within a 90-day period to achieve its purpose. Unlike other expedited procedure statutes, the NWPA appears to require Congress to use the specified means of approval for construction of a nuclear waste repository. The NWPA requires Congress to pass a resolution of approval for a nuclear waste repository within a 90-day period, or else the site will be disapproved. Congress cannot undermine its own ability to pass legislation within its constitutional power. The NWPA requires Congress to pass a resolution of approval for a nuclear waste repository within a 90-day period to prevent site disapproval. Legislation outside of NWPA provisions could suffice if explicitly superseding or repealing relevant provisions. A resolution for site approval must state \"there hereby is approved the site\" specified for the designation to become effective, allowing the Secretary of Energy to apply for construction authorization from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires Congress to pass a resolution of approval within 90 days for a nuclear waste repository site. If the resolution is not passed within the required time or includes additional language, it may not authorize the establishment of the repository. Congress must either pass the approval resolution as specified by the NWPA or enact separate legislation directing the construction of the repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires Congress to pass an approval resolution within 90 days for a nuclear waste repository site. The interpretation of the statute may suggest that approval implies authorization for construction, but to avoid any confusion, the resolution should explicitly authorize construction. This is separate from the eligibility of the resolution for expedited consideration under the Act. The NWPA specifies the form and time constraints for the approval resolution to be valid. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires Congress to pass an approval resolution within 90 days for a nuclear waste repository site. The resolution must be in a specified form and within time constraints. It does not need to follow the expedited procedure. The approval resolution can be amended and passed without adhering to the expedited procedure, as long as it becomes law as prescribed by statute. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires Congress to pass an approval resolution within 90 days for a nuclear waste repository site. The resolution must be in a specified form and within time constraints. Congress can approve the site designation even if it does not follow the expedited procedure, as long as the resolution becomes law as prescribed by statute. Any deviations from the prescribed procedures would be considered an implicit exercise of the chamber's power to alter the expedited procedure. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires Congress to pass an approval resolution within 90 days for a nuclear waste repository site. The resolution must meet specific form and timing requirements. While statutory procedures allow for implicit authorization by the Constitution, Congress cannot use rulemaking power to establish the effectiveness of an approval resolution that does not meet statutory requirements. The Act only gives congressional rules status to certain provisions governing approval resolutions, not all provisions. Congress may need to include an explicit statement in an approval resolution to ensure its intended force and effect if it does not meet statutory requirements. Legislation authorizing a nuclear waste repository must meet specific form and timing requirements under the NWPA to be eligible for expedited procedures. Approval legislation of a different kind would not be subject to certain restrictions imposed by the statute on procedural actions. Legislation authorizing a nuclear waste repository must meet specific form and timing requirements under the NWPA to be eligible for expedited procedures. If not, it would have to be considered under the general procedures of each house, subject to procedural decisions determined by each house's practices."
