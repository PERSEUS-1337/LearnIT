    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Park Centennial Challenge Fund Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Congress finds that national parks are American icons, the National Park System will celebrate its centennial in 2016, and the President's proposed National Park Centennial Initiative aims to provide $3 billion over ten years for park conservation. This Initiative includes a Centennial Challenge to match donations for projects and programs up to $100 million annually. The Act aims to establish a fund in the Treasury to finance projects and programs for the National Park System's centennial in 2016 and ensure conservation and enjoyment for the next century. The Act establishes the National Park Centennial Challenge Fund, with definitions for terms like Challenge Fund, Director, Secretary, Signature project or program, and Qualified donation. The National Park Centennial Challenge Fund is established in the Treasury, consisting of qualified donations and appropriations. The fund is available to the Secretary for signature projects without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation, following federal laws and standards. No funds are allocated for administrative costs. SEC. 5. SIGNATURE PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS. The Secretary will develop a list of signature projects and programs eligible for funding from the Challenge Fund, to be submitted to the President and relevant committees. These projects are aimed at preparing national parks for future conservation and enjoyment, with the ability to add new projects as needed. The Director can add signature projects or programs to the list, and the Secretary must notify the Committees when new projects are added. SEC. 6. DONATIONS AND MATCHING FEDERAL FUNDS. Beginning on October 1, 2007, the Secretary may transfer qualified cash donations to the Challenge Fund for the National Park Service. An amount equal to the donations received and pledged through letters of credit in each fiscal year, not exceeding $100 million annually, can be appropriated for matching purposes until September 30, 2017. The Secretary is allowed to consider a donation as received when a valid irrevocable letter of credit is issued. The Secretary cannot use funds from a letter of credit until the money is deposited in the Challenge Fund. This Act does not give the National Park Service any new authority to receive donations. The Secretary must report to Congress on signature projects and funding status with the President's budget submission. The Secretary is authorized to create necessary regulations for implementing the Act."
