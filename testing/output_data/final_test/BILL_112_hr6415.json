    "content": "The \"Claims Licensing Advancement for Interstate Matters Act\" or the \"CLAIM Act\" aims to accelerate claims adjusting for losses caused by natural or other disasters. The \"CLAIM Act\" allows independent claims adjusters to adjust claims for major disasters designated by the President, regardless of state licensure requirements. Adjusters must hold a valid license in their home state. The \"CLAIM Act\" allows independent claims adjusters to adjust claims for major disasters designated by the President, regardless of state licensure requirements. Adjusters must hold a valid license in their home state. If the National Association of Insurance Commissioners administers a multi-State examination, adjusters must pass it as certified by the NAIC. The \"CLAIM Act\" urges the NAIC to adopt a model independent claims adjuster licensing Act with standards for adjuster qualifications and experience. It also allows adjusters to work in multiple states without additional licensing requirements. The Congress urges the NAIC to develop a multi-State examination for independent claims adjusters to work in jurisdictions other than their home State. Examinees must be licensed, meet integrity requirements, and demonstrate cross-jurisdictional legal competence. The NAIC requires independent claims adjusters to demonstrate essential competence with cross-jurisdictional legal and regulatory concepts, including ethics testing. SEC. 5. INTERSTATE CLAIMS ADJUSTING LICENSING REFORMS. Interstate claims adjusting licensing reforms require states to enact laws and regulations for independent claims adjusters within the state and for non-home state adjusters to have reciprocity with other states. Compliance must be achieved within a 3-year period from the enactment of the Act. States must establish uniform criteria for licensing independent claims adjusters, which should be functionally equivalent to a model act. Reciprocity requirements allow adjusters licensed in their home state to practice in another state to the same extent as in their home state. Adjusters licensed in their home state can practice in another state by submitting proof of good standing and paying any required fees, as long as the home state's laws are equivalent to the model act. The NAIC determines compliance with adjuster licensing requirements, urging annual reviews for states in compliance. The United States District Court has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges arising from a State's non-compliance with adjuster licensing requirements. The court will apply the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5, United States Code, in reviewing any such challenge. SEC. 6. AUTHORITY FOR INTERSTATE CLAIMS ADJUSTING. After a 3-year period, independent claims adjusters can work in non-compliant states if they hold a valid license in their home state and pass a multi-state examination. They are not subject to additional state requirements. Independent claims adjusters can work in non-compliant states without additional state requirements. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"home state\" for independent claims adjusters as the state where they are licensed and maintain their principal place of residence or business. If their home state does not issue a license for the line of authority, it can be any other state where they are licensed and designated as their home state. The Act defines \"home state\" for independent claims adjusters as the state where they are licensed and maintain their principal place of residence or business. An independent claims adjuster is an individual or entity, other than a public adjuster, who determines the amount of a property, casualty, disability, or workers' compensation claim on behalf of an insurance policy or insurer. The term \"public adjuster\" refers to a person who, for compensation, negotiates the amount of a claim solely in relation to first party claims. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States, including territories and possessions. \"State law\" encompasses all laws, regulations, and decisions of any State that have the force of law, treating laws applicable only to the District of Columbia as State laws."
