    "content": "Competitors Aereo and FilmOn X retransmitted broadcast television to subscribers using similar technology, allowing viewing and recording of live programming on computers or mobile devices. Aereo did not negotiate licensing agreements with content providers, leading to accusations of \"stealing content.\" Subscribers accessed programs through a website account, choosing to watch live or record for later viewing. Aereo provided subscribers with the ability to watch and record live TV programs through a webpage, acting as both a television antenna and a DVR. Subscribers could pause, rewind, and watch programs even after the broadcast ended. The system allocated specific antennas to each subscriber upon request. The system allocated specific antennas to subscribers, who selected programming from broadcast television channels. Antennas received the signal, data was sent to a server, and a copy of the program was saved to a hard drive for the subscriber. The program was streamed from the hard drive, whether for watching or recording, with a slight delay for \"watch\" mode. Aereo assigned individual antennas to subscribers for watching or recording programs, creating separate copies stored in personal directories. Each subscriber could only access their specific copy. The 1976 Copyright Act grants copyright holders exclusive rights to control public performance of their works. The Copyright Act grants the right to authorize public performance of copyrighted works, including transmitting or displaying them to the public through various means. The \"transmit clause\" added in 1976 accommodates evolving technologies and is central to legal cases like Aereo and FilmOn. The transmit clause in the Copyright Act defines elements triggering public performance, including transmission of a work to the public through various media. It encompasses all forms of communication beyond the place of origin, such as radio and television broadcasting. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. defined transmitting a public performance as sending a signal to be received by the public. The Copyright Act defines \"to perform\" as reciting, rendering, playing, dancing, or acting a work, or showing its images or making its sounds audible. Courts distinguish between transmitting the work itself and transmitting a performance of the work. The Copyright Act distinguishes between transmitting the work itself and transmitting a performance of the work, especially in the context of audiovisual works like television broadcasts. Courts interpret \"public performance\" broadly to include spaces accessible to the public or places traditionally considered nonpublic. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that transmitting a video rental to a guest in a hotel room is considered a public performance due to the commercial nature of the rental. Courts use the phrase \"capable of receiving the performance\" to determine if a potential recipient is public or private. This interpretation was a key issue in cases leading up to the Aereo and FilmOn decisions. In Cartoon Network LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc. (\"Cablevision\"), the Second Circuit defined \"capable of receiving the performance\" as being able to receive a specific transmission of a performance. The Second Circuit ruled that the RS-DVR playback transmissions were not public performances as they were made to a single subscriber using a unique copy produced by that subscriber. Cablevision's RS-DVR system allowed each subscriber to access their individual playback copy, which was not available to the general public. The development of technology has expanded the definition of public performance, allowing for transmissions to be received in private places at different times without diminishing the public nature of the performance. In a legal case, transmissions of the same film to multiple customers in private rooms were considered public performances by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2012, broadcasters sued Aereo for copyright infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court denied a preliminary injunction against Aereo, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2013. The court ruled that Aereo's transmissions of broadcast television programs were not public performances under the Copyright Act. The Second Circuit examined the transmit clause in the Copyright Act regarding Aereo's one-antenna-per-subscriber service. The focus was on the \"performance of the work\" and \"members of the public capable of receiving the performance\" elements to address the alleged loophole. The issue was determining which performance triggers the analysis in the transmit clause: the broadcast of the program or the specific action. The Second Circuit analyzed the transmit clause in the Copyright Act in relation to Aereo's transmissions. They determined that each of Aereo's transmissions was considered an independent performance, not equal to the original broadcast performance, as argued by the plaintiffs. This interpretation focused on the unique copy created by Aereo's system for each specific user, rather than considering all transmissions in the aggregate. The Second Circuit's analysis of the transmit clause in the Copyright Act focused on individual copies made by an RS-DVR system, determining that each transmission was an independent performance. They emphasized that the definition of \"public\" under the transmit clause pertains to the potential audience of a particular transmission, not the overall audience for the underlying work. The Second Circuit supported the interpretation of the transmit clause, stating that the potential audience for the work could include anyone, making the distinction between public and nonpublic performances irrelevant. Aereo's retransmission system creates unique copies of programs for individual subscribers, leading the court to conclude that each transmission is only to one subscriber. The dissent in WNET v. Aereo criticized the majority's interpretation of the transmit clause, arguing that Aereo's transmissions are public performances according to the statute's plain meaning. The dissent referenced the legislative history to support the view that Congress intended for the public performance right to cover a broad scope, including transmissions at different times and places. The dissent in WNET v. Aereo disagreed with the majority's interpretation of the transmit clause, arguing that Aereo's transmissions are public performances as intended by Congress. The dissent highlighted the difference between Aereo's system and Cablevision's RS-DVR technology, stating that Aereo transmits material without a license. In a related case, Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. BarryDriller Content Systems PLC, broadcast television networks sued FilmOn for similar copyright infringement. The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted a partial injunction against FilmOn for copyright infringement by retransmitting broadcasts. In a separate case in the District of Columbia, FilmOn was also found to violate the plaintiffs' public performance rights. Both courts ruled that the retransmissions over the Internet constituted public performances and infringed on the plaintiffs' exclusive rights. The district courts found that FilmOn violated the plaintiffs' exclusive rights by retransmitting broadcasts over the Internet, constituting public performances. The courts focused on the \"performance of the work\" and \"members of the public capable of receiving the performance\" in interpreting the transmit clause. The California court emphasized that the transmit clause applies to the copyrighted work itself, not just its retransmission. The Second Circuit's focus in Aereo on the uniqueness of the individual copy from which the transmission is made is not justified by the Copyright Act. The D.C. district court clarified that \"performance\" refers to the communication of the original broadcast of a copyrighted work, citing legislative history supporting a broad interpretation of \"performance.\" This interpretation includes any act by which the rendition or showing is transmitted to the public. The D.C. district court defined \"public\" in the transmit clause to include any member of the public accessing the FilmOn service, regardless of technological access. It emphasized the communication to the public aspect and rejected the Second Circuit's focus on individual copies in Aereo. The court also highlighted that Congress did not intend for new technologies to bypass the public aspect of the transmit clause. The U.S. Supreme Court granted a petition for writ of certiorari in WNET v. Aereo, arguing that the Second Circuit decision misinterpreted the Transmit Clause. The petitioners contended that the focus should be on whether the public is capable of receiving the performance, not just the transmission. This decision raises concerns about the current broadcast programming model and its impact on broadcast television. Aereo defended its transmissions as not public performances, citing unique copies created for specific users. The Supreme Court denied FilmOn's intervention, with entertainment industry groups supporting broadcasters. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of broadcasters, stating that Aereo's transmissions constitute public performances under the Copyright Act. Major sports leagues and entertainment industry groups supported this decision, arguing that Aereo's service would harm the industry. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of broadcasters, stating that Aereo's technology is similar to cable television providers and violates the public performance right of the plaintiffs under the Copyright Act. The Court considered what constitutes a \"performance\" under the Copyright Act, looking at the legislative history for a precise definition. Congress amended the Act in 1976 in response to earlier decisions regarding cable television providers not \"performing\" under the Act. The Court in Aereo determined that Aereo \"performs\" under the Copyright Act by offering programming to viewers, similar to cable television providers targeted by the 1976 amendment. Aereo's technology, including antennas and servers, allows it to receive and offer programming to subscribers. The Court in Aereo case concluded that Aereo \"performs\" under the Copyright Act, similar to cable television providers targeted by the 1976 amendment. The Court then analyzed whether Aereo performs \"publicly\" by considering its similarity to cable providers transmitting television broadcasts to a substantial audience outside a normal circle of family and acquaintances. The relationship of the audience to the underlying work determines if they constitute \"the public,\" with Aereo transmitting programming to a large number of paying subscribers. The Court in the Aereo case determined that Aereo's transmission of programming to paying subscribers constitutes transmitting to the public. Justice Scalia's dissent criticized the majority's reasoning, suggesting it could lead to confusion in the future. The dissent agreed that Aereo's technology should not be allowed under a different standard of liability. The dissent in the Aereo case argued that Aereo does not \"perform\" as the key issue is who selects the content. They compared Aereo to a copy shop with a library card, highlighting the difference in technology between Aereo and cable providers. The dissent suggested a potential loophole in Aereo's liability for performance infringement. The dissent in the Aereo case highlighted the role of Congress in addressing loopholes in copyright law. In a separate case, the U.S. District Court declined to apply the Aereo decision to a dispute between Fox Broadcasting Company and Dish Network over public performance rights. Dish Network's \"Dish Anywhere\" service allowed subscribers to watch network programming on various devices, leading to a legal challenge. The U.S. District Court initially denied Fox Broadcasting's request for injunctive relief against Dish Network's \"Dish Anywhere\" service. The court ruled that Dish Anywhere does not publicly perform under the transmit clause as it transmits licensed programming legitimately to users' devices. The court differentiated Dish Anywhere from Aereo by highlighting Dish's license to transmit programming to subscribers. Both the Supreme Court and Second Circuit suggested the need for congressional action regarding technological advancements in transmission methods. The court emphasized the conflict between public and private transmissions in the evolving landscape of technology. The court highlighted the conflict between public and private transmissions in technology, emphasizing the need for congressional action. Bills introduced during the 113th Congress, such as the Television Consumer Freedom Act of 2013, would have impacted companies like Aereo and FilmOn by allowing cable providers to offer \"a la carte\" programming and denying broadcasters spectrum licenses for moving big event programming to cable. The Consumer Choice in Online Video Act, introduced by Senator Jay Rockefeller, aimed to increase consumer choice and competition in the online video programming marketplace by prohibiting unfair practices. The bill included provisions exempting antenna rental services like Aereo from certain fees, pending clarification on their legal status. It is uncertain if similar bills will be introduced in the 114th Congress."
