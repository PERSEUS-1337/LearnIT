    "content": "Federal agencies issue rules with the force of law, following procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act. The \"good cause\" exception allows agencies to bypass certain requirements if compliance is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. The Government Accountability Office found that many rules were issued without notice or comment, often justified by invoking the good cause exception. The \"good cause\" exception allows federal agencies to bypass certain rulemaking requirements if compliance is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Judicial analysis of this exception varies, leading to confusion on what constitutes \"good cause.\" The APA imposes procedural requirements on agency actions, with rules defined as statements designed to implement law or policy. Agencies must follow either formal or informal rulemaking provisions when formulating, amending, or repealing rules. The APA's formal rulemaking procedures are required if an agency's organic statute mandates rulemaking to be \"on the record.\" Otherwise, agencies follow the informal notice and comment rulemaking provisions of Section 553 of the APA. The public is provided with notice of proposed rulemaking, given the opportunity to submit written comments, and agencies must publish a final rule with a concise statement of its basis and purpose in the Federal Register not less than 30 days. Certain subject areas are wholly exempt from the requirements of Section 553 of the APA. Rules that do not regulate public conduct with the \"force and effect of law\" are also exempt from notice and comment requirements. These include rules concerning agency organization, procedure, or practice, interpretive rules, and general statements of policy. Legislative rules may be exempt from notice and comment requirements if an agency finds it impracticable to hold a comment period. The \"good cause\" exception in the APA allows agencies to issue substantive rules without notice and comment requirements. Federal courts have differing standards for reviewing agencies' use of this exemption, with unclear limiting principles. Some courts also debate whether a formal statement of reasons is necessary when bypassing these procedures. Some courts debate whether a failure to include a formal statement of reasons in the rule when bypassing Section 553's requirements is fatal to the rule's validity. The APA allows agencies to bypass notice and comment rulemaking for \"good cause\" and waive the 30-day publication rule for good cause. Courts differ on whether these are distinct standards, with some emphasizing public participation in notice and comment rulemaking and the need for affected parties to adjust their behavior during the waiting period. The D.C. Circuit has highlighted the importance of balancing the necessity for immediate action. The D.C. Circuit emphasizes the need to balance immediate implementation with fairness, while some courts debate the difference between the standards for waiving notice and comment and the 30-day rule. Courts may or may not distinguish between the two standards, but they can operate independently in practice. Good cause may be found for emergency regulations to be issued immediately. Courts have upheld agency invocations of good cause to bypass notice and comment rulemaking in cases of emergencies or where compliance is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. The APA limits good cause to these factors, and judicial application tends to converge. Courts have upheld agency invocations of good cause to bypass notice and comment rulemaking in cases of emergencies or where compliance is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Concern for public safety can constitute good cause to bypass notice and comment procedures, as seen in cases involving the Federal Aviation Administration's rules on pilot certificates and special operating procedures for air tour operators. The Federal Aviation Administration established special operating procedures for air tour operators due to safety concerns following multiple helicopter accidents. Courts require more than just a deadline to justify bypassing notice and comment procedures, insisting on a true exigency beyond agency convenience or efficiency goals. The APA allows agencies to invoke \"good cause\" to defer rule implementation in exceptional circumstances when compliance with notice and comment rulemaking is impracticable. This exception prevents agencies from bypassing APA procedures by waiting until the last minute to promulgate rules. An example is the D.C. Circuit ruling that the Office of Personnel Management's deferment of a health plan enrollment period due to litigation uncertainty did not violate the APA. In a case involving the APA, litigation and losses from a health benefit provider led to an emergency situation where starting the enrollment period without delay would have threatened the financial stability of the benefit program. The court found good cause to waive Section 553's requirements due to circumstances beyond the agency's control. Similarly, swift action may be allowed when a regulation is urgently needed in the public interest, as seen in a case where a temporary FAA rule was upheld in 1981 for allocating air carrier slots at National Airport in Washington, DC. In 1980, scheduling committees failed to reach an agreement on air carrier slots at National Airport. The court upheld the FAA's decision to shorten the comment period and implement the rule immediately, citing the need for efficient airspace utilization. In contrast, the EPA allowed noncompliant engine sales in 2012 without notice and comment for heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers. The D.C. Circuit found that the purpose of the IFR was not to prevent any threat to the public, but instead \"to rescue a lone manufacturer from the folly of its own choices.\" Saving one regulated entity, which could have avoided the problem with better business decisions, did not constitute good cause. Absent important public interest or a systemic threat to an entire industry, conclusory claims of an emergency situation are insufficient. The D.C. Circuit invalidated FERC's interim rule requiring pipeline companies to make disclosures and give advance notice before constructing new facilities. The agency's shift in policy regarding the construction of new facilities led to the publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and a binding interim rule. The court ruled that the agency did not establish good cause for the interim rule, as it lacked sufficient factual basis beyond the agency's own expertise. The D.C. Circuit refused to uphold the agency's reasoning that the interim rule was necessary to prevent environmental harm from companies rushing to begin new projects. The D.C. Circuit refused to uphold a finding of good cause for the agency's interim rule, stating that the mere existence of a statutory deadline is usually not enough. However, Congress can implicitly waive APA requirements when procedures and deadlines are irreconcilable. Imposition of a stringent deadline by Congress can support a good cause finding, especially when agency compliance with Section 553 is impracticable. Good cause to waive requirements can also be established when interim rules are necessary to comply with new laws. Courts have sometimes found good cause to bypass APA procedures when advance notice of a rule would harm the public. For example, the Ninth Circuit upheld the Secretary of Agriculture's use of good cause to issue rules on the orange market under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act. The Secretary can regulate certain commodities and set volume restrictions weekly, with public input through a committee meeting. The court upheld the Secretary's use of good cause to issue rules on the orange market under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act. Requiring 30-day advance notice for each rule would disrupt the regulatory program, but good cause was not established to bypass notice and comment requirements. The Secretary could notify the public weekly for comments. In response to emergencies like the 1970's oil crisis, courts have upheld agencies invoking good cause to bypass notice and comment rulemaking for price controls to prevent market disruptions. This was seen when the Federal Energy Administration issued regulations without notice to equalize prices, citing potential market dislocations if advance notice was given. Similarly, courts have supported bypassing notice and comment requirements to prevent worsening oil supply shortages or a rush to raise prices in the face of future price freezes. One potential reason for confusion is disagreement over the standard of review for agencies invoking the good cause exception. Federal courts agree it should be narrowly construed, with agencies needing to provide sufficient reasons to justify bypassing procedural requirements. Good cause cannot be used as an \"escape clause\" to avoid rulemaking procedures conveniently. Bald assertions by agencies do not create good cause, as it would undermine the rule. Courts differ on the proper standard of review in such cases. Courts are divided on the standard of review for agency actions, as outlined in the APA Section 706. They review agency factual findings, discretionary decisions, and legal conclusions, with varying levels of deference. Sometimes courts do not explicitly adopt standards of review, leading to difficulty in distinguishing between different situations. Courts review agencies' legal conclusions according to several standards, including Chevron deference for agency interpretations of statutory authority. The nature of federal court review involves considering multiple standards for agency actions, fact-findings, and discretionary decisions. Understanding the distinctions between these standards can be complex but is essential for judicial review. In Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, the Supreme Court established Chevron deference, requiring courts to defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute. This deference applies when Congress delegates authority to agencies to make rules with the force of law. When agencies interpret statutes, their legal interpretations are given deference by courts if there is a specific grant of power. In cases where agencies interpret detailed regulatory schemes with specialized experience, their views are respected based on their persuasiveness. However, the ultimate resolution of statutory interpretation questions lies with the judiciary. The weight given to agency interpretations depends on factors such as thoroughness, reasoning validity, and consistency with previous pronouncements. Courts review agency legal interpretations regarding compliance with statutes or the Constitution, with strict scrutiny. Agency actions can be challenged for failing to comply with required procedures under the APA, such as notice and comment rulemaking. Courts may review whether a rule is legislative or interpretive de novo, without deferring to the agency's decision. The APA distinguishes between formal and informal proceedings for agency factual findings. In formal proceedings, factual findings are reviewed under the \"substantial evidence\" test, while in informal proceedings, the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard is used for judicial review. The APA does not specify a particular type of review for agency factual determinations in informal proceedings. Lower courts agree that the difference in evidence required between formal and informal proceedings is nominal. Courts review agency discretionary decisions and will invalidate actions that are \"arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\" The scope of review is narrow, and courts should not substitute their judgment for that of the agency. The agency must provide a rational explanation for its actions based on relevant data. When reviewing agency decisions, courts look for a rational connection between the facts and the choice made. Factors considered include whether the agency relied on unauthorized factors, failed to consider important aspects, or provided explanations contrary to evidence. Courts use the arbitrary and capricious standard to review decisions like drug approvals or pollution permits. The good cause exception's standard of review varies among courts, with a key issue being how the agency's action is characterized. The agency's determination of good cause to bypass Section 553 is a discretionary decision or legal conclusion, with varying standards of review among courts. Some apply the arbitrary and capricious standard, while others review de novo for procedural challenges. The selection of a standard can be crucial, as some courts focus on narrowly construing the provision instead of clearly adopting a specific standard. A framework separate from the APA's text, derived from legislative history, has been developed for the good cause exception. Some circuits use a mixed standard of review combining arbitrary and capricious and de novo review. Recent judicial analysis of the Attorney General's actions under SORNA shows differing interpretations of the good cause exception. The Attorney General issued an interim rule applying sex offender registry requirements retroactively, bypassing notice and comment rulemaking. Various individuals challenged this under the good cause exception, citing uncertainty about the law's applicability. The Attorney General issued an interim rule applying sex offender registry requirements retroactively, bypassing notice and comment rulemaking. Various individuals challenged this under the good cause exception, citing uncertainty about the law's applicability. Courts have differed in their review of the determination, with some upholding the Attorney General's good cause finding while others invalidated it. The Sixth Circuit invalidated the good cause invocation, while other circuits disagreed on factors agencies may invoke. The Fourth Circuit upheld the Attorney General's action citing legal certainty, public safety, and public comments. The Eleventh Circuit also upheld the good cause finding focusing on public safety threats. The court ruled in favor of the Attorney General's good cause determination under arbitrary and capricious review, emphasizing the threat to public safety. It found that the retroactive rule reduced the risk of sexual assaults by allowing timely apprehension of sex offenders. The court highlighted the importance of legal certainty for convicted sex offenders regarding registration requirements. In contrast, circuits that rejected the determination did not find the need to eliminate uncertainty or protect public safety sufficient. The courts found the Attorney General's arguments for good cause to be largely conclusory and not based on independent facts. They reasoned that a bare desire to offer guidance is not sufficient reason to find good cause, and the public safety argument was just a rewording of the statutory purpose of the law. The courts emphasized that the mere assertion of harm continuing during the notice and comment period was not enough to justify the retroactive application of the rule. The appropriate remedy when a court rejects an agency's good cause finding can vary, as courts may vacate a rule if agencies fail to comply with APA's rulemaking requirements. However, if the failure to comply was harmless, the rule may not be vacated. Similarly, if a court rejects an agency's good cause finding, the rule may be vacated and remanded for compliance with APA. In some cases, lack of good cause may be deemed harmless, such as when it aligns with the larger purposes of the APA. The lack of good cause can be deemed harmless, meeting the larger purposes of Section 553 of the APA. Agency use of the good cause exception is important during presidential transitions, with outgoing administrations engaging in \"midnight rulemaking.\" Repealing a rule requires compliance with Section 553's notice and comment procedures, even if a different party takes office. Some Presidents impose a moratorium on new regulations at the start of their administration to gain control of the rulemaking process. For example, at the beginning of the George W. Bush Administration, federal agencies were instructed to halt proposed regulations and withdraw unpublished rules. During the start of new administrations, Presidents may impose a moratorium on new regulations to gain control of the rulemaking process. This was seen in the George W. Bush Administration, where federal agencies were directed to halt proposed regulations and withdraw unpublished rules. In response to memorandums from the White House, agencies sometimes delayed the effective date of rules by citing good cause, with some actions being challenged in court. The court invalidated a final rule delaying efficiency standards, ruling that there was no good cause to bypass notice and comment procedures. The court found that the agency's self-created emergency did not constitute a threat to the public interest, leading to the rule being invalidated. Various changes to the APA's good cause exception have been proposed by Members of Congress and commentators, including a bill introduced during the 114th Congress that aims to restructure Section 553's requirements. The bill would require agencies to provide notice of proposed rulemakings to the public and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, allow for 60 or 90 days for comments, and in certain circumstances, provide a public hearing for certain factual issues. If an agency finds compliance with Section 553 unnecessary, it may issue a final rule; if compliance is impracticable or contrary to the public interest, an interim rule may be issued, followed by notice and comment proceedings before finalization. The bill allows agencies to delay rule implementation for 90 days after a presidential inauguration for reconsideration, without changing the standard of review for good cause. It does not specify the factors for reviewing courts to consider."
