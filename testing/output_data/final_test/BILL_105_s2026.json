    "content": "The \"Asthma Inhaler Protection Act\" may require assessments related to transitioning from chlorofluorocarbons in metered-dose inhalers. Before issuing regulations on chlorofluorocarbons in inhalers, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs must assess health and environmental risks and benefits, as well as alternative policies for transitioning to non-chlorofluorocarbon treatments. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs must assess environmental risks and benefits, as well as alternative policies for transitioning to non-chlorofluorocarbon treatments for asthma and other respiratory diseases. Additionally, an assessment will be made on whether measures adopted by the Montreal Protocol will facilitate the transition in the United States without increasing health risks to patients by 2005. The Commissioner will assess health risks and benefits based on consultations with various stakeholders. Environmental risks and benefits will be assessed in accordance with relevant regulations, consulting with EPA and NOAA administrators. The Commissioner will assess health and environmental risks and benefits in consultation with stakeholders, EPA, and NOAA administrators. Reports will be prepared for each assessment and submitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register. Rulemaking on chlorofluorocarbons in metered-dose inhalers. The Commissioner will issue a regulation outlining criteria for determining essential uses of chlorofluorocarbon inhalers for eligibility for class I allowances under the Clean Air Act. Criteria will ensure availability of non-chlorofluorocarbon alternatives that are comparable in safety to existing treatments. The regulation issued by the Commissioner outlines criteria for determining essential uses of chlorofluorocarbon inhalers for eligibility for class I allowances under the Clean Air Act. The criteria focus on safety, effectiveness, therapeutic indications, dosage strength, delivery system, and availability to meet consumer needs. Limitations include not using a therapeutic class approach and ensuring that inhalers introduced before a determination are not considered adulterated or misbranded. SEC. 4. Approval of new medical products containing chlorofluorocarbons is addressed in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by inserting section 505B for approvals of new drugs containing chlorofluorocarbons. The Secretary will conduct a preliminary assessment of drug applications containing chlorofluorocarbons to determine if they offer significant therapeutic advancements. If not, the application will be terminated. This does not apply to supplements for previously approved applications. The use of a drug containing chlorofluorocarbons in a metered-dose inhaler is subject to regulation under the Asthma Inhaler Protection Act, regardless of its approval status under section 505."
