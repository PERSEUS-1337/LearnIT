The Real Estate Investment and Jobs Act of 2015 modifies ownership rules for Real Estate Investment Trusts, exempting stock held by qualified shareholders from being treated as a United States real property interest. The Real Estate Investment and Jobs Act of 2015 exempts stock held by qualified shareholders from being treated as a United States real property interest, with exceptions for qualified shareholders with applicable investors. The Real Estate Investment and Jobs Act of 2015 exempts stock held by qualified shareholders from being treated as a United States real property interest, with exceptions for applicable investors. A percentage of amounts realized by the qualified shareholder from stock disposition or distributions from the real estate investment trust is treated as amounts realized from United States real property interests. The term 'applicable investor' refers to a person holding more than 10% of stock in a real estate investment trust through a qualified shareholder. Constructive ownership rules apply for determining ownership. Ownership rules under subsection (c)(6)(C) apply to qualified shareholders who are foreign persons eligible for benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States, listed on recognized stock exchanges, and maintain records. For qualified collective investment vehicles, records must be maintained on individuals holding 5 percent or more of a specific class of interest. These vehicles are foreign entities eligible for reduced withholding rates on dividends under a tax treaty, even if they own more than 10 percent of a real estate investment trust's stock. Qualified collective investment vehicles, including those holding more than 10 percent of a real estate investment trust's stock, must meet specific criteria to be designated as such by the Secretary. Amendments have been made to ensure conformity with these requirements. Amendments have been made to sections 897(c)(1)(A) and 857(b)(3)(F) to include references to subsection (k) and section 897(k)(2)(A)(ii). Special ownership rules for determining stock ownership in qualified investment entities have also been updated. The updated rules for determining stock ownership in qualified investment entities in the United States state that a person holding less than 5 percent of a class of stock during the testing period is considered a U.S. person unless there is knowledge that they are not. Additionally, stock held by another qualified investment entity that is regularly traded on an established securities market or is a regulated investment company is also included. The rules for determining stock ownership in qualified investment entities in the United States specify that stock held by a domestically controlled investment company is considered held by a U.S. person. Additionally, stock held by another qualified investment entity not described in specific clauses is also treated as held by a U.S. person. The amendments made by subsection (a) specify that stock held by a domestically controlled investment company is considered held by a U.S. person. Additionally, stock held by another qualified investment entity is also treated as held by a U.S. person. Amendments to section 897(h) include conforming and technical changes. The amendments made by subsection (a) will take effect on the date of enactment and apply to dispositions and distributions by real estate investment trusts. The amendments made by subsection (b)(1) will determine domestic control upon enactment, while the amendment made by subsection (b)(2) will take effect on January 1, 2015. SEC. 3. EXCEPTION FOR INTERESTS HELD BY FOREIGN RETIREMENT OR PENSION FUNDS. Section 897 is amended to include an exception for United States real property interests held by qualified foreign pension funds or entities wholly owned by such funds. A qualified foreign pension fund is defined as an organization established outside the US to provide retirement benefits. The curr_chunk discusses pension benefits provided to participants or beneficiaries who are current or former employees of one or more employers. The benefits are subject to certain criteria, including not having a single beneficiary with a right to more than five percent of its assets or income, being subject to government regulation, and providing annual information reporting to tax authorities. Contributions to the pension fund must comply with the laws of the country where it is established. The curr_chunk discusses tax exemptions for trusts, corporations, or organizations, including deductions, reduced tax rates, and deferred taxation on investment income. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations. Additionally, the exemption from withholding under Section 1445(f)(3) applies to all persons except United States persons. The amendments made by this section apply to dispositions and distributions after the date of the enactment of this Act."
