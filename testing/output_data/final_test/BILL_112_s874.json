The amendment to section 5310 of title 38, United States Code, provides a surviving spouse of a veteran with a benefit for the month of the veteran's death if the veteran was receiving compensation or pension under chapter 11 or 15, or had a pending claim for benefits under these chapters at the time of death. The benefit amount is what the veteran would have received if they had not passed away. If a veteran dies while receiving benefits, the surviving spouse will receive accrued benefits. If a claim for benefits is pending at the time of the veteran's death, the spouse will receive the difference between the amount the veteran would have received and the amount already paid.

Payments made to the surviving spouse are exempt from delays in payment, and certain checks and payments cannot be requested to be returned.
