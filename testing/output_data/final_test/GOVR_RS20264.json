    "content": "The terrorist attacks of September 11 prompted Congressional leaders to consider tax measures to stimulate the economy, including a payroll tax credit and business tax cuts. The House passed H.R. 3090 on October 24, a $99 billion tax cut bill with provisions such as temporary expensing for equipment costs and a reduction in the capital gains rate. The Senate Finance Committee Chairman proposed a plan with various tax provisions, including expensing for businesses, extending tax provisions set to expire, and providing refunds to taxpayers. However, the proposal failed to garner enough votes on November 14. On December 19, the House passed a limited version of the bill H.R. 3529. The Senate considered H.R. 622, a bill with expensing and rebate tax provisions, passing it with only unemployment benefits. The House added their tax provisions to this bill on February 14. On March 7, the House passed a package of tax provisions and unemployment benefits (H.R. 3090), which was signed by the President on March 9. Congressional leaders in the 107th Congress were interested in tax cuts, building on actions taken in the previous Congress. In the 106th Congress, tax cuts were vetoed, while some provisions were not completed due to expected vetoes. Congressional leaders supported President Bush's tax plan presented in February 2001. The House passed separate bills, the Senate passed an omnibus bill costing $1.35 trillion over 2001-2011. On March 1, the House passed Chairman Thomas's $958 billion, 10-year bill implementing tax rate reductions. The House passed Chairman Thomas's $958 billion, 10-year bill on March 1, which would gradually reduce tax rates and include provisions for refundable tax credits against the Alternative Minimum Tax. Amendments were adopted to address changing withholding tables and transfers to the Social Security Trust Fund. Future tax legislation would address concerns such as the AMT, marriage penalty relief, child credit, and estate tax repeal. The Ways and Means Committee rejected a $249.5 billion plan by Democrats to lower the 15% tax rate and provide tax relief. A $585 billion Democratic alternative was also rejected, which included a 12% rate for $20,000 of taxable income. The committee also rejected a proposal for a trigger mechanism to prevent the Social Security surplus from being used for debt reduction. Members of both the House and Senate showed interest in a trigger. The Senate Finance Committee's plan included a new 10% rate bracket effective 2001. The Senate Finance Committee's plan included a new 10% rate bracket effective 2001 and gradually reduces the tax rates at the top. The proposal also raises the income level for the itemized deduction phase out and eliminates the personal exemption phase out, costing $846 billion. Additionally, the plan makes the child credit a permanent offset against the AMT and temporarily increases the AMT exemptions. These provisions were adopted as part of H.R. 1836, with a final bill including $874.9 billion of tax cuts largely following the Senate bill. The Ways and Means Committee reported H.R. 6, providing marriage tax penalty relief and child credits at a cost of $399.2 billion. The bill increased the child credit to $1000 by 2006, expanded the 15% bracket for joint returns, and made modifications to the earned income credit and alternative minimum tax. Democrats proposed an alternative with a new 12% bracket for the first $20,000 of taxable income, but it was rejected by the committee and on the House floor. The Democratic alternative was rejected on the House floor on a party-line vote on March 29; H.R. 6 was approved with 64 Democrats supporting it. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes doubling the standard deduction and the width of the 15% rate bracket for joint returns in its omnibus bill. A $3,000 increase in the phase out level of the EIC was also included. The child credit would be increased to $600 in 2001 and gradually doubled by 2010, refundable against up to 15% of earned income over $10,000. These provisions were adopted as part of H.R. 1836 with slightly different effective dates, costing $193 billion and $72.2 billion. A floor amendment to H.R. 1836 added provisions to expand the dependent care credit at a cost of $5.4 billion. The conference report included various tax credits and provisions, such as the child credit being refundable over $10,000 of income. H.R. 8 was reported by the Ways and Means Committee to gradually lower taxes over 10 years and fully repeal them. The bill would convert the current credit to an exemption in 2002, lower top rates, and eventually reduce all rates to zero by 2011. Carryover basis would be substituted at that time. The bill proposed a gradual repeal of estate taxes over 10 years, with carryover basis replacing step-up in basis in 2011. The exemption was set at $1.3 million ($3 million for surviving spouse) and would cost $193 billion over 10 years. A Democratic substitute measure to increase the exemption to $2 million in 2002 was defeated. The bill passed in the House with 54 Democrats supporting it. The Bush Administration's tax proposal included a gradual repeal of estate and gift tax provisions over 10 years, with offsetting revenue gained from the repeal of the State tax credit. Rates above 50% would be repealed in 2002, with the unified credit increasing to $1 million in 2002 and $2 million in 2004. A gift tax at a 40% rate would also be implemented. The Bush Administration proposed repealing estate and gift tax provisions gradually over 10 years, with a gift tax at a 40% rate. The Senate adopted provisions costing $138 billion, including expanding IRA contribution limits. H.R. 10 would increase IRA contribution limits over time, with costs rising to $5.8 billion by 2011 and $34 billion over 10 years. The House passed H.R. 10, which includes provisions for expanding IRA limits and a temporary credit for elective deferrals and IRAs. The Senate Finance Committee approved education tax benefits costing $20.7 billion and education provisions costing $33 billion in their omnibus bill. The Senate approved provisions for expanding tax benefits for education, including tax-free distributions from prepaid tuition programs, tax exempt bonds, and student loan interest deductions. These provisions were included in the final bill at a cost of $29.4 billion."
