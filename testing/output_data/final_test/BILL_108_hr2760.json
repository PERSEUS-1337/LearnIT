SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings regarding the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 1998, which resulted in a two-year war claiming 100,000 lives, displacing over 1,000,000 people, and causing significant economic and food production losses in both countries. Millions of dollars were diverted from development projects to military activities, exacerbating the threat of famine in the region. The State of Eritrea signed the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Algiers, Algeria in 2000 under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement established a Boundary Commission to delimit and demarcate the colonial treaty border between Eritrea and Ethiopia based on relevant treaties and international law.

The agreement states that the determinations of the Commission are final and binding, with both parties agreeing to respect the border, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of the other party. The United Nations Security Council endorsed the Algiers Agreements, including the neutral Boundary Commission described in the agreement. Council Resolutions 1312 (July 31, 2000) to 1560 (September 14, 2004) were passed. The Boundary Commission's decision on Badme was contested by Ethiopia in 2003. The Ethiopian Ministry of Information accused the Boundary Commission of unfairness in implementing the border ruling and misinterpreting the Algiers Agreements. Prime Minister Zenawi of Ethiopia expressed concerns that Ethiopia might reject the Commission's decisions, potentially leading to war. The United Nations Security Council urged Prime Minister Zenawi of Ethiopia to accept the boundary decision to prevent regional conflict. Secretary General Kofi Annan offered mediation to resolve the impasse. President Isaias of Eritrea has refused to engage with the Special Envoy appointed by the United Nations Secretary General to resolve the impasse between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Despite assurances that the Special Envoy's appointment was not meant to renegotiate the Boundary Commission's decision, Eritrea's president remains unwilling to participate in political dialogue. The Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintains its stance that the current demarcation line could cause conflict in border communities. Secretary General Annan urges Ethiopia to reaffirm acceptance of the Boundary Commission's decision and cooperate fully with the Commission. Congress believes that Ethiopia and Eritrea should implement the Algiers Agreements, including accepting the Delimitation Decision by the Boundary Commission. They are also urged to cooperate with the UN Special Envoy for Ethiopia-Eritrea, Lloyd Axworthy, in implementing the agreements and relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Congress expresses support for the Boundary Commission established by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and calls on the international community to continue supporting the United Nations trust fund for demarcation between Ethiopia and Eritrea. It declares a policy to limit US assistance if either country does not comply with the Algiers Agreements. Congress also condemns Ethiopian officials criticizing the Boundary Commission. Ethiopian officials criticized the Boundary Commission's decision and Congress calls on Ethiopia to fulfill its commitments under the Algiers Agreements, accept the decision, and cooperate with its implementation. Congress also condemns Eritrea's refusal to engage in dialogue to resolve the impasse. SEC. 6. LIMITATIONS ON UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE. Limitations on economic and military assistance to Ethiopia or Eritrea are contingent on compliance with the Algiers Agreements. Exceptions include humanitarian aid, human rights promotion, and HIV/AIDS prevention. The President may waive limitations on assistance to Ethiopia or Eritrea for peacekeeping or counterterrorism if in the national interest of the United States. SEC. 7. INTEGRATION AND BORDER DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE. After the border demarcation between Ethiopia and Eritrea is finalized, the President will establish an initiative with both governments to provide assistance in the border region. This assistance aims to reduce humanitarian impacts, prevent conflicts, and support social and economic development projects identified by local authorities for sustainable integration, development, and trade. Examples of projects include farming initiatives to promote economic development and free flow of goods. The initiative aims to promote economic development and trade across the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea, provide compensation for displaced families, manage movement of people, increase basic services in the region, and support peace efforts. SEC. 8. REPORT.\n\nThe President must regularly report to Congress on progress towards finalizing the border demarcation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, including compliance with the Algiers Agreements and cooperation with international efforts to resolve the impasse."
