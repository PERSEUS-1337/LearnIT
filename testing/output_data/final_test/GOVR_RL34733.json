    "content": "The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been in effect since January 1994, playing a crucial role in the economic relationship between Mexico and the United States. The two countries are closely connected in trade, investment, and various mutual interests. Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n met with President Barack Obama in May 2010 to discuss bilateral, hemispheric, and global issues, reaffirming their shared values on safety, social and economic well-being, and security of citizens in both countries. The two presidents discussed enhancing economic competitiveness and progress in building a Twenty-First Century border with new crossings and bridge projects. The 111th Congress is expected to focus on counternarcotics, economic conditions, migration, trade, and border issues in Mexico. Comprehensive immigration reform may also be revisited. This report provides an overview of Mexico's motivations for joining NAFTA, its economy, effects of NAFTA, and policy options for Congress. In 1990, Mexico's President approached the US President to propose a free trade agreement to boost economic growth, attract foreign investment, and create jobs. Mexico's entry into NAFTA aimed to diversify exports, attract investment, and reduce poverty. In the 1980s, Mexico shifted from protectionist trade policies to experiencing economic challenges like inflation and declining living standards. In the 1980s, Mexico faced economic challenges such as inflation and a declining standard of living due to the 1982 debt crisis. The government focused on privatizing state industries and moving towards trade liberalization. President Miguel de la Madrid initiated measures to restructure the economy, including steps towards unilateral trade liberalization and attracting foreign investment. In the 1980s, Mexico implemented trade liberalization policies to attract foreign investment and lower trade barriers. Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1986, leading to closer ties with the United States. A bilateral trade and investment agreement was established in 1987, addressing issues such as textiles, agriculture, steel, investment, technology transfer, and intellectual property. In the 1980s, Mexico implemented trade liberalization policies to attract foreign investment and lower trade barriers. Mexico joined GATT in 1986, leading to closer ties with the United States. A bilateral trade and investment agreement was established in 1987, addressing textiles, agriculture, steel, investment, technology transfer, and intellectual property. This agreement significantly improved trade relations between Mexico and the United States, leading to further advancements in trade relations. In June 1990, Mexico proposed negotiations for a free trade agreement with the United States, supported by Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari and George H.W. Bush. Mexico's economy heavily relies on exports to the US, with 31% of GDP coming from exports in 2008. The close trade ties between the two countries impact social and political issues like poverty and migration. Since 1994, Mexico's economy has been influenced by various factors such as market-opening measures, financial crises, exchange rates, and business cycles, in addition to NAFTA. Trade-related job changes post-NAFTA likely accelerated pre-existing trends and are not solely due to the trade agreement. It is challenging to isolate NAFTA's economic effects from other factors, as Mexico has faced significant economic impacts from events like unilateral trade liberalization measures and the 1995 currency crisis. In the mid-1990s, Mexico faced a financial crisis due to various factors, including the assassination of a presidential candidate leading to concerns about currency devaluation. The government issued dollar-indexed notes to address the current account deficit, but investor confidence did not fully recover after the 1994 presidential election. In the aftermath of the 1994 presidential election, Mexico's investment flows did not meet expectations, leading to a widening current account deficit. The government faced a liquidity crisis as foreign direct investment decreased, prompting a shift to a floating exchange rate regime. This caused a 50% devaluation of the peso, plunging the country into a deep recession. To mitigate the crisis, the Mexican government implemented economic restructuring measures with assistance from the United States and the IMF, receiving up to $50 billion in emergency financial support. The Mexican government implemented an emergency financial support package of up to $50 billion to address the economic crisis caused by the peso devaluation. Tight monetary and fiscal policies, including austerity measures like budget cuts and tax increases, were adopted to reduce inflation. The devaluation led to increased exports but also resulted in a decline in real income, impacting the poorest segments of the population and the emerging middle class. Despite the challenges, the shift to an export-based economy and the effects of NAFTA helped soften the impact of the currency devaluation. After experiencing significant improvements in per capita GDP and living standards, the Mexican economy faced challenges such as the 1982 debt crisis leading to negative productivity growth. Economic reforms in the late 1980s boosted GDP growth to 3.8% between 1990 and 1994. Following the 1995 financial crisis, GDP growth dropped by 6.2% but rebounded in the next three years at 5%-6% annually. Real GDP growth fluctuated from 6.2% in 2000 to -0.2% in 2001, with improvements in the US economy aiding Mexico's growth. Despite fluctuations, GDP grew by 4.0% in 2004, 4.9% in 2006, and 1.5% in 2008, but the 2009 global financial crisis had a severe impact on the Mexican economy. The global financial crisis had a strong adverse effect on the Mexican economy, with the GDP growth rate contracting by 6.6%. Estimates for 2010 show a possible growth rate of 4.2%. Poverty is a serious economic problem in Mexico, with efforts to address it being a priority for past administrations. Despite progress in poverty reduction, it remains a significant challenge for the country's development, especially for indigenous groups living in extreme poverty. The 1995 currency crisis was a setback to poverty alleviation efforts in Mexico. The poverty levels in Mexico did not decline to pre-crisis levels until 2002. The percentage of people living in extreme poverty fell from 24% in 2000 to 14% in 2006, but increased to 18% in 2008. Moderate poverty also decreased from 54% in 2000 to 43% in 2006, but rose to 47% in 2008. Poverty in Mexico is widespread, especially in rural areas, and is linked to high levels of inequality in access to healthcare, education, and work opportunities. In rural areas, 61% lived in moderate poverty and 32% in extreme poverty in 2008. Urban areas had rates of 40% and 11%, respectively. Mexico's main poverty reduction program is Oportunidades, providing cash transfers to families in poverty who meet certain criteria. The program aims to improve nutrition, health, and education. It covers five million households, mainly in the six poorest states. Monthly benefits range from $15 to $150. NAFTA is a free trade agreement that covers five million households in Mexico. It eliminated trade barriers and provided duty-free treatment for a majority of U.S. imports and exports to Mexico. The agreement also included provisions for market access, foreign direct investment protection, and intellectual property rights. Studies predicted positive effects on the Mexican economy, narrowing the gap in prices and wages with the U.S. NAFTA has brought economic and social benefits to Mexico. Studies have found that NAFTA has brought economic and social benefits to the Mexican economy, but the benefits have not been evenly distributed. The effects on the Mexican economy have been modest, with trade increases starting in the late 1980s. While NAFTA helped Mexico get closer to the levels of development in the United States and Canada, it has not been enough to lower income disparities within Mexico or between Mexico and its North American neighbors. Since NAFTA's implementation, Mexican manufacturers have adapted to U.S. technological innovations, leading to positive impacts on job quantity and quality. The macroeconomic volatility in Mexico has decreased, and business cycles in Mexico, the United States, and Canada have become more synchronized. Economists suggest that NAFTA played a role in Mexico's economic recovery after the 1995 currency crisis by adhering to trade liberalization obligations with the U.S. and Canada. NAFTA supported Mexican economic reforms, boosting investor confidence. FDI in Mexico would have been 40% lower without NAFTA. The agreement aimed to improve Mexico's economy and narrow the income gap with the US. However, economic convergence in North America may not happen due to fundamental differences. Domestic factors play a significant role in economic disparities between the two countries. Studies suggest that Mexico needs to invest more in education, innovation, and infrastructure to narrow income disparities with the United States. Similar issues are faced by other Latin American countries. The quality of domestic institutions, innovation dynamics of firms, and skills of the labor force limit income convergence. Mexico's economic improvement depends on enhancing national institutions, which have not progressed significantly compared to other Latin American countries post-NAFTA. Mexico's failure to converge with U.S. income levels post-NAFTA is attributed to poorly implemented economic reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The lack of proper institutional framework hindered privatization and trade liberalization efforts, leading to reduced economic growth and the emergence of private monopolies. The study highlights Mexico's failure to implement necessary economic reforms post-NAFTA, leading to private monopolies dominating public sectors. The government's restrictions on macroeconomic policies limit their ability to respond to external shocks, while the lack of a domestic engine for internal demand increases vulnerability to US economic conditions. Mexican wages post-NAFTA are influenced by various economic variables, not just trade integration. Mexican wages have fluctuated over the years, with increases in the 1980s and 1990s followed by stagnation and declines in 2008 and 2009. Trade liberalization measures may have impacted the ratio between skilled and non-skilled workers in Mexico's manufacturing industry. NAFTA brought economic and social benefits to Mexico, but the country failed to implement necessary economic reforms post-NAFTA, leading to private monopolies dominating public sectors. The World Bank study on NAFTA in 2000 found economic and social benefits for Mexico but did not narrow the wage gap with the US. While some Mexican states saw positive effects on wages and employment, trade liberalization increased wage differentials within the country. Studies on NAFTA's impact on wages in Mexico vary, with some attributing higher wages for skilled workers to technological changes from trade. The authors of a report attribute the increase in wage inequality in Mexico to technological change post-NAFTA, rather than trade liberalization alone. Mexico's trade with the US grew significantly after 1994, resulting in a trade surplus of $84.8 billion in 2008. In 2008, Mexico had a trade surplus of $84.8 billion with the United States, with U.S. imports totaling $216.3 billion and exports totaling $131.5 billion. However, in 2009, U.S.-Mexico trade declined due to the global financial crisis, with imports decreasing by 19% and exports by 20%. The top U.S. imports from Mexico in 2009 were oil and gas, motor vehicles, audio and video equipment, and communications equipment. Exports to Mexico included motor vehicle parts, petroleum products, chemicals, and oilseeds. NAFTA played a significant role in the increase in trade between the two countries since 1994. The devaluation of the Mexican peso in 1995 affected purchasing power and boosted U.S. imports from Mexico. Trade between Mexico and the U.S. increased until 2001 when the U.S. economic downturn slowed it down. Despite positive effects of NAFTA on the Mexican economy, the impact was uneven across regions and sectors, with higher wages and employment in states with more foreign investment and trade. Trade liberalization effects vary among regions. It can narrow income disparities with other countries but may lead to larger disparities within a country. Initial conditions in Mexico determined economic growth post-NAFTA. States with better infrastructure and human capital saw more positive impacts, while poorer states grew slower, widening income differentials. NAFTA had varying effects on different regions in Mexico. Poorer southern states grew slower post-NAFTA due to low education levels and infrastructure, making them less prepared for trade liberalization. The agricultural sector in Mexico faced worker displacement, partly due to NAFTA and partly due to Mexico's own reform measures in the 1980s. Mexico implemented unilateral reform measures in its agricultural sector, including privatizing lands distributed to ejidos, abolishing CONASUPO, and removing staple price supports and subsidies. These reforms coincided with NAFTA negotiations and continued after its implementation in 1994, making it challenging to separate their effects from NAFTA. With Mexico's entry into NAFTA, prices for certain Mexican crops were expected to decrease due to the removal of price and trade interventions. The \"law of one price\" was anticipated for all agricultural goods in North America, leading to equalized prices between Mexico and the United States. Agricultural reforms alongside NAFTA were expected to result in competition and lower prices for basic crops like grains and oilseeds produced in Mexico. After NAFTA, Mexican agricultural production faced competition from U.S. goods. The agricultural sector saw shifts in production, with some sectors decreasing due to lower-priced imports, while export-oriented sectors like fruits and vegetables increased. Employment was expected to rise in some areas, but not enough to offset job losses in other sectors. Mexican prices for basic crops dropped post-NAFTA, leading to increased imports, but overall production did not decrease. The price of corn in Mexico decreased after NAFTA, with Mexican corn production increasing despite the lower prices. Production increased by 41% from 1994-2001, with a faster growth rate than U.S. corn production during the same period. After NAFTA, Mexican corn production increased by 41% from 1994-2001, outpacing U.S. corn production growth. Mexican exports to the United States and Canada also rose significantly, with a sharp increase in categories like sugar, beverages, and grains. U.S. foreign direct investment in Mexican food processing doubled from 1993 to 2000. Agricultural employment changes in Mexico post-NAFTA cannot be solely attributed to trade liberalization. The impact of NAFTA on Mexican agriculture cannot be solely attributed to trade liberalization, as industrialization also plays a significant role. As countries become more industrialized, agriculture's share of the economy and workforce decreases. For example, South Korea saw a decline in agricultural GDP share from 25% in 1970 to 5% in 2000 due to rapid industrialization. The Institute for International Economics report on NAFTA discusses its effects on the agricultural sector, using international comparisons to analyze the Mexican agricultural labor force. The report highlights the impact of NAFTA on Mexican agriculture, showing a high proportion of agricultural labor force before NAFTA. It predicts a decline in farm employment by 800,000 workers after Mexican tariffs were eliminated. The shift towards large-scale farms and capital-intensive food processing has led to a decrease in small-scale farms and household farmers. Studies indicate a drop in the number of Mexicans employed in rural agriculture and a decrease in the value added by Mexican agriculture. After NAFTA, Mexico's agricultural supply composition remained largely unchanged, with some commercial farmers shifting to export crops. Productivity increased for irrigated crops, but non-irrigated agriculture did not see growth. Disparities in productivity between northern and southern states were attributed to poor infrastructure and limited access to credit for small farmers in rural areas. The Mexican government created Financiera Rural in 2002 to help rural farms access microcredits for machinery and technology. The impact of NAFTA on migration is complex, influenced by factors like agricultural productivity, sectoral adjustments, urban growth, and labor demands in the US. The study by Endowment for International Peace analyzes Mexico's experience post-NAFTA, focusing on the impact on economy, agriculture, and migration patterns. It concludes that NAFTA accelerated Mexico's transition to a liberalized economy but did not adequately address the social and environmental effects of increased trade. Agricultural policies under NAFTA favored large commercial farmers over subsistence farmers, leading to rural-urban migration driven by agricultural liberalization. The study notes that rural-urban migration in Mexico has been ongoing since 1960, with some attributing it to NAFTA. However, economists argue that such migration is common during industrialization. The high poverty levels in rural areas highlight the need for policymakers to understand Mexico's farming structure. In response to potential NAFTA effects, the Mexican government established PROCAMPO in 1993 to provide income support to farmers. In 1993, Mexico established PROCAMPO to provide income support to farmers. Budget cuts due to the 1995 peso crisis affected the program. Alianza para el Campo and Produce Capitaliza were created to improve agricultural productivity and provide assistance to livestock producers. There is a significant subsidy gap between the United States and Mexico, leading to mixed views on NAFTA in Mexico. Some analysts suggest safeguard measures for Mexican farmers if the US continues to subsidize corn production. According to a survey by CIDE and COMEXI, the majority of Mexicans view NAFTA favorably and support trade liberalization with the US and Canada. There is a positive view of globalization, but opinions are divided on renegotiating NAFTA and forming new trade agreements. The survey by CIDE and COMEXI found that both the general public and \"leaders\" in Mexico view international trade favorably, ranking export promotion as one of Mexico's top foreign-policy objectives. They believe that international trade benefits the economy, job creation, Mexican businesses, poverty reduction, and living conditions. 96% of \"leaders\" and 79% of the general public support increasing international trade. Critics of NAFTA in Mexico have protested against its negative impact on the country's agricultural sector. In early 2008, labor and farmers' coalitions rallied against the final tariff eliminations on corn under NAFTA. Thousands marched in Mexico City, mainly small farmers, criticizing the government for not adequately supporting them against competition from the US. They argue that most government aid goes to large agricultural businesses, leaving small farmers at a disadvantage. Small farmers fear they cannot compete with heavily subsidized American farms in the long run. Mexico's economic ties with the US are crucial for both countries. Economic studies on NAFTA's effects on Mexico and Mexican views could inform reopening parts of the agreement or alternative policy options. Suggestions include negotiating trade agreements more beneficially, enhancing economic integration between Mexico and the US, and addressing income disparity issues. Proponents advocate for strengthening NAFTA side agreements and implementing measures to promote economic integration in North America. Some proponents suggest that NAFTA should expand beyond a free trade agreement due to competition from China and India. They propose forming a customs union or common market, but critics argue that NAFTA has already caused harm to the US and Mexican economies. Further economic integration would require cooperation from Mexico and Canada, as well as approval from the US Congress. However, expanding NAFTA to a customs union or common market is unlikely in the near future. One option to address Mexico's income disparities with the United States is to expand the mandate of the North American Development Bank (NADBank) beyond environmental and border issues. This could include transportation and other infrastructure projects, extending eligibility to the entire region of Mexico. Some policymakers have informally discussed this possibility. Some policymakers suggest expanding NADBank's mandate to cover infrastructure, communications, and education in all of Mexico. Increased cooperation with Mexico to address poverty and help farmers in southern states is also proposed. Withdrawal from NAFTA was considered in the 111th Congress. In the 111th Congress, a bill (H.R. 4759) was introduced for the United States to withdraw from NAFTA. The bill had 27 co-sponsors and would require the president to give notice to Mexico and Canada, with withdrawal occurring six months after enactment. Supporters believe NAFTA has led to job losses, while opponents argue it has been successful and withdrawal would harm the economy."
