    "content": "Science and technology policy issues that reach the presidential level typically involve multiple agencies, substantial budgetary, economic, national security, or foreign policy dimensions, controversy, and high visibility to the public. Presidents seek advice from trusted sources on available options and implications. Throughout U.S. history, Presidents have obtained S&T advice from federal scientists, engineers, and advisory boards, although these boards lacked permanency due to the lack of a statutory foundation. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) to emphasize the importance of research and development (R&D) for economic and military strength. The federal R&D enterprise significantly contributed to the Allied victory in World War II and subsequent U.S. industrial strength. President Roosevelt sought recommendations on utilizing research infrastructure in times of peace, leading to the framework outlined in Science: The Endless Frontier by OSRD Director Vannevar Bush. Director Bush's response, Science: The Endless Frontier, emphasized the importance of scientific progress in meeting the nation's economic, national security, and social needs. The report recommended that the Federal Government take on new responsibilities for promoting the creation of scientific knowledge and developing scientific talent in youth. Subsequent Presidents established mechanisms for obtaining science and technology advice within the Executive Office of the President and enhancing interagency coordination. Organizations like the Office of the Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and the Office of Science and Technology were created for this purpose. The establishment of interagency coordination mechanisms for science and technology advice within the Executive Office of the President included various councils and committees under different administrations. President Nixon abolished the Office of Science and Technology, with its functions taken over by the National Science Foundation and the National Security Council. President Ford supported the reinstatement of a science advisory mechanism in the White House. President Ford signed the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 into law, establishing the OSTP and the position of OSTP Director. Policy tensions and power struggles between OSTP and other EOP offices, as well as with the science community, have been ongoing. For example, Carter Administration OSTP Director Frank Press clashed with the Council on Environmental Quality over federal subsidies for the solar power industry. Reagan Administration OSTP Director George Keyworth also faced controversy in the science community. George Keyworth, the OSTP Director during the Reagan Administration, disagreed with the science community's view of his role, stating that he should not represent their interests. Tensions arose between Keyworth and other White House officials over federal funding for commercial technology development, leading to public disputes. The Reagan Administration faced tensions over federal funding for commercial technology development, with OSTP Director George Keyworth disagreeing with the science community's view of his role. Despite criticism, the Administration clarified its stance on industrial policy, stating that it does not target specific industries or technologies for support. Presidential S&T policy advisors and organizations were adapted to suit the needs of subsequent Presidents, with the establishment of the President's Committee on Science and Technology (PCST) playing a key role. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) plays a key role in providing scientific and technological analysis for the President. It oversees various advisory panels and councils, including the President's Committee on Science and Technology (PCST) and the Intergovernmental Science, Engineering, and Technology Advisory Panel (ISETAP), which has now been subsumed by the National Science and Technology Council. The OSTP's mission is defined by three components. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) defines its mission as providing the President with scientific and technical advice, ensuring policies are based on sound science, and coordinating scientific work in the Executive Branch. Its strategic goals include maximizing the impact of federal investments in science and technology, improving government program processes, and maintaining professional relationships with key stakeholders. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) plays a crucial role in providing the President with scientific advice, coordinating scientific work in the Executive Branch, and maintaining relationships with key stakeholders. It also serves as a conduit of information for agency executives, helps coordinate S&T strategies, and resolves interagency conflicts over areas of S&T responsibility and leadership. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) plays a key role in advising the President on scientific, engineering, and technological issues at the highest level of government. The OSTP Director is responsible for providing advice on national concerns such as the economy and national security, while also coordinating S&T strategies and resolving interagency conflicts. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) advises the President on various national concerns, evaluates federal efforts in science and technology, assists in budget reviews, and coordinates research and development programs. The President appoints the OSTP Director, who serves as the President's science advisor. The OSTP Director, also known as the President's science advisor, is appointed by the President and is subject to Senate confirmation. The Director is not a member of the President's Cabinet. The President can also appoint up to four OSTP Associate Directors, who are confirmed by the Senate and compensated at a specific rate. The number of Associate Director positions has varied under different Presidents. President Obama established four OSTP Associate Director positions with specific areas of responsibility: environment and energy, national security and international affairs, science, and technology. The degree of access to the President and other EOP decision makers may vary based on the formal positions held by the President's science advisor. Some question the level of presidential access available to the OSTP Director, who is not a Cabinet-level official. The OSTP Director is not a Cabinet-level official. Some Presidents appoint their science advisors to the Senate-confirmed position of OSTP Director and as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST). President Obama appointed John Holdren to serve as both Director of OSTP and APST, while President George W. Bush appointed John Marburger only as OSTP Director. The relationship between Congress and the President's science advisor varies depending on their roles. Congress can require the OSTP Director to testify, but APSTs may choose not to testify based on separation of powers principles. The OSTP Director, not a Cabinet-level official, may choose not to testify before Congress based on separation of powers and executive privilege. There is ambiguity regarding Congress's authority to require testimony from an individual holding both the Director of OSTP and APST titles, depending on the capacity and subject matter. The OSTP Director advises the President on policy, appointments, budget issues, scientific developments, and serves as a communication conduit between the EOP and the S&T community. Some Directors focus on communicating the views of the S&T community to the EOP, while others emphasize communicating the EOP's views to the S&T community. The OSTP Director, serving as APST, manages the National Science and Technology Council to coordinate S&T policy, establish goals for federal S&T investments, and provide coordination during special events. Additionally, the APST co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to gather consensus from the S&T community on Administration issues. The OSTP Director also plays a role in National Security and Emergency Preparedness communications policies. The OSTP Director advises the President on prioritizing radio spectrum and wired communications for National Security and Emergency Preparedness functions. They also issue priorities for analyses, studies, and research on NS/EP communications. The OSTP Director does not have direct authority over federal agencies or the Office of Management and Budget but participates in the budget process. In the budget process, the OSTP and OMB prioritize R&D activities through agency recommendations, interagency working groups, and joint memorandums. The OSTP advises agencies on budget preparation and R&D priorities. In the budget process, OSTP advises agencies on budget preparation and R&D priorities, providing guidance to agencies with large budgets and programs crossing agency boundaries. Agencies submit budget proposals to OMB, and OSTP works with OMB to review and ensure alignment with Administration plans. OSTP advises on funding levels and program priorities during agency negotiations with OMB. Its role in the final step is to advise on proposal quality and alignment with the President's priorities. President Clinton established the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) in 1993 to coordinate science and technology policy across the federal government. The NSTC, composed of department and agency heads, aims to ensure S&T policy decisions align with the President's goals and integrate his agenda across the government. The council's principal functions include coordinating the S&T policymaking process and ensuring science and technology considerations in federal policies. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) ensures science and technology are considered in federal policies and programs. It assists in recommending R&D budgets and advising on agency submissions. The President chairs the NSTC, which has five committees focusing on various specialized topics. The council is managed by OSTP staff and detailees in conjunction with federal agency staff. The NSTC oversees interagency working groups and taskforces on specialized topics, with lower-ranking staff as members. Congress has mandated the NSTC to coordinate federal activities on ocean acidification, develop a national research program on oceans' role in human health, and oversee the National Nanotechnology Program. Additionally, the NSTC is responsible for coordinating federal programs in STEM education and advanced manufacturing. The NSTC is responsible for coordinating federal programs in advanced manufacturing research and development, overseeing interagency working groups on specialized topics, and addressing deficiencies in federal research facilities. Additionally, it may be assigned responsibilities to meet non-specific congressional mandates, such as establishing a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness as directed by the America COMPETES Act. President George W. Bush assigned the responsibility of establishing a Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to the NSTC Committee on Technology instead of creating a new council. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) advises the President on science, technology, and innovation policy, with diverse perspectives and expertise from individuals outside the federal government. PCAST was created in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush and has been reestablished by Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama. The current executive order gives PCAST a broad remit to provide advice on various policies affecting these areas. PCAST advises the President on science, technology, and innovation policy, with a broad remit that includes policy affecting various areas such as the economy, energy, environment, and national security. The committee consists of 20-25 distinguished individuals from industry, education, research institutions, and other organizations outside the federal government. PCAST is also involved in advisory committees related to innovation and nanotechnology. OSTP provides funding and support for PCAST, with oversight through co-chair John Holdren. PCAST's funding was transferred to DOE, but OSTP still maintains policy and programmatic oversight. OSTP's budget and staffing levels impact its ability to advise the President and respond to congressional mandates. OSTP's staffing levels and funding have varied over time, with FY2014 funding at $5.6 million. Analysts are concerned about inconsistent S&T advice due to fluctuating funding and staffing levels. OSTP has 40 full-time staff positions and a total of 93 staff members as of February 2012. In 2012, OSTP had a total of 93 staff members, including political staff, career staff, consultants, detailees, IPAs, and fellows. Funding sources vary for different staff categories. Previous administrations have relied on detailees and fellows for OSTP activities. The number of detailees and fellows is not included in OSTP's annual budget requests to Congress. During the Clinton Administration, OSTP had around 60 detailees and fellows, while during the G.W. Bush Administration, there were approximately 30-40 detailees per year. Currently, about 60 detailees and fellows support OSTP, a significant increase from the 11 detailees in FY1992. Congress may consider various issues related to OSTP, such as science advice, roles of the Director and Associate Directors, funding levels, compliance with restrictions, and ensuring scientific integrity in research. The curr_chunk discusses the efforts by OSTP to influence federal policies on public access to research, consolidate STEM education programs, and the role of PCAST. It also raises questions about the need for high-level S&T advice for the President and the structure of such advisory roles. Presidents and their senior advisors may perceive a need for only general S&T knowledge and may not see the importance of high-level S&T advice. Tensions can arise if the S&T advisor does not align with the President's agenda, leading to concerns about the politicization of S&T advice. A historical review of presidential S&T activities shows challenges when the President and S&T community disagree. An S&T advisor can provide confidential advice and coordinate S&T efforts in emergencies. Presidential advisory committees and OSTP provide S&T advice to the President. Some suggest eliminating OSTP, which could lead to reliance on outside groups for S&T advice. This may decrease the consideration of S&T in policy-making. Congress may consider relying on Cabinet Secretaries and federal agency officials for S&T advice, or formalizing this provision by agency heads as a statutory responsibility. Eliminating OSTP, the only federal agency focused on broad S&T policy, could make consideration of such policies more challenging. Another option is to move OSTP out of the EOP. Moving OSTP out of the EOP is another alternative that Congress might consider. This could potentially increase OSTP's independence and give Congress more control over its activities. However, there are concerns that this move could result in a lack of response to its advice or requests. Congressional options include maintaining OSTP within the EOP but increasing its autonomy. Some Members of Congress may believe that no changes need to be made in OSTP operations, while others may consider increasing presidential authority over OSTP. Currently, the President has discretion over the policies, structure, and personnel of OSTP, NSTC, and PCAST. Congress oversees OSTP through annual authorization and appropriation processes. Congress oversees OSTP through annual authorization and appropriation processes, introducing issue-specific bills to provide direction and guidance. Through hearings and legislative actions, Congress may mandate specific activities or priorities for OSTP, leading to potential conflicts with its general statutory roles and responsibilities. The current mechanisms for legislative guidance may conflict with presidential activities, such as OSTP's use of appropriated funds for international activities proscribed by Congress. To direct OSTP's activities, Congress could hold oversight hearings or amend legislation to reflect priorities, directing staff or activities towards specific issues. Establishing specific priorities and personnel in statute for OSTP could limit agency discretion and consume its staff and budget, hindering its ability to address new S&T topics. Congress may opt to allow the President to manage OSTP as desired, reducing direction provided through oversight hearings and legislation. The President would appoint the OSTP Director, determine policy agenda, and use executive orders for management. The President's management of the office includes using executive orders for activities like forming NSTC and PCAST. The personal relationship between the President and the OSTP director/science advisor can impact the effectiveness of S&T policy advice. Different Presidents may value S&T advice differently in decision-making processes. Some Presidents prioritize factors other than science and technology in decision-making, such as economic interests or foreign policy. They may not seek input from a Science and Technology (S&T) advisor, unlike President Obama who utilized John Holdren as both OSTP Director and APST. Suggestions have been made for the OSTP Director to also hold the title of APST or have Cabinet rank. The role and responsibilities of the OSTP Director are under discussion in the S&T community. The appointment of an advisor to a specific position arises from presidential discretion, which may limit Congress's ability to regulate access to key decision makers. Presidential science advisors have held various titles throughout different administrations, with the most common being Science Advisor to the President or Special Assistant to the President. The title of APST was held by the OSTP Director in certain administrations, including under President Obama with John Holdren. President Obama appointed John Holdren as APST and OSTP Director, confirmed by the Senate. The difference between the roles of OSTP Director and APST is significant, with implications for oversight by Congress. Some Members may want to oversee the appointment of the president's science advisor and have the option of hearing testimony. Congress expects executive branch officials to testify, contrasting with advisors whose sole responsibility is to advise the President. Some presidential advisors, like the Director of OSTP, are part of the EOP and subject to Senate confirmation. Congress may ask them to testify, but an APST can refuse based on separation of powers or executive privilege. There are debates on allowing APSTs to differentiate between privileged advice to the President and information for Congress. Establishing the APST position by statute and requiring Senate confirmation could ensure availability for testimony. Experts are concerned about potential confusion for Congress. Some experts are concerned about potential confusion in allowing some Administration staff with \"Assistant to the President\" titles to testify before Congress while others cannot. Suggestions have been made to establish the OSTP Director as a Cabinet-level position to enhance their role in policy development. This could ensure the President nominates someone for the position, providing greater influence in Administration policy. Some experts suggest establishing the OSTP Director as a Cabinet-level position to enhance their role in policy development and provide greater influence in Administration policy. This would allow for greater access to the President and other senior Administration staff, enhancing the authority and influence of the OSTP Director in incorporating scientific and technical viewpoints into decision-making. Some experts believe that establishing the OSTP Director as a Cabinet-level position may not substantially improve their role and influence in EOP activities, including Cabinet meetings. The relationship between Presidents and their science advisors is seen as unique, with the focus on how an Administration utilizes expert S&T advice for federal decision-making. Scientists, engineers, and S&T policy professionals, both within and outside the government, play a significant role in providing S&T input for federal policy decisions. Some experts believe the organization of the White House determines the status and access of the S&T advisor. The title is seen as less important than the access to the President it provides. Critics suggest focusing on the transparency of the Administration's operations rather than the title. Historically, OSTP Directors advise on S&T policy, R&D budget issues, scientific developments, and STEM education. The OSTP Director, also known as the APST, manages the NSTC and co-chairs PCAST. John Holdren holds both roles under the Obama Administration, advising on R&D budget, science and technology policies, and representing the US in international S&T meetings. The APST, also known as the OSTP Director, manages the NSTC and co-chairs PCAST. One alternative for Congress is to change the current structure of OSTP, separating roles and responsibilities. Some suggest having separate individuals for APST and OSTP Director to avoid potential conflicts. Some experts suggest appointing co-equal officials for science and technology policy. President Obama created the Chief Technology Officer position within the EOP, but concerns exist about potential conflicts and lack of integration. Splitting OSTP functions may strain resources and staff. Congress could consider increasing funding and staffing levels to support a reorganization of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Currently, the President has flexibility in appointing up to four Associate Directors with varying policy areas. Some Members of Congress have proposed specifying a fixed number of Associate Directors with specific policy focuses. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended creating an Associate Director for Earth Science and Applications at OSTP. Another bill proposed appointing an Associate Director for Societal Dimensions of Nanotechnology. Some suggest joint appointments with other councils. President Obama appointed the OSTP Director and CTO to the Domestic Policy Council. President Obama appointed the OSTP Director and CTO to the Domestic Policy Council, added the Chief Technology Officer as a member of the NEC, and issued Presidential Policy Directive 1 (PPD-1) to include science and technology issues in NSC meetings. Dr. Holdren expected the OSTP associate director for national security to collaborate with the National Security Council. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has faced challenges in fulfilling its duties due to budget constraints and limited staff. Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama requested 35-40 full-time equivalent positions, but actual staffing ranged from 23 to 31. The OSTP has relied on detailees and fellows to supplement its core staff, with concerns raised about the need for more career civil service professionals and a larger budget. The OSTP requires more career civil service professional staff and a larger budget to enhance institutional knowledge, expedite S&T policy issues, and support political appointees during presidential transitions. Additional funding would allow OSTP to conduct special analyses on emerging issues currently handled by the Science and Technology Policy Institute. The Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI) is funded through appropriations, with OSTP receiving varying amounts in recent years. Congress has imposed restrictions on OSTP's activities using appropriated funds. Section 1340(a) of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 112-10) prohibited OSTP from using funds to engage in bilateral activities with China unless authorized by law enacted after the division's date of enactment. OSTP spent part of its FY2011 appropriation on activities with China despite the restrictions. The President's constitutional authority for foreign diplomacy was cited by DOJ and OSTP to challenge Congress's restrictions. The OSTP challenged the constitutionality of Section 1340(a) of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, asserting it infringed upon the President's authority for foreign diplomacy. DOJ supported this, stating that most of OSTP's activities fall within the President's exclusive power for diplomacy, allowing them to proceed despite the restrictions. The Government Accountability Office found that OSTP's use of appropriations for the U.S.-China Dialogues violated Section 1340 and the Antideficiency Act. GAO did not comment on the constitutionality of the law. Chairman Wolf cited the GAO conclusion and urged Attorney General Eric Holder to enforce Section 1340 of P.L. 112-10. Congress subsequently reduced OSTP's FY2012 appropriations by 32.3% due to violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, prohibits OSTP from using funds to support activities that could transfer sensitive technology to China, but allows for activities certified to pose no risk. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 reaffirms the prohibition on OSTP funding activities that could transfer sensitive technology to China, unless certified to pose no risk. Additionally, OSTP must certify that such activities will not involve interactions with officials involved in human rights violations. Reports suggest enhancing the participation of OSTP in coordinating and setting priorities for federal S&T activities. The S&T policy community recommends that the OSTP Director play a greater role in coordinating federal R&D budget, energy, STEM education, and international S&T policy. They also suggest giving the NSTC equivalent authority to the NSC to address disparities in influence, statutory authority, staff, and budget. The NSTC has participated in presidential decision-making processes in different ways in different Administrations. During the Clinton Administration, the NSTC issued six Presidential Review Directives (PRDs) which served as the basis for gathering information and policy options for the President. However, during the G.W. Bush Administration and the Obama Administration, no PRDs were developed. Some experts believe that incorporating NSTC deliberations into policy documents rather than formal directives puts S&T and the NSTC in a supportive role, with S&T input needing a more prominent influence on public policy. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) has not been fully utilized in the past administrations, but efforts are being made to revitalize and streamline its functions. The Obama Administration aims to increase the influence of S&T input on public policy through the NSTC. The Obama Administration has made efforts to revitalize and streamline the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). They established a Committee on STEM Education to coordinate Federal programs, restructured NSTC committees, and increased meetings frequency. Congress may consider changing the roles of the OSTP Director and NSTC in the budget process or increasing oversight. Congress may mandate that OSTP review agency S&T budgets before submission to OMB and empower OSTP to adjust funding distribution based on priorities. This could enhance coordination of S&T expenditures among federal agencies, but agencies may resist the change. Congress might also require NSTC or OSTP to review agency S&T budgets to align with multi-agency R&D strategies and federal investments, increasing transparency on progress towards broader federal R&D goals. Increasing transparency in federal R&D goals may require additional funding and dedicated program offices to track multi-agency activities. Congress could formalize the NSTC structure, provide more funding, and mandate regular reports on NSTC activities to enhance oversight. The OSTP plays a role in ensuring scientific integrity and communication of research conducted by federal scientists. During the George W. Bush Administration, advocacy groups accused officials of politicizing science, particularly in areas like the environment, public health, and national security. Allegations included restricting federal scientists' ability to provide information and altering their research reports or congressional testimony. OSTP Director Marburger dismissed these claims as inaccurate and misleading. Policy makers responded to these concerns in various ways. Policy makers responded to concerns about politicizing science by directing OSTP to develop principles for open data exchange by federal scientists. In 2008, OSTP sent a memorandum to federal agencies outlining the \"Core Principle for Communication of Scientific Research Results.\" This principle emphasizes the importance of open communication for advancing science and providing society with objective information for decision-making. NASA's science communications policy promotes openness and allows employees to speak to the press and public about their work. Prior to President Obama's inauguration, proposals were made to change scientific communication policies, including monitoring scientific integrity and reversing Executive Order 13422. Some proposals for the Obama Administration included reversing Executive Order 13422 to prevent political reviews of scientific documents, enhancing whistleblower protections, requiring disclosure of scientific studies used in regulatory policy, reforming agency communication policies, and providing the public with scientific results used in policymaking. Organizations also suggested differentiating between scientific judgments and other policy matters, and developing guidelines for consulting advisory panels on scientific issues. President Obama issued a memorandum emphasizing the importance of scientific integrity in the executive branch. The memorandum outlined principles for ensuring scientific integrity, tasked the OSTP Director with overseeing this effort, and directed the development of recommendations for presidential action to guarantee scientific integrity. OSTP Director Holdren issued a memorandum outlining principles for scientific integrity in the executive branch, including guidance on public communications, federal advisory committees, and professional development of government scientists. OMB would provide guidance on reviewing scientific testimony for Congress, recognizing the need for distinct mechanisms based on each agency's scientific work and mission. The OSTP reviewed agency guidelines to ensure consistency with President Obama's memorandum. Some departments developed broad policies, while individual agencies may have additional specific elements. 19 agencies have released final policies, with four others finalizing draft policies. Mixed reviews have been received for the agencies' policies. Some agencies praised for supporting scientific integrity, while others criticized for inadequate policies. Congress raised concerns about scientific misconduct in various departments. Options for Congress include influencing executive branch activities, oversight, or establishing alternatives. Congress could influence executive branch activities, oversight, and establish alternative reporting mechanisms for scientific integrity issues. This could include providing guidance on crafting policies or leaving it to agency discretion with regular reporting requirements. Empowering Inspectors General or creating a federal ombudsman for complaints could also address scientific integrity concerns. In \"open access\" publishing, copyright holders grant free access to articles, while traditional publishing relies on subscriptions to fund journal costs. Since 2008, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has required recipients of grants to submit final articles for public access within 12 months of publication, raising concerns about intellectual property protection and competition with private publishers. Supporters of federal open access publishing policies advocate for increased federal support to address rising costs of traditional journal subscriptions and promote free access to research results funded by taxpayers. In contrast, traditional publishers and scholarly associations oppose these policies, fearing negative impacts on the publishing industry and potential increased costs for researchers. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 required the OSTP Director to establish a working group to coordinate agency policies related to public access to research results. Respondents supported increasing public access, and in 2013, the OSTP Director affirmed the Obama Administration's commitment to this goal. The OSTP Director affirmed the Obama Administration's commitment to ensuring that federally funded scientific research results are made available to the public, industry, and scientific community. Agencies funding over $100 million in R&D per year were instructed to develop plans for public access within one year of publication. 20 agencies were expected to submit draft public access plans, with feedback provided by the OSTP. Agencies will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit plans for approval. The Obama Administration directed agencies funding over $100 million in R&D to develop public access plans for research findings. Once approved, agencies will determine their release dates. OSTP is required to report to Congress on agencies' progress in implementing these plans. The plans must provide free online access to final peer-reviewed manuscripts within 12 months of publication. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act specifies that final peer-reviewed manuscripts describing research supported by Federal Government funding must be submitted within 12 months of publication. This is part of efforts to address governance concerns about the federal STEM education program portfolio. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 directed the OSTP to establish an NSTC committee to coordinate Federal programs in support of STEM education. The committee, known as \"CoSTEM,\" is responsible for reviewing STEM education activities, developing a five-year strategic plan, and maintaining an inventory of federally sponsored STEM programs. The OSTP Director is tasked with ensuring the plan is executed and submitting an annual report to Congress. CoSTEM, established under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010, oversees federal STEM education programs. It published inventories of programs and funding levels for FY2008 to FY2010. A progress report on coordinating federal STEM education investments was also released. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act established CoSTEM to oversee federal STEM education programs. A report identified four coordination goals and priority areas for federal STEM efforts, including K-12 teacher education and serving underrepresented groups. In 2013, OSTP was required to produce a federal STEM education strategic plan, and the Administration proposed a reorganization in its FY2014 budget request. The Administration proposed a reorganization of federal STEM education efforts in its FY2014 budget request, aiming to consolidate programs and increase funding. This raised concerns among some stakeholders who disagreed with the approach, fearing it was influenced by budget analysts at OMB. Some policy makers and advocates question the reorganization of federal STEM education activities, expressing concerns about decision-making processes and the capacity of lead agencies to take on new roles. Advocates propose clear agency responsibilities for federal STEM education activities to improve program evaluation, reduce fragmentation, and enhance coordination. However, the reorganization proposal's inclusion in the President's budget request may complicate its execution. The reorganization of appropriations for federal STEM education activities may lead to unintended program eliminations due to lack of comprehensive planning. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations did not support the proposed reorganization in FY2014. The House committee identified flaws in the federal STEM strategic plan and directed OSTP to report on resources needed for a centralized website of research findings. The Senate committee deferred action on consolidation until STEM program assessments are finalized. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 was critical of the proposed reorganization. The Congress supports improving efficiency in Federal STEM education programs but rejects the proposed reorganization due to lack of detail and community buy-in. All STEM activities will continue in their current structures unless specified otherwise. OSTP is directed to reconsider reorganizations after an inclusive process and program evaluations. PCAST advises the President on science, technology, and innovation-related issues. Its members come from various sectors outside the federal government. Experts suggest that PCAST's influence has declined as it focused on fewer issues of interest to the President. Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush had limited interactions with PCAST members. President Obama met with PCAST four times in his first three years in office. President Obama met with PCAST four times during his first three years in office, with discussions lasting an hour or more. PCAST co-chairs also met with the President and senior EOP officials for focused discussions on specific topics, updates on studies, and recommendations. PCAST is unique as its executive order states that the OSTP Director and a member co-chair it, unlike other federal advisory committees. This joint-chair approach continued through succeeding Administrations. Administration staff are not commonly chairs of federal advisory committees. The inclusion of the APST as co-chair in PCAST may hinder its independence and create conflicts with White House policy. Suggestions to strengthen PCAST include broadening its mandate to include national security issues, enhancing independence, increasing staff, selecting non-Administration members as chairs, staggering member terms, and providing security clearances. Obama Administration has provided PCAST members with security clearances. Some experts suggest increasing presidential advisory committees, like a Federal-State Science and Technology Council for STEM education. Establishing new committees may be costly and complicated by the Federal Advisory Committee Act requirements. PCAST has taken on responsibilities of topic-specific advisory committees. Congress may want the President to create additional advisory committees. The President may establish additional presidential advisory committees to address areas not covered by PCAST or to focus on specific issues like nanotechnology and information technology. Recommendations from the Bush Administration's PCAST members included playing a more active role in advising Congress on science and technology policy and increasing interactions with the President, OMB, and CEA. President Obama announced the new members of PCAST on April 27, 2009, emphasizing the need to engage the scientific community in public policy. He stated that PCAST would advise him on national strategies to promote scientific innovation. The OSTP notes that President Obama has increased interactions of PCAST with key government agencies. President Obama has increased the role and influence of PCAST by taking action on their recommendations, including funding for new initiatives like a flu vaccine manufacturing improvement initiative and the establishment of an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Education. Other actions include accelerating adoption of Electronic Health Records, establishing the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, and conducting a Quadrennial Technology Review at the Department of Energy. The Obama Administration has increased the role and influence of PCAST by providing resources for timely report development. PCAST met more frequently and engaged with key leaders in science and technology. They released more reports during the Obama Administration compared to the Bush Administration. During the first five years of the Obama Administration, PCAST released 20 reports by December 2013. The 113th Congress took legislative actions regarding OSTP and NSTC, resulting in the passage of public law. P.L. 113-76 provided $5.6 million for OSTP in FY2014 and included language prohibiting certain expenditures. The passage of public law P.L. 113-76 in FY2014 provided $5.6 million for OSTP and included language prohibiting bilateral activities with China or Chinese-owned companies unless authorized by law. OSTP must certify activities pose no risk to national security or economic security and do not involve interactions with officials linked to human rights violations. OSTP was directed by P.L. 113-76 to reexamine federal STEM program reorganizations, report on funding for STEM education research dissemination, federal agency progress on public access to research findings, and assess rare earth mineral criticality. Additionally, OSTP was encouraged to report on collaborative relationships and identify international opportunities in neuroscience.
