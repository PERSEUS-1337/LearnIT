Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is amended to include a Community Bank Exemption, defining terms such as 'bank holding company' and 'insured depository institution'. This exemption exempts community banks from the annual management assessment of internal controls requirement. The exemption under this section applies to small bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, or insured depository institutions with total assets of $1,000,000,000 or less. The dollar amount is adjusted annually based on the percentage increase in total assets of similar institutions. SEC. 3 amends Section 129D(c) of the Truth in Lending Act by adjusting margins, reorganizing paragraphs, and exempting smaller institutions from certain loan requirements. SEC. 4 establishes minimum standards for residential mortgage loans. Section 129C(b)(2) of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include a safe harbor provision for qualified mortgages originated and retained in portfolio for at least 3 years by a depository institution with less than $10 billion in total assets. Loans meeting these criteria are deemed to meet the requirements of the Act. The text chunk discusses an exception for transferring loans between depository institutions in cases of bankruptcy or failure, ensuring compliance with requirements under the Truth in Lending Act.
