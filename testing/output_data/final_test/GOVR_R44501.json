    "content": "Militant Islamist groups have operated in Southeast Asia for decades, home to over 625 million people with large Muslim populations. The region has experienced violent separatist movements and pockets of Islamist radicalism, leading to instances of violence over the past 30 years. Some Southeast Asian governments have been successful in combatting violent militancy and degrading terrorist groups like Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf. The United States has provided significant counterterrorism assistance to the region since 9/11. The rise of Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria since 2014 has increased terrorism risks in Southeast Asia. A 2016 terrorist attack in Jakarta, Indonesia, linked to IS, highlighted the growing threat in the region. The State Department's 2015 Country Reports on Terrorism warned of the ongoing risks in the East Asia and Pacific region. The East Asia and Pacific region faces terrorist threats, including foreign fighters to and from Iraq and Syria, and support for ISIL. The Trump Administration prioritizes combating IS, aiming to cut off funding, expand intelligence sharing, and engage in cyberwarfare. Despite growing risks, Southeast Asia is not seen as a front-line threat like the Middle East or northern Africa. The Trump Administration prioritizes combating IS in the East Asia and Pacific region, aiming to cut off funding, expand intelligence sharing, and engage in cyberwarfare. Southeast Asia is not seen as a front-line threat like the Middle East or northern Africa, but questions remain about the nature and extent of radicalization in the region and its potential threat to U.S. interests. Congress may need to consider the effectiveness of Southeast Asian governments' capabilities to monitor and combat terrorism, and whether U.S. assistance could help address capability gaps. Congress should prioritize supporting counterterrorism efforts in Southeast Asia and consider the most effective legislative and oversight tools to ensure U.S. assistance is used effectively without compromising human rights and the rule of law. This may include conditionalities on assistance and implementing vetting procedures. Lessons can be learned from Southeast Asian efforts to degrade terrorist groups and de-radicalize individuals with militant views. Southeast Asia is a primary demographic center of the Islamic world with a large Sunni Muslim population. Conservative Sunni communities have grown with support from donors in the Arab Gulf states, leading to small pockets of radicalism in the region. Militant Islamist groups in Southeast Asia have diverse origins, including longstanding separatist movements in parts of the Indonesian archipelago. Separatist movements in parts of the Indonesian archipelago, particularly in Aceh, have created safe havens for violent groups. The Philippines and Thailand have fought separatist movements in their Muslim-majority southern regions for decades, leading to extremism and violence. Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, has porous borders allowing terrorists to operate from its shores. Some believe Malaysia is a source and transit point for terrorist financing. The rise of globalized social media and the war in Afghanistan contributed to the radicalization of Islam in Southeast Asia. Jemaah Islamiyah was linked to Al Qaeda and the Abu Sayyaf Group, while the Islamic State has sparked a new phase of Islamist militancy in the region. Terrorism experts believe IS provides inspiration, training, and material support for militants in Southeast Asia through online recruitment. The Islamic State (IS) has provided training and material support for militants in Southeast Asia, conducting online recruitment efforts in Bahasa Indonesia and Malay language. Analysts estimate hundreds of Southeast Asians have joined IS in the Middle East. A Southeast Asian \"military arm\" of IS, Katibah Nusantara, operates in Syria with Indonesians, Malaysians, and others. Governments in the region have intensified counterterror efforts since 2014, outlawing support for IS and strengthening policing and border control. The exact number of Southeast Asians joining IS and the group's financial support from the region are difficult to estimate. Authorities in Southeast Asia are concerned about the threat posed by battle-trained militants returning from the Middle East. Counterterrorism efforts in the region have weakened large terrorist groups like JI and Abu Sayyaf, leading to the rise of smaller splinter groups seeking to attract support from IS or Al Qaeda. This competition may result in increased terrorist activity in the region. The potential concern in the region is the increasing terrorist activity due to competition between Islamic State and Al Qaeda. This rivalry has divided Islamist groups, leading to a shift in militant strategy and tactics. There is a fear of attacks targeting soft targets like the Paris attacks, with a larger pool of battle-hardened fighters returning from Syria or Iraq. Social media is being used for recruitment, inspiring lone-wolf attacks and drawing converts to the IS cause. The January 2016 Jakarta attack targeted a Starbucks and a large. The January 2016 Jakarta attack targeted a Starbucks, a shopping mall, and a police station, possibly indicating a shift towards Western targets by the Islamic State in Southeast Asia. The group may be expanding its activities in the region to compensate for losses in Syria and Iraq and gain allegiance from existing Islamist groups. This poses a threat to U.S. interests in the region, especially amidst rising strategic competition with China. Rising Islamist militancy in Southeast Asia could impact stability and threaten U.S. interests in the region and beyond in various ways, including direct attacks, recruitment for terrorist activities, inspiration for joining terrorist fighters, financing terrorist causes, and heightening the threat of attacks against U.S. partners and allies in the region. The United States is concerned about rising Islamist militancy in Southeast Asia, which could impact stability and threaten U.S. interests in the region. Terrorist attacks could exacerbate regional tensions and distract governments from U.S.-led coalition activities against groups like the Islamic State and al Qaeda. Efforts to address terrorist threats include enhancing cooperation and building capacity with nations in the region. The Global Counterterrorism Forum, ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus Experts' Working Group, UNODC Terrorism Prevention Branch, ARF, and U.S. Department of State's Regional Strategic Initiative are key bodies in Asian governments' counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. Department of State's Regional Strategic Initiative supports regional counterterrorism activities. The Financial Action Task Force combats money laundering and terrorist financing. Malaysia and Singapore are part of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL. Southeast Asian governments welcome U.S. counterterrorism assistance due to heightened risks from returning fighters. Many governments in the region seek assistance due to the potential return of fighters from the Middle East, leading to increased information-sharing and collaboration among various agencies. Analysts emphasize addressing root causes of Islamist discontent to reduce radicalization. Focus is also on enhancing regional counterterror capabilities, tracking militants, and preventing prisons from becoming hubs for militant networking. Southeast Asian governments have become more assertive in combating terrorism and militancy, with a focus on tracking militants, preventing prisons from becoming militant hubs, and controlling porous borders. The region has shown increased collaboration and information-sharing to address the potential return of fighters from the Middle East. The Obama Administration emphasized programs supporting Combatting Violent Extremism (CVE) in U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The United States has focused on programs to Combat Violent Extremism (CVE) in its counterterrorism assistance strategy, hosting a Summit on Countering Violent Extremism in 2015. The State Department renamed the Bureau of Counterterrorism to include Countering Violent Extremism in 2016. The Trump Administration may shift focus to countering \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" which has been criticized for potentially harming U.S. credibility in counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. government provides Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand to enhance their counterterrorism capabilities. Programs include training police officers, border security, enhancing skills of security forces, and strengthening border controls. The U.S. government provides Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand to enhance their counterterrorism capabilities, including training police officers, border security, and strengthening border controls. NADR funding supports combating weapons of mass destruction in these countries, while Economic Support Funding aims to expand counter-narrative and counter-messaging programming to delegitimize extremist groups in specific regions. Southeast Asia comprises Muslim-majority states and countries with substantial Muslim minorities. Specific issues in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia will be discussed. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia face high terrorism risks, with threats spanning borders and targeting Western interests. Australia also faces terrorism threats due to open immigration policies and links to Southeast Asia. Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority nation, has a history of violent militancy and separatist movements providing safe havens for militant groups. Indonesia's Sunni Muslim population comprises 87% of its 253 million people. Indonesia, with 87% Sunni Muslim population, has faced deadly terrorist attacks, including bombings in Jakarta and Bali targeting Western interests. The 2016 Jakarta attack revealed strengths and weaknesses in Indonesia's counterterrorism efforts, highlighting the heightened risks the country now faces from militants inspired by the Islamic State. Syria called Katibah Nusantara, a group linked to IS supporters in Indonesia, as responsible for planning the attacks. However, experts later disputed this connection, suggesting that the attacks were locally planned by a group seeking recognition from the Islamic State. The conflicting reports underscore Indonesia's struggle in monitoring splintered militant groups, particularly from the 2000s. Despite the attacks being lethal, they caused minimal damage, indicating Indonesia's successful efforts in weakening militant capabilities. Recent militant attacks in Indonesia have been low-tech and ineffective, with President Joko Widodo condemning the attacks and urging the public not to succumb to fear. The attacks in Indonesia were carried out by militant groups linked to Jemaah Islamiyah, which has been weakened since the early 2000s. The arrest of JI leaders has led to the emergence of smaller splinter groups, some of which may be motivated to carry out future attacks. Abu Bakar Baasyir, a key figure with Al Qaeda links, remains imprisoned. Indonesian counterterrorism officials are facing challenges in identifying and disrupting recruitment networks, especially in prisons where terrorist activities are a concern. Despite efforts to supervise radical inmates, some prisoners, including Baasyir, have publicly pledged loyalty to the Islamic State. The challenges facing Indonesian authorities in countering terrorism are considerable, as evidenced by prisoners publicly pledging loyalty to the Islamic State. Experts find it hard to track JI splinter groups and other active groups due to shifting loyalties. The Jakarta attack was linked to Partisans of the Caliphate, led by detained cleric Aman Abdurrahman. Various groups like Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid and Mujahedin Indonesia Timur are active in different regions of Indonesia. The Mujahedin Indonesia Timur (MIT) in Maluku, led by Santoso, attracted recruits from outside Indonesia, including Uyghurs from China. Indonesian militants are now inspired by international conflicts, as weakened terror networks seek relevance. Some networks are facilitating travel to Syria via European destinations for individuals to fight. Indonesia has taken steps to counter the rise of militant groups since 2014, outlawing support for IS and blocking related websites. Counterterrorism efforts are police-led, with Detachment 88 leading operations. There is a debate on the nation's antiterrorism laws. President Widodo's government in Indonesia is considering amendments to the current Anti-Terrorism Law to enhance the police's ability to monitor and address terrorist threats. The proposed changes would allow for proactive detention of suspected terrorists for up to 90 days without charge or legal representation, broaden definitions of terrorism and criminal support for terrorism, and prosecute individuals suspected of supporting IS. Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama, has shown support for strengthening counterterrorism laws, marking a shift from its previous stance in 2003. Indonesia is considering amendments to its Anti-Terrorism Law to enhance monitoring and addressing terrorist threats. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the proposed changes being too broad and vague, potentially restricting freedom of expression. The US and Australia have supported Indonesia in developing its counterterrorism capabilities, including training for the elite unit Detachment 88. Financial intelligence unit training has also been included in capacity-building programs. Indonesia has participated in various international counterterrorism efforts, including training programs with the U.S. Treasury Department and the Global Counterterrorism Forum. They have also been involved in intelligence cooperation, civil-military cooperation, and maritime security through programs like the Regional Defense Counter Terrorism Fellowship Program and the Theater Security Cooperation Program with the U.S. Pacific Command. The Philippines has been involved in counterterrorism efforts for over four decades, facing challenges from Muslim separatist movements, communist rebels, and Islamist terrorist groups. In 2016, the country was ranked 12th on the Global Terrorism Index. Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah have been active in the Philippines in the past. Joint Philippine-U.S. efforts have helped reduce Islamist terrorist activities since 2001. Since 2014, there has been an increase in activity by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in the Philippines, raising concerns about resurgent terrorist threats. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) continues to engage ASG and other Islamist terrorist organizations. The ASG, based in Sulu, is the most established indigenous terrorist group with ties to jihadist networks. The United States designated ASG as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997. The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in the Philippines has maintained ties with terrorist organizations like Jemaah Islamiyah and factions of the MILF. They have carried out hostage-takings, killings, and bombings since the early 1990s, including the 2004 ferry bombing in Manila Bay and simultaneous bombings in three cities in 2005. ASG has evolved into a criminal organization funded by kidnappings for ransom, extortion, and drug trafficking. Membership has decreased over time. The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in the Philippines has decreased in membership from 1,000-2,000 in 2002 to about 300-400 members. Since 2014, ASG has increased criminal activities, pledged allegiance to IS, and aimed to unite Islamist extremist groups in the Philippines. Other organizations supporting IS include splinter groups of MILF and MNLF, such as the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) and Ansarul Khilafah Philippines (AKP) in southern Mindanao. AKP, linked to BIFF and Jemaah Islamiyah, has pledged allegiance to IS and threatened attacks on civilian targets. The Maute group, a radical Islamist organization based in southwestern Mindanao, is suspected of carrying out attacks on civilian targets. The Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) aimed to provide autonomy for Muslim Moros in Mindanao and Sulu but was not implemented due to opposition in the Philippine Congress, which experts fear may fuel local recruitment to Islamist extremist groups. President Duterte aims to negotiate a new Bangsamoro agreement in 2017. Terrorist threats in the Philippines are increasing, with the ASG showing renewed capacity for violence, including bombings, ambushes, and beheadings. Hostage-takings for ransom have risen, funding the ASG's activities and enabling them to bribe officials. Concerns include the influence of the Islamic State, terrorist groups uniting, and international implications. Some terrorist groups in the Philippines aim to unite, while IS fighters are dispersing internationally. The Philippine military is actively pursuing Islamist extremist groups, confining terrorist attacks to the south. Analysts warn of potential \"sympathy attacks\" and safe havens for pan-Islamist groups. Concerns arise as IS loses ground in the Middle East, with fears of expansion in Southeast Asia. Foreign IS fighters may return to the region, particularly the Philippines, to establish terrorist cells. Since President Duterte took office, at least three major terrorist incidents have occurred in the Philippines. In September 2016, a bomb attack in Davao killed 15 people. In November 2016, a bomb was found near the U.S. Embassy in Manila. The Maute group, an Islamist organization, has been involved in terrorist activities in the country. The Maute group, linked to IS, is suspected in a bomb found near the U.S. Embassy in Manila. Duterte's security team was injured by an explosive en route to Marawi. The Philippine government's counterterrorism efforts involve various components, with the ATC leading the implementation of the Human Security Act of 2007. Coordination issues persist among agencies, military, and law enforcement. Duterte's Administration launched the DSSP in 2017 to replace the IPSP. The government launched the Support and Security Plan (DSSP) to succeed the Internal Peace and Security Plan (IPSP), aiming to reduce the strength of terrorist groups in the Philippines. Government forces conducted raids resulting in the deaths of over 150 ASG militants and targeted other extremist groups. Cooperation between the central government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) on counterterrorism efforts has been ongoing, including programs to counter extremism in Islamic schools. The MILF collaborates with the Duterte Administration to counter extremism and support the campaign against illegal drug trade funding extremist groups in Mindanao. The Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia jointly patrol the Sulu Sea to combat piracy and kidnappings by Islamist extremist groups. The Philippines is a member of the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering, committed to preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. ASEAN nations cooperate on counterterrorism efforts. In 2015, ASEAN nations, including the Philippines, adopted the Langkawi Declaration on the Global Movement of Moderates to promote moderation as a core value for peace and security. The lack of economic opportunities in the southern Philippines contributes to the rise of extremist ideologies and criminal activities. The Philippine government's PAMANA program focuses on community-based development in conflict-affected areas. The PAMANA program supports health, education, land claims, and local government capacity-building in conflict-affected areas. U.S.-Philippine counterterrorism efforts reduced the ASG's influence, leading to JSOTF-P forces withdrawing in 2014. Despite this, the ASG has since increased its activities. Since 2014, the ASG has increased its activity in the Philippines, leading to a stalled peace process. President Duterte aims to remove U.S. military forces by 2022, but U.S.-AFP counterterrorism cooperation will continue for now. U.S. support focuses on addressing terrorism's root causes in Mindanao. The U.S. government supports programs in Mindanao to address the root causes of terrorism, focusing on good governance, social services, civil society participation, education, and public health. Assistance includes training Philippine law enforcement to engage communities, identify radicalized youth, and promote inter-ethnic harmony. The Armed Forces of the Philippines received counterterrorism assistance from the U.S. Department of Defense in 2016 and 2017. Collaboration with the Philippine Anti-Terrorism Council is also emphasized in pursuing terrorism cases. The U.S. government collaborates with the Philippine Anti-Terrorism Council to pursue terrorist finance cases. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) allows increased U.S. military presence in the Philippines, with access to military bases. President Duterte, while skeptical of U.S. reliance, supports the EDCA agreement. Five military bases, including Lumbia Air Base in Mindanao, are offered for U.S. access under EDCA due to terrorism concerns. Malaysia has not seen established indigenous separatist groups or insurgents engaging in terrorism, but it faces threats from returning fighters, regional terrorist groups, radicalization of individuals, and potential influence from IS and Al Qaeda. Law enforcement has largely prevented extremist groups from gaining a foothold in the country. Some Malaysians have provided funds and support to insurgent and terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria, with reports of over 100 Malaysians actively involved. Financial transfers to militant groups are often done through cash or the hawala system, making it challenging to stop funding. Recent arrests in Malaysia suggest increased international terror connections within the country. Malaysian police arrested seven men, including foreigners, with links to IS and Al Qaeda in late 2016. The suspects were involved in various terrorist activities, such as gathering information on an international school, smuggling weapons to Indonesia, and planning attacks in Malaysia. Another group linked to IS was arrested in Sabah in January 2017, with connections to Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines. The Islamic State (IS) carried out a successful attack at the Movida nightclub in Malaysia, injuring eight people. The attack was ordered by IS member Muhamad Wanndy Mohamad Jedi from Malacca, based in Syria. Malaysian police thwarted planned attacks in Putrajaya and Johor following the Movida incident. Despite Malaysia's generally moderate practice of Islam, IS and its supporters have drawn some extremists and Malaysian youth. Online IS supporters in Malaysia create a conducive environment for recruitment and radicalization. A Pew Research Center survey found that 67% of Malaysian Muslims have an unfavorable opinion of IS, while 12% support it. In spring 2015, 67% of Malaysian Muslims have an unfavorable opinion of IS, but 12% have a favorable opinion. The opposition Pan-Malaysia Islamic Party (PAS) disavowed support for IS publicly, but senior PAS figures had praised a former PAS youth leader who died fighting in Syria in 2014. Muslim Brotherhood leader Ismail Faruqui is a mentor of opposition political leader Anwar Ibrahim, a founder of the International Institute for Islamic Thought (IIIT). Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and senior officials have denounced IS and urged Malaysians to withhold support. The Malaysian government began freezing assets of individuals or groups linked to IS in September 2014. The National Fatwa Council ruled in 2014 that Malaysian Muslims joining militant groups like IS goes against Islamic law. Malaysia supported UN Resolution 2178 to combat terrorism and urged addressing root causes of terrorism. Prime Minister Najib promoted moderate Islam at the UN in 2014. Malaysian law enforcement authorities are on high alert due to the emerging threat of terrorists connected to the Islamic State. There are concerns that radicalized jihadists returning from Syria and Iraq may carry out attacks in Malaysia. Police have apprehended Malaysian militants returning from Syria and arrested others intending to join terrorist groups in the Middle East. The head of the police counterterrorism unit warned of potential \"Paris-style\" attacks and stated that IS veterans are planning to target the Malaysian government. Malaysian authorities have detained over 160 people connected to the Islamic State, with concerns that IS ideology could inspire attacks within the country. In the past, arrests have been made for plots against domestic targets, including a foiled plan to kidnap the Prime Minister. Authorities are particularly worried about the potential for terrorist groups in Sabah and Sarawak. Sarawak faces the threat of terrorist groups, prompting Malaysia to increase defense measures in Sabah. The government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act in 2015, granting authorities broad powers to detain suspects without trial. This move has sparked controversy amid concerns of a crackdown on dissent. Malaysia's Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) has raised concerns internationally due to indefinite detention without trial. The National Special Operations Force (NSOF) was established in 2016 to respond to terror threats, comprising personnel from various security forces. Malaysia has increased counterterrorism cooperation with Southeast Asian countries and the US, emphasizing intelligence sharing. Malaysia has enhanced counterterrorism cooperation by joining the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Counter ISIL and establishing a Regional Digital Counter-Messaging Communication Center in 2016. China is considering supporting the new center, which aims to counter IS messages on social media. Malaysia also hosts the Southeast Asia Regional Center for Counterterrorism (SEARCCT). Malaysia has established the Southeast Asia Regional Center for Counterterrorism (SEARCCT) and implemented an Advanced Passenger Screening System in 2014. In 2015, Malaysia signed agreements with the U.S. for information exchange on suspected terrorists. Thailand faces terrorism risks due to a separatist insurgency, porous borders, and human trafficking. Thailand, a U.S. treaty ally since 1954, has been experiencing political turmoil with two military coups in the past nine years. Following the 2014 coup, Prayuth Chan-ocha became Prime Minister and head of the military junta. Elections have been delayed, and there are concerns that the junta is reluctant to give up power. The death of Thailand's king in 2016 also brought about a transition to a new king. The transition to a new king in Thailand in 2016 brought uncertainty about the country's political situation. A persistent separatist insurgency in the Muslim-majority southern provinces has been active since the 1940s, resulting in thousands of casualties. The insurgency's goals are mainly separatist, with concerns of expansion beyond the southern provinces. Experts do not see significant involvement of Jemaah Islamiyah in the attacks, emphasizing the movement's long-term goal of creating an independent state. The insurgency in the Muslim-majority southern provinces of Thailand aims to create an independent state with Islamic governance. Some insurgent organizations have received support from foreign Islamic groups and leaders trained in camps in Libya and Afghanistan. Tensions with Malaysia have been heightened as insurgents easily cross the border. Terrorist threats extend beyond the south, as seen in a 2015 Bangkok bombing linked to Uyghur militants. The attack in Thailand was motivated by the repatriation of Uyghurs to China and the dismantling of a human trafficking ring. The Thai government, struggling with political turmoil, has made efforts to contain the conflict in the South, including training local leaders and participating in peace talks with separatist groups. Violence initially declined but picked up again in 2016. The United States and Thailand have a history of strong intelligence cooperation, including sharing facilities and information daily after the September 11, 2001 attacks. This collaboration led to the arrest of a suspected Jemaah Islamiyah leader in Bangkok in 2003. The CIA also had a black site in Thailand for holding terrorist suspects. It is unclear if this level of cooperation has continued due to tensions between the countries. Thailand's cooperation with the United States in intelligence sharing is uncertain due to criticism over the suspension of democratic rule. The Trump Administration's focus on intelligence sharing with Thailand or other regional powers remains unclear. Analysts highlight Thailand's strategic location and open borders as valuable for tracking transnational operatives. Australia has a small Muslim population, with half a million Muslims out of 23.5 million people, mainly of Lebanese, Turkish, Bosnian, Syrian descent. In Australia, the majority of Muslims are moderate, with only 0.2% being Islamist radicals. Radical Islamist attacks in Australia date back to 1915, when individuals of Afghan and Pakistani background carried out an attack motivated by religious and political grievances. Counter-radicalization is just one of many counterterror policy options in Australia. Terrorist activity in Australia has increased due to the influence of the Islamic State on Islamist militants. This includes recruitment for fighting in Syria and Iraq, providing support to fighters in the Middle East, and domestic attacks by individuals influenced by the Islamic State. Other radical Islamist groups have also targeted Australia, such as Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah's plot during the 2000 Olympics. Terrorist activity in Australia has been influenced by groups like Al Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), and Al Shabab. Attacks have targeted Australian interests in Indonesia, including the 2002 Bali bombings and the 2004 bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. JI members aimed to establish an Islamic state spanning Indonesia, Malaysia, the southern Philippines, and Northern Australia. The Lowy Institute is a prominent Australian think tank. The Lowy Institute estimated in February 2015 that around 90 Australians were fighting for Jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, with up to 30 returning and over 20 dying. Australian authorities charged 24 people with terrorism-related crimes between December 2014 and October 2015, a significant portion of all such arrests since 2001. The Al Risalah Salafist Centre in Sydney, associated with radicalism and IS fighter recruitment, was raided in Operation Appleby. This operation, the largest in Australian history involving 800 officers, disrupted planned executions and possibly led to the death of Afghan-born Baryalei in October 2014. In October 2014, Afghan-born Baryalei was possibly killed after the Appleby raids. The Lindt Cafe siege in December 2014, carried out by Sheikh Man Haron Monis, highlighted the terrorist threat from Islamist radicalism in Australia. Monis, who had converted to Sunni Islam, requested an IS flag during the 16-hour siege where he killed a hostage. Monis and another hostage were killed when police stormed the cafe. Monis had pledged allegiance to the \"Caliph of the Muslims\" on Facebook prior to the attack and was under investigation by ASIO. Despite foiled plots, there has not been a major terrorist attack in Australia since the Lindt Cafe incident. Australia has undertaken measures to counter Islamist militancy, with 57 arrests made for foiled plots, including a train station and cathedral attack in Melbourne. An electrician was arrested for designing devices for IS. Approximately 70 Australians have died fighting with IS in Syria and Iraq, with an estimated 100 Australians currently fighting, a decrease from a peak of 120. Australia has enacted new security laws and increased data retention capabilities. Australia has enacted new security laws, increased funding for intelligence agencies and police, and granted greater powers to monitor citizens suspected of supporting jihadist violence. Former Prime Minister Abbott appointed Ambassador Greg Moriarty as National Counterterrorism Coordinator. A new National Terrorism Threat Advisory System was implemented in November 2015. Legislation was passed to lower the age of control orders for monitoring suspects from 16 to 14 after a 2015 attack on police by a 15-year-old. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is perceived to be taking a more conciliatory approach towards the Muslim community in Australia. Prime Minister Turnbull is taking a conciliatory approach towards the Muslim community in Australia, contrasting with former Prime Minister Abbott's approach. Turnbull has proposed integrating security agencies for better counter-terrorism coordination. Australian and New Zealand military missions have trained Iraqi troops, with Australian forces contributing to the campaign in Mosul. Laws enacted in 2015 stripped IS terrorist Khaled Sharrouf of his Australian citizenship. In 2015, IS terrorist Khaled Sharrouf lost his Australian citizenship. Australia has been praised for its counterterror efforts globally, contributing troops to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. Approximately 780 Australian Defence Force personnel are part of Operation OKRA in Iraq and Syria, with 250 defense personnel in Afghanistan under Operation Highroad. Australia supports the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan, having lost 41 personnel during the ISAF mission. This support aligns with the United States' perspective. Australia and the United States collaborate in counterterror efforts, including intelligence sharing through the Five Eyes network. Cooperation with Indonesia has improved, leading to a Memorandum of Understanding on Combating International Terrorism. Australian Federal Police work with Indonesian authorities to counter terrorism and transnational crime. Australia has partnered with Indonesia and other states in the region to build counterterrorism capabilities through the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC). The Centre works with Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counterterrorism (SEARCCT) and other organizations to combat transnational crime with a focus on counterterrorism. Australia and New Zealand collaborate in the counter IS coalition in Iraq and work together to prevent domestic terrorism through the Australia-New Zealand Counterterrorism Committee. Singapore, the region's wealthiest nation, has been the target of failed terrorist plots in the past and could be vulnerable to further attacks. The government has foiled recent terrorist plots, including one involving a terror cell in Indonesia planning a rocket attack. There is a growing concern about the threat of the Islamic State and home-grown radicals. A terrorist attack on Singapore could impact its financial and logistical standing in the region. Singapore has actively countered terrorist threats, including foiling plots by Jemaah Islamiyah in 2001 and arresting suspected militants under the Internal Security Act. They continue to target suspected terrorists, such as the 27 radicalized Islamist Bangladeshis arrested in 2016. The city-state's de-radicalization efforts and intelligence sharing with neighboring states aim to maintain its status as a financial and logistical hub in the region. Singapore actively counters terrorist threats, including foiling plots and arresting suspected militants. The city-state's de-radicalization efforts and intelligence sharing aim to maintain its status as a financial and logistical hub. Singapore and the United States have expanded counterterrorism cooperation, including increased information sharing on known and suspected terrorists. In 2015, Singapore and the United States increased cooperation on counterterrorism efforts, focusing on improving port security and extradition treaty. The rise of the Islamic State poses new challenges for Southeast Asia, influencing U.S. counterterrorism policy. The State Department's 2015 Country Reports on Terrorism highlighted Southeast Asian countries' efforts to address terrorist threats and strengthen security measures. Despite lower terrorist threats compared to other regions, risks remain in Southeast Asia, including potential lone wolf attacks or larger trans-national efforts. Many militant groups in the region have shown support for the Islamic State, leading to concerns about IS recruitment activities targeting the large Muslim populations in Southeast Asia. Analysts are concerned about monitoring new threats in Southeast Asia due to potential return of battle-trained individuals from the Middle East. It is unclear if operational linkages exist between Islamic State and Southeast Asian militants. The effectiveness of U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region remains a priority issue for the United States and regional governments. Congress may consider legislative tools to counter terrorism in Southeast Asia."
