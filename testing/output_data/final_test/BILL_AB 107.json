    "title": "AB 107",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows for an earned income tax credit against the \"net tax\" starting from January 1, 2015. The credit amount is determined based on Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, with adjustments specified in the annual Budget Act. The earned income tax credit under Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is contingent on resources allocated in the annual Budget Act for oversight by the Franchise Tax Board. The credit percentage and phaseout percentage vary based on the number of qualifying children, with corresponding earned income and phaseout amounts specified. The phaseout amounts for the earned income tax credit vary based on the number of qualifying children:\n- No qualifying children: $3,290\n- 1 qualifying child: $4,940\n- 2 or more qualifying children: $6,935\nCertain sections of the Internal Revenue Code are modified to adjust the credit and phaseout percentages. Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code is modified to adjust the earned income tax credit amounts and phaseout thresholds. The credit amounts and phaseout percentages vary based on the number of qualifying children. If the credit exceeds the tax liability, the excess amount will be refunded to the taxpayer. The Franchise Tax Board can create rules for this section, refunds will be treated like federal earned income refunds for benefit eligibility, and exemptions are granted for implementing the credit for the 2015 taxable year. The Franchise Tax Board must include scope, costs, and schedule changes for the California Earned Income Tax Credit in its next Special Project Report. The purpose of the credit is to reduce poverty among working families and individuals, with annual reports on the number of tax returns and individuals claiming the credit. The Franchise Tax Board must report on the number of tax returns and individuals claiming the California Earned Income Tax Credit, including details on the average credit amount, distribution by dependents and income ranges, and estimates of families lifted out of deep poverty by the credit. The Franchise Tax Board will provide a written report to various Senate and Assembly committees regarding the California Earned Income Tax Credit. Section 19136 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to adjust certain provisions related to failure to pay estimated income tax. No additional tax imposed if tax from previous year minus credits is less than $500 ($250 for separate returns by married persons). Section 6654(f) of the Internal Revenue Code does not apply to nonresident individuals. The term \"tax\" refers to the tax imposed under specific sections, less any credits provided. The credit for tax withheld on wages is specified in Section 6654(g) and is allowed under certain conditions. The applicable percentage is determined by specific regulations. Section 6654(f) applies to nonresident individuals. No addition to tax shall be imposed if the underpayment was caused by specific laws or adjustment factors. Penalties imposed after January 1, 2005, and January 1, 2016, are subject to certain conditions. The amendments to Section 19167 of the Revenue and Taxation Code apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2009. Penalties are imposed for failure to furnish a copy of the return or an identifying number as required by specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Penalties are imposed for failure to retain required documents or register as a tax preparer with the California Tax Education Council. The penalty for the first failure to register is $2,500, which can be waived with proof of registration within 90 days. Subsequent failures to register incur a $5,000 penalty. The Franchise Tax Board will not impose penalties until there is an appropriation in their budget or an agreement with the California Tax Education Council for funding. An agreement between the California Tax Education Council and the Franchise Tax Board states that the Council will reimburse the Board for costs related to penalties. The Board has already received reimbursement for the first year's costs. Penalties will be imposed for failure to diligently determine eligibility for earned income credit. The Legislature intends to expand the California Earned Income Tax Credit in the future, benefiting more working poor Californians. This act is related to the Budget Bill and will take effect immediately. The Legislature also plans to make statutory changes related to the Budget Act of 2015."
