    "content": "On November 26, 2007, U.S. President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Kamel Al-Maliki signed a Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship. The parties pledged to negotiate agreements in political, cultural, economic, and security spheres by July 31, 2008. The Declaration aimed to support the Iraqi government in training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces to provide security and stability, as well as contribute to the fight against terrorism. The Bush Administration has proposed a U.S.-Iraq security agreement granting broad authority for military operations, immunity for U.S. forces from Iraqi law, and detainment power over Iraqi prisoners. The draft does not mention permanent U.S. military bases, future troop levels, or specific security obligations in case of an attack. The Bush Administration proposed a U.S.-Iraq security agreement with broad military authority and immunity for U.S. forces. Secretary of Defense Gates clarified that the agreement would not require the U.S. to defend Iraq militarily. The nature of the agreement is uncertain, with General Lute stating it may not be a formal treaty requiring Congressional input. The National Security Council offered to brief Congress on the agreement's details. The National Security Council offered to brief Congress on the prospective U.S.-Iraq security agreement, with classified briefings already underway. Congressional input is welcomed, and seven background briefings have been held with senior administration officials. The Administration plans to negotiate two security agreements with Iraq, including a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) defining the legal status of U.S. forces. Ambassador Satterfield highlighted similarities with other SOFAs, addressing jurisdiction, movement of vehicles, non-taxation, and facility use, while also considering specific requirements for U.S. forces in Iraq. The Administration plans to negotiate two security agreements with Iraq, including a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for U.S. forces in Iraq. The second agreement, a \"strategic framework agreement,\" would broadly address topics outlined in the Declaration of Principles. Congress has oversight tools for any agreement, regardless of its form. The report discusses the legal framework governing U.S. military operations in Iraq, international agreements binding the United States, historical security agreements with other countries, Congress's oversight role in international agreements, and proposed legislation for congressional participation in a security agreement with Iraq. The legal framework governing U.S. military operations in Iraq is authorized by H.J.Res. 114 (P.L. 107-243) to defend national security against Iraq's threat and enforce UN Security Council resolutions. The President must determine diplomatic efforts are insufficient and force is necessary, consistent with the fight against terrorism. The authority extends beyond disarmament to future Security Council resolutions on Iraq. The United States and Great Britain, along with other countries, invaded Iraq in 2003 to enforce compliance with UN Security Council resolutions addressing the situation in Iraq and Kuwait. Despite initial disagreement on the legality of the invasion, subsequent resolutions supported the occupation and plans for a democratic government. Resolution 1511 (October 16, 2003) recognized the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and authorized a multinational force to maintain security and stability in Iraq until a representative government is established. Resolution 1511 authorized a multinational force to ensure security in Iraq, including protection for key institutions and infrastructure. The mandate of the force would expire upon the completion of the electoral process, with the Security Council ready to consider future needs based on the views of an internationally recognized Iraqi government. Coalition troops were not granted immunity from Iraqi legal processes, and a status of forces agreement was not possible until a permanent government was in place. Immunity for coalition soldiers, contract workers, and other foreign personnel in Iraq was established by the CPA through Order 17, granting them immunity from Iraqi legal processes. They are expected to respect Iraqi laws but are under the exclusive jurisdiction of their Sending States. The multinational force in Iraq operates under the exclusive jurisdiction of their Sending States. The Security Council Resolution 1546 reaffirmed the authorization for the force, noting its presence at the request of the Interim Government of Iraq. The mandate for the force will be reviewed at the request of the Government of Iraq or after twelve months, and will expire upon the completion of the political process. The mandate for the multinational force in Iraq will expire upon the completion of the political process, as stated in Resolution 1546. The force operates under the jurisdiction of their Sending States and will terminate earlier if requested by the Government of Iraq. The framework governing the force's function and status is deemed sufficient, with a commitment to act in accordance with the law of armed conflict. Prior to the handover of sovereignty to the interim government, Ambassador Bremer issued CPA Order 100 to revise existing CPA orders, chiefly by substituting the MNF-Iraq for the CPA and reflecting the new political situation. CPA Order 100 aimed to ensure that the Iraqi Interim Government and subsequent Iraqi governments inherit full responsibility for laws and regulations, as determined by a fully empowered and sovereign Iraqi Government. CPA Order 17 (as revised) remains valid under Iraq's permanent constitution. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for multinational forces until December 31, 2008, at the request of Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki. CPA Order 17 remains in force until the departure of the final MNF element from Iraq or until rescinded by law. It does not set a timetable for MNF departure after the U.N. mandate ends. The order may expire with the U.N. mandate or stay in force for a period to allow MNF personnel to leave. CPA Order 17 will remain in force until all MNF personnel depart Iraq, regardless of any timetable set by the U.N. or Iraqi government. The Iraqi government has the sole authority to interpret and decide on the immunity of coalition troops post-U.N. mandate expiration. The Iraqi government has the authority to determine the status of U.S. forces in Iraq post-U.N. mandate expiration. The congressional authorization for the use of military force does not specify a timeline for troop withdrawal. The presence of U.S. forces is authorized as long as Iraq poses a threat to the United States and is consistent with relevant U.N. resolutions. The U.N. mandate for multinational forces in Iraq is set to expire, and without new language supporting a U.S. military role, the use of military force in Iraq may not be necessary. A determination by the U.N. Security Council that Iraq no longer poses a threat could undermine the argument for continued U.S. military presence. The U.N. mandate for multinational forces in Iraq is expiring, and there is debate on whether new legislation is needed to support a continued U.S. military role. The Administration believes no new congressional authorization is required for U.S. combat operations post-mandate. The Constitution gives primary responsibility for international agreements to the executive branch, but Congress also has a crucial role in treaty ratification. The U.S. Constitution gives primary responsibility for international agreements to the executive branch, but Congress also plays a crucial role in treaty ratification. Treaties and executive agreements may require implementing legislation for domestic effect, with some agreements needing congressional approval or funding. A treaty enters into force if approved by a two-thirds Senate majority and ratified by the President. The U.S. Constitution gives primary responsibility for international agreements to the executive branch, but Congress also plays a crucial role in treaty ratification. Treaties may be ratified following Presidential signature, with the Senate able to condition its consent on reservations, declarations, and understandings. Most international agreements are executive agreements made by the executive branch without Senate approval. There are three types of legal executive agreements: congressional-executive agreements, executive agreements made pursuant to an earlier treaty, and sole executive agreements. The Executive's authority to promulgate agreements varies depending on the type: congressional-executive agreements, agreements made pursuant to an earlier treaty, and sole executive agreements. Executive agreements, although not mentioned in the Constitution, are considered valid international compacts. The use of executive agreements has increased significantly since World War II, with the U.S. concluding more executive agreements than treaties in recent years. Scholarly opinion generally rejects the idea that certain agreements must be treated as treaties requiring Senate approval. The use of executive agreements has increased significantly since World War II, with the U.S. concluding more executive agreements than treaties in recent years. Adjudication of the propriety of executive agreements has been rare due to standing issues, and it is rare for courts to invalidate executive agreements. Some agreements have been treated as treaties, while others as executive agreements. The constitutionality of congressional-executive agreements seems well-established. Congressional-executive agreements are authorized by both Houses of Congress through a statute, covering a wide range of topics like trade and military assistance. Examples include NAFTA and GATT. These agreements can take different forms, such as legislation authorizing negotiations or a statute passed after agreement negotiation. The legitimacy of agreements made pursuant to treaties is well established, with controversy sometimes arising over whether the agreement was implied by the treaty. The President has the power to enter into agreements required by treaties, and the Senate may condition approval of a treaty on subsequent agreements being submitted to them. Sole executive agreements do not rely on treaty or congressional authority for their legal basis. The President can enter into sole executive agreements without relying on treaty or congressional authority for their legal basis. These agreements may be permissible if they fall within the President's clear, exclusive constitutional authority, but may face scrutiny if the President's authority is unclear or if Congress also has authority over the subject matter. The court may consider Congress's position in determining the enforceability of a sole executive agreement. If Congress approves or is silent, the agreement is likely valid. If Congress opposes and the President's authority is unclear, the agreement's validity is uncertain. Sole executive agreements do not need congressional approval but may be overridden by pre-existing federal law. In the security context, Congress can limit the effect of sole executive agreements involving military commitments by enacting measures within its constitutional authority. Congress has the power to regulate matters related to defense, military forces, and declarations of war. Congress has the authority to execute laws, suppress insurrections, repel invasions, organize and discipline the militia, and make necessary laws for carrying out its powers. It also has plenary power over appropriations, ensuring no money can be spent without congressional approval. The authority of Congress includes executing laws, suppressing insurrections, and controlling appropriations. Adherence to executive agreements may depend on congressional appropriations, with Congress specifying terms for fund use. There is a debate between the branches on whether international commitments should be treaties or executive agreements. The Senate prefers treaties, fearing an erosion of treaty power, while the House may prefer congressional-executive agreements for a greater role in consideration. The Executive may choose to submit an international compact as a congressional-executive agreement for efficient approval of the agreement and necessary legislation. The decision on whether to treat an international agreement as a treaty or executive agreement is influenced by factors like Senate approval and State Department regulations. Congressional preference is considered in determining the form of the agreement. The State Department regulations outline factors to consider in determining the form of an international agreement, including commitments, impact on state laws, need for congressional legislation, past U.S. practice, Congress preference, formality, duration, and international practice. In 1978, the Senate passed a resolution advising the President to consult with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations before submitting an international agreement as a treaty. The State Department modified the Circular 175 procedure to include consultations with congressional leaders and committees on significant international agreements. Congressional consultation on international agreements' substance and form is discussed further in the report. The Bush Administration has proposed changes in this regard. The Bush Administration has characterized the proposed security arrangement with Iraq as similar to agreements with other countries. The nature of these security relationships can vary from legally binding treaties to non-binding assurances. The specifics of the future security arrangement between the United States and Iraq are still unclear, whether it will be governed by a treaty, executive agreement, non-binding pledges, or a combination of these. The United States enters into security agreements that can be legally binding treaties or executive agreements. Future arrangements may vary in form, with the possibility of congressional-executive agreements or statutory limitations on sole executive agreements. The United States is party to seven collective defense agreements, including the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, the North Atlantic Treaty, and bilateral security treaties with Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. These agreements were ratified between 1947 and 1960, with provisions specifying how the requirements are to be carried out. The United States has collective defense agreements with various countries, ratified between 1947 and 1960, specifying how requirements are to be carried out. These agreements include defense treaties and security commitments with former territories, all subject to congressional approval. The agreements aim to prevent the President from engaging in military hostilities without congressional authorization. The United States has security commitments with newly sovereign entities and other countries, involving obligations to act in defense or consult in case of security threats. These commitments can be in legally binding agreements or political documents. The United States has security commitments with various countries, including agreements with Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, and Liberia. The definition of \"security commitment\" is subject to debate between the executive and legislative branches. The United States has defense agreements with various countries, including military basing agreements, access and pre-positioning agreements, SOFAs, and burden-sharing agreements. These agreements involve military affairs but do not always require the U.S. to take action when another country is attacked. The United States has defense agreements with various countries, including military basing agreements, access and pre-positioning agreements, SOFAs, and burden-sharing agreements. These agreements involve military affairs but do not always require the U.S. to take action when another country is attacked. Additionally, agreements providing for arms transfers, military training, and joint military exercises have historically taken forms other than treaties, such as executive agreements or congressional-executive agreements. These agreements do not directly authorize the United States to engage in significant military operations in defense of the host country. The United States has various defense agreements with countries like Germany, Japan, and South Korea, which assist in fulfilling security commitments under separate defense treaties. These agreements grant the U.S. the legal right to intervene militarily to defend against internal or external threats, providing the right but not the duty to intervene when the security of the other country is threatened. Unlike collective defense agreements, these agreements do not require military intervention. The United States has defense agreements with countries like Germany, Japan, and South Korea, granting the U.S. the legal right to intervene militarily to defend against threats. The U.N. Charter allows for self-defense until the Security Council acts to maintain peace. In the early 20th Century, the U.S. made treaties with Latin American countries for military intervention. In the early 20th Century, the United States made treaties with Latin American countries granting the U.S. the right to intervene militarily when deemed necessary for various reasons such as preserving independence, maintaining government stability, and protecting vital interests like the Panama Canal. The United States has used military force in various instances without treaty authorization, such as in the Dominican Republic in 1907 and prior to entering World War II in 1941. President Roosevelt entered into an executive agreement in the Dominican Republic, which was later replaced by a modified treaty approved by the Senate. Prior to the United States entering World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made executive agreements for stationing troops in Iceland and Greenland to protect them from attack. These agreements, unlike treaties, may not always impose legal obligations but can carry significant political or moral weight. The practice of extending defense commitments to foreign countries dates back to the Monroe Doctrine. Since the Monroe Doctrine, security pledges to assist foreign States have become more common post-World War II. These commitments can be in the form of unilateral pledges by the Executive or joint declarations between the U.S. and foreign officials. Non-treaty arrangements for U.S. military intervention typically do not create legally binding, permanent agreements, allowing the host country to retain discretion over the extent and duration of U.S. presence. For example, in 1962, a joint declaration between the U.S. Secretary of State and the Thai Foreign Minister expressed the U.S.'s intention to aid Thailand in resisting Communist aggression. The United States deployed armed forces to Thailand to assist in combating communist forces, sparking a dispute between Congress and the Executive over the authority to engage in military operations without approval. In 1969, the Senate passed the National Commitments Resolution, defining a \"national commitment\" as the use of U.S. armed forces on foreign territory or a promise to assist a foreign country. The National Commitments Resolution defined a \"national commitment\" as the deployment of U.S. armed forces on foreign territory or a promise to assist a foreign country. The Resolution was motivated by concerns over constitutional imbalance in foreign relations, where Presidents were making significant commitments without congressional approval. The report criticized the practice of \"commitment by accretion,\" where repeated executive declarations created a sense of binding obligation. The National Commitments Resolution emphasized the importance of congressional oversight in significant military commitments. While the resolution itself had no legal effect, Congress can use its appropriations power to limit or condition actions related to security arrangements with foreign countries. This includes bilateral security agreements with Afghanistan, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 was made by the United States with Afghanistan, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. It aims to promote foreign policy, security, and economic development by providing assistance for international development and peace and security measures. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes the President to provide military assistance to friendly countries and international organizations to strengthen US security and promote world peace. This includes defense articles, services, and noncombatant personnel. In 2002, the US and Afghanistan entered into an agreement for economic grants. Afghanistan and the United States have an agreement for economic grants and defense support, including military training and cooperation in response to terrorism. U.S. military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan have diplomatic immunity from criminal prosecution by Afghan authorities. The agreement between Afghanistan and the United States grants diplomatic immunity to U.S. personnel from criminal prosecution by Afghan authorities. The agreement also authorizes the U.S. government to exercise criminal jurisdiction over U.S. personnel in Afghanistan and prohibits the surrender of U.S. personnel without consent. There is no immunity provided for contract personnel, and while the agreement does not explicitly authorize military operations in Afghanistan, it acknowledges ongoing operations authorized by Congress in 2001. The U.N. Security Council implicitly recognized the use of force in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and authorized the deployment of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to Afghanistan. Security Council resolutions provide a mandate for ISAF to work closely with Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), the U.S.-led coalition conducting military operations in Afghanistan. The United States and Afghanistan entered into an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) in 2004, allowing for logistic support, supplies, and services to be provided to foreign militaries on a reimbursement basis. This agreement was made in coordination with the International Security Assistance Force and Operation Enduring Freedom coalition to address security threats posed by the Taliban, Al-Qaida, and other extremist groups in Afghanistan. The United States and Afghanistan entered into an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) in 2004, allowing for logistic support, supplies, and services to be provided to foreign militaries on a reimbursement basis. This agreement was made in coordination with the International Security Assistance Force and Operation Enduring Freedom coalition to address security threats posed by the Taliban, Al-Qaida, and other extremist groups in Afghanistan. President Hamid Karzai and President Bush issued a \"joint declaration\" on May 23, 2005, outlining a prospective future agreement between the two countries, envisioning a role for U.S. military troops. The declaration outlines a future agreement between the United States and Afghanistan, involving a role for U.S. military troops to support Afghan security forces. A status of forces agreement is expected to be part of the final arrangement. In 1951, the U.S. and Germany entered into an agreement related to the Mutual Security Act of 1951, which aims to provide material assistance to friendly nations for international peace and security. The agreement between the United States and Germany in 1951 aims to provide material assistance to friendly nations for international peace and security, reaffirming Germany's commitment to promoting international understanding and maintaining world peace. In 1955, the United States and Germany entered into an agreement on mutual defense assistance, reflecting their commitment to international peace and security through collective self-defense arrangements. Germany guarantees not to use military assistance for any purpose inconsistent with the defensive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty or without prior consent from the United States. The mutual defense assistance agreement between the United States and Germany formed the basis for subsequent agreements, including the 1959 NATO SOFA implementation agreement and the 1954 mutual defense assistance agreement with Japan. Japan and the United States entered into a mutual defense assistance agreement with annexes, referencing the Treaty of Peace signed in 1951. The agreement allows for the furnishing of defense assistance and equipment, subject to relevant acts and provisions. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America and Japan, signed in 1960 and amended in 1990, outlines provisions for mutual defense and cooperation. It allows for the use of facilities and areas in Japan by the United States to contribute to security. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America and Japan, signed in 1960, allows for the use of facilities by the U.S. armed forces in Japan to contribute to security. The Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) addresses the status of U.S. forces in Japan and has been modified multiple times since its inception. In 1948, the U.S. and South Korea entered into an agreement related to the transfer of authority and withdrawal of U.S. forces. The second agreement between the United States and Korea involved interim military and security matters during a transitional period. It was between the President of South Korea and the Commanding General of U.S. Army Forces in Korea. The agreement outlined the training and equipping of Korean security forces by the U.S. until the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The Commanding General retained operational control of Korean security forces until withdrawal, as per a UN resolution. In 1948, Article III of the Agreement granted the Commanding General, U.S. Army Forces in Korea, exclusive jurisdiction over personnel, including dependents, who must abide by Korean laws. Individuals under his jurisdiction apprehended by South Korean law enforcement are to be handed over to the Commanding General. Those not under his jurisdiction but involved in acts harmful to his personnel or property are to be handed over to the South Korean government. In 1950, a mutual defense assistance agreement was signed between the two countries. In 1950, a mutual defense assistance agreement was signed between the United States and South Korea, referencing the Military Defense Act of 1949. This agreement provides for the furnishing of military assistance to support economic recovery essential to international peace and security. Additionally, a mutual security agreement was entered into in 1952, referencing the Mutual Security Act of 1951, which aims to strengthen mutual security through military, economic, and technical assistance. South Korea agrees to promote international understanding and goodwill as part of this agreement. In 1954, the United States and South Korea entered into a mutual defense treaty, agreeing to settle disputes peacefully and consult in case of external threats. The treaty grants the US the right to deploy forces in South Korea. In 1966, a SOFA was established and later amended in 2001. In 1947, the US and the Philippines signed a military assistance agreement for five years. The United States and the Philippines entered into a military assistance agreement in 1947 for five years, providing training and development of armed forces. An advisory group was created to offer advice and assistance. The agreement was extended and amended in 1953, and a mutual defense treaty was signed in 1951 to defend against external armed attacks. In 1952, a mutual security agreement was established between the United States and the Philippines, which included commitments on accounting procedures for resources provided. Subsequent agreements were made in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1998 regarding the treatment of U.S. armed forces visiting the Philippines and Republic of Philippines personnel visiting the United States. The United States and the Philippines have agreements on the treatment of personnel visiting each other's countries. Congress has oversight tools for international agreements, including notification requirements for treaties and executive agreements. The President must submit treaties to the Senate for approval, and Congress must be informed of executive agreements requiring authorization or legislation. The Executive's handling of international agreements, whether requiring congressional authorization or not, has raised concerns about Congress being kept informed. To address this, legislation and regulations have been enacted to ensure Congress is notified of agreements' conclusion or negotiation. The Case-Zablocki Act, enacted in 1972, ensures Congress is informed of international agreements entered by the US. All executive agreements must be transmitted to Congress within 60 days, unless deemed prejudicial to national security. Annual reports on agreements transmitted after the 60-day period are also required. The Case-Zablocki Act, enacted in 1972, requires the Secretary of State to report to Congress on international agreements that have not yet entered into force annually. This includes agreements not published in the United States Treaties and Other International Agreements compilation and those signed or modified in the previous year. The Act was amended in 2004 to include reporting on proposed agreements as well. The Case-Zablocki Act, enacted in 1972, requires the Secretary of State to report to Congress on international agreements annually. The Act does not define what constitutes \"international agreements\" but the State Department has established criteria for determining legally binding agreements. These criteria include the identity of parties, significance of the arrangement, specificity, necessity of agreement by two or more parties, and the form of the arrangement. The State Department's Circular 175 procedure involves notifying Congress of significant international agreements and consulting with congressional leaders and committees. The Bush Administration has committed to keeping lawmakers informed and working closely with them on new treaties or agreements. The State Department's Circular 175 procedure involves notifying Congress of international agreements. Congress has enacted legislation to ensure it remains informed about U.S. security arrangements, requiring the President to submit an annual report on security arrangements with other nations. The report must include legally binding security arrangements and non-binding commitments, such as U.S. policy formulated by the executive branch. It should assess the need to continue, modify, or discontinue these arrangements in light of changing international security situations. It is unclear if subsequent reports have been issued since 1992, despite inquiries made in 2008. The Sunset Act of 1995 terminated most reporting requirements. The Sunset Act of 1995 terminated many reporting requirements, but the reporting requirement in \u00a7 1457 of the FY1991 National Defense Authorization Act was not affected. State Department regulations may allow for congressional oversight on security arrangements with Iraq. Circular 175 procedure aims to ensure consultation with Congress on international agreements. State Department regulations allow for congressional consultation on significant international agreements, such as the prospective U.S.-Iraqi security arrangement. This agreement would involve commitments to provide security assurances, arm and train Iraqi forces, and combat terrorist entities within Iraq. Circular 175 procedures may also apply. Circular 175 procedures allow for congressional consultation on international agreements involving security assurances, armament, training, and combating terrorism in Iraq. The State Department's Legal Adviser for Treaty Affairs determines if an agreement should be a treaty or executive agreement, with potential formal congressional consultation if deemed necessary. Congressional oversight ensures timely identification and resolution of agreement-related issues. The clearest example of congressional oversight in the agreement-making context is through its consideration of treaties and congressional-executive agreements. Treaties require approval by a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which may condition its consent on certain reservations. Congressional-executive agreements need authorization via a statute passed by both Houses of Congress, with potential for conditional approval. In the agreement-making context, Congress can authorize agreements with conditional approval, imposing additional requirements on the Executive. Sole executive agreements do not need congressional approval to be binding, but Congress can limit them through subsequent legislation or appropriations. Congressional oversight extends to non-binding security arrangements as well. Congress may oversee international agreements through legislation implementing their requirements, as some treaties and executive agreements are not self-executing and require implementing legislation for enforcement. This is necessary as U.S. agencies lack authority to ensure compliance without it. The U.S. may need implementing legislation for international agreements to become domestic law, as existing domestic law remains in effect until then. Congress often appropriates funds for fulfilling U.S. obligations under such agreements. The form of the U.S.-Iraqi security agreement and its potential need for implementing legislation are uncertain. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act FY2008, Consolidated Appropriations Act FY2008, and National Defense Authorization Act FY2008 imposed restrictions on establishing permanent military bases in Iraq and prevented U.S. Armed Forces from being subject to Iraqi law. Congress can oversee executive implementation of international agreements and may enact new legislation to modify or reject U.S. adherence to such agreements. Legislation introduced in the 110th Congress aims to ensure congressional participation in agreements between the United States and Iraq, including bills such as H.R. 2642, S. 2426, H.R. 4959, and H.R. 5128. Legislation introduced in the 110th Congress aims to bar funds for certain U.S.-Iraq agreements unless approved by the Senate or Congress. Bills like H.R. 5128, H.R. 4959, and S. 2426 seek to ensure congressional oversight on agreements emerging from the U.S.-Iraq Declaration of Principles. H.R. 5128, H.R. 5626, and H.R. 2642 aim to restrict funds for implementing U.S.-Iraq agreements unless approved by Congress. These bills emphasize congressional oversight on security agreements arising from the Declaration of Principles. Some legislative proposals raise constitutional questions regarding the approval of U.S.-Iraq agreements by Congress. H.R. 4959 and S. 2426 express Congress's views on the form of the agreement, while H.R. 2642 may limit the Executive's negotiation authority. The legislative proposals H.R. 4959, S. 2426, and H.R. 5626 address consultation requirements for U.S.-Iraq agreements, with H.R. 4959 potentially limiting the Executive's negotiation authority. The White House opposes legislation that would determine the legal effect of diplomatic agreements with Iraq before negotiation. It also opposes changing legal traditions on executive agreements and requiring Iraq to support U.S. forces in a Status of Forces Agreement. The President has the discretion for diplomatic negotiations, and Congress cannot establish this by statute. The White House opposes legislation that would limit diplomatic negotiations with Iraq in advance, as it could hinder talks and risk timely completion of agreements. Legislation attempting to restrict a U.S.-Iraq security agreement could face a veto."
