    "content": "During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a push to close unnecessary military bases to balance the budget. Many believed that out of the 3,800 military bases in the US, some could be shut down without harming national security, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, there were debates on which bases to close, how quickly, and what criteria to use. The closure of a base would impact a specific area but bring savings to all taxpayers. During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a push to close unnecessary military bases to save taxpayer funds. A statutory provision enacted in 1977 made base closures difficult, but in 1988, the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act broke the deadlock by introducing new procedures. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 created three subsequent commissions to address concerns about political reasons influencing base closures, despite opposition from some Members of Congress. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 aimed to address concerns about political influence on base closures. The act required evaluations of various consequences before closing or realigning a base to prevent arbitrary closures. Representative Richard K. Armey highlighted how base closures have historically been used as leverage by administrations to influence congressional votes. The 1988 and 1990 statutes aimed to insulate realignment and closure recommendations from political influence by creating bipartisan commissions. The 1990 law established three successive commissions with eight members each, appointed by the President with Senate approval. The President also had the authority to designate each commission's chairman. The 1990 law allowed the President to appoint eight members to bipartisan commissions for base closure recommendations. Consultations were required with key political figures, but the composition did not mandate equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. The process led to the closure of military bases and infrastructure reduction due to the difficulty in stopping closure recommendations once initiated. The 1990 BRAC legislation allowed for the closure of military bases and infrastructure reduction. The process involved multiple reviews and recommendations, with the President having the final decision on whether to approve or disapprove the commission's recommendations. The General Accounting Office also played a role in analyzing DOD's recommendations and selection process. The BRAC process involved the President approving or disapproving the commission's recommendations. If disapproved, the commission would revise and resubmit them. Congress had 45 days to disapprove the recommendations, or they would go into effect. The key elements were: DOD proposes, commission disposes. The BRAC process involved the President approving or disapproving the commission's recommendations. The Secretary of Defense made initial closure or realignment recommendations, which the commission could modify. Both DOD and commission proposals had to align with the force structure plan. The President could request changes to commission recommendations, but no President had challenged them. If a deadlock occurred, the process would end with the President's refusal to forward the closure list to Congress. Congress had 45 days to disapprove the recommendations, or they would take effect without changes permitted. The BRAC law required the closure and realignment recommendations to be implemented if Congress did not disapprove them within 45 days. Selected bases had to close within six years of Congress voting on the recommendations. The commission's proceedings were open to congressional members, and federal departments could detail personnel to the commission. Congress amended the BRAC laws to reduce economic and social disruption. Congress amended the BRAC laws to reduce economic and social disruption in base closure communities, including transferring personal property, below-cost sales of real property, and providing technical assistance. The first base closure commission recommended closing or realigning 145 bases to improve effectiveness and save $693.6 million annually. The Secretary of Defense was required to implement the recommendations by September 30, 1995. The first base closure commission recommended closing or realigning 145 bases to save money and improve effectiveness. Former Senator Thomas Eagleton criticized the lack of cooperation from the Navy in the process. DOD believed base closures were an executive branch function, leading to disagreements with Congress over the closure of military bases. The first base closure commission recommended closing or realigning 145 bases to save money and improve effectiveness. A new commission was created by P.L. 101-510 on November 5, 1990, with eight members appointed by the President. The commission was to meet in 1991, 1993, and 1995, with specific appointments made in consultation with congressional leaders. The base closure commission was reconstituted in 1991, 1993, and 1995. One-third of the personnel could not be from DOD. The new law required the Secretary of Defense to make initial recommendations on base closures. The commission reviewed DOD's recommendations, made its own, and sent them to the President for approval before transmitting to Congress. The base closure commission process was revised in 1991, 1993, and 1995 to further insulate it from political influences and increase transparency to the public. The changes included the requirement for the commission to meet only during non-election years and the involvement of the Comptroller General. Additionally, P.L. 101-510 directed the Secretary of Defense to ensure environmental restoration of closed bases. The 1990 statute directed the Secretary of Defense to ensure environmental restoration of closed bases and provide \"outplacement assistance\" to civilian employees. It also addressed the closure of overseas bases, stating that military operations should be terminated at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense. The 1990 statute directed the Secretary of Defense to ensure environmental restoration of closed bases and provide \"outplacement assistance\" to civilian employees. Congress emphasized the need for fair market value consideration for improvements made by the United States at facilities released to host countries when closing overseas bases. Revenues from the sale of closing bases would be placed in a base closure account to cover expenses related to the relocation of forces. The 1990 statute required the Defense Department to publish proposed criteria for selecting bases to be closed, which were subject to public comments and finalized in February 1991. The criteria included military value, return on investment, and impact as factors for selecting military installations for closure or realignment. The criteria for selecting military installations for closure or realignment included military value, return on investment, and impact. This involved assessing mission requirements, infrastructure availability, cost implications, economic and environmental impacts, and community support. The Secretary of Defense finalized these criteria on April 12, 1991. The Secretary of Defense announced a new list of proposed base closures in April 1991, which was estimated to eliminate approximately 70,000 military and civilian jobs by 1997. Congress generally found the list more acceptable than the previous one, with some objections raised by Senators and Congressmen. Representative Aspin found the list fair, while Representative Moakley noted that Democratic strongholds seemed to be impacted the most. Secretary Cheney claimed ignorance of the political distribution of the bases. The second phase of the base closure process began with statutorily mandated public hearings held by the commission. Many Members of Congress and other witnesses testified about the possible closings, with objections raised about the lack of time and expertise for a complete evaluation. The commission chairman, James Courter, defended the process despite criticisms. The 1991 base closure commission, led by chairman James Courter, issued a final list of 82 proposed closures and realignments on July 1, largely accepting Secretary of Defense Cheney's recommendations but making significant changes for six bases. Ft. Chaffee and Ft. Dix were recommended for realignment, while Fort McClellan, Naval Training Center Orlando, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, and Moody Air Force Base were to remain open. Naval Air Station Whidbey Island (WA) and Moody Air Force Base (GA) remain open. GAO issued a report in May 1991 with detailed comments on DOD's methods for base closures. The report found Army's recommendations well-supported, Air Force rationale adequately documented, but Navy lacked adequate documentation for GAO evaluation. President George Bush approved the report on July 10, 1991. President George Bush approved the independent commission's recommendations for base closures on July 10, 1991. The closures were estimated to cost $4.1 billion from 1992 to 1997 but would save about $1.5 billion annually thereafter. Congress had 45 days to overturn the recommendations but did not take action. Concerns were raised about the impact on communities and the validity of military valuations. Members of Congress debated the issue on the House floor on July 30, 1991. On July 30, 1991, House floor debate focused on recommendations to close the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Naval Station, and Loring Air Force Base. Members sought increased funding for economic support for those affected by closures. The House Armed Services Subcommittee supported the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission's recommendations, despite objections from some Members of Congress regarding lack of coordination and potential inconveniences from medical facility closures. On July 24, 1991, the House Committee on Armed Services endorsed the commission's recommendations. The House rejected a resolution disapproving the recommendations on July 30. The Senate did not need to consider the resolution as both bodies needed to agree to override. The Senate 1992 Defense Authorization bill contained provisions for transferring real property at closing bases to local communities. The Johnston-Breaux amendment proposed changes to existing law regarding the transfer of excess property from closed bases to local governments. The amendment aimed to prioritize local governments for property acquisition and offer it at no cost, but these provisions were removed in conference due to concerns about revenue loss and conflicts with existing laws. The House of Representatives pledged to review matters in 1992 regarding the exclusion of civil works, river and harbor projects, and other activities of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from the base closure program. The impending closure of bases raised environmental concerns under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), prohibiting land transfer until remedial actions are completed. Communities near closing bases seek quick land acquisition, but decontamination processes are necessary for restoration. The decontamination process needed for environmental restoration could cause conflicts between economic development and environmental interests. Federal facilities must comply with state laws, and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act allows states to impose penalties on violators. The base closure program aims to convert bases to nonmilitary use quickly. The base closure program aims to convert bases to nonmilitary use quickly. President Bush appointed nominees for a Base Closure and Realignment Commission in 1993, which recommended closing bases after extensive review and public hearings. The Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommended closing 130 bases and realigning 45 others, resulting in savings of $4 billion between FY1994 and FY1999. The Supreme Court ruled that decisions to close military bases were not subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court reversed a court decision regarding the President's authority to close bases, stating it was not contingent on procedural requirements. Arguments for judicial review were dismissed, and Justice Souter highlighted Congress's familiarity with unsuccessful base closure efforts. Congress adopted procedures in the base closure act to prevent judicial review of base closure decisions. Senator Arlen Specter's amendment for judicial review in cases of fraudulent concealment was rejected due to concerns about opening the door to numerous lawsuits. The Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 (PL 103-421) reduced the scope of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act provision, giving local communities more influence over surplus property disposition. The new law required consideration of homeless needs in the community during the redevelopment planning process. The Department of Housing and Urban Development reviewed base reuse plans. A report by Business Executives for National Security found that many closed military bases had reopened, leading to cost discrepancies between DOD and independent studies. For example, maintenance costs for Carswell AFB were reported differently by BENS and DOD. The BENS report highlighted discrepancies in cost estimates for closed military bases, such as Carswell AFB. DOD argued that savings were achieved by consolidating activities and closing other stations. GAO's report in 1994 revealed a significant reduction in property sales revenue estimates due to property retention by DOD and transfer to other federal agencies and states. The GAO report in 1994 highlighted the shift in emphasis from selling surplus bases for revenue to assisting communities affected by closures. Provisions in the FY1994 DOD authorization act allowed for no-cost transfers of property for economic development, with a major impact from section 2903 allowing transfers at or below fair market value to redevelopment authorities. Section 2904 and 2906 of the base closure program allowed for expedited determination of transferability of excess property and outleasing of property at bases to be closed. The GAO report also addressed issues such as contaminated military land, necessary improvements like sewage and electrical system upgrades, and compliance with standards. It was noted that 50% of federal property would go to the Fish and Wildlife Service, 22% to the Bureau of Land Management, and 24% would remain with the Department of Defense, with smaller acreages going to other agencies. The 104th Congress, under Republican control, had issues with base closure including costs and savings. Secretary of Defense Perry stated that the final round of closings would not be as large as before. Former Senator Alan Dixon of Illinois was confirmed for a role. Former Senator Alan Dixon of Illinois was confirmed as chairman of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. President Clinton announced appointments to the commission, including Al Cornella, Rebecca G. Cox, Retired Air Force Gen. J.B. Davis, S. Lee Kling, and Retired Rear Admiral Benjamin F. Montoya. President Clinton announced nominations to the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, including individuals from various backgrounds such as merchant banking, military, and government. The nominations were confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1995. Additionally, a \"dummy\" list of commissioners was submitted earlier to meet the legal deadline, allowing for further consideration of candidates. The Department of Defense released a report on proposed actions affecting 146 bases on February 28, 1995. The 1995 Base Closure and Realignment Report proposed actions affecting 146 military installations, with 33 major bases listed for closure and 34,200 civilian jobs at risk. Secretary Perry noted that infrastructure reduction lagged behind personnel reduction. The estimated savings from this and previous closure rounds were around $57 billion over 20 years. Additionally, on May 10, the commission added 31 more installations to the list for possible closure or realignment. The commission added 70 bases for further consideration in 1993, with few final recommendations differing from the DOD list. They included Portsmouth shipyard in Maine and Air Force depots in California and Texas. Regional hearings were held before the final vote on June 22. The commission began its final vote on June 22, announcing recommendations for closures and realignments after reviewing 40% of DOD's suggestions. Changes were made to Air Force recommendations, with Rome Laboratory, NY, remaining open while Kelly AFB, TX, and McClellan AFB, CA, faced closure. Navy laboratories were also set to be closed. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission sent its 1995 Report to President Clinton, recommending the closure of 79 bases, realignment of 26 bases, and disestablishments or relocations. Implementing these actions would save $19.3 billion over 20 years but cost an estimated 94 thousand jobs. The biggest closures would be McClellan AFB, CA, Long Beach Naval Shipyard, CA, and Fort McClellan, AL. California senators urged President Clinton to reject the recommendations, while Republican congressmen argued against it to maintain the integrity of the base closure process. President Clinton approved the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission's 1995 report, despite expressing reservations due to the severe economic impact on California and Texas. California had already suffered disproportionately from defense job losses and would lose about half the jobs under the recommendations, even though it only accounted for 15% of the military workforce. The Defense Department had opposed the closure of McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento and Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, citing potential disruptions to Air Force operations. President Clinton defended privatization in the closure of Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Tx., despite opposition from Representative James V. Hansen. The House National Security Committee rejected a resolution to overturn the base closure recommendations, and the House later rejected the resolution as well. The House rejected the resolution of disapproval for the commission's base closure recommendations, including privatizing operations at Kelly AFB and McClellan AFB. President Clinton assured Kelly AFB workers of job retention for five years, with most jobs remaining after eight years. At McClellan AFB, 8,700 out of 11,000 jobs were protected for five years before privatization, with an estimated 4,300 jobs shifting to non-government employers. The Air Force planned to competitively bid work at the depots for privatization in 1996. The two depots recommended for closure by the 1995 BRAC Commission were to be bid competitively for privatization. Critics argued that privatization would maintain overcapacity and undermine projected savings. The BRAC Commission completed its mission by December 31, 1995, requiring new legislation for a new commission. Congress amended the base closing statute to aid communities in transitioning to new economic uses of the land. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 and FY1997 included provisions for base closure, environmental remediation, and transition to new economic uses of land. The RAND Institute studied the impact of base closures on communities in California, finding that while some suffered, the effects were not catastrophic. The RAND Institute studied the impact of base closures on communities in California, finding that the effects were not as severe as forecasted. There is a wide variety among military bases, with differences in settings and impacts on individual workers and communities. Major facility closures may have serious effects on displaced workers, but the local community is often embedded in a larger economy, mitigating the impact. The closure of military bases may have adverse effects on individual workers and firms, but communities may benefit in the long run. Experience shows that more jobs, not less, often follow closures."
