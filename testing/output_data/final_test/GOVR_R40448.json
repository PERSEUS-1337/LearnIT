    "content": "On June 14, 2012, Madagascar's president Andry Rajoelina agreed to meet with former president Marc Ravalomanana to resolve disputes in the country's ongoing political crisis. Their failure to meet has hindered internationally mediated efforts for credible elections. The political environment remains volatile. The political environment in Madagascar remains volatile with regular political disputes and restrictions on journalists. Despite progress in implementing key provisions of the roadmap, the appointment of Prime Minister Jean Omer Beriziky was not universally supported. Prime Minister Jean Omer Beriziky's appointment faced objections from a Ravalomanana spokesman due to his past affiliation with Rajoelina's party. Beriziky has maintained a neutral stance on the differences between Rajoelina and Ravalomanana, earning a reputation as a consensus-oriented leader who could potentially bridge the divide between the two. Some suggest that both Rajoelina and Ravalomanana should not run in the upcoming election, with Beriziky seen as a viable candidate by some Malagasy. In late November, a 35-member national union government cabinet was appointed after disputes over its makeup. The cabinet includes 12 opposition members, but not all opposition parties were satisfied with the appointments. Some opposition members boycotted the initial meeting, alleging that the selection process was not in accordance with the roadmap. In early December, the Congress of Transition and the Superior Council of Transition were both enlarged. The Council of Transition (CST) and the Superior Council of Transition were expanded, with the former increasing from 256 seats to 417 seats and the latter from 90 seats to 189 seats. Incumbents from the transitional legislature retained their positions, while additional seats were allocated based on recommendations from the roadmap signatories. An independent transitional electoral commission (CENI-T) was established on March 12, 2012, with members representing civil society, political parties, and the Rajoelina administration. The CENI-T adopted a provisional electoral timetable with a projected completion date of November 11, 2012. The final scheduling of elections will depend on various electoral procedures, including voter registration and vetting of voter rolls. The current voter registry is inaccurate, missing listings from the southern parts of the island. The CENI-T plans to issue biweekly progress updates and expects to publish a more specific schedule. The lower and upper houses of parliament passed an amnesty law in mid-April 2012, covering political events between 2002 and 2009. The law excludes serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including murder, which means it does not apply to Ravalomanana. The lower and upper houses of parliament passed an amnesty law in mid-April 2012, excluding serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including murder. The law was enacted in response to the murder of pro-Rajoelina protesters in 2009, reflecting the Rajoelina administration's efforts to prevent Ravalomanana from returning to Madagascar. This conflicts with the roadmap allowing all Malagasy citizens in exile for political reasons to return unconditionally. SADC strongly supports Ravalomanana's return as essential for a credible transition process. Returning to Madagascar for an election is crucial for a fair outcome. There is a possibility of a political deal to address the amnesty issue, as Ravalomanana's prosecution is seen as politically motivated. Speculation suggests a potential deal where Ravalomanana would receive amnesty in exchange for not running for president, making Rajoelina the likely winner. The Rajoelina camp has potentially secured a strong legal basis for the upcoming legislative elections, with the transitional government receiving SADC assistance in drafting a law that complies with the roadmap. In response, Mouvance Ravalomanana officials have started boycotting their government duties. Challenges remain with article 11 of the roadmap, which mandates the establishment of certain provisions. Challenges with article 11 of the roadmap include disputes over the establishment of a Special Electoral Court and the authority of CENI-T in deciding election timing. Lack of local reconciliation processes and citizen perspectives have hindered previous agreements and could impact current transitional processes. The success of current transitional processes is defined by the roadmap, with a focus on locally driven reconciliation supported internationally. A law authorizing the Council for Fampihavanana Malagasy (CFM) has been passed to establish a national reconciliation entity. The Malagacho-Malagasy process, a national political dialogue, involves participation from both the Rajoelina and Ravalomanana camps. The SADC Office of Mediation and U.N. technical support are involved in supporting the dialogue and transition process in Madagascar. Madagascar, with a population of 22.6 million, is larger than California and has a diverse population from historical migrations. Malagasy is the official language, along with French, and English usage is increasing. The majority of the population lives in rural areas, relying on farming for a living. The country faces economic losses and natural disasters like cyclones, droughts, and floods. Over two-thirds of the population live in poverty. Madagascar is biologically diverse, with over 85% of its species being endemic, and various ecosystems including tropical forests, coastal plains, river systems, mangroves, marshes, and coral reefs. Madagascar is home to unique flora and fauna, including lemurs. The island faces environmental pressures such as deforestation, desertification, and water pollution. Illegal logging and wildlife exports have increased since 2009. Political unrest has hindered economic growth and donor aid to the government is currently suspended. Following independence from France in 1960, Madagascar experienced political instability under Soviet-leaning socialist regimes. A democratic transition began in 1989, leading to a new constitution and presidential elections in 1992. The new government struggled with extreme poverty, facing strikes, student unrest, and political challenges. Unemployment and food insecurity have increased due to droughts and cyclones, with analysts predicting that social pressures may lead opposing political parties to negotiate a solution. Following the democratic transition in 1989, Madagascar faced political instability, strikes, and student unrest. President Albert Zafy was impeached in July 1996, and former military ruler Didier Ratsiraka won the presidential elections later that year. Ratsiraka attempted to centralize political control and faced opposition due to allegations of corruption. Businessman Marc Ravalomanana emerged as a reformist leader, leading to a contested election in December 2001 against Ratsiraka. Following a contested election in December 2001, a tense stand-off ensued between Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka, with Ravalomanana declaring himself the winner in February 2002. Despite being sworn into office in May, Ratsiraka rejected the election results, leading to armed confrontations and economic disruptions. The United States was the first country to recognize Ravalomanana's presidency in June 2002. In June 2002, the United States recognized the Ravalomanana government, followed by France, China, the United Kingdom, and five African governments. The African Union suspended Madagascar but later readmitted it after Ravalomanana's party won the majority in the National Assembly in December 2002. Ratsiraka fled to France, and Ravalomanana faced economic challenges but received support from Western donors. His administration focused on reducing poverty and improving governance. The Ravalomanana administration focused on reducing poverty, improving governance, and promoting economic growth. Former officials from the Ratsiraka government were tried and sentenced for corruption and political abuses, signaling a commitment to addressing past wrongdoings. Efforts were made towards political reconciliation, including granting amnesties and appointing former Ratsiraka supporters to the cabinet. Ravalomanana's actions broadened his regional support base and demonstrated moderation in dealing with former foes. President Ravalomanana focused on reducing poverty, improving governance, and promoting economic growth during his first term. He was re-elected in December 2006 and received approval for constitutional changes in a 2007 referendum. Despite public dissatisfaction with slow improvements in living standards, elections under his government were generally considered free and fair. The opposition parties' credibility was eroded by dissatisfaction with slow living standards improvements. Low voter turnout in the March 2008 regional elections was attributed to the lack of a credible opposition. President Ravalomanana's popularity did not help his party win the December 2007 mayoral election in Antananarivo, leading to tension with the newly elected Mayor Andry Rajoelina's administration. The government allegedly hindered local government projects in the capital, causing further discord. Rajoelina's supporters claim efforts to undermine the mayor, a successful media entrepreneur known as \"Andry TGV.\" Rajoelina aimed to curb the influence of TIM and Ravalomanana-linked business interests. Madagascar's political crisis began in 2008 when Ravalomanana closed Viva TV, owned by Rajoelina, after airing an interview with former President Ratsiraka. Critics saw this as a move to suppress opposition-friendly media and limit Rajoelina's influence. Rajoelina demanded the reopening of Viva TV for press freedom and democracy. In mid-January 2009, Rajoelina led public anti-government demonstrations in Antananarivo, fueled by dissatisfaction over economic conditions, government corruption, and restrictions on freedom of expression. The protests escalated, with Rajoelina accusing Ravalomanana of dictatorship and calling for strikes that paralyzed the capital. Violence erupted as protesters rioted, looted, and targeted government and private businesses. In mid-January 2009, Rajoelina led anti-government demonstrations in Antananarivo, accusing Ravalomanana of dictatorship. Violence erupted as protesters rioted, looted, and targeted government and private businesses. Reports suggested 70-80 deaths during the unrest, labeled a \"civil disturbance.\" Rajoelina called for Ravalomanana's ouster and declared control of state power, demanding his resignation legally. Ravalomanana removed Rajoelina from his mayoral office on February 3, 2009. On February 3, 2009, Ravalomanana removed Rajoelina from his mayoral office. Rajoelina demanded the president's ouster, leading to violent protests where approximately 30 protesters were shot by the presidential guard. The defense minister resigned in protest, and talks between the two sides broke off. Anti-government protests ensued, resulting in fatalities. In early March, the government unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina. In March, the government tried to arrest Rajoelina, who sought refuge at the French embassy. Madagascar's military, historically neutral, warned of possible intervention after being used to suppress protests. Tensions continued with sporadic demonstrations and reports of security forces using tear gas on protestors. In April and May 2010, there were rumors of possible coups in Madagascar, with the armed forces minister being fired and security forces loyal to Rajoelina suppressing mutinies. Rajoelina's supporters also thwarted a coup attempt in November 2010. Mediation efforts by various international bodies and the Madagascar Council of Christian Churches were made to resolve the political crisis between Ravalomanana and Rajoelina, with the AU condemning events as an attempted coup. AU Commission Chairman Jean Ping warned the Malagasy military against handing power to Rajoelina, citing the constitutional requirement for the president of the Senate to assume office in the event of a presidential vacancy. The AU and SADC suspended Madagascar for unconstitutional government changes, leading to the formation of an International Contact Group on Madagascar (ICG-M) by various international bodies. The International Contact Group on Madagascar (ICG-M) was formed by interested governments to pressure parties to resolve the political crisis. The U.S. State Department and EU officials declared the power transfer a coup d'\u00e9tat. Foreign envoys did not attend Rajoelina's inauguration, and some international donors suspended assistance, including the IMF. The World Bank and African Development Bank continue to provide aid. AU and SADC member states prevented Rajoelina from addressing the UN General Assembly in 2009 and 2010. After assuming office, Rajoelina defied international pressure. In June 2009, a Madagascar court sentenced Ravalomanana to jail and a fine for abuse of office. SADC nominated Joaquim Chissano to mediate talks between Rajoelina and Ravalomanana. An agreement was signed in August for a transitional government to rule for up to 15 months before new elections. Rajoelina named a new government with only 2 critics among the 31 ministers. Rajoelina named a new government with only 2 critics among the 31 ministers. Ravalomanana and opposition parties denounced the cabinet, leading to talks in Maputo. An agreement was reached for a transitional government led by Rajoelina until new elections, with the condition that he would not run for president. Several members of Rajoelina's administration were replaced by consensus candidates. Rajoelina replaced several members of his government with consensus candidates, including Prime Minister Eugene Mangalaza. However, Mangalaza was dismissed in December and replaced by Brigadier General Albert Camille Vital. Despite plans for legislative elections in March 2010, they were postponed under international pressure. Donor pressure continued in 2010, with international mediation efforts faltering. The AU allowed SADC to lead negotiations, as Rajoelina's government sought to legitimize its rule amid increasing domestic pressure. In April 2010, the armed forces' chief of staff and head of the gendarmerie demanded a resolution to the political crisis. The gendarmerie demanded resolution of the political crisis amid reported coup plots. Government sponsored a national conference leading to a new constitution. A new bicameral transitional legislature was appointed in October. SADC resumed mediation efforts in early 2011. In March 2011, a draft roadmap to elections was presented with 8 of the 11 main political parties participating. Rajoelina formed a new government with new political parties holding most ministerial positions. Prime Minister Vital resigned but was reappointed by Rajoelina as part of the transition roadmap. The three former presidents rejected the new government and called for revision of the roadmap. Rajoelina aims to run for the presidency in the next elections, facilitated by a new constitution lowering the age limit for candidates. In September 2011, 10 of 11 major political movements signed onto an SADC-endorsed transitional governance processes roadmap. The September 2011 roadmap signed by major political movements led to substantial progress, but the impasse over Ravalomanana's return and possible amnesty may prolong the political crisis. Madagascar's economy, previously improving under President Ravalomanana, continues to struggle due to donor confidence issues and lack of government legitimacy. Economic recovery is not expected until credible democratic elections are held. Madagascar's economy recovered quickly after Ravalomanana came to power in 2002, with growth spurred by economic liberalization policies. The country reached completion point under the HIPC initiative in 2004, receiving cancellation of almost $2 billion in debt. Ravalomanana sought to diversify bilateral ties and attract foreign investments, including projects by Rio Tinto and Total. Oil companies also began offshore exploration. In late 2008, a major investment proposal by South Korea's Daewoo Logistics sparked controversy in Madagascar. The government offered a 99-year lease of 3.2 million acres for corn and palm oil plantations, which critics argued would displace farmers and raise ethical concerns. Despite economic growth, Madagascar's majority remained poor, with per capita income around $460 per year. Madagascar's per capita income is approximately $460 per year, with low rankings on the U.N. Development Program's Human Development Index. Economic challenges include increased food prices, decreased purchasing power, and chronic food insecurity affecting over half the population. The country's reliance on the tourism industry, which brought in $390 million annually, has been damaged by the 2008-2009 global economic downturn and political uncertainty. Efforts to diversify cash crops with coffee, clove, and pepper plants have been made due to global competition affecting the primary export crop, vanilla. The shellfish industry is also suffering from declining fish stocks. The political uncertainty in Madagascar has significantly damaged the economy, with real GDP growth declining sharply under Andry Rajoelina and the HAT regime. Tourism and textile exports have been severely impacted, leading to a decrease in income and an increase in unemployment, food insecurity, criminality, and corruption. Foreign aid, which previously made up a significant portion of the government's budget, has also been affected. The political crisis in Madagascar has led to a significant decline in foreign aid, impacting the government's budget and public services. The World Bank estimates a loss of $400 million in donor support, affecting infrastructure and productive activities. Despite an increase in aid to social sectors, the effectiveness of the assistance has been hindered by factors like decreased donor coordination and weakened government capacity. The EU has suspended development assistance, exacerbating the country's economic challenges. The EU has extended its suspension of development assistance to Madagascar for another year, worth an estimated $738 million. AU and SADC sanctions include a suspension of trade benefits and a travel ban on members of the HAT. China plays a significant role in the Malagasy economy, particularly in the mining sector, providing over $100 million in budget support. The United States has suspended assistance to the HAT government due to concerns about legitimacy and human trafficking issues. The United States has suspended non-humanitarian assistance to Madagascar due to the unconstitutional assumption of power by the HAT government. This includes military assistance, good governance, basic education, and environmental programs. The State Department has requested $66 million in bilateral aid for Madagascar for FY2013. U.S. assistance in FY2012 and FY2011 was estimated at $67.6 million and $77.6 million respectively, with a majority supporting health programs. The majority of FY2013 assistance for Madagascar focuses on health programs, with a goal to reduce malaria deaths by 50% and increase coverage to 85% among vulnerable groups. Economic growth assistance aims to improve infrastructure and agricultural productivity, despite current aid restrictions. The U.S. government continues to participate in donor working groups on rural development and the environment. The Peace Corps in Madagascar had 120 volunteers in 2012, projected to have 100 in FY2013, focusing on education, environmental conservation, health, and business development. The program was funded at $3.2 million in FY2012 and requested the same for FY2013. Prior to 2009, U.S. bilateral assistance supported democratic governance, economic growth, and environmental protection, totaling almost $48 million in FY2007 to $91 million in FY2010, with a focus on health programs and environmental preservation efforts. The government of Madagascar increased protected land from 1.7 million to 6 million hectares from 2003 to 2008. The United States provided $140 million in humanitarian aid and disaster response from FY1999 to FY2009. Madagascar supported U.S. counterterrorism goals through cooperation but progress stalled after a 2009 government takeover. Madagascar continues to be a source country for forced labor and prostitution. Madagascar is a source country for forced labor and prostitution, with the government's anti-trafficking efforts falling short of minimum standards. In 2009, the House of Representatives condemned a coup and illegal resource extraction. The country signed a $110 million MCC compact in 2005 to assist in transitioning to a market economy and improving property rights for land. Madagascar's MCC assistance focused on property rights, credit access, and agricultural production. Due to a coup in 2009, MCC operations were suspended, and AGOA trade benefits were later suspended, impacting the textile industry and job growth. The AGOA trade benefits for Madagascar, valued at $279 million in 2008, were suspended in 2009, leading to a decline in job growth and foreign investment. Malagasy apparel exports to the United States dropped significantly from $280 million in 2008 to $40 million in 2011. The HAT is working on bilateral trade development and restoring normal trade relations with the help of the U.S. FED Group and a law firm."
