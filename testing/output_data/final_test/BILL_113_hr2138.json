    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ending VA Claims Disability Backlog and Accountability Act\". Congress acknowledges the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' obligation to provide healthcare and disability compensation to injured Armed Forces members. Disability payments aim to alleviate veterans' losses from service-related conditions. A Government Accountability Office report highlighted a significant increase in disability claims backlog at the VA since 2009. In August 2012, 568,043 compensation rating claims are backlogged, with delays in obtaining service and medical records for National Guard and Reserve veterans. If a veteran reports receiving disability benefits from the Social Security Administration, the VA is required to help obtain relevant Federal records for processing the claim. The Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs have an interagency agreement for processing claims, but delays in obtaining information can take up to a year. The Government Accountability Office found that 50% of claims processing staff are inexperienced, requiring supervision. Veterans and their families, who have sacrificed for the nation, face challenges in obtaining benefits. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs pledged to end the backlog of disability claims by 2015 and process all claims within 125 days with 98% accuracy. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs aims to eliminate the backlog of disability claims by 2015, with claims processing accuracy reaching 98% and processing time not exceeding 125 days. Congressional inquiries for progress reports on the backlog remain unanswered. The Department's planning documents do not meet the criteria for sound planning, raising concerns about its ability to reduce claims backlogs. SEC. 3. TIMELINE AND METRICS TO RESOLVE BACKLOG OF DISABILITY CLAIMS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must implement the Strategic Plan to Eliminate the Compensation Claims Backlog by Memorial Day 2015, ensuring disability compensation claims are processed within 125 days with 98% accuracy. Additionally, a supplemental report with specific measures and metrics must be submitted to Congress within 60 days of the enactment of the Act. The Strategic Plan to Eliminate the Compensation Claims Backlog must be implemented by Memorial Day 2015, with a detailed timeline for each initiative included in the plan. SEC. 4. EXPEDITION OF TRANSFER OF CERTAIN RECORDS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must enter agreements with the Social Security Administration and the Department of Defense to transfer medical records within 30 days of a request to evaluate claims. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense must submit a plan to Congress to reduce the time to provide National Guard members with medical records to 30 days and implement the plan within 60 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a training program for newly hired claims processors lasting at least three years, utilizing successful processors for training. The program will not extend the time for processing claims. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit reports to Congress every 90 days on the progress of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in implementing the Strategic Plan to Eliminate the Compensation Claims Backlog. Reports will include analysis of the Secretary's implementation of the plan and recommendations for improvement."
